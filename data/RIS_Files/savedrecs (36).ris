AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to devise a scorecard providing a suite of indicators that give innovation managers a value-oriented, fast but holistic view of open innovation (OI) adoption in their organisations.
   Design/methodology/approach - The theoretical framework is built after a thorough review of OI literature. The managerial tool is developed from the theoretical framework, constructing indicators that can be easily generated by processing data within information systems of companies.
   Findings - The scorecard provides a multi-dimensional conceptualisation of OI adoption in organisations, investigating environment, collaboration and importing/exporting mechanisms. Six indicators are defined: innovation funds, OI employees, collaboration costs, collaboration revenues, importing costs and exporting revenues.
   Research limitations/implications - The devised tool enables the assessment of openness through objective and available data, systematically updated within the information systems of companies and, hence, easily exploitable by innovation managers. In order to meet such conditions, several aspects emerged from the literature review, although relevant, were left out.
   Practical implications - Three dashboards can be derived by exploiting the information available in the scorecard. With the use of such tools innovation managers can both assess the open behaviours of their companies - identifying the trajectories to follow in order to improve performance - and benchmark different OI practices either inside or outside the organisation.
   Originality/value - The scorecard allows innovation managers both to carry out a cost-benefit analysis, evaluating if their organisations are effectively and efficiently generating outputs from OI with the committed resources, and to identify a virtuous circle between the company's commitment and reputation, joint development, and innovation market opportunities.

AB  - The case of flights safety lends itself as a natural case study for choice under of information asymmetry that involves dread risk and emotional factors. Specifically it allows one to experiment how the releasing of information will affect consumer choice. Previous studies, which followed the deregulation of commercial aviation, raised concerns about the corresponding potential for a marked deterioration in airline safety. Measures to prevent that decline were subsequently proposed. Specifically, it was argued that the public sector should establish and release flight safety indicators in addition to accidents' statistics, which are currently available. It was argued that such safety indicators will also enable airlines to diversify their safety offerings. Underlying this argument are the assumptions that consumers' flight safety preferences vary and that, provided with safety information, consumers will use it when making decisions. The present work, however, refutes the first assumption and sheds light on the second. It further investigates whether and how consumers react to and interpret safety information when choosing a flight, while accounting explicitly for a psychological trait. Employing an advanced experimental design and econometric approach, we find that: 1. When formal flight safety ratings are supplied, individuals abandoned their priors and rely on the information provided. 2. When it comes to "bad death" probabilities, people are not sensitive to the different shades of safety, and instead, they simply discern flights as either safe or unsafe. 3. Under a certain conditions disclosed information can alleviated fear and change the decision making of airline passengers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper aims to evaluate and quantify the energy consumption and environmental emissions of a refrigeration compressor produced by a Chinese factory throughout the entire compressor life cycle and try to determine the stage with the strongest environmental impact. The study covers all relevant life cycle stages, from raw material production to compressor use and final disposal. The research is conducted in accordance with ISO 14040/14044 standards.
   Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology is applied in this study, and Chinese Life Cycle Database is used for the assessment. The evaluation results are presented in terms of individual impact category according to the characterization model (CML 2001) and normalization references (Laurent et al. 16:401-409, 2011). The following seven impact categories are considered: global warming potential, acidification potential, eutrophication potential, photochemical ozone formation potential, ozone depletion potential, ecotoxicity, and primary energy demand. All necessary energy and material flows are detailed for assessment purposes.
   LCA results show that the compressor use stage in the life cycle consumes the most energy and exerts the strongest environmental impact, followed by the stages of raw material production and component manufacturing. Meanwhile, primary energy demand, ecotoxicity, and global warming potential are three predominant impact categories along with the entire life cycle of the refrigeration compressor; which account for 36.2150, 34.4567, and 16.5862 % of total impacts, respectively.
   Results show that the compressor use stage may be improved given that environmental impact is largely influenced by electricity requirement. Further investigation must be conducted to improve compressor service efficiency.

AB  - Studies on molecular characterization of soil organic carbon (SOC), although critical to understanding SOC dynamics, are relatively scarce for reclaimed minesoils. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of time since reclamation on SOC molecular properties in a reclaimed minesoil chronosequence using different spectroscopic indices. The chronosequence consisted of four minesoils, with similar soil-forming conditions, reclaimed to pasture ecosystem, and distinguished only by time since reclamation varying from 1 to 22years. Results indicated that the SOC molecules in the older minesoils were comprised of highly humified polyaromatic and polycondensed species with higher proportions of O-containing and N-containing functional groups. In each minesoil, resistant and labile SOC fractions were identified. The resistant SOC fraction constituted >20 and <10 per cent of total SOC (gkg(-1)) in the oldest and youngest minesoil, respectively. Among the spectroscopic indices, the E-285 ultraviolet-visible index, diagnostic of aromatic C, was the most efficient in identifying the intrasite short-term (1-year) changes in SOC molecular properties. Strong positive relationships found between different spectroscopic indices and total SOC (gkg(-1)), with consistently higher r(2) values observed in older minesoils, indicated that SOC molecular characteristics played a key role in overall SOC dynamics, becoming more influential with increasing time since reclamation. In addition, significant relationships between the spectroscopic indices and different soil quality parameters indicated that SOC molecular properties influenced soil quality as well. Overall, the results indicated that SOC molecular properties were useful indicators of both SOC dynamics and soil quality in this minesoil chronosequence. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Wetlands provide many valuable ecosystem services, including water quality improvement to protect downstream aquatic ecosystems such as lakes, rivers, and estuaries. However, their ability to improve water quality to safe levels for direct human exposure while largely surrounded by agricultural lands and hosting large wildlife populations remains unknown. Our aim was to examine the ecosystem service capabilities of an avian-dense coastal wetland surrounded by agricultural lands along the southwestern shore of Lake Erie in Ohio by assessing the quality of water as it flows through the wetland (Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge (ONWR)) and into Lake Erie beach waters. Our study used total phosphorus and fecal indicator (Escherichia coli) concentrations as water quality metrics across the wetland and at an adjacent Lake Erie swimming beach during the 2012 summer swim season. E. coli and total P levels were consistently highest at the site, where water enters the ONWR (mean E. coli = 507 CFU/100 mL; mean total P = 535 mu g/L), and steadily decreased as water flowed through the wetland and into the adjacent beach (mean E. coli = 10 CFU/100 mL; mean total P = 41 mu g/L). E. coli and total P showed statistically significant (alpha = 0.01) correlations with phycocyanin, chlorophyll-a, turbidity, specific conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and pH; total P was also significantly correlated with total N. The results suggest that this wetland may be contributing to improving water quality, which is beneficial for human health as well as to downstream ecosystem health (e.g., limiting eutrophication promoting conditions, etc.).

AB  - Regarded as a keystone species, white-bearded wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) are found across the grassland savannahs of eastern Africa. Over the past 40 years, however, many local populations have become threatened with extinction. This is the first study connecting fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (i.e., stress hormones) in wildebeest with landscape variables of natural and anthropogenic disturbance. Using a validated technique, fecal samples (n = 168) were collected from wildebeest over a 3-month study period and across three different study areas in Kenya with varying degrees of disturbance. The stress of sampled populations was similar between study areas, with a seasonal decline in stress hormones found between dry and wet season data collection periods. We used an information-theoretic approach to rank models of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites. Our highest ranking model included an interaction between locally collected plant biomass and disturbance, the number of calves in a group, and Delta NDVI (change in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). A strong positive effect related to biomass and disturbance suggested that tall/standing biomass and high levels of disturbance contribute to elevated levels of stress in wildebeest. A strong negative effect related to Delta NDVI was also observed, suggestive that new growth lowers average stress levels. Our research suggests that increased levels of habitat disturbance may have an adverse effect on wildebeest populations across the region when habitat conditions deteriorate. Wildebeest likely avoid areas of high anthropogenic disturbance which may indirectly lead to lowered fitness. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of different types of available nutrients of total mix rations on fermentation and synthesis capacities of the rumen in Holstein dairy cows divided into groups in the transition period (+/- 3 weeks after parturition) and early lactation (60-80 days in milk). The diets were fed as a total mixed ration. Results obtained with feeding Diet C (high concentration of available nutrients) to dairy cows confirmed a significant increase in 2,6-diaminopimelic acid from the initial mean 2.2 mu g/ml at 21 days before calving to 6.2 mu g/ml (P < 0.01) at 21 days after calving or 7.6 mu g/ml (P < 0.01) at early lactation, and a parallel significant increase in the concentration of volatile fatty acids (P < 0.01). The concentration of propionic acid increased from the initial mean 25.3 to 39.3 mmol/l (P < 0.01) in the transition period, and to 43.1 mmol/l at early lactation (P < 0.01). All indicators of rumen fermentation and synthesis determined in dairy cows with Diet B (low concentration of available nutrients) of the total mix ration according to productive phases were not significant. High regression coefficients of examined indicators of 2,6-diaminopimelic acid to volatile fatty acid (r = 0.813), propionic acid (r = 0.780) and acetic acid (r = 0.635) indicate direct correlation between fermentation and synthesis activities of the rumen. Our results show that 2,6-diaminopimelic acid appears as a perspective marker for the monitoring and evaluation of the synthesis function of the rumen and production of bacterial biomass under breeding conditions.

AB  - Despite the importance of oolitic depositional systems as indicators of climate and reservoirs of inorganic C, little is known about the microbial functional diversity, structure, composition, and potential metabolic processes leading to precipitation of carbonates. To fill this gap, we assess the metabolic gene carriage and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) development in microbial communities associated with oolitic carbonate sediments from the Bahamas Archipelago. Oolitic sediments ranging from high-energy active' to lower energy non-active' and microbially stabilized' environments were examined as they represent contrasting depositional settings, mostly influenced by tidal flows and wave-generated currents. Functional gene analysis, which employed a microarray-based gene technology, detected a total of 12432 of 95847 distinct gene probes, including a large number of metabolic processes previously linked to mineral precipitation. Among these, gene-encoding enzymes for denitrification, sulfate reduction, ammonification, and oxygenic/anoxygenic photosynthesis were abundant. In addition, a broad diversity of genes was related to organic carbon degradation, and N-2 fixation implying these communities has metabolic plasticity that enables survival under oligotrophic conditions. Differences in functional genes were detected among the environments, with higher diversity associated with non-active and microbially stabilized environments in comparison with the active environment. EPS showed a gradient increase from active to microbially stabilized communities, and when combined with functional gene analysis, which revealed genes encoding EPS-degrading enzymes (chitinases, glucoamylase, amylases), supports a putative role of EPS-mediated microbial calcium carbonate precipitation. We propose that carbonate precipitation in marine oolitic biofilms is spatially and temporally controlled by a complex consortium of microbes with diverse physiologies, including photosynthesizers, heterotrophs, denitrifiers, sulfate reducers, and ammonifiers.

AB  - Pro- and eukaryotic microbes associated with multi-cellular organisms are receiving increasing attention as a driving factor in ecosystems. Endophytes in plants can change host performance by altering nutrient uptake, secondary metabolite production or defense mechanisms. Recent studies detected widespread prevalence of Labyrinthula zosterae in European Zostera marina meadows, a protist that allegedly caused a massive amphi-Atlantic seagrass die-off event in the 1930's, while showing only limited virulence today. As a limiting factor for pathogenicity, we investigated genotypexgenotype interactions of host and pathogen from different regions (10-100 km-scale) through reciprocal infection. Although the endophyte rapidly infected Z. marina, we found little evidence that Z. marina was negatively impacted by L. zosterae. Instead Z. marina showed enhanced leaf growth and kept endophyte abundance low. Moreover, we found almost no interaction of protistxeelgrass-origin on different parameters of L. zosterae virulence/Z. marina performance, and also no increase in mortality after experimental infection. In a target gene approach, we identified a significant down-regulation in the expression of 6/11 genes from the defense cascade of Z. marina after real-time quantitative PCR, revealing strong immune modulation of the host's defense by a potential parasite for the first time in a marine plant. Nevertheless, one gene involved in phenol synthesis was strongly up-regulated, indicating that Z. marina plants were probably able to control the level of infection. There was no change in expression in a general stress indicator gene (HSP70). Mean L. zosterae abundances decreased below 10% after 16 days of experimental runtime. We conclude the under non-stress conditions L. zosterae infection in the study region is not associated with substantial virulence.

AB  - Laccase enzyme (EC 1.10.3.2) is a benzenediol, a multi-copper enzyme, and one of the three main ligninases that differs from the others in its ability to catalyze the oxidation of lignin components. It is widely distributed in fungi and because of its importance in bioremediation; the search for fungal laccases with different properties and potential applications is still on-going. In view of its importance in large scale application, the present endeavor is to search for highly efficient laccase producing fungi from different environmental habitats in Egypt. Cultural conditions such as temperatures, pH, carbon sources and nitrogen sources were optimized for the production of high extracellular laccase activity. By screening sources under investigation namely: soil, wood, seaweeds, sponge, ascidia, drifted decaying wood, plants and miscellaneous materials it was possible to encounter as many as 60 species belonging to 33 genera. Zygomycota represented by six species (10.16% of the total species number), teleomorphic Ascomycota (9 species, 15.25%), anamorphic Ascomycota (44 species, 74.57%) and Basidiomycota (1 species, 1.69%). Soil showed the highest Simpson's species diversity index of 0.83 while contaminated wax samples and Adiantum capillus-veneris showed the lowest value (0). All isolated taxa were tested for laccase production using a qualitative plate assay method by using guaiacol as color indicator. Sixteen isolates showed positive reaction indicating a lignin-degrading potentiality and out of them eight measured the highest zone diameter with high oxidation scale. The most promising taxa were endophytic namely: Chaetomium globosum, Phoma exigua, Thanatephorus cucumeris and Sordaria fimicola. pH 7, incubation temperature 30 degrees C, 1% maltose and 0.3% peptone supported the highest biomass and laccase production for Chaetomium globosum.

AB  - As a result of Hungary's membership in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), surface nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) balances on a country level are calculated and reported to the OECD annually. The Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry (RISSAC) of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences is responsible for the calculations. Surface nutrient NP balances of each of the seven Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) 2 regions of Hungary were calculated for the period of 1989 (the starting year of political and economic transitions in the country) to 2005. For the environmental risk assessment of NP balances, it is also essential to take the soil NP status of the investigated area into consideration. Correlations between NP balances and soil NP status should be investigated on EU, country, or regional levels. The relevant agricultural databases of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary (CSOH) were used to ensure the accurate estimations of coefficients. Significant differences were found among the regions both in the input and output sides of the NP balances and, as a consequence, in the regional NP balances. Utilization of the agricultural area also differs among the regions, as a consequence of their geographical location, terrain features, soil and climate conditions, and different traditions. In general, the annual N balances of the studied period in the Hungarian regions were positive, whereas P balances were negative. Surface gross nutrient NP balances of each of the seven Hungarian regions decreased in the studied period, but characteristic differences between Hungarian regions still remained.

AB  - Objectives: Somatic symptom ratings covary with neuroticism. Yet, people vary from one another in their ability to report their own emotions and differentiate them from bodily sensations. We hypothesized that stressed individuals with greater emotional awareness would experience somatic symptoms in a more differentiated way independent of neuroticism. Methods: Over 3 days, ecological momentary assessments were completed in 161 patients (72.6% female; mean age, 35 years) with Long QT Syndrome, a genetic disorder associated with increased risk for sudden cardiac death. Patients were paged randomly ten times per day to report their momentary experience of nine somatic symptoms (e. g., headache, sore throat, tiredness) as well as other variables. We examined the intercorrelation between somatic symptom ratings, reasoning that greater intercorrelation among ratings indicated less differentiation. Subjects completed measures of neuroticism, depression, and the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale, a trait measure of the tendency to experience emotions in a complex and differentiated way. Results: Higher Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale-Self scores were associated with greater differentiation in the momentary rating of somatic symptoms (p<.001) in men and women independently. This association did not change after removing variance due to neuroticism, depression, or symptom intensity. Conclusions: Among individuals stressed by having a life-threatening condition, those who are more emotionally aware report somatic symptoms in a more differentiated way. These findings regarding symptoms largely unrelated to the disorder are consistent with other evidence that medically unexplained physical symptoms, which tend to be nonspecific, may be accompanied by relatively undifferentiated negative affect.

AB  - It is a well known fact that attention is crucial for driving a car This innovative study aims to assess the impact of attentional workload modulation on cerebral activity during a simulated driving task using magnetoencephalography (MEG) A car simulator equipped with a steering wheel, turn indicators, an accelerator and a brake pedal has been specifically designed to be used with MEG Attentional demand has been modulated using a radio broadcast During half of the driving scenarios, subjects could ignore the broadcast (simple task ST) and during the other half, they had to actively listen to it in order to answer 3 questions (dual task DT) Evoked magnetic responses were computed in both conditions separately for two visual stimuli of interest traffic lights (from green to amber) and direction signs (arrows to the right or to the left) shown on boards The cortical sources of these activities have been estimated using a minimum norm current estimates modeling technique Results show the activation of a large distributed network similar in ST and DT and similar for both the traffic lights and the direction signs This network mainly involves sensory visual areas as well as parietal and frontal regions known to play a role in selective attention and motor areas The increase of attentional demand affects the neuronal processing of relevant visual information for driving as early as the perceptual stage By demonstrating the feasibility of recording MEG activity during an interactive simulated driving task this study opens new possibilities for investigating issues regarding drivers activity (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reserved

AB  - Chloride (Cl) participates in a variety of physiological functions To study processes connected with Cl homeostasis we need effective and quantitative probes allowing measurements of intracellular Cl concentration ([Cl-]) in different cell types, particularly in specialized small cellular compartments such as dendrites and dendritic spines Of the different tools proposed for monitoring [Cl-](i), the genetically encoded Cl-sensitive indicators are the most promising Recently, a ratiometric CFP-YFP based construct, termed "Cl-Sensor", with a relatively high sensitivity to Cl has been proposed (Markova et al, 2008). In the present study, we have developed conditions for the efficient expression of Cl-Sensor in tiny neuronal compartments including distal dendrites and spines We also propose a new approach for the calibration of intracellularly expressed probes using a natural triterpenoid saponin, beta-escin We have mapped [Cl-](i) distribution in different neuronal compartments of cultured hippocampal and spinal cord neurons. The maximum Cl concentration was observed in the soma and It had a tendency to decrease gradually along dendritic branches, reaching minimum values in thin distal dendrites. We have also monitored transient increases in intracellular Cl in dendritic spines caused by glutamate application These results demonstrate that Cl-Sensor enables non-invasive monitoring of the [Cl-], distribution in different types of neurons with variable morphology This probe represents an effective tool for the quantitative estimation of [Cl-](i) in various cellular compartments including dendritic spines.

AB  - Altered levels of aminothiols in biological fluids are thought to be an important risk indicator for several diseases, and reliable methods for the accurate determination of aminothiols concentrations in plasma are thus required. In this paper ammonium 5-bromo-7-fluorobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-sulphonate (SBD-BF) is proposed as a convenient fluorogenic derivatizating reagent for the determination of aminothiols (cysteine, cysteinylglycine, homocysteine and glutathione) by HPLC with fluorescence detection. The reactions of SBD-BF with aminothiols at room temperature are about three-times faster than those of ammonium 7-fluorobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-4-sulphonate (the most frequently employed reagent) at 60 C. The derivatives of SBD-BF with cysteine, cysteinylglycine, homocysteine and glutathione are easily separated by HPLC and their calibration curves show excellent linearity over the range 0.05-20 mu mol/L with excellent r(2) values for all analytes. SBD-BF reacts with thiols under mild conditions, i.e. at 25 degrees C over about 30 min, and is proposed as a suitable fluorogenic reagent for thiol derivatization to be introduced in analytical clinical chemistry. The detection limits of Cys, Cys-Gly, Hcy and GSH at a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 were 0.1 mu M for Cys, 0.01 mu M for Cys-Gly and Hcy, and 0.02 mu M for GSH. Furthermore, validation parameters of the proposed method are quite satisfactory. As an application of this method the determination of thiol derivatives in human plasma was carried out on a number of samples. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Small-holder farmers often develop adaptable agroforestry management techniques to improve and diversify crop production. In the cocoa growing region of Ghana, local knowledge on such farm management holds a noteworthy role in the overall farm development. The documentation and analysis of such knowledge use in cocoa agroforests may afford an applicable framework to determine mechanisms driving farmer preference and indicators in farm management. This study employed 12 in-depth farmer interviews regarding variables in farm management as a unit of analysis and utilized cognitive mapping as a qualitative method of analysis. Our objectives were (1) to illustrate and describe agroforestry management variables and associated farm practices, (2) to determine the scope of decision making of individual farmers, and (3) to investigate the suitability of cognitive mapping as a tool for assessing local knowledge use. Results from the cognitive maps revealed an average of 16 +/- A 3 variables and 19 +/- A 3 links between management variables in the farmer cognitive maps. Farmer use of advantageous ecological processes was highly central to farm management (48% of all variables), particularly manipulation of organic matter, shade and food crop establishment, and maintenance of a tree stratum as the most common, highly linked variables. Over 85% of variables included bidirectional arrows, interpreted as farm management practices dominated by controllable factors, insofar as farmers indicated an ability to alter most farm characteristics. Local knowledge use on cocoa production revealed detailed indicators for site evaluation, thus affecting farm preparation and management. Our findings suggest that amid multisourced information under conditions of uncertainty, strategies for adaptable agroforestry management should integrate existing and localized management frameworks and that cognitive mapping provides a tool-based approach to advance such a management support system.

AB  - This paper presents an experimental qualitative assessment of the stability of a turbulent, non-premixed methane flame. The burner consists of a central fuel nozzle surrounded by an annulus of co-airflow with varying swirl strength. Two distinct nozzle geometries having similar exit cross-sectional areas but different internallorifice geometry-a rectangular and a contracted circular nozzle-were tested. They are referred to in this paper as RN and CCN, respectively. The main focus of the present study was on determining the flame liftoff and blowout velocities as well as the liftoff height and flame length, all of which can be used as indicators of the stability of non-premixed methane flame. The experimental data revealed that the blowout velocity of the RN nozzle's flame is remarkably higher than that of the CCN nozzle, and the liftoff velocity of the CCN is only slightly higher than that of the RN nozzle for identical swirl strength. In addition, the flame length of the RN nozzle is overall shorter than that of the CCN nozzle for identical test conditions, and the liftoff height of the CCN flame is higher than that of the RN flame. LDV velocity measurements were performed to determine the reacting flow overall dynamic along the centerline plane for typical jet and co-flow exit velocities. These results aimed at helping to explain the difference in flame stability between the two different nozzles' geometries in conjunction with the co-flow swirl strength.

AB  - During the past 40 years colluvial and alluvial deposits have been used in Brazil as good indicators of regional landscape sensitivity to Quaternary environmental changes. In spite of the low resolution of most of the continental sedimentary record, geomorphology and sedimentology may favor palaeoenvironmental interpretation when supported by independent proxy data. This paper presents results obtained from pedostratigraphic sequences, in near-valley head sites of southern Brazilian highlands, based on geomorphologic. sedimentologic, micromorphologic, isotopic and palynologic data. Results point to environmental changes, with ages that coincide with Marine Isotopic Stages (MIS) 5b; 3; 2 and 1. During the late Pleistocene, although under temperatures and precipitation lower than today, the local record points to relatively wet local environments, where shallow soil-water saturated zones contributed to erosion and sedimentation during periods of climatic change, as during the transition between MIS 2 and MIS 1. Late Pleistocene events with ages that coincide with the Northern Hemisphere Younger Dryas are also depicted. During the mid Holocene, slope-wash deposits suggest a climate drier than today, probably under the influence of seasonally contrasted precipitation regimes. The predominance of overland flow-related sedimentary deposits suggests an excess of precipitation over evaporation that influenced local palaeohydrology. This environmental condition seems to be recurrent and explains how slope morphology had influenced pedogenesis and sedimentation in the study area. Due to relative sensitiveness, resilience and short source-to-sink sedimentary pathways, near-valley head sites deserve further attention in Quaternary studies in the humid tropics.

AB  - Restoration treatments have been widely advocated to address declining conditions in Pinus ponderosa forests throughout the western United States. However, few studies have examined treatment effects on individual plant species or whether responses differ for common species and uncommon species (those with low abundance in the community)-information that may be critical in managing for long-term biodiversity. We investigated understory species responses to restoration treatments in ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir forests using a randomized block experimental design with three blocks and four treatments (control, burn-only, thin-only, and thin-burn). Understory vegetation was sampled before treatment and for three consecutive years after treatment. We used richness and an index of uniqueness to compare responses of common and uncommon native understory species among treatments, and indicator species analysis to identify individual species that responded to each treatment. Treatments that included thinning had significantly more unique species assemblages than the control. The thin-only treatment increased common native species richness, whereas all active treatments significantly increased uncommon native species richness over the control, especially the thin-burn. Generally, life-forms did not explain the responses of individual species, though in the final sampling year several graminoids were exclusively indicative of treatments that included thinning. Very few species had reduced abundance in the thinning and burning treatments by the final sample year, whereas many uncommon and short-lived species benefited from active treatments, especially the combined thin-burn treatment. Active restoration treatments in these forests may foster plant diversity by minimally impacting common species while significantly benefiting disturbance-dependent native species.

AB  - Carotenoid- and melanin-based colors are valuable indicators of quality in many vertebrates, but their signaling role in invertebrates remains relatively unexplored. The Asian ladybird beetle Harmonia axyridis is an ideal organism for studies of this nature because males and females exhibit highly variable red and black colors on their elytra and are chemically defended with an alkaloid (harmonine). We used digital photography to quantify elytra coloration and absorbance spectrophotometry and gas chromatography mass spectrometry analyses to quantify pigment and alkaloid concentrations, respectively, in wild-caught male and female H. axyridis. We predicted that extensive or intense coloration would be an aposematic signal of high-alkaloid stores. We found that carotenoid pigments largely controlled variation in red elytra coloration. There was no relationship between alkaloid content and either elytra redness or carotenoid pigment concentration in either sex. However, we found a positive correlation between the extent of elytra coloration and alkaloid content. Animals with proportionally more red (or less black) on the elytra were more alkaloid-rich; this relationship was particularly strong in females. We also found that females with lighter black spots had greater amounts of harmonine than those with darker spots. These results suggest that elytra color patterns have the potential to reveal information about chemical defensiveness to mates or predators. Prior studies in this species show that nonmelanic forms are typically less active and yet more sexually attractive than melanic forms, and both results may be explained by the fact that nonmelanics are better chemically defended.

AB  - Within the scope of a biomonitoring study conducted in twelve urban agglomerations in eight European countries, the ozone-sensitive bioindicator plant Nicotiana tabacum cv. Bel-W3 was employed in order to assess the occurrence of phytotoxic ozone effects at urban, suburban, rural and traffic-exposed sites. The tobacco plants were exposed to ambient air for biweekly periods at up to 100 biomonitoring sites from 2000 to 2002. Special emphasis was placed upon methodological standardisation of plant cultivation, field exposure and injury assessment. Ozone-induced leaf injury showed a clearly increasing gradient from northern and northwestern Europe to central and southern European locations. The strongest ozone impact occurred at the exposure sites in Lyon and Barcelona, while in Edinburgh, Sheffield, Copenhagen and Dusseldorf only weak to moderate ozone effects were registered. Between-site differences within local networks were relatively small, but seasonal and inter-annual differences were strong due to the variability of meteorological conditions and related ozone concentrations.
   The 2001 data revealed a significant relationship between foliar injury degree and various descriptors of ozone pollution such as mean value, AOT20 and AOT40. Examining individual sites of the local monitoring networks separately, however, yielded noticeable differences. Some sites showed no association between ozone pollution and ozone-induced effects, whereas others featured almost linear relationships. This is because the actual ozone flux into the leaf, which is modified by various environmental factors, rather than ambient ozone concentration determines the effects on plants. The advantage of sensitive bioindicators like tobacco Bel-W3 is that the impact of the effectively absorbed ozone dose can directly be measured. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Studies were conducted to determine the timing and frequency of disease assessment required to effectively identify levels of resistance to yam anthracnose using tissue culture-derived whole plant inoculation assay. The effects of inoculation methods (paint brush and spray), and disease scoring methods [individual leaf area (ILA) and whole plant area (WPA)] were also assessed. Spray inoculation resulted in rapid infection and higher variations among yam genotypes, leading to earlier discrimination of genotypes than with the paintbrush method. Both the ILA and WPA scoring methods showed variation among yam genotypes, and association between the two methods gave a high positive correlation (r > 0.90). However, the WPA was faster and had the advantage of detecting differences in reactions of yam genotypes to less aggressive pathogen isolates to which the ILA method showed no variation. A single disease evaluation at 7 days after inoculation was as good as the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) and the disease progress rate (R-d) derived from multiple evaluations. However, a significant time-genotype interaction, suggests a need for more than a single assessment for effective comparison of genotypes. AUDPC derived from two assessments (5 and 7 DAI) was better than AUDPC from three assessments (5, 7 and 9 DAI) in separating genotypes reactions to a less aggressive pathogen isolate. This study showed that the use of spray inoculation method, the WPA scoring method, and AUDPC derived from two assessments (5 and 7 DAI) provided best conditions for evaluating yam genotypes for levels of anthracnose resistance with the tissue culture-derived whole plant assay.

AB  - European sea bass were reared in three different systems: one flow-through (FTS), one recirculating (RAS), and one recirculating with a high-rate algae pond (RAS + HRAP). After 1 year of rearing, the final fish weight was 15% lower in the RAS compared to the FTS. The accumulation of a growth-inhibiting substance in the RAS is the main hypothesis explaining this difference. As in environmental risk assessment, fish bioaccumulation markers and biomarkers were used to demonstrate exposure to and effects of the rearing water in the three rearing systems. Thirty fish per system were sacrificed before their condition factor (CF) and liver somatic index (LSI) were calculated. Nine biomarkers, including ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), were measured in liver and twelve metals including As, Cd, Cu, Pb, Cr, and Zn, for which there are regulations regarding human consumption, were measured in liver and muscle. In all systems, CF and LSI were not significantly different and no correlation was found with biomarker activity or metal concentration. EROD and SOD activities were significantly increased in RAS. Accumulation of seven and four metals in muscle and liver, respectively, was significantly higher in the RAS relative to FTS. The HRAP prevented metal accumulation except for chromium and arsenic. Eight metal concentrations were significantly higher in liver than in muscle. Concentrations of toxic metals were similar to reported values and below FAO/WHO recommended values for human consumption. (c) 2004 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Coastal zone managers need to factor submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) in their integration. SGD provides a pathway for the transfer of freshwater, and its dissolved chemical burden, from the land to the coastal ocean. SGD reduces salinities and provides nutrients to specialized coastal habitats. It also can be a pollutant source, often undetected, causing eutrophication and triggering nuisance algal blooms. Despite its importance, SGD remains somewhat of a mystery in most places because it is usually unseen and difficult to measure. SGD has been directly measured at only about a hundred sites worldwide. A typology generated by the Land - Ocean Interaction in the Coastal Zone (LOICZ) Project is one of the few tools globally available to coastal resource managers for identifying areas in their jurisdiction where SGD may be a confounding process. ( LOICZ is a core project of the International Geosphere/Biosphere Programme.) Of the hundreds of globally distributed parameters in the LOICZ typology, a SGD subset of potentially relevant parameters may be culled. A quantitative combination of the relevant hydrological parameters can serve as a proxy for the SGD conditions not directly measured. Web-LOICZ View, geospatial software then provides an automated approach to clustering these data into groups of locations that have similar characteristics. It permits selection of variables, of the number of clusters desired, and of the clustering criteria, and provides means of testing predictive results against independent variables. Information on the occurrence of a variety of SGD indicators can then be incorporated into regional clustering analysis. With such tools, coastal managers can focus attention on the most likely sites of SGD in their jurisdiction and design the necessary measurement and modeling programs needed for integrated management.

TI  - How could conscious experiences affect brains?
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSCIOUSNESS STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - In everyday life we take it for granted that we have conscious con trol of some of our actions and that the part Of us that exercises control is the conscious mind. Psychosomatic medicine also assumes that the conscious mind can affect body states, and this is supported by evidence that the use of imagery, hypnosis, biofeedback and other 'mental interventions' can be therapeutic in a variety of medical conditions. However, there is no accepted theory of mind/body interaction and this has had a detrimental effect on the acceptance of mental causation in science, philosophy and in many areas of clinical practice. Biomedical accounts typically translate the effects of mind into the effects of brain functioning, for example, explaining mind/body interactions in terms of the interconnections and reciprocal control of cortical, neuroendocrine, autonomic and immune systems. While such accounts are instructive, they are implicitly reductionist, and beg the question of how conscious experiences could have bodily effects. On the other hand, non-reductionist accounts have to cope with three problems: (1) The physical world appears causally closed, which would seem to leave no room for conscious intervention. (2) One is not conscious of one own brain/body processing, so how could there be conscious control of such processing? (3) Conscious experiences appear to conic too late to causally affect the processes to which they most obviously relate. This paper suggests a way of understanding mental causation that resolves these problems. It also suggests that 'conscious mental control' needs to be partly understood in terms of the voluntary operations of the preconscious mind, and that this allows an account of biological determinism that is compatible with experienced free will.

AB  - Background: Modulation of the acoustic startle response is a simple and objective indicator of emotionality and attention in rodents and humans. This finding has proven extremely valuable for analysis of neural systems associated with fear and anxiety. Until recently, there have been few efforts to develop acoustic startle measurement in nonhuman primates. We report here development of a whole-body acoustic startle protocol in rhesus monkeys.
   Methods: Eight juvenile rhesus monkeys were tested in a new whole-body (somatic) acoustic startle protocol. Startle responses were assessed in three paradigms: 1) stimulus intensity-response amplitude, 2) prepulse inhibition (PPI), and 3) fear-potentiated startle.
   Results: Initial studies revealed that the amplitude of whole-body, startle in monkeys, as in rodents and humans, is directly proportional to acoustic stimulus intensity and gradually habituates with repeated exposures. Presentation of a weak acoustic stimulus 45-2020 msec before a startle stimulus reduces startle amplitude by 40%-50%, depending on interstimulus interval length (PPI). We have also measured significant potentiated startle amplitude in the presence of a visual stimulus after pairing it with an inescapable pulse of pressurized air (fear-potentiated startle).
   Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that acoustic startle in nonhuman primates successfully bridges rodent and human research in two broad areas: stimulus-response relationships and behavioral plasticity represented by habituation, PPI, and fear potentiation. The opportunity now emerges to link concepts developed in rodents to the more complex neuroanatomical and cognitive processes common to monkeys and humans.

AB  - A facies analysis involving investigations of trace and major elements as well as studies of heavy and clay minerals was focused on Late Triassic to Early Jurassic series which were formed in a transitional environment of deposition between land and sea (North Bavarian Tableland). During Rhaetian and early Jurassic times a striking change in the paleogeography took place (playa, terrigenous linear shoreline, deltaic, nearshore brackish and fully marine epicontinental depositional systems). Elements such as U, Th, Pb, Cu and REE form a reliable tool for facies discrimination. Zinc increases basinward and may be used as a proximity indicator as it is the case with the Fe/Sc and Mn/Fe ratios, which are a direct response to the redox conditions in the basin. From sea towards land the Fe/Sc ratio increases and its graph becomes more oscillating. The Mn/Fe ratios display a reverse trend, with fluctuating curves in the basin centre and an almost straight line in the downhole plots near the basin edge, reflecting a conspicuous decrease in calcareous interbeds. The Jurassic transgression provoked a decreasing-upward trend in the graph of the Cr/Ni ratio, which mirrors variation in provenance and continental run-off. Ratios involving Si, Zr and Hf and R-EEtot are reliable tools as proximity indicators as they are correlative to bed load deposition of rock forming minerals such as quartz and phyllosilicates as well as heavy minerals. Of these elements Zr offers a valuable tool to constrain reworking and beach placer deposits within the sedimentary record.

AB  - Life history theory predicts that ectotherms living in warm thermal environments should mature early because of fast juvenile growth, but it is unclear whether such early maturity will occur in the absence of conditions that promote fast juvenile growth. To assess this possibility and to determine the effect of warm thermal regimes on body size at maturity, we compared the growth and life history patterns of three populations of pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) introduced into warm, Mediterranean waterbodies in southern France with native populations living in cool thermal regimes in Ontario, Canada. Growth and life history traits of the French populations were determined from monthly samples collected from May to September. Mean age at maturity in the French populations ranged from 1.3-2.3 years, and was significantly earlier than that of populations inhabiting Ontario lakes. Length at age 2, an indicator of the juvenile growth rate, was not significantly different between the French and Ontario populations, and the French populations matured significantly earlier than Ontario lake populations even when juvenile growth was taken into account. Length at maturity in the French populations was also significantly smaller. and although there was no significant difference between the French and Ontario populations in mean GSI, the results of a previous reproductive allocation experiment suggest that French populations have a longer breeding season, and greater reproductive effort than Ontario pumpkinseeds. The earlier maturity of French pumpkinseeds could be a direct physiological effect of the warm thermal environment, but factors other than thermal regime may be contributing to the difference in life history traits between the French and Ontario populations.

AB  - The status signaling hypothesis (SSH) was devised primarily to explain the adaptive significance of avian ornamental coloration during the nonbreeding season. It proposes that conspicuous male plumage serves as an honest signal of social status within a population of birds. However, to date this hypothesis has been well tested and supported for only one type of plumage coloration, melanin-based coloration. Carotenoid-based pigmentation is known to positively reveal male health and condition during molt in a variety of species, but it is poorly understood whether this ornament type can also function as a status signal during the winter. We tested the SSH in male house finches (Carpodacus mexicanus) by manipulating the carotenoid-based plumage brightness of first-year males and then pairing unfamiliar birds of differing coloration in a series of dominance trials in captivity. Manipulated plumage color was unrelated to win/loss outcome in these trials, similarly, the natural pigmentation of males was a poor predictor of winter dominance; as in other studies with this species, we found only a weak tendency for naturally drab males to dominate naturally bright males. These results suggest that carotenoid-based coloration is not a reliable indicator of social status in male house finches during the nonbreeding season. In fact, carotenoid-based coloration may function only in mate choice in this species, and it may be retained throughout the year either because time constraints preclude a second plumage molt or because it aids in pair formation that begins in late winter.

AB  - Glutathione and ascorbate are essential components of the general antioxidative strategy to overcome oxidative stress due to environmental constraints such as pollution. The variation of glutathione and ascorbate contents in duckweed (Lemna minor) was investigated after a 48 h exposure to copper, diuron and folpet under laboratory conditions in order to determine whether changes in their level could serve as suitable and early biomarkers of pollution. One could observe that diuron and folpet caused the glutathione level to increase, its redox status remaining unchanged, while copper led to a depletion of this antioxidant and to an increase in its oxidation rate. When duckweed was contaminated by folpet and the metal, an increase of the ascorbate pool size occurred from concentrations as low as 1 mg l(-1) and 50 mu g l(-1) respectively. While the ascorbate pool became more oxidized because of exposure to copper concentrations less than or equal to 200 mu g l(-1), folpet caused an increase in its reduction rate. Diuron was responsible for depletion of ascorbate, the redox status of which remained unchanged. Because it is an adaptation to stress and a defence process, the increase in the antioxidant pool size was proposed as a biomarker of exposure to an unsafe environment. Since depletion of antioxidant and an increase in its oxidation rate weakened cellular defences and indicated a precarious state, they could constitute early indicators of toxicity. So they were proposed as potential biomarkers of toxicity. It was concluded that the antioxidant content in duckweed might serve as a useful biomarker for monitoring water quality.

AB  - In this study we report on accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) wiggle-match dating of selected macrofossils from organic deposits ca. 800 cal BC (ca. 2650 sp). Eased on paleological, archaeological and geological evidence, we found that the sharp rise of atmospheric C-14 between 850 and 760 cal Be corresponds to the following related phenomena:
   1. In European raised bog deposits, the changing spectrum of peat forming mosses and a sharp decline in decomposition of the peat indicate a sudden change from relatively dry and warm to cool, moist climatic conditions.
   2. As a consequence of climate change, there was a fast and considerable rise of the groundwater table so that pest growth started in areas that were already marginal from a hydrological point of view.
   3. The rise of the groundwater table in low-lying areas of the Netherlands resulted in the abandonment of settlement sites.
   4. The contemporaneous earliest human colonization of newly emerged salt marshes in the northern Netherlands (after loss of cultivated land) may have been related to thermal contraction of ocean water, causing a temporary stagnation in the relative sea-level rise.
   Furthermore, there is evidence for synchronous climatic change in Europe and on other continents (climatic teleconnections on both hemispheres) ca. 2650 BP. We discuss reduced solar activity and the related increase of cosmic rays as a cause for the observed climatological phenomena and the contemporaneous rise in the C-14-content of the atmosphere. Cosmic rays may have been a factor in the formation of clouds and precipitation, and in that way changes in solar wind were amplified and the effects induced abrupt climate change.

AB  - The ultrastructure of symbiotic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium sp., zooxanthellae) in the sea anemone Aiptasia pallida Verrill was examined in well-fed or starved (up to 120 days) anemones maintained under two light levels (5 and 50 mu mol . m(-2). s(-1)). Cell size of zooxanthellae was not affected by feeding history; however, both light and feeding history affected the relative cell volume of chloroplasts, lipids, and vacuoles. Stereological analysis of transmission electron micrographs showed that algae in low-light starved anemones had 10 times as much lipid (17.4% of cell volume) as those in well-fed anemones under the same light conditions (1.8%). The lipid content of algae from anemones in high light increased from 15.4% in well-fed anemones to 30.1% in starved anemones. The starch content of zooxanthellae in low-light anemones was low (4.1%) and not affected by feeding history, while the starch content of zooxanthellae in high-light anemones was greater (10.7%), with some differences among groups. Algal photoacclimation to low light included an increase in chloroplast relative volume from 17% (in well-fed high-light anemones) to 33% in well-fed low-light anemones. Starvation of the host resulted in a significant decrease in chloroplast volume in zooxanthellae in anemones at both light levels. Morphometry provides quantitative confirmation of biochemical and physiological data on zooxanthellae, because the changes in zooxanthellae with starvation of the host are consistent with other indicators of nutrient limitation of zooxanthellae of A. pallida held without food for long periods of time.

AB  - This study examined the causal dynamics between circular economy (CE) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in European Union (EU) countries. The selected CE indicators included the trade in recyclable raw materials (TRM) and the circular material use rate (CMR) in the secondary raw materials area, the generation of municipal waste per capita (GMWp) in the production and consumption area and the recycling rate of municipal waste (RMW) in the area of waste management. The coefficients of the panel cointegration equations showed that for every 1 percentage point increase in RMW, average CO2 emissions decreased by 0.5%, while for every 1 percentage point increase in GMWp and TRM, the average CO2 emissions increased by 0.263% and 0.101%, respectively. It also showed that the recycling volumes and recycling rate had a positive but very limited impact on the CMR. The panel vector error correction model result showed that there were long-run bidirectional causalities between CE indicators and carbon emissions, and the TRM had a short-run negative impact on waste generation. However, the short-run impact of CE indicators on carbon emissions was not significant, which may be because the European CE is still in its infancy. The finding suggests that policymakers should adopt multilateral policies such as reducing carbon emissions, improving the efficiency and productivity of resource management and waste recycling, and increasing investment and innovation in the secondary raw materials market to achieve resource decoupling and impact decoupling. The decoupling of these two types is a necessary condition for sustainable development.

AB  - Connected car has become one of emerging technology in the automotive industries today. This development preludes a rise in vehicular communication studies that primarily targets radio channel modelling on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication mode. Considering vehicular obstruction, vast channel propagation studies have focused more on V2V mode while others consider the typical urban scenarios consisting of high traffic volumes of moving vehicles. Due to challenging propagation mechanisms and high complexity in such areas, radio propagation models applied in simulators assume an obstacle-free environment rather than considering the least effect imposed by metal obstruction on communication signal. Besides, there are limited studies pertaining to metal obstruction that considers several under-explored environments such as actual parking lots, junctions and other road infrastructure support. As such, this paper demonstrates signal attenuation analysis caused by the presence of metal objects in low density over obstacle-free environment on actual parking lot via V2I mode. Two scenarios such as LOS and NLOS conditions consisting of obstacle-free, cars and buses as static metal objects are evaluated. The aim of this research is to characterize signal strength caused by metal blockage on radio wave propagation predicated on the presence of vehicles as a subject of obstruction in comparison to obstacle-free vehicular environment. The validity of data is shown through received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and approximation analysis (RMSE) to demonstrate the efficiency of obtained measurements. The results demonstrated that Log-normal shadowing model yields the best fit to low-density metal obstruction scenario with smallest RMSE of 4.78 under bus obstruction whereas 5.72 under car obstruction.

AB  - Documenting flow regimes and the ecology of source headwater streams has gained considerable attention for scientific and regulatory purposes. These streams do not appear on standard maps, and local physiographic and climatologic conditions can control their origins. We investigated macroinvertebrate assemblages seasonally and in relation to flow duration, catchment and habitat variables within 14 source headwaters (< 1 ha) in the Western Allegheny Plateau over a 19-month period. We classified 6 perennial (P) and 8 intermittent (I) streams directly with continuous flow data loggers. Several biological and trait-based metrics could distinguish flow class, but few instream physical measures could. Macroinvertebrate metrics and assemblage dispersion varied seasonally and responded significantly along a gradient of total flow duration. Separate indicator species analyses generated 22 genera and 15 families with significant affinities to P streams. Richness of P-indicator taxa was also strongly correlated with flow duration gradients, and we estimated a total flow duration changepoint at 77% (3 indicator families) followed by a sharp increase in richness. Two rapid field-based flow duration methods (NC Stream Identification index and OH Headwater Habitat Evaluation index) could distinguish upstream ephemeral reaches from P and I reaches, but misclassified P as I more frequently. Our findings highlight that diverse coldwater macroinvertebrate assemblages inhabited extremely small, low-discharge springs in the region, and responded with flow duration. These source headwater habitats are susceptible to human disturbance and should be monitored as is routinely done in larger lotic systems.

AB  - The duration of maternal foraging trips has been regarded as an indicator of foraging conditions in many marine mammals, including northern fur seals Callorhinus ursinus (NFS). However, previous work has focused on individual variation, was conducted during limited portions of the lactation period, and/or reached conclusions based on relatively small sample sizes. Here, we build upon the substantial foundations of this previous work to establish maternal foraging trip duration (MFTD) as an index of foraging success at the rookery level. We found that a 1 d increase in rookery-averaged MFTD corresponded to a 6.52 % reduction in the average mass of female pups. Furthermore, rookery-averaged MFTD increased by 0.34 d per 1 degrees C increase in average ocean bottom temperature. The magnitude of variation observed in both MFTD and pup mass is likely too small to help explain the general decline in population size seen over recent decades. However, the correlation between rookery-averaged MFTD and pup mass highlights the potential power of the MFTD index to detect bottom-up effects on pup growth, a likely indicator of survival. Furthermore, when compared with concurrently conducted studies on prey distribution, availability, and quality, the relationship between MFTD and bottom temperature suggests a northward shift in distribution of NFS preferred prey, walleye pollock Gadus chalcogrammus, that is associated with an increase in trip duration across the study period. Thus, rookery-averaged MFTD is a promising metric for tracking broad environmental changes, such as northerly shifts in the Eastern Bering Sea cold pool.

AB  - Soil microorganisms play a crucial role in the maintenance of the ecosystem. Their diverse enzymatic machinery facilitates the biogeochemical cycling of essential macro/micronutrients. Over the past two decades, significant amount of research has been carried out on the application of nanocompounds in agricultural practices. Some reports support the role of nanocompounds in enhancing crop productivity by providing essential nutrients to plants or by exhibiting antimicrobial activities against different phytopathogens. Meagre information is available on long term impact of agriusable nanocompounds along with plant growth promoting rhizobacteria on microbial population of an agriculture field. In this study, attempts have been made to analyse the impact of nanozeolite and nanochitosan (50 mg L-1) along with a bioinoculant (Bacillus sp.) on the bacterial community of maize rhizosphere under field condition. Total bacterial counts, activities of soil health indicator enzymes and total microbial diversity of the experimental maize rhizosphere were assessed using Illumina based high throughput sequencing after 60 days of the experiment. Obtained results indicated higher bacterial diversity in the treated soil than the control which corresponded to increased number of Operational Taxanomic Units (OTUs). Combined treatment of bioinoculant and nanocompounds showed two fold increase in FDA (Fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis), dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase activity than the control. Presence of dominant bacterial genera viz. Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria and Chloroflexi were observed in treated soil sample. Combined treatment of Bacillus sp. and nanocompounds had a strong influence on the composition of rhizospheric microbiota, diversity and richness. We propose that the application of nanocompounds along with a potential bioinoculant is beneficial for the survival of rhizospheric bacterial population and soil health.

AB  - Freshwater lakes are facing increasingly serious water quality problems. Remote sensing techniques are effective tools for monitoring spatiotemporal information of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), a biochemical indicator for water quality. In this study, the Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT) model and Sentinel-2A/B imagery were combined to estimate low CDOM concentrations (0.003 m(-1) < a(CDOM)(440) <1.787 m(-1)) in Xin'anjiang Reservoir, an important drinking water resource in Zhejiang Province, China, providing the CDOM distributions and dynamics with high spatial (10 m) and temporal (5 day) resolutions. The possible environmental factors that may affect CDOM spatiotemporal patterns and dynamics were analyzed using Sentinel-2 image-observed data in 2018. Results showed that CDOM in the reservoir exhibited a clear increased gradient from its transition and lacustrine zones to the riverine zones, indicating that the rivers carried a substantial load of organic matter to the lake. The precipitation may increase CDOM concentrations but it has a delayed effect, while it may also shortly decrease CDOM concentrations due to the rainwater dilution. We also found that the correlations between CDOM and water temperature, air pressure, and wind speed were very low, indicating that these factors may not have significant impacts on CDOM variations in the reservoir. This study demonstrated that the GBRT model and Sentinel-2 imagery have the potential to accurately monitor CDOM spatiotemporal variations in reservoirs with low CDOM concentrations, which advances our understanding on the relations between the dissolved organic matter and its coupling environmental factors in river-reservoir systems.

AB  - Under the comprehensive reform of its household registration system, China has experienced the largest and fastest urbanization process in the world since its establishment 70 years ago, but with the deepening of urbanization, cities are facing greater environmental challenges. As the total amount of urban wastewater discharge increases, the condition of water pollution nationwide has become more severe. Thus, through the use of dynamic exogenous variable data envelopment analysis (DEA) this research selects the employment population and input cost of wastewater treatment in 31 provinces of China from 2013 to 2017 as input indicators, gross domestic product (GDP), wastewater production, and chemical oxygen demand (COD) in wastewater as output indicators, fixed assets as a carry-over variable, and urbanization level as an important influencing factor to evaluate and compare wastewater treatment efficiency in the northeast, central, western, and eastern regions with and without the influence of the level of urbanization. Findings show that the total efficiency score under the influence of the level of urbanization is generally higher than that without such an influence. The level of urbanization has a significantly positive effect on wastewater output efficiency in various regions, whereas wastewater output efficiency presents a downward trend from 2013 to 2017. The overall level of chemical oxygen demand efficiency is weak. When affected by the level of urbanization, the scores of COD efficiency in the eastern, northeast, and central regions have increased significantly. Finally, there is a large inter-provincial gap in the level of urbanization in the western region, while the level of urbanization has no significant impact on COD efficiency.

AB  - Bitumens from Middle Miocene Fat'ha Formation at Mishraq Sulfur Mine were investigated to determine their sources and the extent to which they may have been diagenetically altered. For these purposes, fourteen bitumen samples were subjected to detailed biomarker analysis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Stable carbon and deuterium isotopes were also measured on chromatographic fractions. These bitumens are present in cavities and fractures of limestone from the native sulfur productive series. Polar fractions accounts for about half of the bitumen composition. These bitumens are showing a partial removal of n-alkanes; whereas their terpanes and steranes are intact. In addition, dibenzothiophene (DBT) and phenanthrene (Phen.) concentrations and DBT/Phen. ratio are variable among the samples. Most deuterium isotope values of asphaltene and resin fractions are similar to those of non-biodegraded bitumen seeps from the Qaiyarah area. These criteria suggest that bitumens of Mishraq mine are slightly affected by biodegradation and they are water washed to different extents but are not affected by abiotic oxidation. The biodegradation of these bitumens is mainly due to sulfate-reducing (anaerobic) bacteria.
   Terpane and sterane ratios suggest that bitumens were generated from early-mid mature carbonate source rocks deposited under reducing conditions. They show high values of C29/C30 and C35S/C34S hopane (>1.0), low values of diasteranes/regular steranes, Ts/Tm, moretane/hopane, and low values of Pr/Ph for most samples. Regular sterane distributions show dominance of C29 over C27 steranes. Middle and Upper Jurassic Sargelu and Chia Gara formations are proposed as source rocks for these bitumens; but Chia Gara is most likely.

AB  - Precipitation regimes that change with global warming and climate changes affect the countries in environmental, economic, and social dimensions. The Marmara region is an important region located in the northwest of Turkey. The impact of economic, environmental, and social dimensions in the region is high. For this reason, the Marmara region is in a situation that can be affected more by climate change and drought. Precipitation forecasting is the first step for the management of agricultural planning, flood controls, and use of drinking water resources. Time series analysis is an important statistics tool that allows forecasting the amount of future precipitation based on the historical data analysis. Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models are the most common statistical methods used to estimate precipitation based on time series. The ARMA, ARIMA, and SARIMA models are based on the assumption that past conditions will remain the same in the future. In this study, precipitation for the 9 cities in Turkey's Marmara region is examined based on the 51-year (1969-2019) historical data and the ARMA, ARIMA, and SARIMA models are used to predict the precipitation in the next 60 months (up to 2024). While determining the model, the lowest AIC (Akaike information criterion) and AIC(c) (corrected Akaike information criterion) are preferred and, generally, the AIC(c) value is used to select the prediction model. After, the forecast measure errors of the models are checked with mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute scaled error (MASE) indicators. Finally, the ARIMA model is chosen as the most suitable model with the lowest estimation error.

AB  - Life-history and life-cycle models of Pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) are developed to provide insight into production dynamics of northern Bering Sea Pink salmon. Arctic ecosystems, including freshwater and marine ecosystems in the northern Bering Sea, are warming at a rapid rate. Due to their short, two-year life cycle, Pink salmon are well known to respond rapidly to ecosystem change and can provide unique insight into ecosystem impacts of warming Arctic conditions. Life-cycle models suggest a lack of density-dependence for adult Pink salmon spawners in the Yukon River and potential for some density-dependence for adult Pink salmon spawners in the Norton Sound region. Life-history models identify a positive and significant relationship between the abundance index for juvenile Pink salmon and average Nome air temperature during their freshwater residency (August to June). This relationship supports the notion that warming air temperatures in this region (as a proxy for river and stream temperatures) are contributing to improved freshwater survival or increased capacity of freshwater habitats to support Pink salmon production. Life-history models also identify the number of adult Pink salmon returning to Norton Sound and the Yukon River is significantly related to the juvenile abundance in the northern Bering Sea. This result indicates that much of the variability in survival for northern Bering Sea Pink salmon occurs during early life-history stages and that juvenile abundance is an informative leading indicator of Pink salmon runs to this region.

AB  - As the primary decomposers of organic material in terrestrial ecosystems, fungi are critical agents of the global carbon cycle. Yet our ability to link fungal community composition to ecosystem functioning is constrained by a limited understanding of the factors accounting for different wood decomposition rates among fungi. Here we examine which traits best explain fungal decomposition ability by combining detailed trait-based assays on 34 saprotrophic fungi from across North America in the laboratory with a 5-y field study comprising 1,582 fungi isolated from 74 decomposing logs. Fungal growth rate (hyphal extension rate) was the strongest single predictor of fungal-mediated wood decomposition rate under laboratory conditions, and accounted for up to 27% of the in situ variation in decomposition in the field. At the individual level, decomposition rate was negatively correlated with moisture niche width (an indicator of drought stress tolerance) and with the production of nutrient-mineralizing extracellular enzymes. Together, these results suggest that decomposition rates strongly align with a dominance-tolerance life-history tradeoff that was previously identified in these isolates, forming a spectrum from slow-growing, stress-tolerant fungi that are poor decomposers to fast-growing, highly competitive fungi with fast decomposition rates. Our study illustrates how an understanding of fungal trait variation could improve our predictive ability of the early and midstages of wood decay, to which our findings are most applicable. By mapping our results onto the biogeographic distribution of the dominance-tolerance trade-off across North America, we approximate broad-scale patterns in intrinsic fungal-mediatedwood decomposition rates.

AB  - A sequence of three lignite seams and interlayering carbonaceous mudstone is characterized by geochemical proxies. The study is extended by the palaeoenvironmental details given by the fossil fauna (gastropods, ostracods, and fishes). The predominant minerals (quartz and kaolinite) and main oxide relations of the carbonaceous mudstone point to sand and clay washed from weathered and/or altered felsic rocks from the catchment area. The mudstone features to deposition from suspension in standing or slow to persistently moving fresh waters at the bottom of the core log, and slightly aerated, warm, fresh to low saline, acidic to alkaline waters on the top. Three communities of organisms are depicted. The first is the pre-swamp environment characterized by standing or slow moving fresh waters and detrital organic matter deposition. The second is the environment of swamp of detrital forest trunks. Depending on the climate and water table, the main forest communities are of trees of families Cupressaceae, Taxodiaceae, and Podocarpaceae accompanied by trees of family Betulaceae, and herbaceous plants. Different Sphagnum species are also abundant. The dry/cold environment is reflected in the herbaceous organic matter deposition. Polar terpenoids ratio differentiates slight climatic oscillations for the samples with a strong Gymnospermae dominance. The second coal seam development reflects the optimum tectonic conditions for peat growth in a cold and dry climate leading up to 25 m lignite deposition. The third is the moss swamp environment with very fluctuating elements. At the top of the log, a Sphagnum-dominated peat has developed.

AB  - Stabilizing the effects of greenhouse gas emissions on the atmosphere is a key step towards solving the global climate change problems. Storage technologies play an essential role in compensating the discrepancy between surplus energy and peak times. Sorption processes, in particular, offer an environment friendly way for almost loss-free heat (of adsorption or absorption) and cold storage. This work is dedicated first to analytically investigate the potential of applying NaY-Water/Zeolite as a working pair for heat and cold storage upon utilizing high temperature heat. It turned out that, the mass of the adsorber heat exchanger increases the useful specific heat stored from 229 kWh/tzeolite for the ideal storage to 538 kWh/tzeolite or even higher depending on the thermal capacity of the adsorber heat exchanger (AdsHX). Contrary to that trend, COP will decrease with increasing the thermal capacity of the AdsHX. Sensible heat losses between charging and discharging phases do have a negative effect on both stored heating capacity and COP.
   In addition, an innovative hybrid steam power cum adsorption storage process is introduced and analytically investigated at different ambient conditions and time scenarios for on-peak and off-peak durations over the day. The introduced hybrid process seems quite promising in achieving electrical power production and efficiency enhancements during peak load durations. The extent of enhancing both performance indicators increases with increasing the ambient temperature difference between peak and off-peak times. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Research on the biodegradation of emerging pollutants is gained great focus regarding their detrimental effects on the environment and humans. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the ability of the ascomycetes Thielavia sp HJ22 to remove the phenolic xenobiotics nonylphenol (NP), 4-tert-octylphenol (4-tert-OP) and 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP). The strain showed efficient degradation of NP and 4-tert-OP with 95% and 100% removal within 8 h of incubation, respectively. A removal rate of 80% was observed with 2,4-DCP within the same time. Under experimental conditions, the degradation of the tested pollutants concomitantly increased with the laccase production and cytochrome P450 monooxygenases inhibition. This study showed the involvement of laccase in pollutants removal together with biosorption mechanisms. Additionally, results demonstrated the participation of cytochrome P450 monooxygenase in the elimination of 2,4-DCP. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed several intermediates, mainly hydroxylated and oxidized compounds with less harmful effects compared to the parent compounds. A decrease in the toxicity of the identified metabolites was observed using Aliivibrio fischeri as bioindicator. The metabolic pathways of degradation were proposed based on the identified metabolites. The results point out the potential of Thielavia strains in the degradation and detoxification of phenolic xenobiotics. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A large proportion of studies assessing the impact of disturbances on the invertebrate community composition focus on a single life stage, assuming that those are an adequate indicator of environmental conditions. The effect of a specific disturbance may, however, depend on the life stage of the exposed organism. Therefore, we focused on the effect of spates on the caddisfly Agapetus fuscipes CURTIS (Trichoptera: Glossosomatidae) during different larval stages. A 2 year field study was performed in which we measured the discharge dynamics and population development of A. fuscipes in four lowland streams in The Netherlands. A stage-structured population model (i.e. StagePop) was used to test the impact of peak discharge on the different life stages, as larval instars 1-4 were not effectively sampled in the field. Four different mortality rates in response to spates were simulated, including a constant low, a constant high, a decreasing and an increasing impact per larval stage. This way, we were able to show a potential association between spates and population declines, where the stage-population model including decreasing impact by spates with increasing larval life stage most accurately described the population development of the larval instars 5-8. Focusing only on late instars could thus potentially result in underestimation of the effects of spates on this species. In conclusion, determination of responses of critical life stages to specific disturbances may help to identify the causes of the presence and absence of species, and thereby aid more effective management and restoration of degraded aquatic systems.

AB  - Sewage sludge is widely used as an organic fertilizer, but also presents several risks to environmental and human health. This chapter presents a quantitative environmental risk assessment (ERA) and a qualitative human health risk assessment associated with farmland application of sewage sludge as compared to cattle and pig slurry. The analysis reflects conditions pertaining to Denmark, and neighboring European countries. The quantitative ERA was performed by estimating the cumulative risk of 138 (sludge) or 20 (slurry) identified contaminants 6 months after the 100th year of application. Environmental risk was quantified as the ratio of the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) divided by the predicted no effect concentration (PNEC). PEC/PNEC was 2-3 for sewage sludge and cattle slurry, whereas it was 8 for pig slurry. Metal compounds (especially Zn and Cu) accounted for the majority (>50%) of the environmental risk associated with farmland application of animal slurries, whereas phthalates and triclocarban collectively accounted for more than 50% of the corresponding risk associated with sewage sludge. Human health risks via dietary exposure to potentially toxic elements (PTEs) and pharmaceuticals in food crops were concluded not to cause any reason for concern. Based on reviewed literature, we further conclude that Danish sewage sludge does not represent a higher risk than animal manure for environmental dissemination of antibiotic resistance. Overall, it is concluded that sewage sludge from contemporary Danish society does not constitute a higher risk to soil organisms or human health than pig slurry.

AB  - Changes in vegetation productivity and species composition have been used as conventional indicators of land degradation and rehabilitation assessments. The two biophysical parameters vary nonlinearly during land change process with various time lags, which provide, as a whole, a useful framework to diagnose degree of land degradation and rehabilitation. In this study, the net primary productivity (NPP) and water use efficiency (WUE), which are the proxies of vegetation productivity and eco-physiological properties related to species composition, were combined to develop an eco-physiological framework to assess the degree of land degradation in the Northeast-Asia dryland regions (NADR) from 1982 to 2012. Results from long-term trends analysis showed early, middle or late degradation stages occurred in northern grassland and central barren or sparsely vegetated regions, respectively, while the rehabilitation prevailed in eastern croplands and forest, southern, and western grassland. In contrast, short-term trend analysis illustrated the recent rehabilitation in mid-eastern Mongolia and Loess Plateau, which was unseen in long-term trend analysis. The spatial patterns and temporal changes of land degradation and rehabilitation could be explained partly by either or both natural and anthropogenic factors. Long-term drying and warming might induce land degradation in northern and central NADR, respectively, while the recovery projects and wetting conditions after 2000s promoted the land rehabilitation in Loess Plateau and mid-eastern Mongolia. Here, our NPP-WUE framework may contribute further conceptual development and rapid assessments on land degradation and rehabilitation in wide geographic regions.

AB  - This study explores use the of remotely sensed satellite data for monitoring environmental impact of MSW open dumps on their surroundings using bio-thermal indicators. The study has made use of 66 images of Lansat-8 from January 2014 to December 2017, to monitor main MSW dump of Gujranwala, Pakistan. On average thermally influence zone of the dump has been found extended to 480 m around it. Whereas the seasonal average radius of the influence in the zone is measured as 375 m, 425 m, 450 m, 527 m, 590 m and 600 m for spring, monsoon, wet summer, winter-II, winter-I and dry summer respectively. Extreme temperatures and dry weather conditions increase the range of the zone. The range of the bio-influence zone around the dump has been measured using satellite driven VIs of MSAVI, SAVI and NDVI that averages to 590 m. The seasonal averages measured by averaging results from all three VIs are 326 m, 410 m, 430 m, 620 m, 692 m and 1100 m for spring, monsoon, winter-II, wet summer, winter-I and dry summer respectively. In addition, max-min gap of the measurements has been used to assess operational stability of individual parameters and seasons for the used spatial analysis. Development of bio-thermally influence zone with time and a comparison with previous studies a positive correlation between measured range of bio-thermal influence zone and amount of MSW dumped at sites has been verified.

AB  - Tourism is an important source of income for many mountain communities in Nepal. However, the tourism industry is highly vulnerable to a variety of natural hazards. The ability of local people to proactively prepare, protect, and support prevention activities against natural hazards drives a mountain community's resilience. Research on whether and to what extent people have adopted such proactive behaviors has shown that human action is determined not only by sociodemographic and socioeconomic conditions-such as age, gender, or income-but also by values and worldviews. In this paper, we present data from a 2-phased survey of 160 lodge owners conducted in 2017 and 2018 in Mustang, Nepal, focusing on lodge owners' activities in disaster risk reduction (DRR) and their values and worldviews. Classifying the preparedness and support for prevention (PSP) activities of lodge owners, we found 3 different PSP types. In a second step, these PSP types were contrasted with values and worldviews held by the lodge owners, as well as sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors. This revealed strong correlations between the lodge owners' values and their PSP type. These results indicate that when trying to explain an actor's DRR activities, his or her values might be as important as commonly used sociodemographic and socioeconomic indicators. We argue that a holistic concept of resilience-combining actors' values and worldviews as well as their sociodemographic and socioeconomic status-can strengthen efforts to build resilience.

AB  - Mixed crop-livestock (MC-LS) farms are assumed to be more environmental friendly than specialized livestock systems, due to their better options for internal nutrient recycling. However, there are large differences among MC-LS farms in nutrient allocation and recycling. Here, we posit that the relative allocation of nitrogen to crop and livestock compartments, expressed as crop-livestock ratio (CLS), determines the performance of MC-LS farms. Among 300 urban and peri-urban farms studied in 2014, 42 MC-LS farms (Addis Ababa: 20; Jimma: 22) were re-interviewed in 2016, using MonQIt (monitoring tool) questionnaire. The performances of these farms were evaluated using partial nitrogen balance (PNB), N use efficiency (NUE), N recycling index and net farm income (NFI). CLS was negatively related to N input, PNB and NFI. Livestock oriented MC-LS farms had 4-5 times higher N input and 7 times higher PNB than crop oriented MC-LS farms, because they had 2-4 times higher NFI and purchased more external N input. This indicated that N allocation has significant environmental and economic implications. Sensitivity analyses suggested that NUE at farm system level can be improved by 20-25% and N recycling (NR) by 10-20% over the current condition. In conclusion, MC-LS farms are diverse, and much of the diversity can be captured by the CLS indicator. NUE and NR of peri-urban MC-LS farms in Ethiopia can be significantly improved through NUE enhancing measures: targeted exchange of crop residues and manure between crop and livestock activities within and between farms and improving animal NUE through breeding and precision feeding.

AB  - Municipalities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) are managing their municipal solid waste management (MSWM) systems without a structured performance assessment mechanism. For long-term sustainability, all the key components of a MSWM system need to perform efficiently. Identifying suitable performance indicators (PIs) for the regions without having an established performance benchmarking process is a daunting task. A framework is developed to select the PIs for seven key components of MSWM systems, including public service and participation, personnel, physical assets, operational, environmental, sustainability, and financial. Initially, 87 potential PIs were identified under these components through an exhaustive review of literature and expert knowledge. Interview surveys were conducted with decision-makers from two municipalities and academia in the Qassim Region of KSA to evaluate the PIs against three decision criteria, i.e., "relevance," "measurability," and "understandability." For addressing the uncertainties due to vagueness in group decision-making, criteria weights were established through fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) while the linguistic scores (defined as fuzzy numbers) were aggregated using the Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE II). Finally, 61 PIs were selected and ranked, for the seven key components, by the decision-makers based on the outranking relationships. Network maps encompass the selected PIs using the decision-makers' boundary and leave a choice for including additional PIs in future for continuous performance improvement. A conceptual performance assessment framework has also been proposed for practical implementation of the selected PIs for MSWM systems in KSA and other parts of Gulf region with similar conditions.

AB  - Human activities interacting with coastal waters lead to large amounts of nutrient loading and severe water pollution in China's near Seas. In this context, a comprehensive quantitative characterization of the spatiotemporal variation of nutrient pollutant concentrations is a key component of any reliable seawater quality assessment and integrated coastal management plan. The present work combines the Bayesian maximum entropy method with stochastic site indicators to estimate monthly nitrate and phosphate concentrations in China's near seas during 2015, explore their spatiotemporal variation, and provide an explicit quantitative assessment of seawater quality in conditions of in situ uncertainty. This makes it the first study of space-time nutrient pollutant characterization at a national-scale in a coastal seawater environment. The results showed that nitrate and phosphate distributions exhibit the same spatial trends along China's near seas, whereas high nutrient pollution levels are found in the Yangtze River, Liaohe River, and Pearl River estuaries. Local differences of temporal trends exist between nitrate and phosphate distributions, which suggest that distinct remediation strategies are needed to properly satisfy the required seawater quality standards. The average nitrate and phosphate concentrations across space-time were found to be equal to 0.271 and 0.015 mg/L, respectively. The nitrate and phosphate concentrations exceeding the fourth grade seawater quality standard during 2015 were about 11% and 2.6%, respectively. The study of both the seasonal changes in human activities along the coastal cities and the temporal marine hydrodynamics can offer a better understanding of the seawater quality and the biogeochemical process of nutrient transport and distribution.

AB  - Objective Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) exist along a spectrum, from explanatory, designed to evaluate interventions under ideal conditions, to pragmatic, designed to reflect usual care. This study assessed the pragmatism of RCTs of advanced therapeutics in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods A systematic review was conducted to identify RA RCTs comparing biologic or targeted synthetic therapy in combination with methotrexate, to placebo or any other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Trials were rated using the Pragmatic Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary-2 (PRECIS-2) tool in 9 domains, each rated from 1 (very explanatory) to 5 (very pragmatic). Latent class and regression analyses examined the heterogeneity in PRECIS-2 scores and the relationship to trial characteristics. Results In total, 96 trials were included. Eligibility, follow-up, and flexibility of delivery of the intervention were rated as explanatory, with mean +/- SD PRECIS-2 scores of 2.0 +/- 0.7, 2.0 +/- 1.1, and 2.1 +/- 0.7, respectively, reflecting strict inclusion criteria, intensive follow-up, and rigid protocols. Studies were rated as pragmatic in setting (3.6 +/- 1.5) because many were international, multicenter trials, and in primary analysis (4.1 +/- 1.3), because most used intent-to-treat analyses. In latent class analyses, 2 groups were identified; the majority (74%) were rated as explanatory for most domains assessed. These trials had larger sample sizes, were more likely to be industry-funded, and enrolled patients with higher Disease Activity Score in 28 joints and Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index scores, but were less likely to be at high risk of bias. Conclusion RCTs of biologic DMARD treatment in combination with methotrexate for RA were rated as predominantly explanatory, which may affect the generalizability of trial results to clinical practice.

AB  - Material stocks play a key role in the increasing and unsustainable utilization of natural resources. However, comprehensive and disaggregated datasets are still scarce in the literature of socio-economic metabolism research. The model presented in this article is able to estimate the capital stocks of agriculture, industry and services both in physical and in monetary dimensions.
   The estimation method based on Cobb-Douglas production function was introduced in this article through two example sectors of Hungarian economy, namely the agricultural production and transportation. Three capital stock estimations of four are statistically significant. The highest impact on output of transportation sector has the investment into machinery and ICT, it is proved with high input elasticity (0.656) relative to other factors. In case of agriculture, drought and machinery has significant influence on the production (-0.958 and 0.5633). Transportation sector requires 12,654 Mt of building stock and 2064 Mt of machinery and ICT, while agriculture utilizes 347,112 Mt building stock and 1891 Mt machinery and ICT.
   In this article, a condition determining the weight of annual output relative to the specific type of capital stock is discussed as well. Furthermore, the significance of the internalization of externalities during the life cycle of the built capital stock is analyzed, with a correspondence to standard microeconomic theory. Although marginal product of machinery and ICT exceeds significantly those of buildings and infrastructures in the studied sectors, material stock of buildings and infrastructure are higher, hence they are available at lower per unit cost.

AB  - The Inland River Area of China (IRAC), being the most water-stressed region in the world, faced with increasingly severe ecological degradation risk and water shortage issue under global climate warming. Previous studies indicated that the climate of IRAC have changed from warm-dry to warm-wet, because both precipitation (P) and air temperature have increased. However, the analysis in this study, considering the effects of climate change on hydrologic cycle rather than simply on climate conditions, indicates that there has been no substantial change from a warm-dry to a warm-wet climate in the IRAC during 1948-2010. The Standardized Moisture Anomaly Index (SZI), which is a comprehensive multiscalar drought indicator, was used to identify the patterns of dry and wet weather. The Global Land Data Assimilation System 2 (GLDAS2) Noah model, based on advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques, were used to provide input surface water-energy variables for calculating SZI. The results show that both the forcing data and the output of the GLDAS2 Noah model are in good agreement with different types of observations. The variabilities in SZI are more consistent with evidence of multiple droughts (including residual water/energy ratio, evapotranspiration deficit, and historical drought records) than the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). Based on SZI, it is known that increases in the water supply (P) are balanced by the increased water demand caused by significant climate warming; that is, terrestrial water storage has generally remained balanced over the past four decades.

AB  - Due to the complexity of factors that influence species density on a large geographical scale, the effectiveness of the species distribution model (SDM) is still debatable. That is why the buffer zone (the area within 100 m from the outside edge of the patch), the core, i.e. (patches excluding the 100 m buffer zone from the patch's edge) and patch shape are explored in this study to see how they affect the density of habitat specialist and generalist bird species. Two sets of generalised additive models were generated separately for each of the four bird species: One set of models contained landscape configuration metrics as an additional predictor variable, and the other did not. The results showed that models including the core, the buffer zone and the shape of patches turned out to be definitely better than models without them. Specialist species, the Corn bunting and the Wood nuthatch, are more likely to occur in the core of the preferred patches, and they choose those of a simple shape; while generalist species, the Whinchat and the Tree pipit, are more probable to be present in the buffer zone of a more complicated shape. Thus, the results clearly show that specific landscape configuration models can improve the predictive power of SDMs and can be used as an effective tool for predicting species density and functional bird diversity (specialist and generalist). Furthermore, from the applied ecology perspective, detailed landscape configuration metrics can be considered as a surrogate of elusive habitat conditions.

AB  - Germination-an important stage in the life cycle of plants-is susceptible to the presence of soil contaminants. Since the early 1990s, the use of germination tests to screen multiple plant species to select candidates for phytoremediation has received much attention. This is due to its inexpensive methodology and fast assessment relative to greenhouse or field growth studies. Surprisingly, no comprehensive synthesis is available of these studies in the scientific literature. As more plant species are added to phytoremediation databases, it is important to encapsulate the knowledge thus far and revise protocols. In this review, we have summarised previously-documented effects of petroleum hydrocarbons on germination and seedling growth. The methods and materials of previous studies are presented in tabulated form. Common practice includes the use of cellulose acetate filter paper, plastic Petri dishes, and low numbers of seeds and replicates. A general bias was observed for the screening of cultivated crops as opposed to native species, even though the latter may be better suited to site conditions. The relevance of germination studies as important ecotoxicological tools is highlighted with the proposed use of root imaging software. Screening of novel plant species, particularly natives, is recommended with selection focussed on (i) species phylogeny, (ii) plant morphological and functional traits, and (iii) tolerance towards harsh environmental stresses. Recommendations for standardised protocols for germination and early growth monitoring are made in order to improve the robustness of statistical modelling and species selection in future phytoremediation evaluations and field programs.

AB  - Self-reports and questionnaires have been the preferred research methods in the criminological field of "fear of crime" (FOC) since its rise in the 1960s. Our study had two main goals: (1) to measure the physiological indicators of fear in real time and (2) to compare these data with those obtained through self-reports, designed also to measure the emotion of fear.
   An experimental study was conducted over the course of a week during late February 2016 in Aarhus (Denmark), in which the focus was on traditional environmental variables in the field of FOC (i.e., poor lighting conditions).
   Our results support the ideas that: (1) the absence of good luminosity in an open public space in an urban setting elicits physiological reactions of arousal that can be taken as indicators of experiences of fear and (2) heart rate appears to capture aspects of the emotion of fear that are not reflected in data obtained through self-report questionnaires.
   This study, introducing a pioneering approach to the study of FOC, presents great potentials in complementing traditional methods in the crime sciences. The many challenges we faced are significant and reported with the hope that subsequent literature will build upon. We propose that traditional methods and new measurements could be combined to advance research in the field by allowing researchers to more unambiguously constrain the interpretation of their data. This becomes particularly relevant in a field like FOC, which has long suffered from irreconcilable results stemming from different investigations.

AB  - Explosives are commonly used to generate strong impulsive waves for on-land petroleum exploration. For each exploration area in Thailand, a concessionaire shall submit an environmental impact assessment report that commits minimum distances, or setback distances, between an explosive and various types of structures to a regulatory authority. However, the basis for determining the setback distances is not described and or based on surface mine blasting researches.
   To establish a guideline for exploration contractors in Thailand, ground vibrations were measured from ten exploration sites across the country which can be grouped into three geology conditions, namely sandy ground, clayey ground and sandy ground with rock boulders. Explosives in this study were buried and packed in boreholes at depths of 9 similar to 23 m, having weights of 1 similar to 4 kg and length-to-diameter ratios of 6 similar to 25.
   The measured data were used for determining the attenuation of particle velocities over distance and the frequency content of vibrations. The geometric damping was found to be the main cause of attenuation while the material damping was negligible. The attenuation in sandy ground with rock boulders was found to be stronger than sandy ground and clayey ground. Since the dominant frequencies of vibration in each ground type varied over wide range, the frequencies at the 2.5th percentile were used for the conservative sake in the vibration assessment according to DIN 4150. Based the proposed formula, the setback distances between residential buildings and a 2-kg explosive are 53, 149 and 221 m for sandy with rock boulders, sandy and clayey grounds, respectively.

AB  - This paper presents the results of multi-disciplinary research carried out on the deposits of Moervaart depression, NW Belgium, one of the largest palaeolakes (similar to 25 km(2)) that existed during the Lateglacial interstadial in NW Europe. The multi-proxy study, including physical (organic matter and calcium carbonate, magnetic susceptibility, micromorphological), botanical (pollen, macrofossils, diatoms), zoological (ostracods, molluscs, chironomids) and chemical analyses (stable carbon and oxygen isotopes) has resulted in a detailed reconstruction of the Lateglacial landscape as well of the local conditions that prevailed in the lake itself. A chronology of the record was provided by radiocarbon dating and comparison with radiocarbon dates of the nearby Rieme site. These yielded a good match with the regional biostratigraphy. During the Lateglacial, vegetation and geomorphology of the landscape in general changed from a tundra landscape to a boreal forest. The vegetation development, however, was interrupted by a number of cold reversals. Three centennial-scale cold oscillations are present in the record: 1) the so-called Older Dryas corresponding to GI-1d in the Greenland ice-cores, 2) a short and pronounced cold event during the early Allerod, which could be correlated to GI-1c2 and 3) a cooling event during the late Allerad probably corresponding to the Intra Allerod Cold Period (IACP) or GI-1b. The latter most likely was responsible for the disappearance of the Moervaart palaeolake. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of organophosphorus (OP) pollutants on oxidative stress and ultrastructural biomarkers in the midgut of the honeybee Apis mellifera collected from three locations that differ in their extent of spraying load with OP insecticides: a weakly anthropised rural site, Bolin which is considered as a reference site; moderately spraying site, El Kaza; and a strongly anthropised urban site, Tiba with a long history of pesticide use. Results showed that high concentrations of chlorpyrifos, malathion, diazinon, chlorpyrifos-methyl, and pirimiphos-methyl were detected in midgut at locations with extensive pesticide spraying. Reduced glutathione content, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase displayed lowest activities in the heavily sprayed location (Tiba). Lipid peroxidation level in the midgut of honeybees in the sprayed locations was found to be significantly higher compared to the reference values. Meanwhile, various ultrastructural abnormalities were observed in the epithelial cells of midgut of honeybees collected from El Kaza and Tiba, included confluent and disorganized microvilli and destruction of their brush border, the cytoplasm with large vacuoles and alteration of cytoplasmic organelles including the presence of swollen mitochondria with lysis of matrices, disruption of limiting membranes, and disintegration of cristae. The nuclei with indented nuclear envelope and disorganized chromatin were observed. These investigated biomarkers indicated that the surveyed honeybees are being under stressful environmental conditions. So, we suggest using those biomarkers in the assessment of environmental quality using honeybees in future monitoring of ecotoxicological studies.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify the effects of recent demographic transition and rising labor costs on agricultural production structure and pattern in China during 1998-2012.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors, first, theoretically discuss the effects of changing relative input prices due to rising labor cost on producers' decisions regarding input mix (substitution effect), output level, and product quality (output effect). A logarithmic mean Divisia index decomposition method is then applied to empirically identify these effects at aggregated levels, followed by an analysis based on the visualization of land use indicators on changing cropping patterns across Chinese provinces.
   Findings - The authors find that tightened effective agricultural labor supply and rises in rural labor costs are associated with divergent changes in input mixes and output choices across products. Producers of land-intensive products focusing more on input mix adjustment, while those of labor-intensive products seem to more likely to adjust output choices. Producers' adaption strategies also varied across Chinese provinces due to natural conditions, leading to shifts and concentrations in the regional distribution of agricultural products, with lower-value bulk products concentrating in the plain areas, whereas higher-value horticulture products increasingly prevailing in sloped areas.
   Originality/value - This paper illustrates how adjustments in input mixes and output choice in Chinese agriculture counteracted disadvantages caused by rising labor costs and how such adjustments are product and region specific. Based on these observations, implications regarding further innovations in production technology and institutional arrangements needed within China's agricultural sector are highlighted in the paper.

AB  - One of the basic conditions for effective police work in the local environment is the disposal of information about the events that pose a threat to the safety and security of citizens in a particular location. Without such information, necessary measures and actions will not be taken, or if they are taken, they will not take place where and when needed. Answering the question as to the extent police officers know where crimes are committed is important, not only in terms of improving work efficiency of the police organization, but it can also be a significant indicator of (low)quality analytical support provided to police officers. In this context, this paper provides results of research on current police practices of the Ministry of Interior of the Republic of Serbia, specifically to answer the question as to extent the police officers know where crime areas (hotspots) are located, and the way in which they acquire information on relevant events at their patrol areas, as well as the influence of the crime analysis unit in their everyday work. Results showed that police officers believe that they are familiar with the locations of crime hotspots, although the analysis revealed that police officers' knowledge of hot spots do not correspond with real situations. We discovered that two key factors stand out - personal lack of interest of police officers, and inadequate analytical support of their work. In order to overcome the stated problems, it is necessary to decentralize the work of the department of analytics, to implement crime mapping in police practice, as well as to create adequate organizational prerequisites for better informing police officers.

AB  - In this report, we present the research results on using the conventional method and microwave technology to extract curcuminoid from turmeric roots originated in different regions of Northern Vietnam. This method is simple, yet economical, non-toxic and still able to achieve high extraction performance to get curcuminoid from turmeric roots. The detailed results on the Raman vibration spectra combined with X-ray powder diffraction and high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry allowed the evaluation of each batch of curcumin crystalline powder sample received, under the conditions of applied fabrication technology. Also, the absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies of the samples are presented in the paper. The information to be presented in this paper: absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies of the samples; new experimental study results on applied technology to mass-produce curcumin from turmeric rhizomes; comparative study results between fabricated samples and marketing curcumin products-to state the complexity of co-existing crystalline phase in curcumin powder samples. We noticed that, it is possible to use the vibration line at similar to 959 cm(-1)-characteristic of the. C=O vibration, and the similar to 1625 cm(-1) line-characteristic of the. C=O and. C=C vibration in curcumin molecules, for preliminary quality assessment of naturally originated curcumin crystalline powder samples. Data on these new optical spectra will contribute to the bringing of detailed information on natural curcumin in Vietnam, serving research purposes and applications of natural curcumin powder and nanocurcumin in Vietnam, as well as being initial materials for the pharmaceutical, cosmetics or functional food industries.

AB  - The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an essential organelle for cellular metabolic homeostasis including folding and maturation of secretory and membrane proteins. Disruption of ER proteostasis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases such as diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. The ER redox state, which is an oxidative environment suitable for disulfide-bond formation, is essential for ER protein quality control. Hence, detection of the ER redox state, especially in living cells, is essential to understand the mechanism by which the redox state of the ER is maintained. However, methods to detect the redox state of the ER have not been well-established because of inefficient folding and stability of roGFP variants with oxidative redox potential like roGFP-iL. Here we have improved the folding efficiency of ER-targeted roGFP-iL (ERroGFP-iL) in cells by introducing superfolder GFP (sfGFP) mutations. Four specific amino acid substitutions (S30R, Y39N, T105N and I171V) greatly improved folding efficiency in Escherichia coli and in the ER of HeLa cells, as well as the thermostability of the purified proteins. Introduction of these mutations also enhanced the dynamic range for redox change both in vitro and in the ER of living cells. ER-targeted roGFP-S4 (ERroGFP-S4) possessing these four mutations could detect physiological redox changes within the ER. ERroGFP-S4 is therefore a novel probe suitable for monitoring redox change in the ER. ERroGFP-S4 can be applied to detect aberrant ER redox states associated with various pathological conditions and to identify the mechanisms used to maintain the redox state of the ER.

AB  - The lack of consistency in homogeneous color throughout the season of pigmented baby leaf lettuce is a problem for growers because of the rejection of the product and consequently the economic loss. Changes in color as well as individual and total phenolic composition and content as a response to the climatic variables were studied following the analysis of three pigmented baby leaf lettuces over 16 consecutive weeks from February to May, which corresponded to the most important production season in winter in Europe. Color and phenolic content were significantly (P <= 0.001) affected by cultivar, harvest week, and climatic variables that occurred in the last week before harvest. Radiation and temperature showed positive correlations with the content of phenolic acids and flavonoids that increased in all three cultivars as the season progressed. Cyanidin-3-O-(6"-O-malonyl)-glucoside content showed positive correlations with temperature and radiation but only in Batavia cultivars whereas in red oak leaf the correlation was with cold temperatures. Regarding hue angle, a positive correlation was shown with the number of hours at temperatures lower than 7 degrees C. A relationship between hue angle and the content of anthocyanins was not possible to establish. These results suggest that the colorimetric measurement of color cannot be used as a good indicator of anthocyanin accumulation because other pigments such as chlorophylls and carotenoids may contribute as well to the leaf color of pigmented lettuce. This study provides information about the impact of genotype and environment interactions on the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds to explain the variability in the leaf color and product appearance.

AB  - Photosynthesis and respiration are major components of the plant carbon balance. During stress, like drought, carbohydrate supply from photosynthesis is reduced and the Krebs cycle respiration must be fueled with other stored carbon compounds. However, the dynamics of storage use are still unknown. The respiratory quotient (RQ, CO2 released per O-2 consumed during respiration) is an excellent indicator of the nature of the respiration substrate. In plant science, however, online RQ measurements have been challenging or even impossible so far due to very small gas exchange fluxes during respiration. Here we apply cavity-enhanced multi-gas Raman spectrometry (CERS) for online in situ RQ measurements in drought-tolerant pine (Pinus sylvestris [L.]) and drought-intolerant spruce (Picea abies [L. H. Karst]). Two different treatments, drought and shading, were applied to reduce photosynthesis and force dependency on stored substrates. Changes in respiration rates and RQ values were continuously monitored over periods of several days with low levels of variance. The results show that both species switched from COH-dominated respiration (RQ = 1.0) to a mixture of substrates during shading (RQ = 0.77-0.81), while during drought only pine did so (RQ = 0.75). The gas phase measurements were complemented by concentration measurements of non-structural carbohydrates and lipids. These first results suggest a physiological explanation for greater drought tolerance in pine. CERS was proven as powerful technique for non-consumptive and precise real-time monitoring of respiration rates and respirational quotients for the investigation of plant metabolism under drought stress conditions that are predicted to increase with future climate change.

AB  - The shale-gas potential of mid-Carboniferous mudrocks in the Bowland-Hodder unit in the Cleveland Basin (Yorkshire, northern England) was investigated through the analysis of a cored section from the uppermost part of the unit in the Malton-4 well using a multidisciplinary approach. Black shales are interbedded with bioturbated and bedded sandstones, representing basinal-offshore to prodelta - delta-front lithofacies. The total organic carbon (TOC) content of the shales ranges from 0.37 to 2.45 wt %. Rock-Eval pyrolysis data indicate that the organic matter is mainly composed of Type III kerogen with an admixture of Type II kerogen. T-max (436-454 degrees C), 20S/(20S+20R) C-29 sterane ratios, and vitrinite reflectance values indicate that organic matter is in the mid- to late- mature (oil) stage with respect to hydrocarbon generation. Sedimentological and geochemical redox proxies suggest that the black shales were deposited in periodically oxic-dysoxic and anoxic bottom waters with episodic oxic conditions, explaining the relatively low TOC values. The Rock-Eval parameters indicate that the analysed mudrocks have a limited shale-gas potential. However, burial and thermal history modelling, and VRr data from other wells in the region, indicate that where they are more deeply-buried, the Bowland-Hodder shales will be within the gas window with VRr > 1.1 % at depths in excess of 2000 m. Therefore although no direct evidence for a high shale-gas potential in the Cleveland Basin has been found, this cannot be precluded at greater depths especially if deeper horizons are more organic rich.

AB  - Many studies have revealed that anchovy has exhibited large variability in population size on decadal timescales. However, such works concerning anchovy population are mainly based on short historical catch records. In order to understand the causes of variability in fish stocks (natural and/or anthropogenic) and calibrate the error between catches and standing stocks, it is essential to develop long-term time series of fish stocks from the time when human impacts are minimal or negligible. Well preserved fish scales from sediment record are regarded as useful indicators revealing the history of fish population dynamics over the last centuries. Anchovy scales was first analyzed over the Yellow Sea and East China Sea and the largest abundance was found in the central South Yellow Sea where is regarded as the largest overwintering ground for Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicas). Thus in the central South Yellow Sea, two cores covering the last 150 years were collected for estimating fish scale flux. The scale deposition rate (SDR) records show that the decadal scale SDRs were obviously coherent between cores with independent chronologies. The calibration of downcore SDRs to the standing stocks of anchovy further validated that SDR is a reliable proxy to reconstruct the long-term anchovy population dynamic in the central South Yellow Sea where anoxic conditions prevail in the sediment. When assembled with other productivity proxies, it would be expected that SDR could be associated with changes in oceanic productivity and may make a contribution to determine the forcing factors and elucidate the mechanism of the process in future.

AB  - Geophysical and geochemical signals recorded during episodes of unrest preceding volcanic eruptions provide information on movements of magma inside the lithosphere and on how magma prepares to reach the surface. When the eruption ensues continuous volcanic monitoring can reveal the nature of changes occurring in the volcano's plumbing system, which may be correlated with changes in both eruption behaviour and products. During the 2011-2012 submarine eruption of El Hierro (Canary Islands), the seismic signal, surface deformation, a broad stain on the sea surface of the eruption site, and the occasional appearance of floating lava balloons and pyroclastic fragments were the main observable signs. A strong continuous tremor in the vent accompanied the eruption and varied significantly in amplitude, frequency and dynamical parameters. We analysed these variations and correlated them with changes in the distribution of earthquakes and in the petrology of the erupting magma. This enabled us to relate variations in tremors to changes in the (i) stress conditions of the plumbing system, (ii) dimensions of the conduit and vent, (iii) intensity of the explosive episodes, and (iv) rheological changes in the erupting magma. The results obtained show how the tremor signal was strongly influenced by stress changes in the host rock and in the rheological variations in the erupting magma. We conclude that the tracking of real-time syn-eruptive tremor signals via the observation of variations in plumbing systems and magma physics is a potentially effective tool for interpreting eruption dynamics, and suggest that similar variations observed in pre-eruptive tremors will have a similar origin.

AB  - Cumulic paleosois in core from the Lower Permian (Asselian-Sakmarian) Council Grove Group of western Kansas contain a diverse suite of pedogenic features, including carbonate nodules, gleying, fossil burrows, rhizoliths, peds, and cutans. Abundant gleying, burrowing by organisms with a high soil-moisture requirement, and extensive plant growth are evidence of at least intermittently high soil moisture during this time. Paleosol character was strongly influenced by regional topography and paleogeographic position, as well as the climate changes accompanying hierarchical glacioeustatic cycles. The distribution of pedogenic features across formations also indicates a shift toward more humid conditions during a larger 3rd-order regression.
   Climatic variability during the interval of soil formation resulted in overprinting and close stratigraphic juxtaposition of both humid and arid climate indicators. Variability is likely the result of exposure to multiple 5th-order eustatic and climatic cycles during the lowstands of 4th-order cycles. Fifth-order cycles are expressed as lithologic changes in stratigraphically equivalent outcrops across the state, but lack of accommodation space prevented cycles from being expressed as differing lithologies in the study area. Biologic activity assisted in consolidation and stabilization of eolian and alluvially deposited sediments.
   This study emphasizes that detailed, quantitative study of pedogenic features can reveal important paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental information in otherwise lithologically similar paleosols. Close juxtaposition of opposing climatic indicators over intervals of known sea-level change adds. evidence to the hypothesis of a link between sea-level change and climate change in the Early Permian. Pedogenic features thus support a semiarid or wetter climate for the midcontinent during the Early Permian.

AB  - In Malaysia, the endemic level of dengue fever (DF) has already changed morbidity indicators, and the magnitude of these incidences in the last few years has surpassed the incidences of all other diseases of compulsory notification. The reasons for the dramatic emergence of DF are complex and not well understood. There are many factors that contribute to the epidemiological conditions that favour viral transmission by the main mosquito vector. This study, therefore, is filling this gap by analysing the impact of dengue incidence at a local (Subang Jaya) scale using environmental factors. Meteorological data and land-use pattern were consolidated using geographic information system (GIS) and its components as an analytical tool. We have shown that weather variables (relative humidity, temperature and precipitation) have significant correlation with DF incidence with seasonal variation. Besides land-use pattern, DF incidence shows the higher distribution in the residential area, followed by commercial and industrial area. This is due to the higher population density in residential area as well as favourable places for the breeding of dengue-carrying Aedes mosquitos created by humans in the residential area, especially one-storey houses. The analysis on the trends of DF incidence towards various housing types indicate that most of the victims' houses fall into interconnection houses and mixed houses types compared to the independent houses area. The outcome driven from this analysis suggested that each character of the environmental factors has their own risk towards dengue incidence. In line with that, it is possible to develop a dynamic model of DF transmission using the knowledge produced by this comprehensive time series data and the results provided by the different analyses.

AB  - Past vegetation change and the influence of climate change and anthropogenic pressure during the Holocene is constructed from a series of palynological records sampled from three locations within the territory of the antique site of Sagalassos. The disappearance of the original deciduous oak woodlands and increases in anthropogenic indicator species around 5300 and 4300 b.c. correspond with an increase in settlements in the region. A period of drought following the deforestation may have hampered the recovery of deciduous oak. The timing of the onset of the BeyAYehir Occupation Phase (BO-Phase) in the territory differs between locations, estimates ranging from ca. 1000-800 b.c. to the start of the Hellenistic period (334 b.c.). The most intense period of arboriculture coincides with the Roman and late-Roman periods. Increases in human pressure on the landscape as reflected in the pollen record correspond with an increased rate of sedimentation and fire activity. The timing of the end of the BO-Phase again differs between locations. Estimates range from the 4th century a.d. to the mid 7th century a.d., when a region-wide shift to dry environmental conditions is observed. Numerical analyses show that post BO-Phase vegetation change is largely driven by climate and displays a succession of dry and wet periods that coincided with well-defined European climate shifts, including the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age. Current agricultural activities in the region are of a very recent (20th century) origin.

AB  - Toxic cyanobacteria threaten the water quality of drinking water sources across the globe. Two such water bodies in Canada (a reservoir on the Yamaska River and a bay of Lake Champlain in Quebec) were monitored using a YSI 6600 V2-4 (YSI, Yellow Springs, Ohio, USA) submersible multi-probe measuring in vivo phycocyanin (PC) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) fluorescence, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, temperature, and turbidity in parallel. The linearity of the in vivo fluorescence PC and Chl-a probe measurements were validated in the laboratory with Microcystis aeruginosa (r(2) = 0.96 and r(2) = 0.82 respectively). Under environmental conditions, in vivo PC fluorescence was strongly correlated with extracted PC (r = 0.79) while in vivo Chl-a fluorescence had a weaker relationship with extracted Chl-a (r = 0.23). Multiple regression analysis revealed significant correlations between extracted Chl-a, extracted PC and cyanobacterial biovolume and in vivo fluorescence parameters measured by the sensors (i.e. turbidity and pH). This information will help water authorities select the in vivo parameters that are the most useful indicators for monitoring cyanobacteria. Despite highly toxic cyanobacterial bloom development 10 m from the drinking water treatment plant's (DWTP) intake on several sampling dates, low in vivo PC fluorescence, cyanobacterial biovolume, and microcystin concentrations were detected in the plant's untreated water. The reservoir's hydrodynamics appear to have prevented the transport of toxins and cells into the DWTP which would have deteriorated the water quality. The multi-probe readings and toxin analyses provided critical evidence that the DWTP's untreated water was unaffected by the toxic cyanobacterial blooms present in its source water.

AB  - Numerous antimicrobial interventions are capable of reducing the prevalence of harmful bacteria on raw meat products. There is a need to identify effective and inexpensive antimicrobial interventions that could, in practice, be used in very small meat plants because of limited financial, space, and labor resources. Eight antimicrobial compounds (acetic acid, citric acid, lactic acid, peroxyacetic acid, acidified sodium chlorite, chlorine dioxide, sodium hypochlorite, and aqueous ozone) were applied at various concentrations with small, hand-held spraying equipment, and bactericidal effectiveness was examined. Beef plate pieces were inoculated with fecal slurry containing a pathogen cocktail (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, Campylobacter coli, and Campylobacter jejuni) and natural populations of aerobic plate counts, coliforms, and E. coli. Antimicrobial solutions were applied to beef surfaces via a portable, pressurized hand-held spray tank, and treated surfaces were subjected to appropriate methods for the enumeration and isolation of pathogens and hygiene indicators. Relative antimicrobial effectiveness was determined (from greatest to least): (i) organic acids, (ii) peroxyacetic acid, (iii) chlorinated compounds, and (iv) aqueous ozone. Using the equipment described, a 2% lactic acid rinse provided 3.5- to 6.4-log CFU/cm(2) reductions across all bacterial populations studied. Conversely, aqueous ozone yielded 0.02- to 2.9-log CFU/cm(2) reductions in pathogens and hygiene indicators, and did not differ significantly from a control tap water rinse (P = 0.055 to 0.731). This 2% lactic acid rinse will be subsequently combined with a previously described water wash to create a multistep antimicrobial intervention that will be examined under laboratory conditions and validated in very small meat plants.

AB  - The fission track technique is a sensitive detection method for particles which contain radio-nuclides like (235)U or (239)PU. However, when the sample is a mixture of plutonium and uranium, discrimination between uranium particles and plutonium particles is difficult using this technique. In this study, we developed a method for detecting plutonium particles in a sample mixture of plutonium and uranium particles using alpha track and fission track techniques. The specific radioactivity (Bq/g) for alpha decay of plutonium is several orders of magnitude higher than that of uranium, indicating that the formation of the alpha track due to alpha decay of uranium can be disregarded under suitable conditions. While alpha tracks in addition to fission tracks were detected in a plutonium particle, only fission tracks were detected in a uranium particle, thereby making the alpha tracks an indicator for detecting particles containing plutonium. In addition, it was confirmed that there is a linear relationship between the numbers of alpha tracks produced by plutonium particles made of plutonium certified standard material and the ion intensities of the various plutonium isotopes measured by thermo-ionization mass spectrometry. Using this correlation, the accuracy in isotope ratios, signal intensity and measurement errors is presumable from the number of alpha tracks prior to the isotope ratio measurements by thermal ionization mass spectrometry. It is expected that this method will become an effective tool for plutonium particle analysis. The particles used in this study had sizes between 0.3 and 2.0 mu m. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The quality of gilthead sea bream from distinct production systems and geographical locations in Southern Europe was evaluated to differentiate aquaculture products from extensive, integrated and semi-intensive systems from the ones produced intensively. This work analysed the external appearance of fish, yields after filleting as well as nutritional, sensory and histological characteristics of the muscle. The results showed that the yellow-golden line between eyes and the shiny red spot on the gill cover can be important and easy criteria to discriminate aquaculture products. Trimming losses are higher in fish from intensive systems. Lipid content of fish from extensive systems was significantly lower than values observed for fish reared intensively. Samples from the integrated and extensive systems showed the best n-3/n-6 ratio, contrarily to intensive systems, but it is difficult to establish clear quality markers to differentiate gilthead sea bream according to the rearing system. Regarding sensory characteristics, the sea bream flesh from intensive systems seems firmer and denser, having smaller white fibres and higher density of fibres in the dorsal muscle. The taste and odour of fatty fish was less strong in fish reared in non-intensive conditions, but extensive rearing in earthen pond is more propitious to the development of certain characteristics related to the environment.

AB  - Comet assay under neutral conditions allows detection of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which has consequence to genome instability and carcinogenesis. The present study aims to validate the neutral Comet assay for genotoxicity assessment in Drosophila melanogaster (Oregon R+) with three well known DSBs inducers i.e. cyclophosphamide (CP), bleomycin (BLM), cisplatin (CPT) and subsequently its efficacy in detecting DSBs in the organism exposed to a well known environmental chemical, chromium [Cr(VI)]. Third instar larvae of D. melanogaster were fed different concentrations of BLM. CPT and CP (50.0-200.0 mu g/ml) or Cr(VI) (5.0-20.0 mu g/ml) mixed standard Drosophila food for 48 h. Neutral Comet assay was performed in cells of mid gut and brain from control and treated larvae. Our results show a dose-dependent increase in the migration of DNA in cells of the exposed organisms. A comparison among DNA lesions per mole number of the test chemical in the exposed groups showed that both BLM and CPT induce more DSBs than CP. Interestingly, Cr(VI) at 20.0 mu g/ml was found to induce significantly increased (p < 0.001) DSBs in the exposed organism as compared to the control. The study while validating neutral Comet assay in D. melanogaster suggests its use for in vivo assessment of environmental chemical induced DSBs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The strengthening of spatial database infrastructures, further promoted by the INSPIRE Directive adopted in 2007, has led to an increased use of spatial data in planning and decision-making. Given that land-use plans are intrinsically spatial, such evidence and approaches can significantly benefit plan-making. A spatial framework could especially support the specific Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) aspects of the plan-making process. Spatial tools such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are particularly well-placed to support the environmental integration sought in SEA by providing evidence through the spatial assessment of multiple environmental datasets. Moreover, GIS bring the opportunity to augment conventional assessment techniques (e.g. matrix-based assessments) by acting as visual mediators of spatial knowledge and by providing an effective tool for the spatial and temporal analysis of environmental impacts.
   This paper presents a GIS-based approach to SEA (GISEA), and analyses the above premise by evaluating the barriers, limitations, opportunities and benefits of its implementation. The GISEA approach has been applied to seven development plans of differing scales in the Republic of Ireland. The results of the case studies revealed that current issues in SEA (e.g. restricted time-frames and institutional arrangements) condition the implementation of a GIS-based approach. Moreover. GIS expertise, data accessibility and quality remain limiting factors to an effective GIS application in SEA. However, the results also confirmed that GIS have the potential to increase the objectivity and accuracy of the assessment, enhance both the understanding of environmental and planning considerations and the delivery of information, and, therefore, help to improve the effectiveness of SEA practice.

AB  - We examined the effect of Phalaris aquatica L. cv. Sardinia on populations of Chloris truncata R. Br. (Poaceae) and Trifolium subterraneum L. (Fabaceae) under laboratory conditions to assess interspecific allelopathy and, on P. aquatica, to assess intraspecific allelopathy (autotoxicity). A population-ecological pilot study measured the abundance and morphometrics of Medicago trunculata that occurred in association with populations of P. aquatica. We found the abundance of M. trunculata was reduced in the presence of P. aquatica litter; lengths of shoots of M. trunculata were enhanced, but those of roots remained unaffected. Previous laboratory-based studies on P. aquatica allelopathy utilized >10% extracts in bioassays on different leguminous taxa; therefore in the present study we attempted to assess the allelopathic potential of P. aquatica with <10% extracts (0-2.5% in 0.5% increments), to determine the optimal rate of concentration at which the allelochemicals became either inhibitory or stimulatory. Six concentrations (0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5%) of aqueous extracts of P. aquatica were applied to seeds of C. truncata, T. subterraneum, and P. aquatica. Germination of C. truncata, T subterraneum, and P. aquatica was observed for eight days and lengths of radicles were measured as an indicator of growth. Assessment of the allelopathic potential tested with aqueous extracts of P. aquatica on seeds of C. truncata and T. subterraneum neither inhibited germination nor impacted on radicle lengths. However, P. aquatica exhibited autotoxicity by inhibiting radicle growth, although not that of germination. Phalaris aquatica water extracts were subjected to high-performance-liquid-chromatographic analysis revealing gramine. Gramine, known to be allelopathic in other grasses, could be a potential allelopathic agent in this taxon.

AB  - In animals with complex life cycles, the quality of juveniles environments is important in shaping the longer-term fitness of individuals. Larval density is a major factor governing quality of larval environments in amphibians, with high densities leading to reduced growth rates, smaller size at metamorphosis, and potentially long-lasting postmetamorphic effects. A little-studied effect of larval density is its impact on physiological stress of postmetamorphic individuals. We used a hematological approach, involving counts of specific white blood cells types (neutrophils and lymphocytes) that covary with corticosterone, to estimate stress levels in recently metamorphosed spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) that were reared in three different larval densities in outdoor mesocosms. In replicated treatments consisting of 12, 25, or 50 larvae, survival was, as expected, lowest and size at metamorphosis smallest in the highest density mesocosms. In addition, surviving salamanders from high-density treatments had significantly higher neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios, indicative of high levels of stress hormones (corticosterone). This trend was not a result of density-related differences in body condition as these did not vary with density. Further, estimated stress levels were similar regardless of whether the salamanders metamorphosed early or late, suggesting that the density effect on stress is long-lasting even once realized density has been reduced through mortality or early metamorphosis. These results may be important in understanding amphibian population dynamics, since research on other vertebrate taxa demonstrates that high hematological stress indicators lead to reduced growth, survival, and increased disease susceptibility in vertebrate animals.

AB  - In case of an avian-influenza-derived human flu pandemic, an inordinately high use of medicines over several weeks is predicted. in particular for the recommended influenza antiviral oseltamivir (Tamiflu). While the risk of oseltamivir to sewage works and freshwater bodies has already been assessed, the fact that a large percentage of the human population worldwide lives relatively close to the sea raises concern for its environmental compatibility in coastal marine waters. The potential risk of high oseltamivir use to the marine compartment is assessed in this publication, based on the 2003 European Community Technical Guidance Document (TGD) for risk assessment. Subchronic embryo-larval ecotoxicity tests with three marine invertebrates (Pomatoceros triqueter, Annelida; Mytilus edulis. Mollusca: Paracentrotus lividus, Echinodermata) and chronic growth inhibition tests with two different groups of marine microalgae (Isochrysis galbana, Haptophyta; Skeletonema costatum. Heterokontophyta) were performed with the active substance oseltamivir carboxylic acid to derive a dependable marine predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC). This was compared to a predicted environmental concentration (PEC) for oseltamivir in coastal waters, based on the worst-case freshwater PEC. The PEC/PNEC risk characterisation ratio for the marine compartment is well below 1, which in the terminology of the TGD signifies no immediate concern. Further, while oseltamivir may be persistent (P), it is not bioaccumulative (B) nor highly ecotoxic (T) and therefore not a PBT substance. In conclusion, even a high pandemic use of oseltamivir would not lead to a significant risk for the marine compartment, in confirmation of the risk assessment for sewage works and freshwaters.

Tolerance to freezing was tested in 21 chytrids isolated from cropping and undisturbed soils in temperate Australia. Samples of thalli grown on peptone-yeast-glucose (PYG) agar were incubated for seven days at -15 degrees C. Recovery of growth after thawing and transferring to fresh medium at 20 degrees C indicated survival. All isolates in the Blastocladiales and Spizellomycetales survived freezing in all tests. All isolates in the Chytridiales also survived freezing in some tests. None of the isolates in the Rhizophydiales survived freezing in any of the tests. However some isolates in the Rhizophydiales recovered growth after freezing, if they were grown on PYG agar supplemented with either 1 % sodium chloride or I % glycerol prior to freezing. After freezing, the morphology of the thalli of all isolates was observed under LM. in those isolates that recovered growth after transfer to fresh media, mature zoosporangia were observed in the monocentric isolates and resistant sporangia or resting spores in the polycentric isolates. Encysted zoospores in some monocentric isolates also survived freezing. In some of the experiments the freezing and thawing process caused visible structural damage to the thalli. The production of zoospores after freezing and thawing was also used as an indicator of freeze tolerance. The chytrids in this study responded differently to freezing. These data add significantly to our limited knowledge of freeze tolerance in chytrids but leave many questions unanswered. (c) 2008 The British Mycological Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We report on the first Health Impact Assessment (HIA) for proposed oil and gas development in Alaska's North Slope region. Public health is not generally analyzed in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) process in the U.S. We conducted an HIA for proposed oil development within the National Petroleum Reserve - Alaska in response to growing concerns among North Slope Inupiat communities regarding the potential impacts of regional industrial expansion on their health and culture. We employed a qualitative HIA methodology, involving a combination of stakeholder input, literature review, and qualitative analysis, through which we identified potential health effects. The possible health outcomes identified include increases in diabetes and related metabolic conditions as a result of dietary change; rising rates of substance abuse, domestic violence, and suicide; increased injury rates; more frequent asthma exacerbations; and increased exposure to organic pollutant, including carcinogens and endocrine disruptors. There are also potential benefits, including funding for infrastructure and health care; increased employment and income; and continued funding of existing infrastructure. Based on these findings, we recommend a series of public health mitigation measures. This project represents the first formal effort to include a systematic assessment of public health within the U.S. EIS process. The inclusion of public health concerns within an EIS may offer an important and underutilized avenue through which to argue for environmental management strategies that focus on public health, and may offer communities a stronger voice in the EIS process.

AB  - Financially, mastitis is one of the most important diseases affecting dairy cattle in the United Kingdom. Seven commercial farms were monitored over a 2.5 year period and data from 1040 cows were included in a study that examined both straw yard and cubicle housing systems. The influence of genetic merit for milk production (PIN95 and PTA(f+p)) on somatic cell counts (SCC) as an indicator of mastitis under commercial farm conditions was assessed. The mean genetic potential (PIN95) pound was 39.0 ( +/- 0.80) and the mean 305-day milk yield (kg) was 7980 ( +/- 54.2). In all, 5618 monthly records of SCC and 1040 records of 305-day SCC were included in the analysis. A multiple regression model was used to assess the influence of genetic merit and the level of concentrate intake on SCC (the log(10) transformation was used) under the two housing systems.
   Significant interactions between genetic merit and housing system, and concentrate intake and housing system were found. Log(10) SCC increased with genetic merit when cows were housed in straw yard accommodation, but decreased when cows were housed in cubicle accommodation. The increase in SCC with concentrate feeding was higher for straw yards. For parity 2 animals, there was a significant positive correlation between PIN95 and SCC (r(p) = 0.184, P = 0.003) but the correlations between 305-day milk production and SCC were negative for animals greater than parity 2.

AB  - Changes in the soil microbial community structure and cellulolytic activity may reflect the effects of different amendment or management strategies. In this study, cellulolytic activity dynamics and microbial community structure in an agricultural soil undergoing treatment-induced cellulose decomposition in response to two commercial biofertilizers (G and Y) were investigated under laboratory conditions. The rate of weight loss among filter paper strips buried in G-treated soil was significantly higher than in untreated control soil (R), while that in Y-treated soil lower. A significant shift in the PCR-temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-TGGE) fingerprints of fungal community members was observed during the process, while no dramatic changes were observed in the bacterial community structure. The ITS3-4 sequence of one predominant TGGE band in a sample from G-amended soil during the peak of cellulose decomposition was most similar to that of a wood-decaying species Meruliporia incrassata. Fungal species composition of the same sample was analyzed by clone library profiling and was found to differ significantly from that of its parallel control sample. Several operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in a G-amended soil sample, including the species represented by the predominant TGGE band, were suggested to be cellulose decomposing fungal species. The data of this study demonstrate that structural shifts in the soil fungal community for cellulose degradation represent a meaningful ecological indicator of the consequences of soil amendments with biofertilizers.

AB  - Because Salmonella spp. can be spread from the production environment to the consumer, strategies are required to control Salmonella. One such intervention involves control of the distribution of the organism in poultry litter. In this regard, we have attempted to determine whether Salmonella spp. are uniformly distributed throughout the litter of commercial poultry houses, or if they are unevenly localized to "hot spots" associated with high surface litter water activity (A(w)) and high total moisture levels.
   Of the 86 houses sampled, 48 (55.8%) were positive for Salmonella spp. using a combination of the drag swab and targeted litter culturing methods. Data are presented that show that elevated A(w) and percentage moisture content values representative of targeted litter samples or whole-house moisture status are not statistically predictive of Salmonella contamination, using either drag swab or targeted litter culture results as indicators of contamination. This study suggests that favorable environmental conditions for the growth of Salmonella are unequally dispersed in poultry houses. Because there is not equivalent distribution of salmonella in the surface litter, the drag swab technique is apparently necessary to adequately survey for Salmonella spp. contamination. The findings further suggest that the development of a methodology to detect areas within houses that possess risk factors favorable for Salmonella growth must also include elevated A(w) and percentage moisture content levels. This capability may enable a grower to detect and intervene in these targeted areas with neutralizing procedures, agents, or other substances to provide significant reduction of Salmonella or other poultry-associated food-borne pathogens.

AB  - Results from experimental trials and on-farm surveys have suggested that organic farm management is associated with positively enhanced soil physical, chemical and biological characteristics. To test this hypothesis more rigorously, 30 paired organic and conventional farms were assessed across a range of soil types and management regimes in the south of England. The 60 paired farms ranged from grassland to horticultural/arable and purely arable. The soils of all chosen farms were measured for a wide range of physical and chemical characteristics. The data were subjected to a multivariate analysis and the results interpreted so as to identify the management factors deemed beneficial for topsoil physical and nutritional conditions.
   The results showed that farm types could be most effectively characterized by organic matter, aggregate stability, humic acid, infra-red absorbance and pH and that these differentiated organically and conventionally managed arable and horticultural farms. Pasture farms showed no significant differences between organic and conventional management. Conventional horticultural farms showed the lowest values for soil organic matter, aggregate stability, cation exchange capacity and E-4/E-6 ratio. Organic horticultural farms had the highest mean humic acid content, infra-red absorbance, air capacity and available water capacity. Infra-red absorbance values showed a clear age trend for humic acid, with older humic acids seen For pasture farms. Management factors deemed most important in differentiating between conventional and organic management included frequent farmyard manure applications to horticultural land and the inclusion of grass leys in arable rotations. Some of the soil measurements are suggested as potentially effective indicators of sustainability for farm systems.

AB  - Measurements of urban air quality at monitoring stations in developed countries have frequently involved the criteria gaseous pollutants, particulates, hazardous air pollutants, perceived air quality and relevant meteorological conditions. Large numbers of indicators have therefore been established to quantify emissions, concentrations and environmental and human health impacts of each of these groups of substances. To simplify the data for management, several indicators have been grouped together to form urban air quality indices but the weightings of individual variables is contentious.
   In industrialising and developing countries, data may be limited and traditional air pollutant indicators cannot often be constructed. The emphasis therefore has to be placed on the development of policy-relevant indicators, such as Response Indicators that reflect different policy principles for regulating air pollutant emissions. Indices that quantify the air quality manage ment capabilities and capacities at the city level provide further useful decision-relevant tools. Four sets of indices, namely, 1. air quality measurement capacity, 2. data assessment and availability, 3. emissions estimates, and 4. management enabling capabilities, and a composite index to evaluate air quality management capability, were constructed and applied to 80 cities. The indices revealed that management capability varied widely between the cities. In some of the cities, existing national knowledge on urban air quality could have been more effectively used for management.
   It was concluded that for effective urban air quality management, a greater emphasis should be given, not just to monitoring and data capture programmes, but to the development of indicators and indices that empower decision-makers to initiate management response strategies. Over-reliance on restricted, predetermined sets of traditional air quality indicators should be avoided.

AB  - A set of 102 tooth and bone samples of Pleistocene age (32,600-13,300 yr BP) belonging to the species Cervus elaphus, Bos primigenius and Equus caballus and coming from the Paglicci cave (Southern Italy) was studied for the carbon (delta(13)C) and nitrogen (delta(15)N) isotopic composition of bone and dentine collagen and for the carbon(delta(13)C(c)) isotopic composition of tooth enamel carbonate. The amount of collagen extracted from bone and tooth samples (mg/g) was rather variable, representing approximately only 0.5-15% of the collagen present in a fresh bone. However, the loss of an important fraction of the original collagen during diagenesis did not change the in vivo isotopic composition. In general, when the delta(13)C of both collagen and carbonate and the delta(15)N of collagen obtained from each level for the three species are compared, wild ox shows the most increased values, deer the most decreased values and horse shows intermediate results. These differences are probably related to distinct diets or to differences in their physiological behaviour. However, the isotopic results suggest that the three species considered lived in an open environment with a diet based on C-3 plants. The stratigraphic sequence of light and heavy nitrogen isotope values between 19,000 and 15,000 may be related to shifts from arid to humid conditions, while the overall trend shown by delta(13)C toward lighter values may be related to a progressive development of a forest habitat.

AB  - Under resting conditions, steady-state [Ca] in agonist-sensitive Ca stores reflects a balance between active uptake (usually mediated by a thapsigargin-sensitive Ca-ATPase of the SERCA family) and passive efflux of Ca. Even though this pump-leak cycle appears to be a common property of Ca-storing organelles, little is known about the nature of the leak pathway, Ca homeostasis in thapsigargin-sensitive internal Ca stores of single permeabilized BHK-21 fibroblasts was examined using digital image processing of compartmentalized mag-fura-2 (a low-affinity Ca indicator), It is shown here that the leak of Ca from internal stores is regulated specifically by the cytosolic ATP concentration, The rate of leak was 3.6 times slower in 0.375 mM [ATP] than in 4 mM [ATP] (Na or Mg salt), These effects were observed in the presence of 0 Ca/EGTA, thapsigargin, heparin, and ruthenium red, and therefore appear to be independent of the Ca-ATPase, the InsP(3) receptor and the ryanodine receptor, The ATP-stimulated leak was seen in a variety of cell types, including rat basophilic leukemia cells and mouse pancreatic acinar cells, Other nucleotides (ADP, GTP, CTP, and UTP) and nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs (AMP-PNP and ATP gamma S) did not reproduce the action of ATP, Changes in cellular metabolism and ensuing alterations in [ATP] will be expected to influence the filling state of internal Ca stores through effects on the passive leak pathway, potentially leading to modulation of Ca signaling and organellar function.

AB  - The influence of kairomonal baits, containing cucurbitacins, blossom volatiles, and carbaryl, on Diabroticite adult survivorship and trophic interactions with cucurbits was examined.  Enrichment of cantaloupes using rubidium (Rb) was developed for monitoring trophic interactions.  A soil-soak method was developed to enrich plant Rb concentrations.  Beetle uptake of Rb followed a rectangular hyperbola and elimination after transfer to clean plants followed an exponential decay.  Models showed beetle uptake occurred within 1 h and the mark is retained up to 2 wk.  Naturally occurring endogenous Rb concentrations in beetles varied with species and sex.  Baselines were established to allow determination of the incidence and intensity of beetle feeding on Rb-enriched plants.  In field cages, kairomonal baits reduced the probability and intensity of feeding on cucurbits by Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardii (Barber) and Acalymma vittata (F.).  In one trial, kairomonal baits totally blocked feeding interactions.  In field plots, baits also significantly reduced feeding incidence and intensity in D. u. howardii and D. virgifera virgifera (LeConte), but not in A. vittata.  Where the bait reduced feeding, males showed less reduction than females.  In D. v. virgifera, there was a higher probability of capturing live males than females regardless of kairomonal treatment.  Adult survivorship was reduced by the kairomonal bait in both field and cage experiments.  These novel methods allow the monitoring of trophic interactions under field conditions in the presence of behavior-modifying semiochemicals.  Hypotheses to explain variation among species and sex and implications of using kairomonal baits to manage vectoring of a pathogen are discussed.

AB  - Scientifically revealing the spatiotemporal patterns of cultivated land quality (CLQ) is crucial for increasing food production and achieving United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2: Zero Hunger. Although studies on the evaluation of CLQ have been conducted, an effective evaluation system that is suitable for the macro-regional scale has not yet been developed. In this study, we first defined the CLQ from four aspects: soil fertility, natural conditions, construction level, and cultivated land productivity. Then, eight indicators were selected by integrating multi-source remote sensing data to create a new CLQ evaluation system. We assessed the spatiotemporal patterns of CLQ in Guangzhou, China, from 2010 to 2018. In addition, we identified the main factors affecting the improvement of CLQ. The results showed that the CLQ continuously improved in Guangzhou from 2010 to 2018. The area of high-quality cultivated land increased by 13.7%, which was mainly distributed in the traditional agricultural areas in the northern and eastern regions of Guangzhou. The areas of medium- and low-quality cultivated land decreased by 8.1% and 5.6%, respectively, which were scattered throughout the whole study area. The soil fertility and high productivity capacity were the main obstacle factors that affected the improvement of CLQ. Simultaneously, the obstacle degree of stable productivity capacity gradually increased during the study period. Therefore, the targeted improvement measures could be put forward by applying biofertilizers, strengthening crop management and constructing well-facilitated farmland. The new CLQ evaluation system we proposed is particularly practical at the macro-regional scale, and the results provided targeted guidance for decision makers to improve CLQ and promote food security.

AB  - Drainage basins act as indicators of geomorphic information for hydrogeological and sustainable natural resources development. Concerning the impacts of short-duration excessive downpour and flash floods worldwide, management strategies for such analysis accordingly assume a paramount importance. Understanding drainage characteristics of watersheds for stability and gradual release of waters downstream is imperative to recognize their linkage to erosion and flash flood processes. This study proposed an empirical and semiquantitative method for determining an index referred herein as erosion and flash flood susceptibility index for 18 major stream drainage areas of the Jhelum River Basin (JRB) of Kashmir Himalaya, India. The index was employed to assess and prioritize stream watersheds, considering statistically driven weightage-based influence of 23 morphometric attributes and 10 slope categories which govern the erosion and flash floods of these watersheds. Results demonstrated that about 83% of the JRB, encompassing 12 stream watersheds, fall under high- to moderate-priority classes and thereby contribute to frequent flooding and erosion in the eventuality of heavy downpours. The new index provided in this research would help in better understanding stream watershed conditions and deliver recommendations for watershed management authorities in regions deficient in hydrometric and erosion yield datasets. The present work further would support the regions to accomplish various sustainable development goals after implementing the management procedures. The findings arising out of this study will provide tangible inputs for watershed management authorities in the region typically characterized as deficient in hydrometric and erosion yield datasets.

AB  - The response of the Maroon reservoir in southwest Iran is modeled to evaluate possible impacts of 21st century climate change. Projections of 3 CMIP5 General Circulation Models (GCMs) were investigated using 2 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), which respectively represent low/medium and high greenhouse gas emission scenarios. The raw GCM projections are statistically bias-corrected to provide boundary conditions for the 3-dimensional Aquatic Ecosystem Model (AEM3D). A new overturn bias analysis method was developed to evaluate possible bias in the GCM predictors during the observational (historic) period and determined it to be negligible. The modeling results, quantified by the analysis of various limnological parameters (onset and length of mixing and stratification periods, hypolimnion and epilimnion thickness and temperature, Brunt-Vaisala frequency, and Schmidt stability) indicate for RCP4.5 a continuous reduction in winter mixing and complete suppression of mixing by the end of the 21st century, implying a switch from monomictic to weakly oligomictic behavior. Under RCP8.5, the behavior transition occurs abruptly in the late 2050s in the form of a tipping point, followed by intermittent oligomictic behavior and transition to permanent stratification (thermal meromixis) within a decade. The change in behavior occurs because the surface and mixing temperatures significantly increase due to climate warming, whereas the hypolimnion is less affected, partly because of milder warming of cold winter river inflows (underflow) and strengthening stratification. The climate change-induced tipping point for the thermal regime of Maroon reservoir might serve as an indicator of changes in other warm monomictic systems.

AB  - Medical oxygen is the key to survival for COVID-19 patients. To meet the pandemic-driven oxygen demand spike, local hospitals began searching for a suitable medical oxygen delivery system. Among the studies published on the impact of COVID-19 on a range of aspects, including the global economy and the environment, no study has been conducted on the environmental impact of medical oxygen supply to hospitals under epidemic conditions.
   In this paper the authors perform a comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to evaluate the environmental and economic impact of three scenarios (oxygen cylinders, liquid oxygen in tanks and on-site oxygen production) of local oxygen supply to hospitals in Poland. The LCA was performed according to ISO 14040 -14044 standards requirements, using the SimaPro 9.0 software. Results from the analysis showed that the Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Fine Particulate Matter Formation Potential (FPMFP) indicators for the liquid oxygen in tank scenario are the lowest and equal 265 kg CO2 eq and 0.309 kg PM2.5 eq. respectively. The greatest terrestrial acidification reductions (-1.38 kg SO2 eq) can be achieved when applying the on-site oxygen production scenario. Our findings revealed that the oxygen in cylinders scenario has the most harmful impact on the environment. The economic analysis was performed in order to compare the monthly and annual operational costs of analysed scenarios. The results show that hospitals sustain the lowest annual costs when using the on-site oxygen production scenario. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Polymeric ion-exchange membranes have come a long way since their invention, benefiting a wide range of processes, ranging from desalination to fuel cells. However, challenges such as alkaline stability, monovalent ion selectivity, cost-effectivity, and process sustainability largely persist. This work showcases alkaline stable anion-exchange membranes made by hot-pressing of a polyelectrolyte complex of poly (styrenesulfonate) (PSS) and poly(diallyldimethylammonium) (PDADMA). This completely aqueous production approach leads to especially dense (non-porous) saloplastic films with an excess of cationic groups, demonstrating good stability even at high salinities (up to 2 M NaCl). On key performance indicators for anion exchange membranes, such as water uptake (similar to 40%), permselectivity (up to 97%), ion exchange capacity (1.01 mmol g(-1)), and resistance (2.3 O.cm(2)) the membranes show comparable values to commercial membranes. A drop in permselectivity at high salinities, however, indicates that the charge density of the membranes could be further improved. Still, what really sets these membranes apart is their natural long term (up to 60 days) stability at extreme acidic (pH 0) and alkaline conditions (pH 14) and a relevant monovalent selectivity of up to 6.3 for Cl- over SO42-. Overall this work showcases PDADMA/PSS based saloplastics as highly promising and stable anion-exchange membranes, that can be produced by a simple, scalable, and sustainable approach.

AB  - Characterising deformable substrates of modern and past ice sheets is a key factor in understanding ice mass behaviour and dynamics. This is challenging when field-scale signatures of deformation in soft sedimentary beds areweakly developed or absent. To overcome these difficulties, in this study, we combinemicro- and macroscale studies and quantitative analyses to decipher the nature of subglacial sediment deformation under a Pleistocene fast-flowing (streaming) ice sheet. We investigated a complex sedimentary succession at Nieszawa in north-central Poland. A multi-proxy approach involving till micromorphology in thin sections, ripple-cross lamination orientation, till fabric, clast microfabric and the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) data in a closely sampled vertical profile throughout the fluvial sand and tillwas used to reveal subglacial bed deformationmechanismsand kinematics. This records subglacial deformation of the sedimentary succession at Nieszawa under low basal shear stresses, where simple shear was the dominant bed deformation mechanism. Intergranular advection, decoupling at the ice-bed interface related to high subglacialwater pressure, clast ploughing, and basal sliding also took place. The main finding of this study is that AMS reveals the shear strain development and ice flow direction in the structurally and texturally complex deposits underweak coupling conditions at the ice-bed interface beneath a fast flowing/streaming ice sheet, where strain and kinematic indicators other than AMS fabrics are vague or absent.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to understand and discuss the relationships of the thermal environment, morphophysiological response, performance, and carcass traits of Brahman bulls from weaning at 18 months exposed to grazing conditions based on the physiological and evolutionary rationale behind the different proposals for the thermal adaptation of zebu cattle. Fifty-three uncastrated and clinically healthy bulls with birth and weaning weight of 34.0 ? 3.32 kg and 215.5 ? 44.75 kg, respectively, were evaluated. Fifteen canonical correlations were estimated, but only six were significant: thermal environment ? thermoregulatory responses (rc = 0.4635; P = 0.0413); thermal environment ? performance (rc = 0.4338; P = 0.0218); thermoregulatory responses ? performance (rc = 0.5119; P = 0.0071); hair coat characteristics ? performance (rc = 0.4939; P = 0.0273); hormone ? carcass traits (rc = 0.5408; P = 0.0698); and performance ? carcass traits (rc = 0.9644; P < 0.0001). Thermal environment, thermoregulatory responses and hair coat morphology influence of 18.81%, 21.49% and 24.40%, respectively, were found in the performance. We also concluded that (i) rectal temperature (RT) is a homoeothermic indicator; (ii) sweating rate (SR) is an important heat dissipation mechanism to explain the adaptation of zebu animals in the tropics and is related to weight at 550 days (W550); (iii) coat morphology, especially length (HL), diameter (HD) and hair density (ND) are related to animal performance; and (iv) hormonal profile, mainly T4, influences the carcass traits (yield, weight, subcutaneous fat and marble meat).

AB  - Transportation and living conditions are part of horse mode of life, but are itself a stressor often resulting in a reduction in feed intake, body weight gain, and nutrient digestibility. Something more stress factors induces physiological, behavioural, immunological and biochemical changes that directly affect health and well-being. For this reason the aim of this study was to evaluate some haematological, biochemical and hormonal changes, may able used successfully to identify the impact of mode of live on hospitalized horses suffering from degenerative joint disease (DJD) after consumation of herbal tea. Six animals were transported by road for approximate 1 h and accommodated in the Equine Veterinary Hospital of Trakia University, Stara Zagora, Bulgaria. The natural herbal tea (Herbacon GmbH, Berlin, Germany) was administered to three horses by water for drink in dose 10g/100 kg body weight together with standard therapy for osteoarthritis during 2 months. The results of this study confirmed that a linkage between stress and hormons and acute phase responce (APR) exists. In both groups horses Fib increased significantly after road transport and 24 and 48 h of accomadation compared to the previous data points. At the end of the period acute phase proteins, cortisol were insignificantly (P > 0.05) lower in treatmed group (Fb=3.69 0.15; Cortisol=0.93 0.16) with herbal tea in compare with control group (Fb=5.57 0.89; Cortisol=1.07 0.41). Based on the results presented above and considering changes in studied blood parameters which are useful indicators of animal health and welfare, we can recommend the daily use of natural herbal tea.

AB  - The coal gasification wastewater figures prominently among types of industrial effluents due to its complex and phenolic composition, posing great difficulty for conventional water treatment processes. Since the coking wastewater is toxic and mutagenic to humans and animals, treatment of coal gasification wastewater is genuinely necessary. In this study, we established a lab-scale A2O (Anaerobic-Anoxic-Oxic) with moving bed biological reactor (MBBR) system and evaluated some water indicators of wastewater pretreated with internal electrolysis, of wastewater output of the established A2O-MBBR system, and of the wastewater treated by the combination thereof. The wastewater was taken from a coking plant at Thai Nguyen Iron and Steel Joint Stock Company in Vietnam. COD, BOD5, NH4+-N, phenol, and pH of the input coal gasification wastewater were 2359, 1105, 319, 172 mg/L, and 8 +/- 0.1, respectively. The conditions of internal electrolysis were as follows: 720 min of reaction time, pH = 4, 25 g/L Fe-C dosage, and 100 mg/L PAM dosage. After internal electrolysis process, the removal of COD, BOD5, NH4+-N, and phenol were 53.7%, 56.7% 60.5%, and 73.3%, respectively. After 24 h of treatment, the treatment efficiencies of the combined treatment process are as follows: 100% phenol removal, 71.3% of TSS removal; 97.7% reduction of BOD5, and 97.1% reduction of COD; total N content reduced by 97.6%; total P content decreased by 81.6%; and NH4+-N content decreased by 97.5%. All above indicators after treatment have met QCVN 52: 2017/BTNMT (column A) Vietnamese standard for steel industry wastewater.

AB  - The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that the changes in extreme events are expected to be detected earlier than changes in climate averages. Hot temperature extremes in the United States cause important economical, societal, and environmental impacts. Thus, the climatology of hot extremes and heat waves (HWs) merits further examination. Spatiotemporal trends of five extreme temperature indicators were investigated for the period 1948-2017 for the Mississippi River Basin (MRB), which covers approximately 41% of the Contiguous United States. A hot extreme was identified using the 90th percentile threshold and a HW was defined as two or more consecutive hot temperature extreme days. Results suggest that the western, northwestern, southern, and northern parts of the MRB are regions with a growing risk of extreme temperatures with more frequent and longer hot events. Change in the eastern part of the MRB suggests a smaller risk with a general downward trend in HWs.
   Change-point analysis indicates that these climatic data exhibit nonstationarity. A significant increase happened starting in 1994 in the percentage of area with a HW longer than 10 consecutive days. Frequency and length of HWs were greater during El Nino years. However, this finding is not statistically significant. An increase in HW duration and frequency can impact water availability, human and animal health, agriculture and the economy. Results from this study assist in finding hotspots where changing extreme conditions have happened and where society may need to make adjustments related to water use, human outdoor activities and agricultural practices.

AB  - The removal efficiencies (REs) of nineteen pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) (six antibiotics-clarithromycin, ofioxacin, sulfadiazine, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim -, four beta-blockers -atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol and sotalol-, two antihypertensives/diuretics -furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide-, three lipid regulators -bezafibrate, fenofibrate and gemfibrozil-, and four psychiatric medications -carbamazepine, diazepam, lorazepam and paroxetine) were ascertained in a pilot-scale anaerobic/anoxic/aerobic (A(2)O) system treating urban wastewater, long term operated during two experimental phases using different sets of environmental conditions and operating parameters. Illumina MiSeq sequencing was used to investigate the structure, diversity and population dynamics of bacteria, archaea and fungi communities in the activated sludge. The results showed that mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) and food-to-microorganisms ratio (F/M) were operational parameters significantly influencing the REs of five of the analyzed PhACs in the A(2)O system. Biota-environment (BIO-ENV) analysis revealed strong correlations between population shifts of the activated sludge community and the REs of PhACs of the different pharmaceutical families. Increased REs of clarithromycin, furosemide, bezafibrate and gemfibrozil were concomitant to higher relative abundances of bacterial phylotypes classified within the Rhodobacteraceae and Sphingomonadaceae (Alphaproteobacteria), while those of Betaproteobacteria, Chloroflexi and Methanomethylovorans (Euryarchaea) correlated positively with the REs of up to seven PhACs belonging to different therapeutic groups.

AB  - The Late Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods are poorly understood in northeastern Iberia. Most of the information comes from the sepulchral structures rather than habitat settlements. The high number of individuals usually recovered from this types of collective burial spaces, together with the low number of direct radiocarbon dates available on them, forces us to be cautious and consider all the studied assemblages as belonging to the so-called Late Neolithic-Chalcolithic time period. To evaluate human dietary patterns of the Late Neolithic-Chalcolithic populations from the northeast of Iberia, stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis was carried out on 78 humans and 32 faunal bones from Cova de la Guineu (Font-rubi, Barcelona) and Cueva de Abauntz (Arraitz, Navarra), both of them sepulchral sites. Results show a common dietary pattern in both sites, indicating an homogeneous protein diet based on C-3 terrestrial resources and no isotopic evidence of the consumption of C-4 plants. Only one individual from Cueva de Abauntz, who directly dates to the first moments of the use of the cave as a burial place, suggests a different protein intake. The inter-population analysis shows a significant difference between both human and faunal delta C-13 values, suggesting an environmental influence on the isotope values depending on the geographic location. This effect should not be discarded and always assessed with baseline isotopic values in future studies at each area of Iberia and for different chronological moments.

AB  - Indoor Air Pollution (IAP) puts people at greater health risks, as compared to outdoor air pollution. Whenever there is poor ambient air quality, it is advised to stay indoors for maximum hours. But in the Indian context, the studies have shown that even in the indoors, the people can not get away from outdoor pollution. To explore such scenario, this study was carried out in the urban houses at three regionally distinct cities of India viz. Delhi, Imphal and Trivandrum. Fine aerosol concentration was found highest in the Delhi households (196.5 +/- 48 mu g/m(3)), followed by Imphal (173.6 +/- 46 mu g/m(3)) and Trivandrum (69.4 +/- 38 mu g/m(3)). Samples were also collected from different parts of the each house, mainly kitchen, living room and bathrooms, to find out activity-wise differences in aerosol characteristics. Despite having larger sources, kitchens were found to be cleaner as compared to other parts in each site. As the morphology and elemental compositions are potential indicators of sources and transport of the pollutants, SEM-EDX analysis was also performed. Soot, fly-ash, flour dust, crustal materials, secondary and biogenic aerosols are the dominant particles present in indoor aerosols. Different activities in each part of the house, have clearly shown its effect on the elemental composition of aerosols. However, despite keeping the study within the four walls of the houses, the corresponding impact of geographical and meteorological conditions of locations has remained prominent at all the sites.

AB  - This assessment of environmental drivers and phytoplankton community in Kuwait (Arabian Gulf) describes changes in environmental conditions linked to the rapid urbanization over recent decades. To describe these changes, we have analyzed a long-term water quality dataset (1984-2017) and explored potential changes in a sub-set of phytoplankton community data by analyzing 10 years of phytoplankton data available (2007-2016) for Kuwait Bay and the Northern Gulf waters. The longer-term water quality data show that dissolved nutrient concentrations, with the exception of a recent fall in SiO4, have been increasing over 30 years, but with a high degree of variability reflecting the changing rate of inputs from river outflows and point sewage sources. The correlative analysis between the environmental parameters and phytoplankton in the period from 2007 to 2016 shows that the seasonal variability of the phytoplankton are influenced by several co-stressors including higher temperatures, coastal sewage runoff and changing salinity. While the extended nutrient enrichment has changed the trophic state of Kuwait waters, the seasonal and temporal correlations highlight that recent changes in phytoplankton community seem to be responding to cumulative pressures of eutrophication, climate, and salinity changes. The seasonal and temporal changes in the coastal phytoplankton community, responding to co-stressors, present challenges for managers to consider the simultaneous management of local, regional and external pressures. Continued declines in water quality within a system that is influenced by a warming climate can potentially have long-term consequences on the resilience of the Northern Gulf environment.

AB  - No-tillage (NT) systems have arisen as a promising alternative to traditional rice cultivation in flooded soils, such as pre-germinated (PG) and conventional tillage (CT) systems. However, how NT affects soil properties and grain yield is not completely understood, especially over the long term. The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term impact of three tillage systems (CT, NT and PG) on soil chemical, physical and biological attributes and the influence of these attributes on rice yield over time in a lowland soil of the Brazilian subtropical region. The rice grain yield was evaluated for 16 growing seasons, and the soil properties were evaluated from 17 to 21 years after the beginning of the experiment. After 14 growing seasons, rice yield was greater (3.4%) under the NT system compared to under the CT system. The increase in rice yield over time resulted in 67% greater soil organic matter (OM) content, exchangeable Ca and Mg and consequently cation exchange capacity (CEC) under the NT system compared to the CT and PG systems. In addition, soil bulk density and microbial C and N were 15%, 40% and 75% greater, respectively, under the NT system than under the CT system in the surface soil layer. The lack of soil disturbance associated with the high input of crop residues and flooding soil conditions favored the chemical, physical and biological soil properties through soil OM content, improving rice yields after 14 yr of NT adoption in relation to CT adoption.

AB  - The aim of the present research was to evaluate the antimicrobial and bio-preservative capabilities of the selected probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from rice bran sourdough. The survival in the simulated stomach and intestine conditions was used to screen the LAB isolates. Subsequently, the selected LAB isolate was identified by a PCR-based assay, and then the probiotic characteristics of the isolate including auto-aggregation and co-aggregation abilities, haemolytic activity and antibiotic susceptibility profile were determined. After that, the antagonistic effects of the LAB isolate on some foodborne indicator bacteria and fungi and its anti-aflatoxigenic capability were studied. In vivo safety and in vivo anti-Listeria activity of the isolate were also investigated. Due to the results of the sequencing and phylogenetic evolutionary tree, the LAB isolate was identified as Lactobacillus brevis. The isolate had no haemolytic activity, and it showed proper antifungal effects on the tested fungi. Furthermore, the L. brevis isolate had higher (P < 0.05) co-aggregation and antibacterial activities toward L. monocytogenes rather than the other indicator bacteria. Based on the results of the HPLC analysis, anti-aflatoxigenic effect of the isolate on aflatoxin B-1 was higher than the other toxins. No noticeable abnormal behaviors or changes in general health status, growth, blood biochemistry and examined liver enzymes were observed in the mice during a four-week feeding with the L. brevis in comparison with the control. The L. brevis-fed mice significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the numbers of L. monocytogenes in the gastrointestinal tract, visceral organs and faeces as well.

AB  - While the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through spontaneous generation or as the by-products of aerobic metabolism can be toxic to plants, recent findings demonstrate that ROS act as signaling molecules that play a critical role in adapting to various stress conditions. Tight regulation of ROS homeostasis is required to adapt to stress and survive, yet in vivo spatiotemporal information of ROS dynamics are still largely undefined. In order to understand the dynamics of ROS changes and their biological function in adapting to stresses, two quantitative ROS transcription-based bioreporters were developed. These reporters use ROS-responsive promoters from RBOHD or ZAT12 to drive green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. The resulting GFP expression is compared to a constitutively expressed mCherry that is contained on the same cassette with the ROS-responsive promoter: This allows for the generation of ratiometric images comparing ROS changes (GFP) to the constitutively expressed mCherry. Both reporters were used to assess ROS levels to oxidative stress, salt stress, and the pathogen defense elicitor flg22. These bioreporters showed increases in the ratio values of GFP to mCherry signals between 10 and 30min poststress application. Such stress-associated ROS signals correlated with the induction of abiotic/biotic stress responsive markers such as RbohD, ZAT12, SOS2 and PR5 suggesting these ROS bioreporters provide a robust indicator of increased ROS related to stress responses. Based upon the spatiotemporal response patterns of signal increase, ZAT12 promoter-dependent ROS (Zat12p-ROS) bioreporter appears to be suitable for cellular mapping of ROS changes in response to abiotic and biotic stresses.

AB  - The water reservoirs created by dams and used for public water supply, irrigation or electricity production, have several environmental, economic and social values, and constitute strategic reserves in periods of water scarcity. Reservoirs are vulnerable to the impacts of land uses on their banks and so require careful planning and development control. Systematic studies on how water reservoirs plans formulate land use rules are, however, scarce. In Portugal, reservoirs for public water uses have been subject to protection plans but those have not raised much attention. This paper analyses the rules established by reservoir protection plans adopted in Portugal and assesses if the legal regime revised after the Water Framework Directive (WFD) entry into force has altered their regulatory approaches. The analysis uses a methodology based on a set of analytical factors proven valuable for comparative studies on regulatory approaches. The findings revealed that the Reservoir Legal Regime (RLR), as reviewed to adapt to the new regulatory framework that followed the WFD approval, did not bring robust changes to the earlier regulatory praxis. Although the relative importance of rules for reservoir banks is slightly reinforced, they are maintained as predominantly prohibitive and still poorer than before concerning targets definition. The increase of conditioned rules is not followed by a corresponding increase in mentioning indicators or nutrients. As rules on the reservoir banks are to be assimilated by different users and agencies, the paper stresses how they could foster more substantiated, referenced and balanced deterrence compliance formulations in order to incentivize innovative land use options.

AB  - In oviparous species, physico-chemical characteristics of eggs are an indicator of maternal physiological traits and environmental conditions of the site where the females develop. In this study, we aim to (a) determine the physico-chemical characteristics of eggs from wild Caiman latirostris populations; (b) evaluate if fertile and infertile eggs differ in physico-chemical characteristics associated with suchest reproductive success; and (c) compare the present results with findings in other crocodilian species to identify characteristics that would be associated with reproductive biology and adaptations to their environments. Eggs were collected and identified, and different morphometric variables (percentage of components, and protein, total lipids and fatty acid composition) were determined. Fertile and infertile eggs did not differ in weight or component (eggshell, yolk and albumen) percentages of total egg weight. Fatty acid profiles of yolk differed between fertile and infertile eggs in C14:0, C16:1 and C17:1. However, the comparison of profiles among clutches showed differences in 12 fatty acids. We also observed differences in percentage of egg components respect to other crocodilian species, particularly of albumen, which had a lower proportion in C. latirostris. Our results suggest that egg infertility may not be related to maternal lipid investment. We propose using yolk of infertile eggs (which is similar to that of fertile eggs) as a non-invasive method to identify and evaluate the difference in FA composition of eggs for breedings female of varyns diets.

AB  - The use of non-food materials such as agro-residues as feedstock for renewable energy production continues to generate greater interests due to the environmental challenges from the utilisation of fossil-based fuels. This study gives the first report on thermochemical characteristics, pyrolysis kinetics and pyrolysis product distribution from adzuki bean waste (pod). The pyrolysis characteristic was evaluated under a non-isothermal condition at a different heating rate (10, 15 and 20 A degrees C/min) and kinetic parameters determined using distributed activation energy model. The result indicates that the model adequately described the pyrolysis characteristics of the feedstock with high correlation coefficient (R (2) > 0.9) and apparent activation of 140.81 kJ/mol. The result of pyrolysis study revealed that adzuki bean pod could be valorised into solid, liquid (bio-oil) and gas products with maximum bio-oil yield of 46.57 wt% at 600 A degrees C. The bio-oil collected contains high-value fuel precursors and value-added chemicals such as phenol and phenol derivatives, benzene and methyl ester. The gas product comprised of combustible gases, which can serve as an alternative energy source to the pyrolysis system. The solid bio-char product is predominately a porous carbon material with indicators of high stability. This material can also be utilised for energy application in addition to carbon sequestration. The presence of macronutrients suggests its suitability for bio-fertiliser application. This study shows that adzuki bean waste is a potential feedstock for production of alternative energy and valuable biomaterials.

AB  - Spinach is one of the most important green-leafy vegetables, consumed worldwide, and its intake is beneficial for human beings. In this crop, produce yield and quality are closely related to plant nitrogen (N) nutrition. A precise supply of N is also essential for high environmental and economic sustainability. Main aims of the work were: i) to establish relationships between produce yield or quality and mineral N availability in the root zone; and ii) to define an optimal mineral N level to be maintained in the root zone for spinach. Eight experiments were carried out during a four-year-long period under typical Mediterranean climate conditions. Different amounts of N fertilisers were supplied leading to twenty different levels of mineral N in the root zone. Experimental measurements included climate parameters, plant growth, tissue and soil analyses, produce yield and quality indicators. A segmented linear model significantly represented the relationship between crop yield (1.7 to 21.7 t ha(-l)) and soil mineral N concentration (7.6 to 41.0 mg kg(-1)). Basing on this model, an optimal mineral N threshold was fixed at 23.4 mg kg(-1). Above this threshold, crop yield did not show any significant variations as well as tissue characteristics and produce quality. Plants grown under suboptimal N levels showed reduction in growth, tissue mineral (nutrients) content, and SPAD index. The proposed models could be implemented in fertilisation protocols for the optimization of N supply and the estimation of spinach growth and yield.

AB  - River inflows are often the dominant source of sediment into a lacustrine system and the extent of sediment transport can be an important indicator of the impact of introduced constituents on an ecosystem. Inflow intrusions, which intrude into the middle of the water column at a depth of neutral buoyancy, can be common in deep, stratified lakes and reservoirs. However, the dynamics and associated sediment transport of these flows have received less attention in the literature compared to surface or underflow plumes. A three-dimensional hydrodynamic and sediment transport model was used to investigate sediment transport due to inflow intrusions in Pallanza Bay, an embayment within Lake Maggiore, Italy. The model was validated using field observations of inflow intrusions over varying conditions and was then used to simulate a range of realistic scenarios to evaluate sediment transport and deposition from inflow intrusions. The extent of sedimentation across the range of simulated scenarios can be estimated using a simple analytical expression with only a priori known parameters. The expression is a function of the intrusion plume speed and thickness, which are governed by the volume flow rate and the ambient stratification. We utilize the first-mode wave speed to characterize the ambient stratification in the simplified expression, which eliminates the need to characterize near-field mixing and entrainment to predict the intrusion depth. While the simple expression gives a reasonable estimate of the sedimentation extent, it does not capture lateral variability in the plume due to effects like lateral spreading and the earth's rotation.

AB  - Chloropicrin (CP) is a potential alternative for methyl bromide as a soil fumigant given that the use of methyl bromide has become limited. However, little is known about how fumigation with CP affects the condition of the soil microbial community. In this study, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR were combined to investigate the effect of CP on soil bacterial community. In total, 938,922 effective reads were obtained from 18 samples and clustered into 58,662 operational taxonomic units at a similarity cut-off of 97%. Both approaches showed that the primary structure of bacterial community in soil did not significantly change at the phylum level after fumigation, but CP had a significant impact on the abundance of the bacterial microbiome that was recovered and identified. Additionally, bacterial community diversity decreased significantly, and there was a shift in the predominant populations. Staphylococcus, Actinomadura, Acinetobacter and Streptomyces significantly decreased in number or disappeared, and Bacteroides, Lachnoclostridium, Pseudoalteromonas, Colwellia, Idiomarina and Cobetia became the new predominant populations. In addition, some species associated with biodegradation, such as Sphingomonas spp. and Rhodococcus spp., significantly increased in number. The abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) were significantly inhibited, yet the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) significantly increased, and denitrification was significantly promoted. These changes in bacterial flora can considerably impact soil function and health and lead to negative effects on the environment surrounding fumigated soils, indicating the need for proactive risk management. Our study provides useful information for environmental safety assessments of CP in China. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We examined changes in the functioning of copepod assemblages with increasing pollution in estuaries, using sampling standardization of the salinity range to enable comparisons. Copepod assemblages were analyzed in four southeast Brazilian estuaries with different water quality levels and hydrodynamic characteristics over two years. We obtained mesozooplankton samples together with environmental and water quality parameters in the estuaries, every two months under predetermined salinities ranging from 15 to 25. The values of parameters, except species size, associated with the functioning of the copepod assemblages (biomass, productivity, and turnover rate) did not differ among estuaries. However, in the more polluted estuaries, the biomass and productivity of copepod assemblages of mesozooplankton were negatively correlated with concentration of pollution indicator parameters. Conversely, in the less polluted estuaries some degree of enrichment still seems to increase the system biomass and productivity, as these parameters were inversely related to indicators of improved water quality. The pollution level of estuaries distorted the relationship between temperature and the efficiency of converting energy to organic matter. In the less polluted estuaries, the relationship between turnover rate and temperature was over 70%, while in the most polluted estuaries, this relationship was only approximately 50%. Our results demonstrated that the functioning of assemblages in the estuaries was affected differently by increasing pollution depending on the water quality level of the system. Thus, investigating the functioning of assemblages can be a useful tool for the analysis of estuarine conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sediments from three paleolakes and two paleosol horizons in south Bohemia, Czech Republic, provide evidence of climate change and landscape evolution in central-eastern Europe on millennial to centennial thhescales over the Late Glacial (similar to 16-11.5 ky). Based on a combination of geochemical, sedimentological and geophysical proxy indicators, along with the pollen record and soil micromorphology, we propose a relationship between vegetation cover, soil development, and erosional processes. Four major and two minor environmental stages, identified in all investigated paleo-lakes, were broadly correlated with the Late Glacial climatostratigraphy. Short-term (decadal to centennial) climatic deteriorations between the Bolling and Allerod, and within the Allerod, have been correlated with the Older Dryas and the Infra-Allerod Cold Period (IACP) respectively. B horizons of two (gleyic) podzols discovered under aeolian sand dunes in the lake catchments were dated to the Allerod interstadial and were parallelized with Usselo soils - pedostratigraphical marker horizons of west-and northern-central Europe. The upper parts of these soils have signs of colluvial processes. According to the radiocarbon dating, the erosion occurred at 13,155 150 cal. yr BP and can be associated with the IACP event, which is marked by a significant input of allogenic material into the lake basins. We attribute the significant increase in the iron and consequent phosphorus content in the lake sediments during the Allerod to the podzolization that occurred with the humid interstadial conditions.

AB  - This pilot study tested the acceptability and usability of a prototype app designed to promote the physical well-being of adults with psychiatric disorders. The application under evaluation, WellWave, promoted walking as a physical exercise, and offered a variety of supportive non-physical activities, including confidential text-messaging with peer staff, and a digital library of readings and videos on recovery from psychiatric illness. Study participants engaged strongly in the app throughout the 4-week study, showing a 94 % mean daily usage rate, and a 73 % mean response rate across all electronic messages and prompts, which approximates the gold standard of 75 % for momentary ecological assessment studies. Seven of the ten study participants averaged two or more walks per week, beginning with 5-min walks and ending with walks lasting 20 min or longer. This responsiveness to the walking prompts, and the overall high rate of engagement in other app features, suggest that adults with psychiatric conditions would welcome and benefit from similar smartphone interventions that promote healthy behaviours in life domains other than exercise. Pilot study results also suggest that smartphone applications can be useful as research tools in the development and testing of theories and practical strategies for encouraging healthy lifestyles. Participants were prompted periodically to rate their own health quality, perceived control over their health, and stage-of-change in adopting a walking routine, and these electronic self-ratings showed acceptable concurrent and discriminant validity, with all participants reporting moderate to high motivation to exercise by the end of the study.

AB  - People living in slums can be considered left behind with regard to national successes in achieving Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The objective of this study was to evaluate the living and working conditions of waste pickers and their children in a landfill slum located in the largest city in eastern Indonesia. A total of 113 people from the landfill slum and 1184 people from the general population participated in face-to-face interviews. Municipal solid waste (MSW) was analyzed for metals, metalloids and fecal indicator bacteria. Ambient air quality including particulate matter was measured in the landfill. Households in the landfill slum were 5.73 (p = 0.04) times more likely to be below the international poverty line (MDG 1: Poverty) and 15.6 times (p < 0.01) more likely to have no one in the household possessing a primary education (MDG 2: Universal Education), and 107 times (p b 0.01) more likely not to have improved sanitation facilities (MDG 7: Environmental Sustainability) when compared to the general population. Diarrhea is one of the leading causes of death in children under five in Indonesia. Young children living in the landfill slum were 2.87 times (p=0.02) more likely to develop diarrhea than their general population counterparts. Other survey results and environmental measurements suggest that landfill slum children have additional adverse health effects (e.g. infections and poisoning). Poverty underlies several MDG issues that directly or indirectly affect child health. Therefore, eradicating extreme poverty will continue to be the most critical challenge for the MDGs beyond 2015.

AB  - 1. The expansion of agriculture has led to forest loss and fragmentation, resulting in dramatic biodiversity impoverishment. Surprisingly, few studies have assessed forest fragmentation effects on leaf-cutting ant assemblages, and none has dealt with effects on their community richness and composition, despite their known role as key herbivores and ecosystem engineers.
   2. We analysed forest area and edge effects on leaf-cutting ant abundance, richness and assemblage composition, by recording and identifying colonies along edge and interior transects in 12 Chaco Serrano forest remnants of different sizes, in Central Argentina. We also explored leaf-cutting ant presence in the adjacent soybean matrix.
   3. We recorded five leaf-cutting ant species, in the genus Acromyrmex. In the soybean matrix, colonies of three species were observed, which were also found at the forest edge. Within the forest, edges sustained more species and colonies than interior habitats, whereas forest area was linked positively to colony abundance. Taxonomic composition of leaf-cutting ant assemblages reflected both area and edge effects.
   4. Our results revealed overall positive edge and area effects on leaf-cutting ant communities, highlighting differential species-specific responses and a possible role for Acromyrmex crassispinus as a forest status indicator. According to our findings, an increase in edge habitats may favour most leaf-cutting ant species, providing a suitable interface for access to the cultivated matrix, but hindering species associated with undisturbed forest conditions. As leaf-cutting ants are acknowledged as cornerstones of ecosystem functioning, the consequences of these trends may be far reaching.

AB  - Photosynthetic activity is one of the most important indicators for evaluating the introduction and acclimatization of trees to new geographies. The aim of this study was to investigate the photosynthetic characteristics of marula [Sclerocarya birrea (A. Rich.) Hochst. subsp. caffra (Sond.) Kokwaro (Anacardiaceae)] and the environmental conditions relevant to its growth in China. We analyzed the diurnal dynamics of photosynthesis in two S. birrea varieties, one from South Africa and one from Israel, after introduction into China using a portable photosynthesis measuring system. Our results showed that the diurnal net photosynthetic rate (P-n) exhibited an atypical double-peak pattern that was influenced mainly by stomatal factors. Moreover, the diurnal change in stomatal conductance (G(s)) was consistent with that for P-n and showed an obvious double-peak curve, whereas the diurnal change in the transpiration rate (T-r) was opposite to that in intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i), which presented a single-peak curve. The extreme values of the environmental factors we monitored occurred at approximately the same time of day and influenced photosynthesis by affecting C-1, T-r, and leaf temperature (T-L), with light intensity exerting an especially strong effect. The P-n of the S. birrea variety from Israel was higher than that of the S. birrea variety from South Africa, while South Africa S. birrea exhibited superior growth trait in southern China. We suggest that the photosynthetic performance of S. birrea can be acclimated to a new environment. (C) 2015 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Predictive soil mapping with limited sample data
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE

KW  - KNOWLEDGE
AB  - Existing predictive soil mapping (PSM) methods often require soil sample data to be sufficient to represent soil-environment relationships throughout the study area. However, in many parts of the world with only a limited quantity of soil sample data to represent the study area, this is still an issue for PSM application. This paper presents a method, named individual predictive soil mapping' (iPSM), which can make use of limited soil sample data for PSM. With the assumption that similar environmental conditions have similar soils, iPSM uses the soil-environment relationship at each individual soil sample location to predict soil properties at unvisited locations and estimate prediction uncertainty. Specifically, the environmental similarities of an unvisited location to a set of soil sample locations are used in a weighted average method to integrate the soil-environment relationships at sample locations for prediction and uncertainty estimation. As a case study, iPSM was applied to map soil organic matter (SOM) content (%) in the topsoil layer using two sets of soil samples. Compared with multiple linear regression (MLR), iPSM produced a more accurate SOM map (root mean squared error (RMSE) 1.43, mean absolute error (MAE) 1.16) than MLR (RMSE 8.54, MAE 7.34) the ability of the sample set to represent the study area is limited and achieved a comparable accuracy (RMSE 1.10, MAE 0.69) with MLR (RMSE 1.01, MAE 0.73) when the sample set could represent the study area better. In addition, the prediction uncertainty estimated by iPSM was positively related to prediction residuals in both scenarios. This study demonstrates that iPSM is an effective alternative when existing soil samples are limited in their ability to represent the study area and the prediction uncertainty in iPSM can be used as an indicator of its prediction accuracy.

AB  - A hydropedologic approach can be used to describe soil units affected by distinct hydrologic regimes. We used field observations of soil morphology and geospatial information technology to map the distribution of five hydropedologic soil units across a 42-ha forested headwater catchment. Soils were described and characterized at 172 locations within Watershed 3, the hydrologic reference catchment for the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire. Soil profiles were grouped by presence and thickness of genetic horizons. Topographic and bedrock metrics were used in a logistic regression model to estimate the probability of soil group occurrence. Each soil group occurred under specific settings that influence subsurface hydrologic conditions. The most important metrics for predicting soil groups were Euclidean distance from bedrock outcrop, topographic wetness index, bedrock-weighted upslope accumulated area, and topographic position index. Catchment-scale maps of hydropedologic units highlight regions dominated by lateral eluviation or lateral illuviation and show that only about half the catchment is dominated by podzolization processes occurring under vertical percolation at the pedon scale. A water table map shows the importance of near-stream zones, typically viewed as variable source areas, as well as more distal bedrock-controlled zones to runoff generation. Although the catchment is steep and underlain by soils developed in coarse-textured parent material, patterns of groundwater incursion into the solum indicate that well-drained soils are restricted to deeper soils away from shallow bedrock and the intermittent stream network. Hydropedologic units can be a valuable tool for informing watershed management, soil C accounting, and understanding biogeochemical processes and runoff generation.

AB  - The bioarchaeological record of human remains viewed in the context of ecology, subsistence, and living circumstances provides a fundamental source for documenting and interpreting the impact of plant and animal domestication in the late Pleistocene and early to middle Holocene. For Western Asia, Catalhoyuk (7100-5950 cal BC) in central Anatolia, presents a comprehensive and contextualized setting for interpreting living circumstances in this highly dynamic period of human history. This article provides an overview of the bioarchaeology of Catalhoyuk in order to characterize patterns of life conditions at the community level, addressing the question, What were the implications of domestication and agricultural intensification, increasing sedentism, and population growth for health and lifestyle in this early farming community? This study employs demography, biogeochemistry, biodistance analysis, biomechanics, growth and development, and paleopathology in order to identify and interpret spatial and temporal patterns of health and lifestyle under circumstances of rapid population growth and aggregation and changing patterns of acquiring food and other resources. The record suggests that the rapid growth in population size was fueled by increased fertility and birthrate. Although the household was likely the focus of economic activity, our analysis suggests that individuals interred in houses were not necessarily biologically related. Predictably, the community employed resource extraction practices involving increased mobility. Although oral and skeletal indicators suggest some evidence of compromised health (e.g. elevated subadult infection, dental caries), growth and development of juveniles and adult body size and stature indicate adjustments to local circumstances.

AB  - The Upper Triassic Chang 7 non-marine hot shales have been proven to contribute to Mesozoic oil reservoirs in the Ordos basin, Central China. These shales have been studied extensively in sedimentology, petrology and organic geochemistry. However, the factors controlling the development of the shales are still ambiguously constrained. This paper presents the major, trace, and platinum-group elements (PGEs) data to address these issues. The Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA), Chemical Index of Weathering (CIW), C-values and clay mineral compositions indicate that the Chang 7 hot shales were developed in a humid paleoclimate. The indicators of redox conditions (Eu/Eu*, Ce/Ce*, Ce-anom, delta U, U/Th, V/(V + Ni) and V/Cr) suggest that the Chang 7 hot shales were developed under anoxic environment. Uranium enrichment (average 46.10 ppm) is an important distinguished signature of the Chang 7 hot shales, which was mainly related to synchronous volcanic ash sediments and/or possibly hydrothermal fluids. The PGE concentrations of the Chang 7 hot shales were reported for the first time here, and can be subdivided into two groups. The total abundances of the Group One samples are relatively lower and derived mainly from detrital minerals, while the Group Two samples are relatively higher, and are also likely linked to the synchronous volcanic ash sediments and/or possibly hydrothermal fluids. Combined with the regional geological setting, we tentatively propose that the tectonics is the major control on the development of the Chang 7 hot shales. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The identification of early markers has become a focus for early intervention in bipolar disorder. Using a retrospective, qualitative methodology, the present study compares the early experiences of participants with bipolar disorder to those with unipolar depression up until their first diagnosed episode. The study focuses on differences in early home and school environments as well as putative differences in personality characteristics between the two groups. Finally we a compare and contrast prodromal symptoms in these two populations. Thirty-nine participants, 20 diagnosed with unipolar depression and 19 diagnosed with bipolar disorder, took part in the study. A semi-structured interview was developed to elicit information about participants' experiences prior to their first episode. Participants with bipolar disorder reported disruptive home environments, driven personality features, greater emotion dysregulation and adverse experiences during the school years, whereas participants with depression tended to describe more supportive home environments, and more compliant and introvert personality traits. Retrospective data collection and no corroborative evidence from other family members. No distinction was made between bipolar I and bipolar II disorder nor between melancholic and non-melancholic depression in the sample. Finally the study spanned over a 12-month period which does not allow for the possibility of diagnostic reassignment of some of the bipolar participants to the unipolar condition. These findings indicate that there may be benefits in combining both proximal and distal indicators in identifying a bipolar disorder phenotype which, in turn, may be relevant to the development of early intervention programs for young people with bipolar disorder.

AB  - In this study, an integrated "Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE)" and maintenance systems are presented. Multivariate analysis is used for continuous performance assessment and improvement of these systems. The two subjects of "Maintenance System" and "HSE" have been individually investigated several times in different studies. However, few studies have been done to integrate these two systems and provide an integrated system for their implementation. This study evaluates current maintenance and HSE systems of a Gas Transmission Unit by Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Moreover, decision making units (DMUs) are examined and ranked. Employees are considered as DMUs. This is done through investigating and measuring their efficiencies and identifying the inefficient and less-efficient units. Since an increase in the number of inputs does not lead to an increase in the number of outputs with the same scale, an output-oriented DEA with a Variable Returns to Scale (VRS) is used. The Fuzzy DEA (FDEA) is also used in this research to decrease uncertainty existing in qualitative indicators and human error. Finally, suggestions are given to improve those DMUs. The managers and employees of the gas transmission unit constitute the statistical population of the study. To achieve the objectives of this study, standard questionnaires with respect to HSE and Maintenance system are completed by operators. The proposed approach would help policy makers and top managers of Gas Transmission Company to have a more comprehensive and thorough understanding the working conditions with respect to the maintenance and HSE features.

AB  - Purpose - Many companies lack insights or fact-based support for the pricing decisions they make in an increasingly complex environment. In order to optimize their pricing process, managers need to identify key indicators that may influence the performance of their decisions. The purpose of this paper is to report an investigation of pricing determinants in large companies manufacturing capital goods in France. First a conceptual framework is proposed, in order to fill several gaps identified in the literature on pricing practices and more precisely by operating a distinction between environmental variables (determinants), decision making (pricing strategy and price and product-line structures) and its consequence in terms of price level.
   Design/methodology/approach - The author conducted an empirical research on the determinants of the pricing process. This study consisted of a questionnaire survey addressed to pricing managers (or executives in charge of pricing) in 98 of the largest manufacturing companies in France about their new-product pricing decision-making process.
   Findings - The author studies environmental determinants and their influence on the pricing and describes the structure of pricing determinants as a five dimensions construct: market-based, value-based, position-based, competition-based and production-based. The results show that firms rely on environmental determinants as indicators of their pricing flexibility. These indicators operate as pricing levers: a good position on these variables gives firms more pricing power. But in the vast majority of the cases, companies extensively relied on competitive conditions instead of taking advantage of a favorable position, described as pricing myopia.
   Originality/value - This paper describes current pricing practices in leading companies with key informants (mainly pricing managers) highly involved in the pricing decision process, and contrasts two pricing orientations, pricing power vs pricing myopia.

AB  - Australia has seen an unprecedented proliferation in large scale water recycling schemes since the late 1990s. This has been driven by a recent decade of drought, policies to encourage water efficiency in new homes and buildings in urban areas, and to reduce pressure on rain-fed water supplies by replacement with alternate water sources in rural areas. Underpinning these drivers are principles of economic and environmental sustainability and protection of public health. National guidelines for recycling of treated sewage, released in 2006, replaced an approach using prescriptive end point water quality targets, with a 12-step risk-based framework for the planning and operation of Australian water recycling schemes. Essential to this risk-based approach is an understanding of the sewage treatment system and assessing the risks in the catchment, the treatment process, distribution system and end use environment. Inherent also in this process is the identification of critical control points with tangible operational targets for pre-empting, preventing and correcting off-spec conditions before they derail a scheme. Validation of systems through microbial log reduction targets for indicator viruses, bacteria, protozoa and helminths, differentiated according to end use and expected exposures, may be obtained through treatment, site controls or a combination of both. Drawing on case studies from the Australian states of New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland (Qld), this paper gives insight to preventative risk management of water recycling schemes with typical risk profiles. Some advantages and disadvantages of the guideline approach are considered. The information paints a picture of the industry's risk management obligations in the planning phase and may be of use to practitioners in other regions where planning for safe and sustainable water recycling is developing.

AB  - The use of music as enrichment has rarely been explored in zoos, despite evidence that music has a positive effect on a range of laboratory housed animals. In this study of moloch gibbons, Hylobates moloch, at Howletts Wild Animal Park (Kent, England), instrumental classical music was played to eight individuals in two family groups. Music was played 7hr a day during three of six study weeks for each group, alternating with control weeks in which no music was played. In focal watches, data were recorded on a measure of activity, brachiation, and on two rates of affiliative behavior, giving and receiving grooming. In addition, to assess potential impacts on emotional state, data were recorded on self-scratching and self-grooming, two widely used indices of anxiety or stress. Analyses were carried out for each individual separately, as previous studies of primates indicate animals may differ in their response to enrichment. Results revealed little evidence for effects of music on gibbons' behavior. During the music compared to control weeks, the adult male from one group showed higher rates of self-scratching and higher durations of both self-grooming and grooming others. The adult female from the same group was groomed more during the music weeks than control weeks. For the six other animals, no significant differences in behaviors were seen between music and control conditions. Our findings suggest music may not be an effective enrichment for captive gibbons, and further highlight the importance of considering individual differences when assessing the effects of potential enrichment.

AB  - The average temperature of the earth has increased from 0.3 to 0.6 degrees C, and warming is facilitating faunal reshuffling. Variable thermal environments warrant mechanisms to adjust the expression of phenotypic values to environmental needs. Ectothermic Drosophilids are profoundly affected by thermal selection (i.e., genetic effects) or through induced effects on phenotypes (i.e., plastic effects). Climatic data for the last fifty years involves a significant change in average temperature (T-ave) of Western Himalayas, which has affected the distribution and boundaries of various Drosophilids in this region. There is a significant decline in the number of D. nepalensis from lower ranges; whereas D. ananassae is reported to be introduced to lower to mid mountainous ranges. Further, a comparison of fecundity, hatchability, and viability at different growth temperatures has shown significant decrease in trait values at 17 degrees C in D. ananassae and at 25 degrees C in D. nepalensis. Thus, the recent range changes of these two species involve genetic effects on ecophysiological and plastic effects on life history traits. Our results indicate that thermal plasticity of life history traits can be species-specific; thus climate change may lead to a mismatch of such traits to the changing environment. We suggest that D. nepalensis and D. ananassae could serve as indicator species for analyzing range changes under changing climatic conditions. Evolutionary biologists can provide unique perspective to the examination of how climate change will affect the earth's biota.

AB  - A vegetation survey of semi-permanent plots was conducted between years 1955-1962 and 2005-2009, and aimed to determine floristic changes occurring in beech forests located on a scarcely populated, dense forest area. The survey encompassed all natural beech forest types within the Polish part of the "Eastern Carpathians" International Reserve of Biosphere. A comparison of trends in changes between unmanaged (Bieszczady National Park) and managed (the remaining part of the Biosphere Reserve) forests was attempted. DCA analysis was used for the determination of changes on the community level. The density of vegetation, species richness, frequency of occurrence and cover, and functional groups of species were determined. Much more profound community changes were determined to have occurred in managed beech forests. However, a similar direction in vegetation changes within both managed and unmanaged forests verifies the existence of a regional pattern of changes in beech forests. This regional pattern involves (1) a decrease in the shares of arborescent species within the shrub layer, (2) disturbance of the canopy layer, (3) acidification of the top layer of the soil, (4) change of light conditions, (5) increase in shares of generalist species and decrease in shares of specialist species. A decreasing anthropogenic pressure, aging of forest stands, functioning of large, dense forest areas and sustainable forest management strategies forestry management system mimicking natural deciduous forest disturbance regime constitute factors shaping the regional changes of the forest vegetation. The undergoing changes can lead to biotic and spatial homogenization of the Eastern Carpathian beech forests. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The intensity of ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B) has increased on the Earth's surface due to the stratospheric ozone depletion, causing an adverse effect on a wide range of species, such as morphological, physiological, and biochemical alterations. This research studied the intraspecific photosensitivity of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) seedlings exposed to UV-B. Six commercial cultivars were evaluated: Laura, Sprint 440, Dasher II, Exocet, Poinsett 76, and Marketmore 76 under greenhouse-controlled environmental conditions with a hydroponic sandwich-type system with a Hoagland II nutrient solution. Seedlings were irradiated from expanded cotyledons to the third true leaf with three intensities of UV-B radiation (30, 40, and 50 mu W cm(-2)) for 18 d between 11:40-15:40 h. Seedling growth, morphology, accumulation of photosynthetic pigments, and absorbing UV-B pigments were evaluated. 'Laura' was the least affected by chlorosis and had a total absence of leaf curl, whereas 'Poinsett 76' was the most affected in the 40 and 50 mu W cm(-2) intensities. Both leaf area and seedling height of 'Marketmore 76' and 'Poinsett 76' had the lowest values. 'Laura' obtained the highest value in both fresh weight and dry weight. 'Poinsett 76' had the least amount of pigments absorbing UV-B and was 53% lower than that obtained by 'Laura'. 'Poinsett 76' had lower chlorophyll and carotenoids. Parameters used were indicators of the seedling response to UV-B radiation, but could not be used for cucumber seedling sensitivity to UV-B radiation.

AB  - In tropical regions with well-defined wet and dry seasons, repeated wetting and drying cycles can harden exposed soils and inhibit root growth. While this phenomenon has been well documented, the relationships between plant productivity and chemical and physical soil parameters have not been well defined. The current study identifies the abiotic parameters that best relate to measures of plant development, specifically to corn productivity. The primary goal of this research was to provide information to improve agricultural sustainability in humid tropical ecosystems. The effects of using plant residues as a cover on a sandy soil were studied. Four leguminous species were planted in an alley cropping system, Leucaena leucocephala, Cajanus cajan, Clitoria fairchildiana and Acacia mangium, and corn was planted in January 2007 between legume rows. We measured the most important chemical and physical soil parameters. Yield indicators included cob weight and the weight of 100 kernels. The application of plant residues altered soil conditions and increased rootable soil volume. This change was associated with an increase by 10% in water retention above field capacity in the uppermost soil layer of the residue-covered sections of the experiment. In the control sections cobs were up to three times lighter (31.43-93.38 g) in the bare soil control than those from residue-covered sections of the experiment. Dynamic indicators related to nutrient absorption and crop evapotranspiration, such as the number of days with water stress and rootable soil volume, were the most suitable indicators for assessing soil quality. The response of corn was best related to complex physical indicators, including the amount of N applied via legume residues.

AB  - The Pyrenean and Pre-Pyrenean mountain areas have been intensively used at least since roman times. but nowadays depopulation has lead to widespread land abandonment without a steering land-management. Vegetation recovery is weak in most abandoned fields. Soil formation and characteristics are conditioned by this fact, and for this, soils show past degradation processes and are mostly predominant factors for continuing land degradation or restoration. Three study areas were set up along a climatic gradient with increasing summer water deficit in the sub-humid zone between the Central Pyrenees and Pre-Pyrenees. Soil survey combined with experiments for the determination of infiltration. runoff and erosion were applied for understanding the degradation history and the future development of the soils. All areas are dominated by Entisols, but also Inceptisols and Alfisols are found, and even soils with hydromorphic features. The soils show signs of heavy erosion. The parental material determines the nutrient supply and the general chemical properties. All sites show a weak water storing capacity, as a result of the removal of fine material by erosion and due to the depletion of soil organic matter. In addition. infiltration capacity and runoff "generation are high within the studied areas. averaging, between 27 and 37 per cent. The driest area studied shows an ongoing trend to degradation, with high erosion rates combined with a high degradations status of the soil. The other areas are characterised by a patchy pattern of soil degradation and regradation processes. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - We assessed over 15 months the distribution of total coliforms concentrations of Escherichia coli, Enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus in three monitoring points in the Etueffont landfill (Belfort, France). We selected the piezometer (PZ30) which is located downstream from the dump and two leachate collectors from the old dump and the new casing. The results showed that the leachate was free from both Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus. The absence of Salmonella was most likely due to the small occupation of the landfill environment by vertebrates, especially rodents, birds and reptiles, which are known to be principal vectors of Salmonella. S. aureu, is generally hosted on skins and mucus of animals. The mean densities of E. coli and Enterococcus in the leachates were low. In contrast, P. neruginosa abundance was high and closely related to precipitations. Coliform bacteria concentrations in the leachate averaged UFC.100 CFU. ml(-1). In the contaminated groundwaters, the coliforms, E. coli and Enterococci were always present at concentrations 10 to 100 fold higher than those reported from septic tank effluents. P. aeruginosa concentrations were low (mean : 11 CFU.100 ml(-1)) and inferior to those quoted in the leachate. This may be explained by the anoxic conditions which prevailed in the shistous aquifer. The absence of Salmonella in groundwaters may be due to its sensitivity to disinfectants and that of S. aureus linked to the fact that it is not a common host of the human intestine. Finally, our study clearly indicates the role played by E. coli and Enterococci as biomarkers of recent faecal contamination.

AB  - Mytilus galloprovincialis mussels from a clean area were transplanted from 2003 to 2005 to several stations in the Bay of Cannes (North-Western Mediterranean Sea) including a site considered as reference, for I month at the end of spring (May). Several biomarkers (AChE, GST and CAT activities, TBARS and MT concentrations) were measured in the transplanted organisms. The concentrations of metals (Cd, Cu and Zn) were determined in the transplanted mussels, PAH and PCB analyses were performed in the mussels caged in 2004. The integrated biomarker response (IBR) was calculated; pollutant concentrations in mussels were displayed as star plots and compared to IBR star plots. Visualization was thus possible between sites for comparison with exposure conditions. Results demonstrated that the mussels from the Old harbour site (VP) are characterized by elevated copper and PCB concentrations, those from Canto harbour (PC) presented high PCB contents and those from the mouth of the Siagne River (ES) high PAH concentrations compared to the animals transplanted in the reference site (IL). In 2003, there was a visual correlation between the copper gradient measured in the transplanted mussels and the IBR variation. In 2004, the agreement between the copper gradient and the PCB gradient measured in the caged mussels and the IBR variation was good whereas the PAH gradient did not seem to contribute to the IBR demonstrating that the chosen biomarkers did not respond to PAHs. In 2005, IBR showed that other contaminants, not measured might be present in VP, PC and ES compared to the reference station (IL). (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite a high nitrate uptake capacity, the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of oilseed rape is weak due to a relatively low N remobilization from vegetative (mostly leaves) to growing parts of the plant. Thus, this crop requires a high rate of N fertilization and leaves fall with a high N content. In order to reduce the rate of N fertilization and to improve the environmental impact of oilseed rape, new genotypes could be selected on their capacity to mobilize the foliar N. Various indicators of leaf senescence in oilseed rape were analysed during plant growth, as well as during senescence induced by N deprivation. Metabolic changes in leaves of increasing age were followed in N-supplied and N-deprived rosettes by measuring chlorophyll, total N, and soluble protein contents. Similarly, the expression of genes known to be up-regulated (SAG12) or down-regulated (Cab) during leaf senescence was monitored. The amount of soluble proteins per leaf was a better indicator of leaf senescence than chlorophyll or total N content, but was not evaluated as an accurate indicator under conditions of N deprivation. On the other hand, up-regulation of SAG12 concomitantly with down-regulation of Cab in the leaf revealed the spatial and temporal progression of leaf senescence in oilseed rape. This study shows, for the first time at the whole plant level, that the SAG12/Cab gene expressions match the sink/source transition for N during both developmental and nutrient stress-induced leaf senescence.

AB  - Geographic variability in the physiological attributes of widely distributed species can be a result of phenotypic plasticity or can reflect evolutionary responses to a particular habitat. In the field, we assessed thermal variability in low and high intertidal pools and the distribution of resident fish species Scartichthys viridis and transitory Girella laevifrons along this vertical intertidal gradient at three localities along the Chilean coast: Antofagasta (the northernmost and warmest habitat), Carrizal Bajo (central coast) and Las Cruces (the southernmost and coldest habitat). In the laboratory, we evaluated the thermal sensitivity of fish captured from each locality. The response to temperature was estimated as the frequency of opercular movements and as thermal selectivity in a gradient; the former being a indirect indicator of energy costs in a particular environment and the latter revealing differential occupation of habitat. Seawater temperature in intertidal pools was greatest at Antofagasta, and within each site was greatest in high intertidal pools. The two intertidal fish species showed opposite patterns of local distribution, with S. viridis primarily inhabiting the lower sectors of the intertidal zone, and G. laevifrons occupying the higher sectors of the intertidal zone. This pattern was consistent for all three localities. Locality was found to be a very important factor determining the frequency of opercular movement and thermal selectivity of both S. viridis and G. laevifrons. Our results suggest that S. viridis and G. laevifrons respond according to: (1) the thermal history of the habitat from which they came, and (2) the immediate physical conditions of their habitat. These results suggest local adaptation rather than plasticity in thermoregulatory and energetic mechanisms.

AB  - The increased awareness of potential impacts of agricultural activities on nonpoint source pollution has increased the demand for agro-environmental policy measures and for scientifically sound indicators to control their implementation. Our objective was to investigate whether N concentration of maize (Zea mays L.) at silage maturity, a routinely recorded quality parameter, can serve as an end-of-season indicator of N status. Based on 29 field trials on sandy soils in northern Germany, we derived a critical N concentration at silage maturity (CNC), i.e., the minimum N concentration necessary for maximum yield production. A quadratic-plateau function describing dry matter (DM) yield as a function of N concentration allowed for the exclusion of all data sets not responsive to N fertilization or with luxury N uptake. For the remaining pooled data points, a mixed-model analysis provided parameter estimates describing N concentration (Nc) as an exponential function of relative DM yield (Wrel), namely Nc = 4.4141. exp (0.0086-Wrel). Setting Wrel - 100 provided a CNC of 10.5 g N kg(-1) DM. This value is in good agreement with results in the literature, which indicates the relative robustness of CNC with respect to a wide range of environmental conditions and genotypes. The CNC constant can be used to evaluate and monitor the end-of-season N status on a large-area scale. Applied to an extended set of silage quality data of northern Germany, it revealed that forage maize production is characterized by significant excess of N supply in this region and leaves ample opportunity for reduction in N use without risk of any yield loss.

AB  - Studies on solar inactivation of Escherichia coli in freshwater and in situ have been limited. At 63rd St. Beach, Chicago, Ill., factors influencing the daily periodicity of culturable E. coli, particularly insolation, were examined. Water samples for E. coli analysis were collected twice daily between April and September 2000 three times a week along five transects in two depths of water. Hydrometeorological conditions were continuously logged: UV radiation, total insolation, wind speed and direction, wave height, and relative lake level. On 10 days, transects were sampled hourly from 0700 to 1500 h. The effect of sunlight on E. coli inactivation was evaluated with dark and transparent in situ mesocosms and ambient lake water. For the study, the number of E. coli samples collected (n) was 2,676. During sunny days, E. coli counts decreased exponentially with day length and exposure to insolation, but on cloudy days, E. coli inactivation was diminished; the E. coli decay rate was strongly influenced by initial concentration. In situ experiments confirmed that insolation primarily inactivated E. coli; UV radiation only marginally affected E. coli concentration. The relationship between insolation and E. coli density is complicated by relative lake level, wave height, and turbidity, all of which are often products of wind vector. Continuous importation and nighttime replenishment of E. coli were evident. These findings (i) suggest that solar inactivation is an important mechanism for natural reduction of indicator bacteria in large freshwater bodies and (ii) have implications for management strategies of nontidal waters and the use of E. coli as an indicator organism.

AB  - We assessed the potential importance of tidally-driven intrusions of autochthonous protistan plankton into Saanich Inlet, a fjord in Vancouver Island, as potential sources of fossils in the fine intra-annual sediment laminations of ODP cores. We determined the structure of protistan assemblages throughout the Inlet during July 1995 at times of successive neap and spring tides. Results were compared to a concurrent physical study of tidal hows and nutrient advection into and out of the Inlet, which allowed us to identify protistan species indicative of mixed Satellite Channel and stratified Saanich Inlet waters. These identifications were either confirmed or rejected by temporal analyses of protistan assemblages based on weekly sampling at two fixed positions, one in Saanich Inlet and one in Sidney Channel from May through October 1997, Results of both studies supported the hypothesis that the presence of a suite of diatom species, including most Chaetoceros spp., a large-celled variant of Skeletonema costatum and Thalassiosira rotula indicates the intrusion of water with elevated levels of dissolved inorganic nitrogen into Saanich Inlet from the Strait of Georgia. This indicator group of species contained additional species, but not all were observed in large numbers in 1997, Many of these species are important components of the laminated sediments of Saanich Inlet, whose presence is probably indicative of paleo-environmental conditions in the southern Strait of Georgia rather than Saanich Inlet. Effects of tidal cycles on dinoflagellate and other flagellated cells, exclusive of mastigophorans, were inconclusive and additional studies are required to elucidate details of their ecology in waters of the southern Strait of Georgia.

AB  - Annual variation in the feeding value of barley straw (Hordeum vulgare L. subsp. vulgare) is economically significant in the Mediterranean region. The relationship between the feeding value for sheep of several winter-planted barley cultivars and monthly meteorological data was analysed at Tel Hadya, northwest Syria (mean annual precipitation 330 mm) in 11 years. Indicators of feeding value included contents of neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre and nitrogen (11 years), voluntary straw intake by sheep (10 years), voluntary digestible organic matter intake (9 years), in sacco dry matter loss and lignin content (8 years), in vitro digestibility (7 years) and in vitro gas production (6 years). Monthly meteorological data included total precipitation, mean minimum and mean maximum air temperatures.
   Conditions likely to decrease grain yield tended to increase the feeding value of straw. Low mean minimum temperature in February, low precipitation in January, February, March and April, and high mean maximum temperature in March, April and May increased one or more indicators of straw feeding value (by both bivariate and multiple regression, P < 0.05). Precipitation before January affected grain and straw yield but had little effect on the feeding value of straw.
   Genotype x year interactions had a meteorological component; the superior feeding value of the straw of locally-adapted cultivars v. exotic cultivars was only seen in years with cool or wet springs. This has implications for the genetic selection of crops with better straw feeding value.
   Models based on monthly precipitation and temperature, calibrated for locations in the Mediterranean region, can predict the nutritive value of straw and aid the planning of rations for small ruminants.

AB  - We estimated leaf area index (LAI) for Glacier National Park, Montana, U.S.A., by using various methods to measure LAI in the field and correlating these values with Landsat Thematic Mapper data. Ground-based LAI were estimated using sapwood-LAI allometric equations and optical instruments, including the LAI-2000 and a Decagon ceptometer. Optical-based LAI estimates contain nonrandom self-shading therefore, allometric and optical LAIs were compared to calculate coefficients to correct optical LAI data within similar vegetation types and canopy structural conditions. Least-squares regression models were constructed from pooled the ground-based allometric and corrected optical LAI values and from Landsat Thematic Mapper vegetation indices. Average LAI and satellite indices for defined slope, aspect and elevation classes were used in the model calculation, as point estimates were generally poor. The normalized difference vegetation index and a mid-infrared corrected simple ratio had the "best fit" with field LAI values. We applied these two models to the Thematic Mapper indices and tested LAI estimation with independent field LAI data. In addition, we tested the effect of spatial resolution on satellite-estimated LAI values by averaging the Thematic Mapper data into 250 x 250 m grid cells (pixels). Our results showed that the normalized difference vegetation index provided the best estimate of LAI and decreased in accuracy with coarser pixels. The corrected simple ratio index overestimated LAI largely because of difficulty deriving the appropriate reflectance scale of mid-infrared correction to apply to this index at the larger landscape scale investigated here. However, mid-infrared correction of the Thematic Mapper indices was a good indicator of understory canopy cover.

AB  - Interpretations of depositional environments and hydrologic units are made routinely from the study of geophysical well logs. Spontaneous potential (SP) and resistivity logs can be used as indicators of textural parameters. Gamma-ray logs denote lithologic zones based on the presence of radioactive material, particularly in fine-grained sediments. On the South Carolina Coastal Plain, surficial fluvially derived cobbles, sands and clays are characterized by very low radioactivity. Weathered paleosurfaces enriched in hydroxy-interlayered vermiculite (HIV) and associated mica produce higher gamma ray responses at discrete intervals. The underlying sequence of siliciclastic shelf sands, deposited under conditions of eustatic sea-level rise, has high concentrations of smectite and low gamma-ray signatures. Small-scale variability of gamma radiation reflects temporal changes of sub-environments; higher values are recorded in finer-grained, organic-rich nearshore sediments.
   Calcareous Eocene sediments are characterized by highly variable signals on the gamma-ray, SP and resistivity logs. Phosphatic material, smectite and disseminated organic matter produce very high gamma-ray values; corresponding low SP readings are a function of low macro- to microscale porosity resulting from the fine grain size and authigenic pore-filling cement. Intervals that resemble massively bedded chalks at the macroscale are characterized by low gamma-ray and resistivity values and high SP readings. High SP values result from microporosity preserved in biogenic tests rather than intergranular porosity that would be expected for a permeable sand. These observations indicate the importance of incorporating sedimentologic techniques with well-log data for a comprehensive evaluation of subsurface lithologic units.

AB  - Rotational resonance is a solid-state NMR method for restoring homonuclear dipolar couplings in magic angle spinning (MAS) experiments. Measurements of dipolar couplings can be used to determine internuclear distances which in turn provide direct constraints on molecular structure. The dipolar coupling between two spins is estimated from the observed intensity changes in a magnetization exchange experiment carried out while spinning the sample at a rotational resonance condition, i.e. when Delta = n omega(r), where Delta is the difference in chemical shift of two dipole-coupled spins, omega(r) is the rotational frequency in the MAS experiment, and n is a small integer corresponding to the rotational resonance order. Rotational resonance NMR data and calculations are presented for a crystalline 11-residue peptide incorporating pairs of C-13 labels separated by 3.7, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, and 6.8 Angstrom. We discuss the critical parameters in generating and interpreting the magnetization exchange curves that are used to relate the observed intensity changes in the rotational resonance spectra to dipolar couplings. The accuracy of internuclear distance estimates from these experiments depends on the precision of the measurements as well as correctly accounting for natural abundance background signals, the effects of proton B-1 field strengths, and inhomogeneous broadening of the dipole-coupled NMR resonances. For the crystalline 11-residue peptide, the precision and accuracy of the RR distance measurements are on the order of 0.1 and 0.2-0.3 Angstrom, respectively. On the basis of these studies, we outline approaches for determining internuclear distances in both crystalline and non-crystalline solid-state samples.

AB  - An overview of, and information from, a number of publications dealing with the availability, uptake rates and accumulation of metals (e.g. Fe, Cu, Cr, Cd, Pb) and organic substances (e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and pesticides) by submersed and floating macrophytes are provided.
   Differences in metal enrichment are reported to be dependent mainly on the plant species, the seasonal growth rate changes, the tissue age, and metal or compound type.  A brief review of the possible sites of absorption and accumulation of substances by the macrophytes is given and the role played by the roots and shoots is discussed.  A higher concentration of metals in the plants usually, but not always, indicates a proportional increase in element levels in the water and/or sediments.  Consequently, the implications for the use of macrophytes as phytogeochemical indicators for metals and other toxic materials in water bodies are also evaluated.  Competition between elements and factors, indirectly influencing metal uptake such as, for example, light conditions and eutrophication, seem to limit in some cases the utility of using macrophytes as bio-indicators.
   Further, the effects of metals, particularly Cu and Cr, and a few other organic compounds on growth and photosynthesis of some species are described.
   In considering all these aspects, the importance of several environmental factors (e.g. pH, water hardness, nutrient concentration) in influencing the macrophyte-toxic compound cycle occurring in aquatic systems has been emphasized.  It has been noted how contradictory results often emerge because of the large differences existing both in sampling time and in the methods used by different working groups.
   As a general rule, it seems extremely difficult to extrapolate field results from one species to another.

AB  - DNA hypermethylation caused by environmental pollutants like cadmium (Cd) has already been demonstrated in many invertebrates, including earthworms. However, the exact epigenetic mechanisms that drive this hypermethylation are largely unknown and even basic DNA methylation and demethylation processes are hardly characterized. Therefore, we used an important bioindicator, the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris, as a model organism to determine time-and dose-dependent effects of Cd on global and gene-specific DNA methylation and its underlying mechanisms. We revealed Cd-induced adenine and cytosine hypermethylation using specific antibodies in dot blots and found that the methylation level of adenine compared to cytosine changed even to a bigger extent. However, the levels of hydroxymethylated cytosine did not differ between treatment groups. General methylation and demethylation components like methyltransferases (DNMT1 and 3), and ten-eleven translocation (TET) genes were confirmed in L. terrestris by quantitative RealTime PCR. However, neither gene expression, nor DNMT and TET enzyme activity showed significant differences in the Cd exposure groups. Using bisulfite conversion and sequencing, gene body methylation (gbm) of metallothionein 2 (MT2), one of the most important detoxification proteins, was characterized. Cd-dependent changes in MT2 gbm could, however, not be correlated to MT2 gene activity evaluated by quantitative RealTime PCR. Future directions as well as missing links are discussed in the present study hinting towards the importance of studying epigenetic marks and mechanistic insights in a broad variety of species to deepen our knowledge on the effects of changing environmental conditions.

AB  - An important role has been recently reported for bacterial biofilm in the pathophysiology of chronic diseases, such as chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). CRS, affecting sinonasal mucosa, is a persistent inflammatory condition with a high prevalence around the world. Although the exact pathological mechanism of this disease has not been elicited yet, biofilm formation is known to lead to a more significant symptom burden and major objective clinical indicators. The high prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria has severely restricted the application of antibiotics in recent years. Furthermore, systemic antibiotic therapy, on top of its insufficient concentration to eradicate bacteria in the sinonasal biofilm, often causes toxicity, antibiotic resistance, and an effect on the natural microbiota, in patients. Thus, coming up with alternative therapeutic options instead of systemic antibiotic therapy is emphasized in the treatment of bacterial biofilm in CRS patients. The use of topical antibiotic therapy and antibiotic eluting sinus stents that induce higher antibiotic concentration, and decrease side effects could be helpful. Besides, recent research recognized that various natural products, nitric oxide, and bacteriophage therapy, in addition to the hindered biofilm formation, could degrade the established bacterial biofilm. However, despite these improvements, new antibacterial agents and CRS biofilm interactions are complicated and need extensive research. Finally, most studies were performed in vitro, and more preclinical animal models and human studies are required to confirm the collected data. The present review is specifically discussing potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of bacterial biofilm in CRS patients.

AB  - Background and gaps. The topic of indoor air quality (IAQ) in low-energy buildings has received increasing interest over the past few years. Often based on two measurement points and on passive measurements over one week, IAQ studies are struggling to allow the calculation of pollutants exposure. Objectives. We would like to improve the evaluation of the health impacts, through measurements able to estimate the exposure of the occupants. Methodology. This article presents detailed IAQ measurements taken in an energy-efficient occupied house in France. Two campaigns were conducted in winter and spring. Total volatile organic compounds (TVOC), formaldehyde, the particle numbers and PM2.5, carbon dioxide (CO2), relative humidity (RH), temperature (T), ventilation airflows, and weather conditions were dynamically measured in several points. Laboratory and low-cost devices were used, and an inter-comparison was carried out for them. A survey was conducted to record all the daily activities of the inhabitants. IAQ performance indicators based on the different pollutants were calculated. Results. PM2.5 cumulative exposure did not exceed the threshold available in the literature. Formaldehyde concentrations were high, in the kitchen, where the average concentrations exceeded the threshold. However, the formaldehyde cumulative exposure of the occupants did not exceed the threshold. TVOC concentrations were found to reach the threshold. With these measurements performed with high spatial and temporal discretization, we showed that such detailed data allow for a better-quality health impacts assessment and for a better understanding of the transport of pollutants between rooms.

AB  - The traditional approach to modeling productive efficiency assumes that technology is constant across the sample. However, farms in different regions may face different production opportunities, and the technologies they employ may differ due to environmental factors. Therefore, rather than using a traditional stochastic frontier model in such cases, a stochastic meta-frontier (SMF) analysis is recommended to account for environmental factors between regions. It follows that differences in environmental factors between the upland and lowland regions in Anambra State, Nigeria, may result in farmers producing rice under different production and environmental conditions. Using the SMF model, this study, for the first time, determines technical efficiency (TE) and technological gap ratios (TGRs) of rice production from the upland and lowland regions in the Awka North Local Government Area of Anambra State, Nigeria. Our data are from a cross-section sample of randomly selected rice farmers. Results reveal that lowland regional rice producers are on average, significantly more technically efficient (91.7%) than their upland counterparts (84.2%). Additionally, mean TGRs associated with lowland rice farmers are higher (92.1%) than their corresponding upland producers (84.7%). While the upland rice producers are less technically efficient and further away from their full potential, results indicate that both sets of farmers do not use advanced technologies to match the industry's potential. We suggest that agricultural policy should focus on providing regionally specific technologies, such as improved rice varieties that fit the working environment of the lagging area, to help rice farmers improve their resource efficiency and minimize technological gaps.

AB  - For more than a century, the coal-mining industry has been a major economic force and employer in the Appalachian region of eastern USA. As national and global energy economies experience rapid change, Appalachian mining is declining in a way that appears permanent.
   Coal mining, however, has left its mark on the region's lands, waters, and people. Most mined lands have soils, plant and wildlife communities that differ from those present in the region's existing native forests and are not used for economically valued purposes. Non-native plants are prominent on many former mine sites. Mined areas typically produce waters with elevated geologic-origin pollutants, major ions and trace elements, and support biotas differing from those present in waters flowing from the region's native forests. Human communities also reflect the region's mining history, as economic, education, and human-health indicators in intensive coalmining areas lag those elsewhere in the region. These effects are evident as coal-mining declines to levels last seen in the late 19th century and with little prospect of recovery. As the people of the Appalachian coalfield look to the future, they do so while bearing that legacy. Here, we describe the condition of Appalachia's resources as they have been influenced by mining. We also look to the future by presenting opportunities for conversion of the region's extensive mined lands to beneficial uses and offering our perspective on prospects for Appalachia's coalmined areas.

AB  - In the present work a comparative exergy analysis, multi-objective optimization, as well as extended environmental analysis of a geothermal-based power and refrigeration system, is carried out. Different arrangements with the ammonia-water refrigeration cycle, organic Rankine cycle (ORC), and thermoelectric generator (TEG) are investigated. The current work novelties are the presentation of a novel power -refrigeration system driven by a geothermal source and the employment of TEG units to recover geothermal energy, besides extended environmental assessment. The results of sensitivity analysis indicate that the highest net output work capacity is for the suggested system (configuration 3). Exergy analysis exhibits that in all cases, the absorber has the highest exergy destruction rate and one of the lowest exergy efficiency because it is the first component, which gains the heat from the geothermal source. The suggested system produces 495.2 kW net output power and the highest energy efficiency of 19.42%, which are 131.7 kW, and 3.84% higher than configuration 1(base system). Optimization results represent that in the optimum point, Wnet shows about 33.3% improvement compared with the un-optimized condition. It is found that configuration 3 which consists of cogeneration with two loops of ammonia-water power cycle with refrigeration system along with an additional thermoelectric generator for enhanced waste heat recovery has the highest environmental footprints because of multiple components installed that would occupy more space, electricity, materials, and other resources for its construction, operation, maintenance, and end-of life.

AB  - Mesoscale convective cloud clusters develop and organize in the formof squall lines along the coastalAmazon in the afternoon hours and propagate inland during the evening hours. The frequency, location, organization into lines, and movement of the convective systems are determined by analyzing the "precipitation features'' obtained from the TRMM satellite for the period 1998-2014. The convective clusters and their alignments into Amazon coastal squall lines are more frequent fromDecember to July, and theymostly stay within 170 km of the coastline. Their development andmovement in the afternoon and evening hours of about 14ms(-1) are helped by the sea breeze. Negative phase of Atlantic dipole and La Nina combined increase the frequency of convective clusters over the coastal Amazon. Composite environmental conditions of 13 large Amazon coastal squall-line cases in April show that conditional instability increases from 0900 to 1200 LT and the wind profiles show a jet-like structure at low levels of the atmosphere. The differences in the vertical profiles of temperature and humidity between the large-squall-line composites and no-squall-line composites are weak. However, appreciable increase in themean value of CAPE from 0900 to 1500 LT is found in the large-squall-line composite. Themeanmixing ratio of themixed layer at 0900 LT in La Nina situations is significantly larger in the large-squall-line composite. Thus, CAPE and mixed-layer mixing ratio are considered to be promising indicators of the convective activity over the coastal belt of the Amazon basin.

AB  - The impact of the Great Recession on health stands out due to its implications for the wellbeing of the population. The available empirical evidence suggests that macrosocial inequalities can be a central element in explaining differences in the impact of the crisis on the health of the population during its early years (2008-2011). Specifically, it is necessary to analyze the role played by the processes constituting a model of inequalities based on social exclusion. This study addresses the topic by using longitudinal data taken from the European Union statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC) survey (n = 5.924), with a hierarchical structure of four measurement moments nested in 5,924 individuals nested in 17 regions. Variables from two levels of analysis are considered: individual and ecological (regional) variables. The findings show that personal socioeconomic status (income and education) are significantly associated with changes in self-rated health during the onset of the crisis. The findings for ecological variables show that the variables measuring exclusion (material deprivation and low work intensity) play a significant role in the explanation of inequalities in health and how they changed during the crisis. Both indicators are negatively associated with self-rated health, while the Gini index and the proportion of the population in long-term unemployment do not have a consistent significant effect. These findings support the hypothesis that there are higher risks to wellbeing in more unequal societies compared with more equal societies.

AB  - Organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) are posing great threat to the environment and human health, due to their overuse and persistence in the environment. Photolysis has been established as an effective method to degrade OPs. The influence of pH value, the initial concentration of pesticides and the light source on the photolysis of two OPs, including chlorpyrifos and dimethoate, was investigated. The optimal reaction condition for OPs degradation was under pH 9, with xenon lamp as the light source, in which the photodegradation efficiencies of chlorpyrifos and dimethoate (500 mg/L) were 75.12% and 94.31%, respectively. The photodegradation products of chlorpyrifos and dimethoate were identified by GC-MS. Also, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to characterize the molecular properties of chlorpyrifos and dimethoate, as well as predicting potential photolysis reactions. Photodegradation mechanisms of chlorpyrifos and dimethoate were proposed, in which 3,5,6-trichloropyridinol (TCP), O,O-diethyl thiophosphate (DETP), 2,3,5-Trichloro-6-methoxypyridine (TMP) and O,O,S-trimethyl phosphorothioate were identified as the main products of chlorpyrifos degradation. Omethoate, O,O,S-trimethyl thiophosphorothioate, N-methyl-2-sulfanylacetamide, O,O,O-trimethyl thiophosphate, O,O,S-trimethylphosphorothiate, and O,O,O-trimethyl phosphoric ester as the main photodegradation products for dimethoate. The main degradation mechanisms included ring opening, cleavage, oxidation and demethylation. This work demonstrated the feasibility of combining chemical analysis with quantum chemical calculation in unraveling degradation mechanisms of OPs. Also, it is of great significance for evaluating the environmental fate of OPs in aquatic system and further environmental risk assessment.

AB  - Climate models predict an increase in the severity and the frequency of droughts. Tropical forests are among the ecosystems that could be highly impacted by these droughts. Here, we explore how hydraulic and photochemical processes respond to drought stress and re-watering. We conducted a pot experiment on saplings of five tree species. Before the onset of drought, we measured a set of hydraulic traits, including minimum leaf conductance, leaf embolism resistance and turgor loss point. During drought stress, we monitored traits linked to leaf hydraulic functioning (leaf water potential (Psi(md)) and stomatal conductance (g(s))) and traits linked to leaf photochemical functioning (maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (F-v/F-m) and maximum electron transport rate (ETRmax)) at different wilting stages. After re-watering, the same traits were measured after 3, 7 and 14 days. Hydraulic trait values decreased faster than photochemical trait values. After re-watering, the values of the four traits recovered at different rates. F-v/F-m recovered very fast close to their initial values only 3 days after re-watering. This was followed by ETRmax, Psi(md) and g(s). Finally, we show that species with large stomatal and leaf safety margin and low pi(tlp) are not strongly impacted by drought, whereas they have a low recovery on photochemical efficiency. These results demonstrate that pi(tlp), stomatal and leaf safety margin are a good indicators of plant responses to drought stress and also to recovery for photochemical efficiency.

TI  - Characterizing juvenile salmon predation risk during early marine residence
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Predation mortality can influence the distribution and abundance of fish populations. While predation is often assessed using direct observations of prey consumption, potential predation can be predicted from co-occurring predator and prey densities under varying environmental conditions. Juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. (i.e., smolts) from the Columbia River Basin experience elevated mortality during the transition from estuarine to ocean habitat, but a thorough understanding of the role of predation remains incomplete. We used a Holling type II functional response to estimate smolt predation risk based on observations of piscivorous seabirds (sooty shearwater [Ardenna griseus] and common murre [Uria aalge]) and local densities of alternative prey fish including northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) in Oregon and Washington coastal waters during May and June 2010-2012. We evaluated predation risk relative to the availability of alternative prey and physical factors including turbidity and Columbia River plume area, and compared risk to returns of adult salmon. Seabirds and smolts consistently co-occurred at sampling stations throughout most of the study area (mean = 0.79 +/- 0.41, SD), indicating that juvenile salmon are regularly exposed to avian predators during early marine residence. Predation risk for juvenile coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch), yearling Chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha), and subyearling Chinook salmon was on average 70% lower when alternative prey were present. Predation risk was greater in turbid waters, and decreased as water clarity increased. Juvenile coho and yearling Chinook salmon predation risk was lower when river plume surface areas were greater than 15,000 km(2), while the opposite was estimated for subyearling Chinook salmon. These results suggest that plume area, turbidity, and forage fish abundance near the mouth of the Columbia River, all of which are influenced by river discharge, are useful indicators of potential juvenile salmon mortality that could inform salmonid management.

AB  - Objective: Analyze whether the use of Z codes in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) correlates with the socioeconomic reality of the population attended.
   Design: Observational, descriptive, cross-sectional, ecological study.
   Location: 90 health centres of two Primary Health Care (PHC) Departments of the Community of Madrid.
   Participants: The total number of patients treated during 2016: 1,920,124 (54.33% women, 45.67% men). The 7.15% received some Z code (67.29% women, 32.71% men).
   Main measurements: As a dependent variable, the proportion of patients with Z code records in their EHRs was established. As independent variable, two socioeconomic indicators were selected that objectively reflect the differences between Basic Health Areas: Average Income Available per capita and Proportion of Economic Immigrants. To evaluate the correlation between dependent and independent variables, a multivariate correlation-regression analysis was used.
   Results: It was observed that the higher the disposable income, the lower the proportion of Z code records in the EHRs (Pearson correlation coefficient: -0.56). However, there is a great variability in the registration of Z codes and the coding fails to make visible the socio-economic realities of the populations covered (Diagnostic Odds Ratio: 0.12. CI: 0.05-0.32).
   Conclusions: The use of different tools that facilitate the visualization of the health impact of social inequalities, as well as their evaluation through various research methodologies, is relevant for a community orientation of the PHC. The Z codes do not make visible in the studied area the social determinants of health of the population attended. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

AB  - Long karst spring discharge series were analyzed to determine trends, fluctuations and relationship to climate. The data came from two karst aquifers, Picentini and Matese massifs in southern Italy, and in some cases cover more than 100 years of records. The long-term hydrological series of these springs aid the understanding of water-resource availability variations under climate change, given the systematic discharge records and the absence of human-made alteration of the natural conditions in most of the spring catchments. The performances of five three-parameter probability distribution functions (generalized logistic, lognormal, Pearson type III, generalized extreme values and Weibull) for frequency analysis of the hydrological series were investigated, and evaluated also for the fit of extreme values of both tails of the distributions. The Weibull distribution was chosen in most cases. Then, each spring discharge value was transformed into the Z value of the standard normal distribution, which allows a statistical comparison between different spring discharge series and other climate variables. In particular, the relationship between the spring discharge, rainfall, North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and temperature series were investigated, also by linear correlations and trend detection tests. The analyses proved a general decrease of spring discharge over the last few decades. This decrease does not seem to depend only on precipitation change; an important role was played by the temperature increase. The discharge trends of these karst springs may provide a robust climate indicator of a wide area of southern Italy, as well as of a large sector of the Mediterranean area.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment are an exposure risk to humans and animals and is emerging as a global public health concern. In this study, mercury (Hg) driven co-selection of ARGs was investigated under controlled conditions in two Australian non-agricultural soils with differing pH. Soils were spiked with increasing concentrations of inorganic Hg and left to age for 5 years. Both soils contained ARGs conferring resistance to tetracycline (tetA, tetB), sulphonamides (sul1), trimethoprim (dfrA1) and the ARG indicator class 1 integron-integrase gene, intI1, as measured by qPCR. The last resort antibiotic vancomycin resistance gene, vanB and quinolone resistance gene, qnrS were not detected. Hg driven co-selection of several ARGs namely intI1, tetA and tetB were observed in the alkaline soil within the tested Hg concentrations. No co-selection of the experimental ARGs was observed in the neutral pH soil. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed proliferation of Proteobacteria and Bacteriodetes in Hg contaminated neutral and alkaline soils respectively. Multivariate analyses revealed a strong effect of Hg, soil pH and organic carbon content on the co-selection of ARGs in the experimental soils. Additionally, although aging caused a significant reduction in Hg content, agriculturally important bacterial phyla such as Nitrospirae did not regrow in the contaminated soils. The results suggest that mercury can drive co-selection of ARGs in contaminated non-agricultural soils over five years of aging which is linked to soil microbiota shift and metal chemistry in the soil.

AB  - The use of natural dyes in foods enhances the product quality and they are also associated with anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects. Therefore, they play significant role in human health. Chlorophyll is used as a natural pigment in a variety of foods. This study aims to prepare the extract and chlorophyll from Persian clover (Trifolium resupinatumL.), using enzymatic and ultrasound methods and evaluation of their antioxidant and physicochemical properties. In the present study, the chlorophyll stability was evaluated in different conditions including temperature (- 18, 4 and 10 degrees C), time (15, 30 and 45 days), pH (4.5 and 5.5) and NaCl concentration (50, 100 and 150 mM). The results showed the chlorophyll a concentration was approximately as twice as the chlorophyll b concentration. In all of the experiments, the enzymatic method has shown better efficiency than the ultrasound one. Also, with the increment of extract concentration, the DPPH free radical scavenging and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) as well as total phenolic compounds, anthocyanin, and flavonoids were increased dramatically. Due to the higher efficiency of enzymatic extraction, the stability assessments were performed based on this method. The result demonstrated that 50 mM of NaCl, temperature - 18 degrees C, pH 4.5 and time 15 days were associated with the highest chlorophyll a and b values. According to the results the enzymatic method to prepare clover extract and its chlorophyll can be used as an efficient method for indicator pigment production in food and pharmaceutical industries. However, further testing is needed to achieve more information.

AB  - Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatasL.), typically cultivated in temperate climates under low inputs, is one of the most important crops worldwide. Abscisic acid (ABA) is an important plant stress-induced phytohormone. Hitherto, few works analyzed the ABA function in sweet potato tissue growth. Very scarce information is available concerning the ABA role in sweet potato response to water scarcity conditions. Here, we show the ABA content variation in shoots and tubers of eight sweet potato accessions subjected to drought stress. ABA was also related to other resistance traits, such as chlorophyll content index (CCI), carbon isotopic discrimination (Delta C-13), oxalic acid (OA) and water use efficiency (WUE), to assess stress response mechanisms to water deficit between their organs. The most resilient drought-stressed sweet potato plants accumulated ABA-shoot, and significantly decreased the ABA-tuber content. ABA signaling was related to Delta C-13 and CCI decrease and WUE increment, as an attempt to cope with water stress by partially closing the stomata. The partial closure of stomata could be in part due to the presence of OA-shoots, known to affect the intensity of the ABA-shoot signal in stomatal closure. Higher CCI content and minimal Delta C-13-shoot differences indicated good carboxylation fractionation, with higher Delta C-13-tuber content as an indicator of efficient tuber(13)C fixation and growth. Our work demonstrated that ABA could be used in conjunction with the other traits studied for the assessment of sweet potato whole-plant responses to environmental stresses, and thus aid the selection of the best drought tolerant genotypes for breeding programs.

AB  - Premise Soil salinity negatively impacts plant function, development, and yield. To overcome this impediment to agricultural productivity, variation in morphological and physiological response to salinity among genotypes of important crops should be explored. Sorghum bicoloris a staple crop that has adapted to a variety of environmental conditions and contains a significant amount of standing genetic diversity, making it an exemplary species to study variation in salinity tolerance. Methods Twenty-one diverseSorghumaccessions were treated with nonsaline water or 75 mM sodium chloride. Salinity tolerance was assessed via changes in biomass between control and salt-treated individuals. Accessions were first rank-ordered for salinity tolerance, and then individuals spanning a wide range of responses were analyzed for foliar proline and ion accumulation. Tolerance rankings were then overlaid on a neighbor-joining tree. Results We found that, while proline is often a good indicator of osmotic adjustment and is historically associated with increased salt tolerance in many species, proline accumulation in sorghum reflects a stress response injury rather than acclimation. When combining ion profiles with stress tolerance indices, the variation observed in tolerance was not a sole result of Na(+)accumulation, but rather reflected accession-specific mechanisms. Conclusions We identified significant variation in salinity tolerance amongSorghumaccessions that may be a result of the domestication history ofSorghum. When we compared our results with known phylogenetic relationships within sorghum, the most parsimonious explanation for our findings is that salinity tolerance was acquired early during domestication and subsequently lost in accessions growing in areas varying in soil salinity.

AB  - Arsenolipids include a wide range of organic arsenic species that occur naturally in seafood and thereby contribute to human arsenic exposure. Recently arsenic-containing phosphatidylcholines (AsPCs) were identified in caviar, fish, and algae. In this first toxicological assessment of AsPCs, we investigated the stability of both the oxo- and thioxo-form of an AsPC under experimental conditions, and analyzed cell viability, indicators of genotoxicity and biotransformation in human liver cancer cells (HepG2). Precise toxicity data could not be obtained owing to the low solubility in the cell culture medium of the thioxo-form, and the ease of hydrolysis of the oxo-form, and to a lesser degree the thioxo-form. Hydrolysis resulted amongst others in the respective constituent arsenic-containing fatty acid (AsFA). Incubation of the cells with oxo-AsPC resulted in a toxicity similar to that determined for the hydrolysis product oxo-AsFA alone, and there were no indices for genotoxicity. Furthermore, the oxo-AsPC was readily taken up by the cells resulting in high cellular arsenic concentrations (50 mu M incubation: 1112 +/- 146 mu M As cellular), whereas the thioxo-AsPC was substantially less bioavailable (50 mu M incubation: 293 +/- 115 mu M As cellular). Speciation analysis revealed biotransformation of the AsPCs to a series of AsFAs in the culture medium, and, in the case of the oxo-AsPC, to as yet unidentified arsenic species in cell pellets. The results reveal the difficulty of toxicity studies of AsPCsin vitro, indicate that their toxicity might be largely governed by their arsenic fatty acid content and suggest a multifaceted human metabolism of food derived complex arsenolipids.

AB  - Increasing atmospheric greenhouse gasses (GHGs) is a major cause of rising global temperatures. The first part of this study quantifies emission reduction of greenhouse gases by shifting the mode of transport from vehicles including vans, buses, 3-wheelers and motorcycles to Metro Bus System (MBS), Lahore.. Secondly, the study assesses the sustainability of MBS through a set of specific indicators. A survey was conducted to categorize the passengers according to their modes of transportation and travel distance before the metro bus. Fuel type, mileage and average passenger capacity of vehicles information was collected in order to estimate the levels of GHG emissions. The net reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) was 14242.66, 159.68 and 632.03 tonnes CO2-e, respectively. The total annual reduction of GHGs was 15034.38 metric tons CO2-e (59.25%) by MBS project. The annual emissions of GHGs per passenger kilometer were 1.06 kg CO2-e by MBS. Before the MBS, this value was 4.41 kg CO2-e for different vehicles. The total annual fuel reduction was 6574.52 kL (kiloliters). Significant social, economic, cultural, and environmental sustainability can generally be associated with the implementation of MBS, Lahore. However, MBS should transition to renewable fuel for climate change mitigation and sustainable development. In addition, disaster management problems exist due to a lack of emergency plans/routes and the poor condition of firefighting equipment. Officials must improve traffic flow and parking while promoting alternatives to personal vehicle use. In so doing, sustainability will increase safety and livability in the urban environment.

AB  - A field study was conducted to assess the long-term effects of no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT), and the short-term effects following tillage conversion from CT to NT (NTn) and from NT to CT (CTn) on soil quality (SQ) indicators in a semi-humid climate. First, plots of a long-term tillage experiment on a Luvic Phaeozem initiated in 1986 were split into two subplots in 2012, yielding four treatments: NT, CT, NTn and CTn. In 2015, composite soil samples were collected from each treatment and from a natural site (Ref) at depths 0-5, 5-10, 10-20 and 0-20 cm. Several indicators were determined: soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (SON); particulate organic C (POM-C) and N (POM-N); potential N mineralization (PMN) and soil respiration (R-s). Moreover, bulk density was determined in long-term tillage systems. Different ratios between indicators were calculated, with emphasis on its function in the agroecosystem, that is functional indicators. Significant differences in SOC, SON and PMN were found between CT and NT at most depths. In contrast, 3 years after tillage conversion, only a part of the SQ indicators studied were modified mainly at the 0-10 cm depth. The functional indicators showed differences between tillage systems in the long-term and after short-term tillage conversion depending on the depth; however, the PMN/SON ratio demonstrated differences at all depths. Under these conditions, this ratio-related to easily mineralizable N fraction proved to be a promising indicator for assessing SQ under contrasting tillage systems regardless of the sampling depth.

AB  - Artificial soil (AS) with a dark-brown appearance and high soil organic matter (SOM) was manufactured under hydrothermal conditions from poor sandy landfill using the 'hydrothermal humification process.' This approach may retrosynthesize the natural clay-humin complex, which is the main contributor for water and ion binding in fertile, natural soils. The structure and morphology of as-created organic-inorganic composites was examined, and it was shown that the as-created artificial SOM (A-SOM) indeed tightly binds to the mineral surfaces, thus creating remediated soil or more general AS. A-SOM does not change the bulk structure of the involved inorganic minerals but activates their surface. Depending on the biomass used as the starting product, the high effectivity of synthetic humification improves the organic carbon and nitrogen content when compared with the employed sandy soil (SS). The composition was adjusted to be comparable with a reference sample of cultivated soil (2.92% in C content and 7.8% in SOM) to enable a fair referencing. We then analyzed the most frequently used soil quality indicators for agricultural land use and found strong water retention and nutrient conservation, which reflects the successful restoration of mineral-humus conjugation. Pure ASs provide superior performance in the analyzed series, whereas simulated soils (mixture of SS and AS) still exhibit satisfactory capacities of water and ion bonding. The values were found to be very similar to cultivated soils sampled from Germany and Harbin, China.

AB  - Crop production guidelines in Brazil currently focus on soil fertility or chemical indicators (i.e., soil pH and nutrient availability) but often neglect physical and biological aspects of soil health. No-tillage (NT) practices have been widely adopted in Brazil primarily to mitigate erosion, but chemical-based guidelines associated with those practices may be contributing to nutrient stratification and a concentration of crop roots within the top few centimeters of the soil profile. Our objective was to quantify relationships between soil physical and chemical attributes and root growth in soils with a long-term NT history (> 10-yr). Crop root development and several soil health indicators were measured within the 0 to 7-, 7- to 17- and 20- to 30-cm depth increments of two long-term NT studies on Rhodic Hapludox soils in Brazil. Data from both experiments showed strong organic carbon (OC) stratification, significant differences in soil physical and chemical attributes, and root systems that were concentrated within the surface layer. Soil compaction below 7-cm appeared to be the dominant factor limiting root growth. Soil-test phosphorus (P) and OC were also correlated to root growth. Based on these analyses and other on-farm observations, we concluded that it is important to recognize that despite its benefits, NT practices can result in plant root stratification. Therefore, it is important to not only monitor soil fertility/chemical conditions, but also soil structure and biological indicators of soil health when developing NT guidelines for Brazil.

AB  - This work provides information on nitrification with nitrite accumulation in low strength ammonia (below 50 mg L-1 NH4-N) and low organic matter (below 150 mg L-1 COD) reclaimed wastewater. In the South Tenerife reclaimed wastewater pipeline (62 km long), injection of O-2 has been applied to promote a nitrification process in order to improve water quality and to avoid anaerobic conditions. Nitrification occurs, in most cases, with nitrite accumulation. The amount of oxidized nitrogen compounds produced increases with the oxygen dose applied. The nitrification process is usually favoured instead of the organic matter transformation, due to the low organic matter/ammonia nitrogen ratio of water. The influence of organic matter content on nitrification has been analysed, and a good suitability for COD has been found as an indicator for nitrification limitation (for the range of COD and NH4-N concentrations of the system). Nitrification limitation has been observed above 85 mg L-1 COD, and nitrification inhibition above a concentration of 105 mg L-1. In addition, the limitation of nitrite oxidation bacteria activity (nitrite accumulation) by free ammonia and temperature has been assessed, finding that, for the range of free ammonia (0.6-2.1 mg L-1 NH3) and temperature (20.4-27.0 degrees C) in the study, temperature plays a much more relevant role than free ammonia on nitrite accumulation. The lower limiting temperature for nitrite build-up in the system has been 21.0 degrees C. Below this temperature, nitrite accumulation did not exist or was very low.

AB  - The demand for cultural ecosystem services (CES) is increasing, and aesthetic values contribute substantially to attract visitors to mountain regions, enhancing the socio-economic well-being. While most studies focused on the assessment of aesthetic values under current conditions, this study aimed to evaluate the historic development of aesthetic values from the perspective of today by analysing changes in the actual supply of this CES along roads and paths in Solden in the Otztal valley (Austria) since the beginning of tourism. We first mapped roads and paths for five time steps over the last 150 years to then estimate aesthetic values along these infrastructures, using a spatially explicit modelling approach. Furthermore, we compared spatial patterns of visitation preferences derived from social media data with predicted aesthetic values. Our results indicate that an increased access to areas of high aesthetic values was related to general increases in the supply of aesthetic values until 1950. Although the accessibility to high-elevation areas continued to increase until 2017, aesthetic values generally decreased due to landscape changes induced by the shift from mainly agricultural to touristic use. The abandonment of alpine pastures occurred mainly above the forest belt, which coincides with high levels of photo density, as most pictures were taken around mountain huts and on mountain peaks. If carefully planned and managed, mountain regions may actively enhance aesthetic experiences and foster the touristic use by providing good infrastructure, but land use policies and landscape management should support agricultural activities to maintain high levels of aesthetic values.

AB  - Antigen specific immunotherapy aims to tolerise patients to specific autoantigens that are responsible for the pathology of an autoimmune disease. Immune tolerance is generated in conditions where the immune response is suppressed and thus gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are an attractive drug delivery platform due to their anti-inflammatory effects and their potential to facilitate temporal and spatial delivery of a peptide autoantigen in conjunction with pro-tolerogenic elements. In this study we have covalently attached an autoantigen, currently under clinical evaluation for the treatment of type 1 diabetes (PIC19-A3 peptide), to AuNPs to create nanoscale (< 5 nm), negatively charged (-40 to -60 mV) AuNP-peptide complexes for immunotherapy. We also employ a clinically approved microneedle delivery system, MicronJet600, to facilitate minimally-invasive intradermal delivery of the nanoparticle constructs to target skin-resident antigen presenting cells, which are known to be apposite target cells for immunotherapy. The AuNP-peptide complexes remain physically stable upon extrusion through microneedles and when delivered into ex vivo human skin they are able to diffuse rapidly and widely throughout the dermis (their site of deposition) and, perhaps more surprisingly, the overlying epidermal layer. Intracellular uptake was extensive, with Langerhans cells proving to be the most efficient cells at internalising the AuNP-peptide complex (94% of the local population within the treated region of skin). In vitro studies showed that uptake of the AuNP-peptide complexes by dendritic cells reduced the capacity of these cells to activate naive T cells. This indicator of biological functionality encourages further development of the AuNP-peptide formulation, which is now being evaluated in clinical trials.

AB  - The degradation of freshwater resources and loss of freshwater biodiversity by anthropogenic activities, including agriculture, are of major global concern. Together with diffuse pollutants, point sources, such as where cattle have direct access to riparian margins and watercourses, can potentially present significant environmental challenges. These can include impacts on stream morphology, increased sedimentation, nutrient additions, microbial contamination, and impacts on aquatic biota. Mitigation measures aimed at reducing these frequently include reducing the amount of time cattle spend in riparian margins and watercourses. This is often accomplished through the provision of an alternative water supply and grazing management, or even cattle exclusion measures. Although a number of studies refer to potential negative impacts, there has been little attempt to review previous research on this topic. The key aim of this paper is to collate and review these disparate studies, as well as those relating to the effectiveness of mitigation measures. Although it is difficult to draw generalizations from studies due to the inherent variability between and within catchments, evidence pertaining to impacts in relation to sedimentation, pathogens, and riparian margin vegetation were strong. Conclusions in relation to impacts on stream morphology and nutrient parameters were less clear, whereas studies on responses of macroinvertebrate communities were particularly variable, with differences due to cattle access difficult to separate from catchment scale effects. A greater understanding of the impact of cattle access on watercourses under varying conditions will help inform policymakers on the cost effectiveness of existing management criteria and will help in revising existing measures.

AB  - Adsorbents used in adsorption processes play an important role in wastewater treatment technologies. It is therefore of interest how manufactured adsorbents can perform better or be more efficient. Is the adsorption capacity a sufficient indicator to select a good adsorbent? In this study, two nanoadsorbents of Hg(II) were successfully synthesized. They are magnetic graphene oxide (MGO-NH-SH) and magnetic nanoparticle (Fe3O4@SiO-NH-SH), both functionalized with a thiol group, acetylcysteine. The nanoadsorbents, in addition to their adsorption capacity, were investigated from the viewpoints of reuse and regeneration, economic costs, and environmental impact (carbon footprint). The prepared nanoadsorbents were characterized by FTIR, XRD, TGA, FE-SEM, VSM, AFM, Raman, and elemental analysis. Their adsorption of Hg(II) fits well with the Langmuir isotherm model and follows the pseudo-second-order kinetics. Under optimal conditions, the results of Hg(II) removal from real wastewater and polluted water by MGO-NHSH exhibited a higher adsorption capacity, reuse, and regeneration, and as well lower cost and greenhouse gas emissions compared to Fe3O4@SiO-NH-SH. The findings of the present study highlight that MGO-NHSH as a promising adsorbent is more economically and environmentally friendly than Fe3O4@SiO-NH-SH in the efficient removal of Hg(II) from real wastewater and polluted water.

AB  - The traditional Kazakh village of the nomadic mode of life functioned as a structure-forming "block" of the community - the main form of self-organization of the ethnic group, the process of reproduction of conditions and means to a normal existence in pre-industrial society. Unsurpassed sources for the study of the traditional Kazakh village, its economic, social and cultural life are the studies of pre-revolutionary Russian authors - scientists, government officials, etc.
   These works, written by highly skilled specialists of their time, provide diverse and extremely important information that helps modern historians restore the picture of the life of nomadic and semi-settled Kazakhs in that post-reform period (late XIX - early XX century). At the same time, the most representative sources giving a complete picture of the life of the nomadic village among the Kazakhs are, undoubtedly, the published results of the statistical commissions researching the territory of Kazakhstan ("Materials on Kyrgyz Land Use..." and others).
   Therefore, more attention was paid to this particular group of sources. Published materials of expeditions organized by the royal administration in the second half of the XIX century - the first decade of the XX century, contain well-organized statistical information and very serious analytical materials on such key indicators of Kazakh society as "social structure", "property relations" about land use in nomadic environment, mediated by ownership of livestock, "subsistence system", "traditions (methods and strategy) of environmental management", "relationships with alien population", "dynamics of the political structure of nomadic society in the historical context ", etc.

AB  - Environmental antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) can be transferred to humans through foods. Fresh produce in particular is an ideal vector due to frequent raw consumption. A major contamination source of fresh produce is irrigation water. We hypothesized that water quality significantly affects loads of ARB and their diversity on fresh produce despite various other contamination sources present under agricultural practice conditions. Chive irrigated from an open-top reservoir or sterile-filtered water (control) was examined. Heterotrophic plate counts (HPC) and ARB were determined for water and chive with emphasis on Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. High HPC of freshly planted chive decreased over time and were significantly lower on control- vs. reservoir-irrigated chive at harvest (1.3 log (CFU/g) lower). Ciprofloxacin-and ceftazidime-resistant bacteria were significantly lower on control-irrigated chive at harvest and end of shelf life (up to 1.8 log (CFU/g) lower). Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. repeatedly isolated from water and chive proved resistant to up to six or four antibiotic classes (80% or 49% multidrug-resistant, respectively). Microbial source tracking identified E. coli-ST1056 along the irrigation chain and on chive. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that E. coli-ST1056 from both environments were clonal and carried the same transmissible multidrug-resistance plasmid, proving water as source of chive contamination. These findings emphasize the urgent need for guidelines concerning ARB in irrigation water and development of affordable water disinfection technologies to diminish ARB on irrigated produce.

AB  - The interpretation of postmortem bupropion is often a challenge to the forensic toxicology community because of the instability of the parent compound. At the North Carolina Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (NC OCME) toxicology laboratory, one of the active metabolites, threobupropion, is used as a complementary indicator for the extent of exposure to the parent compound. Metabolite data will address postmortem normal concentrations as well as when bupropion was attributed to the cause of death. For 55 natural cases where bupropion was unattributed to the cause of death, the blood and liver mean threobupropion concentrations were 1.8 mg/L and 12.1 mg/kg, respectively, with median concentrations of 1.5 mg/L and 10 mg/kg, respectively. For the 51 suicidal ingestion cases when bupropion was attributed to the cause of death, the blood and liver mean threobupropion concentrations were 15.8 mg/L and 131.5 mg/kg, respectively, with median concentrations of 13.5 mg/L and 110 mg/kg, respectively. The laboratory completed a stability study over the course of 50 days to evaluate how bupropion and threobupropion degrade in postmortem blood, liver and liver homogenate. The samples were subjected to forensically relevant conditions by storing them at room temperature (RT, 20 degrees C), refrigerated (4 degrees C) and frozen (-20 degrees C). While the concentration of bupropion decreased in all specimens, the rate of degradation of the RT samples was the most dramatic. The threobupropion metabolite appeared to be relatively stable. The postmortem case data along with the evaluation of potential degradation products should provide an overall picture to assist the toxicological community with the interpretation of bupropion found in routine casework.

AB  - Research on grapevines has indicated that organic amendment application (OAA) increases the nutrient content of soil and plant tissue. Microbial functional groups are extensively used as soil fertility indicators because they are highly sensitive to changes in climatic and management conditions and they accurately represent entire biological processes. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the interactive effects of OAA on microbiological and chemical properties of soil and plants of a vineyard in Mendoza, Argentina. The following factors were evaluated: type of organic amendment (compost or vermi compost), application mode (surface or buried) and frequency of application (one or two applications). The field experiment was carried out using a factorial randomized complete block design. The following soil parameters were analyzed before and after OAA: microbial abundance related to the carbon and nitrogen cycle, total microbial activity, salinity and fertility. Yield, pruning weight, trunk diameter and nutritional variables of the vine were determined at the end of the assay. The results showed that microorganisms were not affected by the type of amendment, the application method or frequency. After OAA, the total abundance of microorganisms was similar, and soil salinity was not affected. Phosphorus depended on the strategy or combinations. Total phosphorus in petioles was higher after one or two buried applications (0.43% and 0.39%, respectively). In conclusion, OAA to irrigated soil of arid areas in Mendoza, Argentina, could be considered a promising supplementary treatment to increase the nutrient content in soil and vine.

AB  - Sewage input and the relationship between chemical markers (linear alkylbenzenes and coprostanol) and fecal indicator bacteria (FIB, Escherichia coil and enterococci), were evaluated in order to establish thresholds values for chemical markers in suspended particulate matter (SPM) as indicators of sewage contamination in two subtropical estuaries in South Atlantic Brazil. Both chemical markers presented no linear relationship with FIB due to high spatial microbiological variability, however, microbiological water quality was related to coprostanol values when analyzed by logistic regression, indicating that linear models may not be the best representation of the relationship between both classes of indicators. Logistic regression was performed with all data and separately for two sampling seasons, using 800 and 100 MPN 100 mL(-1) of E. coli and enterococci, respectively, as the microbiological limits of sewage contamination. Threshold values of coprostanol varied depending on the FIB and season, ranging between 1.00 and 2.23 mu g g(-1) SPM. The range of threshold values of coprostanol for SPM are relatively higher and more variable than those suggested in literature for sediments (0.10-0.50 mu g g(-1)), probably due to higher concentration of coprostanol in SPM than in sediment. Temperature may affect the relationship between microbiological indicators and coprostanol, since the threshold value of coprostanol found here was similar to tropical areas, but lower than those found during winter in temperate areas, reinforcing the idea that threshold values should be calibrated for different climatic conditions.

AB  - Perceptions of the future are crucial components of individual well-being. Hopelessness, which is the sense that the future is a dead end, begins with the occurrence of negative life events and develops through the perception of consistent and pervasive negative outcomes. This study investigated the role of the socioeconomic aspects of the context and shared emotions (emotional climates) within a region in reducing or exacerbating hopelessness. Emotional climates have been defined as the emotional relationships constructed among members of a society, and they describe the environmental quality of a particular community. Multilevel modeling with individuals nested into regions (i.e., Swiss cantons) was used to explore the relationship between context and hopelessness. Data from the project "Vulnerability and Growth," the Swiss Household Panel and official socioeconomic indicators were used. Spatial-weighting methods were applied to estimate depressive and optimistic emotional climates at the canton level. The results show that hopelessness is primarily affected by individual factors such as personality and life events. However, the analyses revealed that socioeconomic conditions and the optimistic and depressive climates that prevail in cantons also affected individuals' perceptions of hopelessness. Individuals were more likely to feel hopeless in cantons with high unemployment rates and high levels of shared negative emotions. In contrast, positive emotional climates played a protective role against hopelessness. Acknowledgment of the influence of context on individuals' perceptions of the future and the correlation of their states of anxiety and depression is pivotal for planning effective interventions to prevent depression.

AB  - In the current study, water quality of five river sites in Parana River basin (Brazil), utilized for public water supply, was assessed through a set of biomarkers in fish Astyanax spp. Population growth and inadequate use of land are challenges to the preservation of biodiversity and resources such as water. Some physicochemical parameters as well as somatic indexes, gills and liver histopathology, genotoxicity, and biochemical biomarkers were evaluated. The highest gonadosomatic index (GSI) and antioxidant parameters (catalase and glutathione S-transferase activities, non-protein thiols), as well as the lowest damage to biomolecules (lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, DNA damage) were observed in site 0 (Piava River), which is located at an environmental protected area. Site 1, located in the same river, but downstream site 0 and outside the protection area, presents some level of impact. Fish from site 2 (Antas River), which lack of riparian forest and suffer from silting, presented the highest micronucleus incidence and no melanomacrophages. Differently, individuals from site 3 (Xambr River) and site 4 (Pinhalzinho River) which receive surface runoff from Umuarama city, urban and industrial sewage, have the highest incidences of liver and gill histopathological alterations, including neoplasia, which indicated the worst health conditions of all sites. In particular, site 4 had high levels of total nitrogen and ammonia, high turbidity, and very low oxygen levels, which indicate important chemical impact. Comparison of the biomarkers in fish allowed classification of the five sites in terms of environmental impact and revealed that sites 3 and 4 had particular poor water quality.

AB  - The abundance, diversity and composition of bacterial communities in water wells with low groundwater temperatures were assessed. The drinking water catchment system, equipped with subsurface groundwater treatment for iron- and manganese removal, is located within a continental influenced veldt landscape type in eastern Russia, close to the border to China. In this study, the bacterial communities in 22 different water wells of the catchment system were analyzed and correlated to operating conditions and environmental factors. The investigated bacterial treated and groundwater populations differed from those in central European groundwater. Large variations between the investigated samples were observed, and DGGE profiles of water samples from the beginning and the end of the abstraction phases revealed two distinct fingerprint clusters with about 82% similarity to each other corresponding to the operation mode of the wells. Sequence data analysis from 454 pyrosequencing indicated Rhodoferax and Gallionella as the most abundant genera within the catchment system. The abundance of the OTU Methylotenera was statistically significant when correlated to the beginning of the abstraction phases, while no indicator OTUs could be determined for the end of the pumping phases. ACK-M1 cluster was proofed as indicator OTU for operating wells, whereas the Gallionella OTUs were correlated with non operating wells. Well operation and resultant oxygen entry could serve as factors that altered the bacterial community structure and composition the most. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that genes related to the iron-reducing Rhodoferax genus were present in nearly all of the samples. This study clearly showed an alteration within the bacterial communities dependent on the operation mode of the water wells. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - An ecological correlation study of the prevalence of hypertension with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa was conducted to determine the extent to which these conditions coincide at country level.
   Methods
   Data on prevalence of hypertension were derived from a systematic search of literature published between 1975 and 2014 with corresponding national estimates on HIV prevalence and antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage from the Demographic and Health Surveys and the joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS databases. National estimates on gross national income (GNI) and under-five mortality were obtained from the World Bank database. Linear regression analyses using robust standard errors (allowing for clustering at country level) were carried out for associations of age-standardised hypertension prevalence ratios (standardized to rural Uganda's hypertension prevalence data) with HIV prevalence, adjusted for national indicators, year of study and sex of the study population.
   Results
   In total, 140 estimates of prevalence of hypertension representing 25 nations were sex-and area-matched with corresponding HIV prevalence. A two-fold increase in HIV prevalence was associated with a 9.29% increase in age, sex and study year-adjusted prevalence ratio for hypertension (95% CI 2.0 to 16.5, p = 0.01), which increased to 16.3% (95% CI 9.3 to 21.1) after adjusting for under-five mortality, GNI per capita and ART coverage.
   Conclusions
   Countries with a pronounced burden of HIV may also have an increased burden of non-communicable diseases such as hypertension with potential economic and health systems implications.

AB  - Imposex in gastropods (Acanthina monodon, Oliva peruviana and Xanthochorus cassidiformis), butyltin levels in surface sediments (Coquimbo and Concepcion) and tissues (Valparaiso and Concepcion) were assessed in three areas under the influence of maritime activities along the central Chilean coast. The highest TBT concentrations were observed in Sao Vicente Bay (Concepcion), reaching 122.3 ng Sn g(-1) in surface sediments and 59.7 ng Sn g(-1) in gastropods tissue, while in Valparaiso ranged from 7.4 to 15.8 ng Sn g(-1) in biota. The lowest TBT concentrations were detected in sediments from Coquimbo (<2 ng Sn g(-1)), which can be attributed to a much lower ship/boat traffic (probably using TBT free products) in association to local oceanographic conditions. Despite DBT and MBT were the predominant analytes, recent inputs of TBT were evident in some areas. In fact, fishing boats may be a relevant source since they were the predominant maritime activity in the most contaminated sites. In addition, the absence of significant differences within BTs levels between both genders of A. monodon suggests that tissues from distinct sexes can be indistinctly used for future contamination studies. Imposex incidence was detected in 11 out of 15 sampled sites, indicating that environmental levels of TBT have been sufficient to induce deleterious effects on the exposed organisms. Thus, the impacts caused by TBT in Chilean coastal areas were detectable and consistent with other studies performed in South America. This present environmental contamination is probably due to the lack of regulations forbidding the use of TBT-based antifouling paints in Chile. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This research examines how agricultural practices commonly used in Lebanese olive tree orchards (no-tillage, co-culture with Vicia sativa L. var. sativa and conventional tillage) affect soil microbial and chemical characteristics, and whether this depends on geographical context (coastal or inland areas). Four coastal and four inland sampling sites were selected, and at each site three practices were considered (one practice per plot). For each plot (200m(2)), 20 soil samples were taken and homogenized to obtain a composite sample from which soil was characterized chemically and microbiologically. Differences in chemical properties (smaller N content and alkyl C fraction in the coastal area) depended on geographical location rather than on agricultural practices. For microbial properties, catabolic structure varied with geographical location; the index of catabolic diversity was larger in the coastal area. Importantly, the basal respiration was similar in both areas although the soil contained less nitrogen (N) in the coastal area. The negative effect of conventional tillage on microbial functioning of the soil was observed only in relation to geographical location. We found that this effect was reduced by co-culture, for example with Vicia sativa L. var. sativa. Our study reveals that geographical location affects how agricultural practices affect soil properties (in the coastal area, enhanced mineralization of labile C and change in microbial catabolic profile). This suggests that soil management should take into account the environmental conditions specific to coastal areas, which enhance the adverse effects of conventional tillage. Consequently, this type of management should not be implemented in coastal areas of the Mediterranean.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to examine the efficacy of four bacterial antagonists against Aspergillus flavus using 50:50 ratio of bacterial cells/conidia for the control of aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) production on two different nutritional matrices, nutrient and maize-based media at different water availabilities (0.98, 0.94 water activity (a(w)) on nutrient medium: 0.995, 0.98 a(w) on maize meal agar medium) at 35 degrees C. The indicators of efficacy used were the relative expression of one structural and regulatory gene in the biosynthetic pathway (aflD and aflR respectively) and the production of AFB(1). These studies showed that some of the bacterial species could significantly inhibit the relative expression of the afID and aflR genes at both 0.98 and 0.94 a(w) on nutrient agar. On maize-based media some of the bacterial antagonists reduced the activity of both genes at 0.94 aw and some at 0.995 a(w). However, the results for AFB(1) production were not consistent with the effects on gene expression. Some bacterial species stimulated AFB(1) production on both nutrient and maize-based media regardless of aw. However, some bacterial treatments did inhibit AFB(1) production significantly when compared to the control. Overall, this study suggests that temporal studies are required on the biosynthetic genes under different environmental and nutritional conditions to evaluate the potential of antagonists to control AFB(1).

AB  - Genomics enjoys overwhelming popularity in the study of microbial ecology. However, extreme or atypical environments often limit the use of such well-established tools and consequently demand a novel approach. The bentonite clay matrix proposed for use in Deep Geological Repositories for the long-term storage of used nuclear fuel is one such challenging microbial habitat. Simple, accessible tools were developed for the study of microbial ecology and metabolic processes that occur within this habitat, since the understanding of the microbiota-niche interaction is fundamental to describing microbial impacts on engineered systems such as compacted bentonite barriers. Even when genomic tools are useful for the study of community composition, techniques to describe such microbial impacts and niche interactions should complement these. Tools optimised for assessing localised microbial activity within bentonite included: (a) the qualitative use of the resazurin-resorufin indicator system for redox localisation, (b) the use of a CaCl2 buffer for the localisation of pH, and (c) fluorometry for the localisation of precipitated sulphide. The use of the Carbon Dioxide Evolution Monitoring System was also validated for measuring microbial activity in desiccated and saturated bentonite. Finally, the buffering of highly basic bentonite at neutral pH improved the success of isolation of microbial populations, but not DNA, from the bentonite matrix. Thus, accessible techniques were optimised for exploring microbial metabolism in the atypical environments of clay matrices and desiccated conditions. These tools have application to the applied field of used nuclear fuel management, as well as for examining the fundamental biogeochemical cycles active in sedimentary and deep geological environments.

AB  - A drought index with respect to the spatio-temporal scale was developed in response to the demand from the agricultural sector in South Korea. The new drought index was calculated based on the soil water balance between the supply and demand of water. The water supply was estimated using the cumulative effective precipitation weighted by the precipitation from two months prior. The water demand was derived from the actual evapotranspiration, which was calculated by applying a crop coefficient to the reference evapotranspiration. The amount of surface runoff on a given soil type was used to calculate the residual soil moisture. The presence of drought was determined based on the probability distribution in the given area. In order to assess the reliability of this index, termed the Agricultural Drought Index (ADI), the amount of residual moisture, which represents the severity of a drought, was compared to the measurements of soil moisture at three experimental sites between July 2012 and December 2013. The results showed that the ADI had greater correlation with measured soil moisture than did the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), suggesting that the ADI is a useful indicator of drought. While both the SPI and ADI showed similar trends in the temporal variation of drought conditions at all of the sites, the ADI better detected 'severe drought' than did the SPI. The daily relief of severe drought due to precipitation was also better represented by the ADI. Using the high-resolution climatic and spatial data of a small watershed, we produced 270m resolution maps of ADI from week 36 through week 41 of 2013, demonstrating the feasibility of the ADI as an operational drought monitor appropriate for the agricultural environment of South Korea.

AB  - Due to elevated ozone concentrations at high altitudes, the adverse effect of ozone on air quality, human perception and health may be more pronounced in aircraft cabins. The association between ozone and passenger-reported symptoms has not been investigated under real conditions since smoking was banned on aircraft and ozone converters became more common. Indoor environmental parameters were measured at cruising altitude on 83 US domestic and international flights. Passengers completed a questionnaire about symptoms and satisfaction with the indoor air quality. Average ozone concentrations were relatively low (median: 9.5 ppb). On thirteen flights (16%) ozone levels exceeded 60 ppb, while the highest peak level reached 256 ppb for a single flight. The most commonly reported symptoms were dry mouth or lips (26%), dry eyes (22.1%) and nasal stuffiness (18.9%). 46% of passengers reported at least one symptom related to the eyes or mouth. A third of the passengers reported at least one upper respiratory symptom. Using multivariate logistic (individual symptoms) and linear (aggregated continuous symptom variables) regression, ozone was consistently associated with symptoms related to the eyes and certain upper respiratory endpoints. A concentration-response relationship was observed for nasal stuffiness and eye and upper respiratory symptom indicators. Average ozone levels, as opposed to peak concentrations, exhibited slightly weaker associations. Medium and long duration flights were significantly associated with more symptoms compared to short flights. The relationship between ultrafine particles and ozone on flights without meal service was indicative of ozone-initiated chemistry.

AB  - Larval and early juvenile fishes were sampled from the eastern Bering Sea (EBS) shelf from 2001 to 2005, and in 2007. Data from these collections were used to examine spatial and temporal patterns in species assemblage structure and abundance. The years 2001-2005 were unusual because the EBS water temperature was 'warm' compared with the long-term mean temperature. In contrast, 2007 was a 'cold' year. The abundance of the five most numerous taxa at 12 stations common to all years sampled (1996-2005, 2007) were significantly different among years. Larval and early juvenile stage Theragra chalcogramma (walleye pollock), a commercially important gadid, were by far the most abundant fish in all years. Bottom depth alone best explained assemblage structure in most years, but in others, bottom depth and water column temperature combined and percent sea-ice coverage were most important. Abundance of T.chalcogramma larvae increases with water column temperature until 5 degrees C and then becomes level. Higher abundances of Gadus macrocephalus (Pacific cod) larvae occur in years with the greatest percent sea-ice cover as indicated by GAM analysis. Larvae of Lepidopsetta polyxystra (northern rock sole) increase in abundance with increasing maximum wind speed, but decrease at a later date during the last winter storm. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that oceanographic conditions, specifically water temperature and sea-ice coverage, affect the spatial and temporal pattern of larval abundances. In general, ichthyoplankton species assemblages can be important early indicators of environmental change in the Bering Sea and potentially other subarctic seas as well.

AB  - Remarkable outbreaks of various vegetation-related vector-borne diseases have been reported in recent years. Two well-known examples in Western Europe are nephropathia epidemica and Lyme borreliosis. The spatial distribution of these diseases closely follows the geographical distribution of the vegetated areas that are home to the organisms responsible for pathogen transmission. The causal agents of these diseases are the Puumala hantavirus and the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, respectively. Each disease has a specific transmission mechanism, but there are commonalities in the pathways of these two pathogens. The dynamic nature of vegetated areas and frequent weather anomalies increase the need to understand the links between climate, vegetation and disease. There is a need for innovative ways of monitoring vegetation as determinant of disease risk. This study aims to identify time-variant indicators of vegetation conditions as potential predictors to be used in spatio-temporal disease risk models. The candidate predictors include seasonal growing degree days and vegetation phenology metrics extracted from time series of remotely sensed vegetation indices after the conduction of a wavelet-based multi-resolution analysis. The response variable is a local Bayesian estimator of disease risk, calculated from epidemiological data with consideration of spatial stationarity. The results demonstrate the value of combining meteorological data with georeferenced datasets, like those obtained with remote sensing, which include specific information about the vegetation class of interest and its position with respect to urban centers.

AB  - The study area is an urban forest remnant in the city of Tampere (Finland). The presence of vascular plant species were surveyed in 1980 and again in 2000 within the 5 x 5 m grid cells covering the whole forest. The forest fragment has been influenced by three types of urban pressure: general ecological conditions (such as eutrophication due to increase of nitrogen), edge effect and local human disturbance. A general and spatially even eutrophication was reflected in the frequencies of C- and S-strategists as a shift towards to the C-point in the CSR triangle. The total number of native species (83 in 1980, 89 in 2000), typical Vaccinium type (VT)-forest species (32 in 1980, 31 in 2000) and aliens (57 in 1980, 68 in 2000) did change, but only to a moderate extent. The number of typical VT-forest species and native species were more common in central parts of the fragment. In terms of the number of species, the forest has been relatively resistant to date to major changes. However, the average number of native plant species per grid cell increased from 13.7 to 14.4, the average number of aliens increased from 2.0 to 4.2 and the average number of typical VT-forest species decreased from 5.5 to 5.0. Natives were spatially concentrated in the centre in 1980, but in 2000 they were more evenly distributed. The edge has offered habitats for new species, but the typical VT-forest species of the original sub-xeric forest are slowly diminishing.

AB  - Tree carbohydrate reserves are usually compromised following insect outbreak, which results in a delay in leaf emergence and a reduction in growth, especially in cold environments. However, in recent times, severe defoliation of subarctic mountain birches (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) by the winter moth (Operophtera brumata) has not induced such responses. This may be the result of a warming climate stimulating plant primary metabolism. We examined if increasing thermal sum (sum of daily mean temperatures above +5 A degrees C, d.d.) and complete foliage loss affected the concentrations of carbohydrates in sap, juvenile leaves, and fine roots of mountain birches in northern Finland and Norway. The sampling was conducted at the beginning of the growing season, two years after the insect outbreak. We also investigated the morphologic properties of mature leaves and the shoot growth of the trees. Our results showed that the carbohydrate concentrations in leaves and roots (averages 67.8 and 12.5 mg g(-1) DW, respectively) decreased in defoliated trees with increasing thermal sum (> 400 d.d.), whereas the response in intact trees was the opposite. The carbohydrates in the sap were unaffected by defoliation or thermal sum accumulation. The leaf area of mature leaves and the height growth of long shoots were greater in trees at warmer sites, irrespective of defoliation. However, defoliation increased the leaf weight per area (SLW: specific leaf weight). We conclude that under warmer growing conditions, low early-season leaf and fine root carbohydrate concentrations of previously defoliated trees cannot be used as indicators of aboveground growth.

AB  - This study investigates the feasibility of installing a 250MW commercial scale marine energy park (wind and wave energy), both in terms of economics and environmental impacts, off the Belmullet coastline in Co. Mayo, Ireland. This site corresponds to the Atlantic Marine Energy Test Site (AMETS) where an environmental impact assessment has been carried out previously. A probabilistic economic model for the evaluation of wind and wave hybrid designs has been developed and is used in this study. This life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) uses discount rates suggested by industry and investigates the variation in the levelised cost of energy (LCoE) for various farm arrangements. A study using numerical wave modelling software has been undertaken to determine the modification to the wave field and thus the subsequent effects on sediment transport processes and shoreline evolution on the Mayo coast with the aim of optimising the arrangement of the marine energy park with respect to LCoE and environmental impacts. This methodology is a significant advancement in studies of the optimisation of wave farm arrangements. The methodology firstly consists of a capital expenditure model for pricing the farm infrastructure, secondly, a hydrodynamic analysis of the offshore wave conditions incident on the farm of devices is performed and the wave height incident on each device is passed as an input to the energy yield model, which is coupled with an operations and maintenance model. A financial calculator, which employs discounted cash-flow techniques, is employed to calculate the LCoE. This study demonstrates that there is an optimum arrangement for a renewable energy farm of wave energy converters (WEC), and that the addition of wind turbines can significantly alter this optimum arrangement.

AB  - The objectives of this paper are the description of azimuthal instability modes found in annular combustion chambers using two numerical tools: (1) Large Eddy Simulation (LES) methods and (2) acoustic solvers. These strong combustion instabilities are difficult to study experimentally and the present study is based on a LES of a full aeronautical combustion chamber. The LES exhibits a self-excited oscillation at the frequency of the first azimuthal eigenmode. The mesh independence of the LES is verified before analysing the nature of this mode using various indicators over more than 100 cycles: the mode is mostly a pure standing mode but it transitions from time to time to a turning mode because of turbulent fluctuations, confirming experimental observations and theoretical results. The correlation between pressure and heat release fluctuations (Rayleigh criterion) is not verified locally but it is satisfied when pressure and heat release are averaged over sectors. LES is also used to check modes predicted by an acoustic Helmholtz solver where the flow is frozen and flames are modelled using a Flame Transfer Function (FTF) as done in most present tools. The results in terms of mode structure compare well confirming that the mode appearing in the LES is the first azimuthal mode of the chamber. Moreover, the acoustic solver provides stability maps suggesting that a reduction of the time delay of the FTF would be enough to stabilise the mode. This is confirmed with LES by increasing the flame speed and verifying that this modification leads to a damped mode in a few cycles. (C) 2012 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Structural colors result from the physical interaction of light with organic materials of differing refractive indexes organized at nanoscale dimensions to produce significant interference effects. Because color properties emerge from these finely organized nanostructures, the production of structural coloration could respond to environmental factors and be developmentally more plastic than expected, functioning as an indicator of individual quality. However, there are many unknown factors concerning the function and mechanisms regulating structural coloration, especially relative to social environment. We hypothesized that social environment, in the form of competitive settings, can influence the developmental pathways involving production of feather structural coloration. We experimentally assessed the impact of social environment upon body condition, molt and spectral properties of two types of structural color that compose the nuptial plumage in blue-black grassquits: black iridescent plumage and white underwing patches. We manipulated male social environment during nine months by keeping individuals in three treatments: (1) pairs; (2) all-male groups; and (3) male-female mixed groups. All morphological characters and spectral plumage measures varied significantly through time, but only acquisition of nuptial plumage coverage and nuptial plumage color were influenced by social environment. Compared with males in the paired treatment, those in treatments with multiple males molted into nuptial plumage faster and earlier, and their plumage was more UV-purple-shifted. Our results provide experimental evidence that social context strongly influences development and expression of structural plumage. These results emphasize the importance of longterm experimental studies to identify the phenotypic consequences of social dynamics relative to ornament expression.

AB  - The relationship between environmental conditions and the delta O-18 and delta C-13 values of soil and groundwater carbonates in Europe is poorly understood. Consequently, the use of the isotopic composition of these carbonate palaeoclimatic indicators in European sedimentary sequences is restricted. In this study we examine the delta O-18 and delta C-13 values of soil and groundwater carbonates from western and southern Europe. In western Europe there is no relationship between carbonate delta O-18 values and carbonate delta C-13 values. The delta O-18 values of soil carbonate appears to be driven by temperature, whilst the delta C-13 value of soil and groundwater carbonate reflects the persistent dominance of C-3 vegetation in this region during the Quaternary. The delta O-18 and delta C-13 values of soil carbonates from Spain and Crete show a strong degree of co-variance suggesting that they are being controlled by the same environmental factor. This is suggested to be aridity. delta O-18 values are controlled by soil moisture evaporation whilst delta C-13 value is controlled by soil moisture degassing, vegetation abundance and possible C-3/C-4 vegetation inputs. The paper concludes by highlighting the fact that, although currently under-utilised, the delta O-18 and delta C-13 values of soil and groundwater carbonates have a huge potential for providing important palaeoenvironmental information from sites across Europe.

AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) content is one of the main factors to be considered in the evaluation of soil health and fertility. As timing, human and monetary resources often limit the amount of available data, geostatistical techniques provide a valid scientific approach to cope with spatial variability, to interpolate existing data and to predict values at unsampled locations for accurate SOM status survey. Using geostatistical and geographic information system (GIS) approaches, the spatial variability of some physical and chemical soil parameters was investigated under Mediterranean climatic condition in the Abruzzo region of central Italy, where soil erosion processes accelerated by human induced factors are the main causes of soil degradation associated with low SOM content. Experimental semivariograms were established to determine the spatial dependence of the soil variables under investigation. The results of 250 soil sampling point data were interpolated by means of ordinary kriging coupled with a GIS to produce contour maps distribution of soil texture, SOM content related to texture, and C/N ratio. The resulting spatial interpolation of the dataset highlighted a low content of SOM in relation with soil texture in most of the surveyed area (87%) and an optimal C/N ratio for only half of the investigated surface area. Spatial location of degraded area and the assessment of its magnitude can provide decision makers with an accurate support to design appropriate soil conservation strategies and then facilitate a regional planning of agri-environmental measures in the framework of the European Common Agricultural Policy.

AB  - Understanding of how plant communities are organized and will respond to global changes requires an understanding of how plant species respond to multiple environmental gradients. We examined the mechanisms mediating the distribution patterns of tidal marsh plants along an estuarine gradient in Georgia (USA) using a combination of field transplant experiments and monitoring. Our results could not be fully explained by the "competition-to-stress hypothesis" (the current paradigm explaining plant distributions across estuarine landscapes). This hypothesis states that the upstream limits of plant distributions are determined by competition, and the downstream limits by abiotic stress. We found that competition was generally strong in freshwater and brackish marshes, and that conditions in brackish and salt marshes were stressful to freshwater marsh plants, results consistent with the competition-to-stress hypothesis. Four other aspects of our results, however, were not explained by the competition-to-stress hypothesis. First, several halophytes found the freshwater habitat stressful and performed best (in the absence of competition) in brackish or salt marshes. Second, the upstream distribution of one species was determined by the combination of both abiotic and biotic (competition) factors. Third, marsh productivity (estimated by standing biomass) was a better predictor of relative biotic interaction intensity (RII) than was salinity or flooding, suggesting that productivity is a better indicator of plant stress than salinity or flooding gradients. Fourth, facilitation played a role in mediating the distribution patterns of some plants. Our results illustrate that even apparently simple abiotic gradients can encompass surprisingly complex processes mediating plant distributions.

AB  - The long-term impact of pollution in freshwater aquatic environments can be assessed realistically only if the mutagenic effects of pollutants on organisms inhabiting aquatic biotopes are evaluated. To do this, the larvae of Chironomids (Diptera) can serve as suitable indicators of potential environmental genotoxicity. These larvae exhibit aberrations in their polytene chromosomes, which, when analyzed, indicate an early response to toxicity more efficiently than morphological analysis, up to now the usual technique. Chironomids have excellent salivary gland chromosomes with well-defined bands and permanent somatic pairing, where there are two important regions of active transcription-Balbiani rings (BRs) and Nucleolar organizers (NOR). We have described the responses of different Chironomid species in two situations: in the field and in the laboratory, where we performed Cr, Al, Pb and Cu trace-metal-exposure experiments with Chironomus riparius. In both situations, the genome response consisted in a statistically significant increase in somatic chromosome aberrations and decrease in BR and NOR activity to levels lower than those of larvae under standard conditions. The main chromosome aberrations consisted in inversions, amplifications, deletions and deficiencies. Deletions in the chromosome G in C. riparius transformed it into a pompon-like structure. Chromosome aberrations were not randomly distributed: they occurred mainly in sites with repetitive DNA elements that have a highly interspersed location in the C. riparius genome. Hence C. riparius is the species most likely to produce aberrations and can be used as a model for cost-effective monitoring of the early genomic response to trace metals and other stress agents.

AB  - There is growing interest in what controls the present distribution of terrestrial vegetation in Antarctica because of the potential use of biodiversity as an indicator or predictor of the effects of climate change. Recent advances in knowledge of distribution and ecophysiological performance of terrestrial vegetation means that an initial analysis of the potential influence of temperature is now possible. Regressions of species numbers of lichens, mosses and hepatics on latitude and mean annual temperature (standard macroclimatic data) were carried out, and the terrestrial vegetation in Antarctica could be divided into two zones. The microenvironmental zone lies south of around 72 degrees S, and biodiversity (richness and location) is uncoupled from the macroenvironment and is, instead, determined by the occasional coincidences of warmth, water, light and shelter. The macroenvironmental zone lies north of about 72 degrees S, and biodiversity (richness, cover and growth) is strongly positively linked to mean annual temperature; species numbers increase at about 9-10% per K (24.0, 9.3 and 1.8 species for lichens, mosses and hepatics, respectively) probably due to improved water availability through increased precipitation and longer active period (monthly degree-days also reach zero at about 72 degrees S) allowing greater productivity, completion of metabolic processes and a switch from survival to growth strategies. Cyanobacterial lichens appear to be a special case and may be expanding after being forced into northerly refugia. Warming will cause a southward movement of the boundary between the two zones but distribution in the microenvironmental zone will remain determined by local coincidences of environment and resources.

AB  - Historical range of variability (HRV) describes the range of temporal and spatial variations in river variables such as flow regime or channel planform prior to intensive human alteration of the ecosystem. In mountainous river networks, HRV is most usefully applied to spatially differentiated geomorphic process domains with distinctive form and process. Using the Colorado Front Range as an example, three examples of how knowledge of HRV can assist river management and restoration are discussed. The examples involve instream wood load and channel morphology, beaver colonies and valley-bottom form and process, and flow thresholds in regulated rivers. The question of what a river should look like - that is, what range of process and form the river included prior to intensive human alteration - can be addressed by (i) placing the river within a process domain, (ii) establishing correlations between form parameters that can be remotely sensed and reach-scale process and form, so that the spatial extent, connectivity, and rarity of process domains within a river network or a region can be quickly assessed, (iii) inferring characteristics of the river prior to intensive alteration by documenting characteristics of the least altered reference rivers and by using proxy indicators of pre-alteration conditions, and (iv) establishing process thresholds that must be exceeded to maintain form (e. g. flow thresholds to mobilize bed sediment). Once this context has been established, resource managers can better evaluate the options for restoring altered riverine form and function. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - All economic actions are directed to the satisfaction of wants, or in other words: to welfare. Welfare is defined as the satisfaction of wants derived from our dealings with scarce goods. It is a category of personal experience and not measurable in cardinal units. Therefore we have to make do with indicators that are measurable in cardinal units and that are arguably influencing welfare. The cardinal indicator and the ordinal welfare have, of course, to develop in the same direction.
   Economic growth is generally defined as increase of national income (NI) (or GDP) as a measure of production. However, according to the subject matter of economics, economic growth can mean nothing other than increase in welfare. Welfare is dependent on more factors than solely production. It is also dependent on employment, income distribution, labour conditions, leisure time and the scarce possible uses of the non-human-made physicalsurroundings: the environmental functions. These objectives or ends are often in conflict. Therefore welfare can increase with decreasing production.
   The narrow minded, theoretical wrong definition of economic growth is especially threatening the current and future availability of environmental functions, the most fundamental scarce and consequently economic goods at the disposal of humanity. These fall outside the market and outside the measurement of NI. Correct information is decisive for the coming into being of the preferences of individuals and institutions and consequently for the decision making process. Therefore it is of the utmost importance to correct the current misleading information. In the paper five relatively simple ways are discussed to correct the wrong information about growth. The concept of environmental functions is defined as the possible uses of the non-human-made physical surroundings on which humanity is entirely dependent.

AB  - Agricultural soil quality evaluation is essential for economic success and environmental stability in rapidly developing regions. At present, a wide variety of methods are used to evaluate soil quality using vastly different indicators. A universally accepted method of soil quality evaluation would assist agriculture managers, scientists, and policy makers to better understand the soil quality conditions of various agricultural systems. This study analyzes the soil quality of Zhangjiagang County, a rapidly developing region of China (n = 431), using the Integrated Quality Index (IQI) and Nemero, Quality Index (NQI) in combination with three indicator selection methods: Total Data Set (TDS), Minimum Data Set (MDS), and Delphi Data Set (DDS). A total of 22 soil parameters were used with the TDS method. These six combinations of soil quality evaluation methods were then analyzed to determine which is best suited for soil quality evaluation in the county. All evaluation methods revealed that the county has fair to favorable soil quality with Anthrosols (Inceptisols) generally having higher quality than Cambosols (Entisols). Regression and correlation analysis all showed that the IQI preformed better than the NQI, in three indicator selection methods and IQI match analysis was 9% higher than NQI. Though the TDS method is the most accurate, it was concluded that using the IQI index and the MDS method can adequately represent the TDS method (r(2) = 0.65) and thus save time and money.

AB  - In the mountainous areas of Eastern Spain, soils have been cultivated in terraced orchards for centuries, although in the last decades, almond orchards are being abandoned. For this study, we selected four locations in SE Spain, with a similar vegetation mosaic, constituting forest, almond tree orchards, and orchards abandoned between 10 to 15 years previous to sampling. The main objective was to investigate the effects of changes in land use from forest to agricultural and posterior land abandonment on various physical, chemical, and biochemical properties. In all locations, all properties showed the highest values in forest soils, excepting pH and some eco-physiological ratios which were lowest under this land use. Abandoned agricultural soils showed a slight recovery in some properties compared to agricultural soils, the biochemical properties being the most sensitive indicators in reflecting these changes. All these results indicate that after land abandonment, soil microorganisms are more active as a consequence of the increment in the vegetation cover, with higher inputs as litter and root exudates. Moreover, the stopping of tillage may also have favored the increments in microbial biomass and activity. Nonetheless, these values are still low compared to forest soils, reflecting that 10-15 years of abandonment is not long enough to achieve a significant recovery in soil properties under semi-arid Mediterranean conditions. The metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) showed no general pattern in all locations in terms of land use, suggesting that this ratio is not specific enough to be used as an indicator in ecosystem succession.

AB  - Tail and ear biting lesions have a negative effect both on the animal welfare status of pigs (Sus scrofus) and the economical revenue of the pig farm. Tail biting behaviour is an unpredictable, abnormal behaviour that is thought to have a multifactorial origin. On-farm factors influencing tail biting have been described, but the real triggers are poorly understood. Much of the research into tail biting has been done on a small scale within a well-controlled environment and small sample sizes. This well-controlled environment is not always representative of the contemporary commercial conditions. Therefore, an observational epidemiological approach at farm level was adopted to gain a better insight into the factors influencing the occurrence of tail and ear biting lesions. Tail and ear biting lesions were observed at pen level three times a year on sixty farms across Belgium. A questionnaire was conducted to build a multi factorial model indicating different risk factors concerning the lesions scored. The temperature and the number of feeding places per animal in the nursery, the percentage of floor space covered with slats in the farrowing unit the feed type in the growing unit and the overall hygiene policy were the most important indicators for the appearance of tail and ear biting lesions during fattening. The leave-one-out cross validation of the model demonstrated an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.55 between the predicted model outcomes and the observed data. This epidemiological study provides important potential risk factors in relation to the incidence of tail and ear biting lesions. However, experimental and/or longitudinal studies have to confirm that the correlations found in this work are causal factors.

T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE

AB  - In the organic horizons of the Al-Fe-humus podzols under the old pine forests of the northern taiga, the biomass of all the groups of microorganisms, the length of the fungal and actinomycete mycelium, the number of fungal spores, and the bacterial population were maximal (13 mg/g) irrespectively of the stage of pyrogenic succession. The share of fungi (mainly, of basidiomycetes) exceeded 90%. In the mineral root-inhabited soil horizons, the biomass of microorganisms was not greater than 1.0 mg/g. The soil under the lichen pine forest had the smallest biomass of microorganisms as compared to the soil under the pine forests that were not exposed to fire for a long time. At all the stages of the pyrogenic succession, the most favorable conditions for the functioning of microorganisms were in the root-inhabited horizons of the soils in near-stem sites due to the accumulation of nutrients there. In the soils of these zones, the basidiomycete biomass was greater than that in the soils of the gaps. In the mineral soil horizons, buckleless micromycetes demonstrated the same trend. No distinct parcella differences, with respect to the soil nutrient regime, were found only for the prokaryotes. The fungi in the Al-Fe-humus podzols may be used as indicators for the pyrogenic succession stages of forest ecosystems. At the early stages, micromycetes without buckles prevailed, and, in the course of succession, the share of basidiomycetes clearly increased. The density and structure of mycorrhiza were tightly related to the nutrient regime of the soils. The increase in the concentration of available biogenic elements in the root-inhabited soil horizons did not cause the necessity of developing complex mycorrhiza forms.

AB  - The paper presents a decision support designed to conduct an economic-environmental assessment of the agricultural activity focusing on irrigation called 'Decision Support for IRRigated Agriculture' (DSIRR). The program describes the effect at catchment scale of choices taken at micro scale by independent actors, the farmers, by simulating their decision process. The decision support (DS) has been thought of as a support tool for participatory water policies as requested by the Water Framework Directive and it aims at analyzing alternatives in production and technology, according to different market, policy and climate conditions. The tool uses data and models, provides a graphical user interface and can incorporate the decision makers' own insights. Heterogeneity in preferences is admitted since it is assumed that irrigators try to optimize personal multi-attribute utility functions, subject to a set of constraints. Consideration of agronomic and engineering aspects allows an accurate description of irrigation. Mathematical programming techniques are applied to find solutions. The program has been applied in the river Po basin (northern Italy) to analyze the impact of a pricing policy in a context of irrigation technology innovation. Water demand functions and elaslicity to water price have been estimated. Results demonstrate how different areas and systems react to the same policy in quite a different way. While in the annual cropping system pricing seems effective to save the resource at the cost of impeding Water Agencies cost recovery, the same policy has an opposite effect in the perennial fruit system which shows an inelastic response to water price. The multidimensional assessment conducted clarified the trades-off among conflicting economic-social-environmental objectives, thus generating valuable information to design a more tailored mix of measures.

AB  - Observations of marine air temperature (MAT) by Voluntary Observing Ships (VOS) are known to contain significant biases due to solar heating of the sensor environment. MAT and humidity observations are usually made using wet- and dry-bulb thermometers housed in Stevenson screens, or with psychrometers. These instruments are typically mounted in the bridge wings or on the wheel-house top. If not sited carefully then the instruments can be poorly exposed to the undisturbed environmental conditions and have inadequate ventilation, leading to biased observations of both MAT and humidity.
   In this paper we use observations collected as part of the VOS Climate (VOSClim) project to investigate the relationship between instrument exposure and heating errors. The heating errors are estimated as the difference between the observed MAT and the collocated output of a numerical weather prediction model. The instrument exposures are assessed from photographs of the instruments. Currently, photographs of the instruments and sufficient observations exist for 17 VOSClim ships.
   Two methods of assessing the instrument exposure using the observations are presented. The first method is based on the skewness of the distribution of estimated heating errors for individual ships. The second method is based on a correction developed to correct the heating errors and uses the ratio of the heating to cooling terms in the correction. When ships are ranked both on the skewness and on the ratio of the heating to cooling terms, there is a statistically significant correspondence between the rankings and the visual assessments of instrument exposure. The skewness of the distribution of estimated errors in MAT is proposed as a simple indicator of instrument exposure. Copyright (c) 2005 Royal Meteorological Society.

AB  - On examining the scientific literature of recent years, one notices an increase in the number of studies of global warming and its impact on the Earth's various environments. Research has been undertaken in various fields such as geomorphology, hydrology and many others. In the context of climatic change, there is growing interest in the study of past floods, or palaeofloods. Researchers are attempting to reconstitute the chronology of past floods, especially with respect to past or subrecent climatic changes. The work involves using different methodological approaches borrowed from various disciplines including geology, geomorphology and ecology. The reconstruction of ancient hydrological events such as palaeofloods in fact requires that different methods and techniques be combined in order to trace the chronology of events as precisely as possible using different biophysical parameters. A wide variety of indicators are used in the chronological reconstruction of ancient fluvial environments, whether in humid, subhumid or desert regions. These indicators involve analysing stratigraphic sequences and sedimentary deposits, organic matter and macrorest deposits, as well as using radiocarbon dating (C-14), thermoluminescence ( TL), and dendrochronology and lichenometry. In fact, most work on the reconstitution of the frequency and magnitude of ancient floods uses several methods and techniques to obtain the long-term chronology of flood events in relation to the specific conditions ( e. g., climate, geomorphology) of a region or study area. With the publication of several studies in palaeohydrology, it was interesting to examine, through a literature review, the various approaches used in the study of palaeofloods. This kind of study has seen major advances, which can be explained partly by the interest generated by global climate change and its effect on river-system dynamics.

AB  - The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) was an abrupt global warming event at similar to 55 Ma. This event had profound effects on the. biosphere. Quantitative investigations of calcareous nannofossil assemblages were performed across the PETM, at Deep Sea Drilling Project Site 213, in the tropical Indian Ocean, and Site 401, in the Bay of Biscay, North Atlantic Ocean, at a temperate latitude. Calcareous nannofossil assemblages from both sites show major changes before, during, and after the PETM. Fluctuations at Site 213 are affected by selective dissolution of the least robust taxa. By contrast, assemblages in the lower part of the PETM at Site 401 show less diagenetic alteration and display high abundances of genera such as Discoaster, Fasciculithus, and Ericsonia. These taxa reflect relatively warm and, probably, oligotrophic surface waters. Abundances of the genus Chiasmolithus, an indicator of relatively cool and eutrophic waters, decreased dramatically. The upper portion of the PETM is characterized by an increase in the abundance of Toweius spp. and Zygrhablithus bijugatus, interpreted as a return to cooler and more eutrophic conditions. The elimination of Fasciculithus was probably due to competition with the holococcolith species, Z. bijugatus, which occupied the same ecological niche. The occurrences of long-armed and asymmetrical Discoaster species such as Discoaster araneus, Discoaster anartios, and Discoaster okadai, and Rhomboaster species, such as Rhomboaster calcitrapa and Rhomboaster cuspis, are characteristic of the PETM interval.

AB  - Red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) has experienced a substantial decline across most of its range in eastern North America over the past century and probably also in the disjunct Ontario populations where it now occurs only in small isolated stands. Measurements of cone and seed traits from natural populations were used as indicators of the reproductive and genetic status of red spruce across the northern margins of its range in Canada. Cone and seed traits were quantified to provide reproductive benchmarks for assessing and monitoring population viability. Reduced fecundity and seedling height growth were observed in some of the smallest Ontario populations, suggesting some inbreeding depression in both vegetative and reproductive components of fitness. Nevertheless, the reproductive status of these small isolated Ontario populations compared favorably with the much larger, more extensive Maritime populations in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Significantly higher proportions of aborted (nonpollinated) seeds and lower proportions of filled seeds suggested poorer pollination conditions in the Maritimes in 1996. The proportion of empty seed, which was used to estimate inbreeding levels, was significantly and negatively related to seedling height growth. In the short-term, the Ontario populations, which probably represent relatively recent remnants of a broader past distribution, generally appeared to be quite resilient to the effects of small population size on fecundity and progeny fitness. In the longer term, continuing decline in population sizes and numbers may be expected to erode reproductive success and genetic diversity through the effects of inbreeding, genetic drift, and changes in mating behavior. The reproductive indicators described here have general validity for assessing and monitoring reproductive and genetic aspects of population viability in conifers.

AB  - An 8000-year record of palaeoproductivity, based on the chemical and chironomid stratigraphies from Lake Paijanne, S. Finland, was assessed with respect to known morphometric, climatic and anthropogenic events. A gradual trend of dystrophication and an associated decrease in aquatic production was detected during the Holocene, with the following exceptions: (1) high diatom and chironomid production around 8000-6000 cal yr BP, (2) eutrophication around 2000 cal yr BP, and (3) an anthropogenic signal during the last few decades.
   The changes in chironomid assemblages, before the past few decades, have mainly been shifts in concentration, but not in species composition. Variation in chironomid production was mainly explained by the accumulations of biogenic silicon, carbon and organic matter. Nutrient availability seems to be important in controlling biogenic silicon, which we use to infer past diatom production. The high production ca. 8000-6000 cal yr BP and the fluctuation in chironomid influx after ca. 2000 cal yr BP, however, were probably caused by the proposed warm/dry and cold/wet conditions during these times, respectively. These results highlight the sensitivity of boreal shield lake ecosystems to climatic forcing. In contrast, the pronounced change in the morphometry of the basin around 7000 cal yr BP had little effect on the trophic state of the lake. The human-induced trophic change during the past few decades has affected the Lake Paijanne ecosystem to an extent never experienced before during the last 8000-years.

TI  - ACCESSORY CHROMIUM SPINELS - THEIR COEXISTENCE AND ALTERATION IN SERPENTINITES
T2  - GEOCHIMICA ET COSMOCHIMICA ACTA
LA  - English
KW  - PROGRESSIVE METAMORPHISM
AB  - Accessory chromium spinel occurring in serpentinites is usually altered. The extent of this alteration and its relationship to alteration processes such as serpentinization and metamorphism is not defined, complicating the use of altered spinel as a petrogenetic indicator. Here, the relationship between different alteration processes and spinel alteration is evaluated in terms of accessory chromium spinel occurring in serpentinites of progressive metamorphism in the eastern Central Alps.
   Two coexisting Cr-spinels were identified, i.e., an altered, Fe-rich Cr-spinel (I) with Cr > Al, and an Fe-poor, Cr-spinel (II) with Al > Cr, which exsolved a Cr-Fe3+ phase and which resisted alteration. Alteration of Cr-spinel (I) is evident from decreasing Al, Mg, and Cr values, with a trend leading to ferrite-chromite (trend a). An enrichment in Cr (trend b) related to CO2 in the serpentinizing fluid, indicated by the presence of carbonate, talc or tremolite, is superimposed to (a).
   Alteration is a decomposition of the spinel structure caused by the dissolution of Mg, Al, and Cr during serpentinization. Dissolution of Cr is favored in a reduced environment whereas reprecipitation occurs under locally oxidizing conditions, indicated by the presence of CO2 . SiO2 detected in spinel is a relative measure of the degree of alteration. Metamorphism up to amphibolite facies recrystallized and homogenized preexisting spinel phases to various degrees.
   Whether or not and to what extent a spinel alters depends on its Fe content. Fe2+, stabilized in the octahedral site (high CFSE), is responsible for an inverse and less stable spinel structure. Fe-rich spinels (Cr-spinel I) are, therefore, readily subjected to alteration, whereas Fe-poor spinels (Cr-spinel II) are resistant to alteration during the serpentinization processes.

AB  - The phenotypic properties of the M. tuberculosis strains obtained from patients with pulmonary or extra-pulmonary tuberculosis are determined by a complex set of factors: the genetic characteristics of the pathogen, its ability to adapt in vivo and in vitro, the influence of the host's immune system and chemotherapy. The growth rate as the phenotypic property is the most accessible for the study of the host-pathogen relationships at the level of host/strain population interactions. The aim of the study is to assess in vitro of the growth rate of M. tuberculosis strains isolated from patients with pulmonary and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis: untreated and treated (with surgical and non-surgical treatment) and also sensitive and resistant isolates in comparison with the reference strain H37Rv. To estimate the growth rate of 116 clinical isolates we have used the modified method originally developed by von Groll and co-authors: to get the bacteria growth curve the fluorescence intensity of growing strains (with indicator resazurin) has been measured daily for 8 days in 96-well plate. The growth rate is determined as the slope of the growth curve. The mean values of the growth rate have been calculated in the following groups of patients: 1- untreated patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PT), respiratory material; 2 - non-surgical treated PT patients, respiratory material; 3 - surgical treated PT patients (mainly with chronic and hyperchronic process), respiratory material; 4 - patients like in 3rd group, surgical material; 5 - bone and joint tuberculosis (BJT), surgical material. In addition, groups of sensitive and resistant strains have been examined, but there are no significant differences in growth rates. It has been obtained that the growth rate of strains isolated from the PT patients is higher than in BJT patients: it can be explained less favorable conditions for the pathogen vegetation in the BJT. In the case of a closed tuberculous lesion where the pathogen transmission to another host is impossible, then the selection of strains with the property to survive in the tissues of the osteoarticular system is impossible too, therefor it should be observed only an adaptation of the pathogen strain population to the individual host. The growth rate of isolates from untreated PT patients is higher than that of the treated ones. Comparison of the growth parameters of only MDR strains 1-5 groups to eliminate the influence of the sensitivity/resistance has resulted in the same conclusions. We suggest that the decrease in the growth rate of strains from the treated PT patients is in not only result of the treatment, but also is conditioned by adaptation of the pathogen to its external environment, which is the internal environment of the macroorganism. To confirm this assumption, the bacterial load of 1,083 diagnostic specimens grouped in a similar manner has been estimated, taking into account only MDR/XDR strains. In the group of treated patients the frequency of high bacterial load (CFU >= 100) reached 52.5-63.8% that shows the conserved fitness of bacteria in such patients. The mean values of the growth rate of the strain H37Rv non-adapted to the macroorganism (due to numerous passages on artificial media) are higher than in all groups of clinical strains. Thus, heterogeneity of phenotypic properties of M tuberculosis clinical strains on the basis of growth rate has been obtained. The growth rate of M.
   tuberculosis clinical strains is depended on the tuberculosis localization (PT, BJT) and on the joint effect of patient treatment and pathogen adaptation to the host.

AB  - The Jurassic/Cretaceous boundary interval in the northern hemisphere is characterized by the widespread occurrence of black shales. About 60% of all petroleum source rocks comprise sediments of late Jurassic and early Cretaceous age with the origin of such black shales still under discussion. In order to better understand the factors that controlled black shale sedimentation, 78 samples were analyzed for calcareous nannofossils from two sections (Gorodische, Kashpir) of the Volga Basin (NE Russia). Calcareous nannofossils are ideal proxies for deciphering nutrient, temperature and salinity fluctuations. Additionally 58 samples from both sections were also analyzed for clay mineralogy, delta(13)C(org) , TOC and CaCO3 composition. Both sections contain calcareous claystones and intercalated organic rich shales overlain by phosphorite beds. The presence of the calcareous nannofossil species Stephanolithion atmetros throughout both successions allows a biostratigraphic assignment to the S. atmetros Nannofossil Biozone (NJ 17), which corresponds to the Dorsoplanites panderi Ammonite Biozone of the Middle Volgian. The marlstones of the Kashpir section yield a well-preserved rich and diverse nannoflora, whereas all black shale beds are essentially barren of calcareous nannofossils. Only the uppermost black shale layers yield an impoverished assemblage of low diversity and abundance. Geochemical data suggest an early diagenetic nannofossil dissolution in the black shales of the Kashpir section. This is supported by the occurrence of coccoliths in black shale horizons of the Gorodische section. The assemblages in both sections are dominated by coccoliths of the Watznaueriaceae group (Watznaueria barnesae, Watznaueria fossacincta, Watznaueria britannica, Watznaueria communis), Biscutum constans and Zeugrhabdotus erectus. In Kashpir rare specimens of Crucibiscutum salebrosum occur in the higher part of the section. These taxa indicate boreal affinities. B. constans and Z. erectus are considered to be taxa indicative of a higher productive environment, while C. salebrosum is a cool-water species. From base to top of the Kashpir section, consecutive mass occurrences of different taxa/groups were observed: W. barnesae-W. fossacincta acme, W. britannica-W. communis acme, Z. erectus acme, B. constans acme (including sparse occurrences of C. salebrosum).
   The observed distribution patterns have been interpreted as characterizing a transition from a low productive, oligotrophic setting with high abundances of K-selected cosmopolitan species (Watznaueriaceae) and predominating marlstone sedimentation to a higher productive, mesotrophic setting. Cooler water temperatures marked by r-selection and acmes of opportunistic species (Z. erectus, B. constans) are coincident with the deposition of black shales and phosphorites in the higher part of the section. Interpretation of clay mineral distribution indicates that black shale deposition occurred under semi-arid hinterland climatic conditions concomitant with a sea level rise. This induced dysoxic conditions in the deeper parts of the Volga Basin, favoring the preservation of organic matter. The cause of the nutrient enrichment in the surface water is still unclear, but possible river water input from the continents does not seem to have been the controlling factor under a semi-arid climate. The occurrence of phosphorites in the upper part of both sections presumably indicates that enhanced productivity may be better explained by the upwelling of nutrient-rich bottom water and thereby causing the recycling of nutrients from oxidized phytoplankton back into the photic zone. This recycling effect finally may have led to an intensified phytoplankton growth which seemed to be a sufficient source for the enrichment of organic matter. This is well correlated with the increase in black shale horizons in the upper part of the Kashpir section.

AB  - Drought is amongst the most precarious natural hazards associated with severe repercussions. The characterization of droughts is usually carried out by the sector-specific (meteorological/agricultural/hydrological) indices that are mostly based on hydroclimatic variables. Groundwater is the major source of water supply during drought periods, and the socio-economic factors control the aftermaths of droughts; however, they are often ignored by the sector-specific indices, thereby failing to capture the overall impacts of droughts. This study aims to circumvent this issue by incorporating hydroclimatic, socio-economic and physiographic information to assess the overall drought vulnerability over Narmada River Basin, India, which is an agriculture-dominated basin highly dependent on groundwater resources. A Comprehensive Drought Vulnerability Indicator (CDVI) is proposed that assimilates the information on meteorological fluctuations, depth to groundwater level, slope, distance from river reach, population density, land use/land cover, soil type, and elevation through a geospatial approach. The CDVI showed a remarkable geospatial variation over the basin, with a majority (66.4%) of the area under highly to extremely vulnerable conditions. Out of 35 constituent districts of the basin, 9, 22, and 4 districts exhibited moderate, high, and extreme vulnerability to droughts, respectively. These results urge an immediate attention towards reducing drought vulnerability and enhancing resilience towards drought occurrences. The proposed multi-dimensional approach for drought vulnerability mapping would certainly help policy-makers to proactively plan and manage water resources over the basin, especially to ameliorate the pernicious impacts of droughts.

AB  - Lakes and their catchments have been subjected to centuries to millennia of exploitation by humans. Efficient monitoring methods are required to promote proactive protection and management. Traditional monitoring is time consuming and expensive, which limits the number of lakes monitored. Lake surface sediments provide a temporally integrated representation of environmental conditions and contain high microbial biomass. Based on these attributes, we hypothesized that bacteria associated with lake trophic states could be identified and used to develop an index that would not be confounded by non-nutrient stressor gradients. Metabarcoding (16S rRNA gene) was used to assess bacterial communities present in surface sediments from 259 non-saline lakes in New Zealand encompassing a range of trophic states from alpine micmtrophic lakes to lowland hypertrophic lakes. A subset of lakes (n = 96) with monitoring data was used to identify indicator amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) associated with different trophic states. A total of 10,888 indicator taxa were identified and used to develop a Sediment Bacterial Trophic Index (SBTI), which signficantly correlated (r(2) = 0.842, P <0.001) with the Trophic lake Index. The SBTI was then derived for the remaining 163 lakes, providing new knowledge of the trophic state of these unmonitored lakes. This new, robust DNA-based tool provides a rapid and cost-effective method that will allow a greater number of lakes to be monitored and more effectively managed in New Zealand and globally. The SBTI could also be applied in a paleolimnological context to investigate changes in trophic status over centuries to millennia.

AB  - The Pyrenophora genus involves an extremely important group of fungal plant pathogens, causing some of the most devastating disease epidemics of cereal plants worldwide. Among them, tan spot caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis is one of the major constraints of wheat production in Argentina. Furthermore, Pyrenophora teres F. maculata is a new recently recorded pathogen infecting leaves of wheat plants causing the spot-type of net blotch, a leaf-spotting symptom easily confused with those caused by tan spot. Most of the wheat cultivars in Argentina have been reported as moderately susceptible to P. tritici-repentis under natural infections. Concerning P. teres F. maculata, no information is available about the currently used cultivars in Argentina. Thirty wheat cultivars currently widely used in Argentina were evaluated for their reaction to one isolate of P. tritici-repentis and two isolates of P. teres F. maculata. The type of lesions occurring on plants was a reliable indicator of susceptibility or resistance of cultivars to both pathogens with artificial inoculations under pot and field conditions. Several wheat genotypes showing susceptibility or resistance to the isolates of the two pathogens tested at seedling and adult plant stages were found. This is the first report of the reaction of Argentinian cultivars to the new pathogen P. teres F. maculata in wheat. We detected that Don Mario Algarrobo, Buck SY 110 and ACA Cedro could be used as source of resistance for both pathogens at seedling and adult stages. This information is useful to improve the resistance to the disease in breeding programs.

AB  - An in situ bioassay approach was used to determine whether aquatic contaminant stressors in a large Atlantic river ecosystem affect the survival of 3 fish species: the largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides, juveniles), the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas, adults), and the robust redhorse (Moxostoma robustum, juveniles). Hatchery-propagated fish were placed into cages to assess site-specific survival in the Yadkin-Pee Dee River of North Carolina and South Carolina, USA. Contaminants were measured in caged fish and sediment and surface water at each site. No apparent longitudinal trends in fish survival were detected, and contaminant concentrations varied among sites. Juvenile largemouth bass and robust redhorse did not survive past 13 and 23 d, with corresponding Kaplan-Meier median survival estimates of 9.7 and 12.1 d, respectively. Survival of adult fathead minnows deployed in cages alongside the juvenile fish averaged 43% at the end of the 28-d exposure, with a 22-d median survival estimate. The intersex condition, an indicator of endocrine disruption, was not observed in any adult fathead minnow. Contaminant accumulation in surviving fathead minnows was apparent, with highest accumulated concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (34.6-93.4 ng/g dry wt), organochlorine pesticides (19.9-66.1 ng/g dry wt), and mercury (0.17-0.63 mu g/g dry wt). Contaminants and other water quality stressors in this river system appear to detrimentally impact juvenile fish survival, with presumed effects at the fish assemblage and community levels.

AB  - Soil enzymes act in biogeochemical cycles of elements and are indicators of soil quality since they rapidly reflect changes of the environmental conditions. Moreover, enzymes are related to soil physicochemical properties, but their spatial distribution has been rarely evaluated. The hypothesis of this work is that soil properties related to fertility and texture (F), total contents of chemical elements obtained by portable X-ray fluorescence (pX) spectrometry and terrain attributes (T) can be used as predictor variables to soil enzyme activity, along with phytophysiognomy and season information. The objective of this work was to predict soil enzymes activity and assess its spatial variability in the most common phytophysiognomies of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero mineral province, in Brazil. Soil samples were collected in four phytophysiognomies during both dry and humid seasons. Activity of beta-glucosidase, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, urease, and hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate (FDA) was determined. Phytophysiognomy, season, F, T, and pX, were used together or separately to predict the enzymes activity through conditional random forest algorithm and the accuracy was assessed via leave-one-out cross validation. The generated models were accurate, with coefficient of determination (R-2) varying from 0.63 (FDA by pX) to 0.82 (beta-glucosidase by F). F variables were more important for the predictions, while pX variables were more important for predicting acid phosphatase and urease. The accurate models using T variables allowed the generation of maps showing the enzymes variability along the phytophysiognomies. This approach can accelerate the determination of soil enzymes activity across the landscape.

AB  - The anticipated increase in extreme disturbance events due to climate change is likely to expose Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) dominated forests in northern Europe to new conditions. Empirical data on the resilience of such natural (unmanaged) forests to disturbance and the long-term patterns of regeneration in its aftermath are currently scarce. We performed a quantitative assessment of natural forest stands in north-western Latvia to identify and characterise the patterns of stand structure 44 years after a stand-replacing disturbance and investigated the effects of legacies on regeneration. The spatial distribution of tree species and their dimensions were assessed in 71 circular sample plots (500 m(2) each) in natural forest areas, where Norway spruce dominated prior to the windthrow and salvage logging was not carried out. Spatial indices (species mingling index, size differentiation index, and aggregation index) were used to characterise stand structure and diversity. The different initial states (age and coverage of surviving trees) of stands affected eventual tree species dominance, size differentiation, degree of mingling and aggregation. Our results demonstrate a close relationship between disturbance legacies and spatial indices. The pre-storm understory and canopy survivors decreased species mingling, whereas survivors increased size differentiation. The size differentiation increased also with a higher degree of species mingling. Leaving differential post-storm legacies untouched promotes a higher structural and species diversity and therefore supports the management approach of preserving canopy survivors.

AB  - Fifty crude oils from reservoirs ranging in age from Cambrian to late Permian and distributed widely over the Permian Basin were geochemically characterized to assess their stratigraphic interrelationships and provenance. Detailed characterization using stable carbon isotopic composition and biomarker characteristics recognized five genetic groups. Genetic group I oils originate from a type II kerogen, Ordovician marine shale (Simpson Group) source rock deposited under anoxic conditions. Genetic group II oils, believed to be sourced from two kitchens, originate from type II/III kerogen Devonian marine shale (Woodford Shale) source rock deposited under anoxic to suboxic environments. Genetic group III oils are similar in many respects to group II oils. This group, however, shows evidence of significant terrigenous organic matter input. Genetic group III oils, single kitchen-derived oils, are inferred to be sourced from the Mississippian shale (Barnett Shale). Oils of genetic group IV are sourced from two kitchens and generated from the Cisuralian Wolfcamp shale source rock having type II/III kerogen deposited under anoxic-suboxic environments. Group V oils are derived from carbonate-rich shales (marls) of the Cisuralian Bone Spring Formation, having type II kerogen deposited under extremely anoxic environments.
   With the exception of Devonian- and Mississippian-sourced oils, which occur across a large stratigraphic interval (Cambrian-Ordovician to Permian), the rest of the genetic oil groups occur in close proximity to their candidate source rocks. Although no source rock samples were used in this study, the detailed geochemical study of oils has provided an understanding of the stratigraphic relationships between oils and their inferred source rocks.

KW  - Sustainable Development
AB  - This article examines and explains the necessity and importance of studying the conceptual provisions of sustainable development of enterprises and organizations in the real sector of the economy, taking into account the current environmental, economic, social situation. Also, the work is developing scientific and theoretical provisions on increasing the level of safety of industrial enterprises. Special attention is paid to studying the theoretical and methodological foundations of the concept of "compliance-safety" and the development of methodological foundations of its potential use in the current conditions of the Ukrainian economy to increase the level of sustainable development of enterprises in the real sector of the economy. After analyzing the current state, methodological and practical recommendations, which are associated with potential changes in the number of compliance-safety violations in the domestic economy, were formed. In this regard, the scientific community was invited to expand the terminology base by introducing the terms "compliance safety", which should be formulated based on the current understanding of the term "compliance", as well as close to the concept of "economic security" and "sustainable development". This approach makes it possible to significantly impact the sustainability of the development of industrial enterprises and the economy of the state as a whole. Thanks to this definition, it is possible to consider the dynamics of the compliance safety indicator in determining the sustainable development of an enterprise and determine the size and importance of the impact of micro and macro factors on safety. In this work, special theoretical and methodological provisions and methodological recommendations were developed for assessing the value of a comprehensive compliance safety indicator. The authors' proposals were tested at many machine-building enterprises of the North-Eastern industrial region of Ukraine.

AB  - The restoration of Nardus grasslands is often hampered by high bioavailability of soil phosphorus and disturbed soil communities. In order to better understand these bottlenecks, we studied Nardus grassland species grown together in communities with fast-growing species in 50-liter pots along a gradient of bioavailable phosphorus with or without inoculated soil biota. These mesocosms allowed the plants to freely interact, including competition for light and nutrients.
   We investigated changes in the plant community composition along the phosphorus gradient using Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN). We found a negative threshold of 11.5 mg P-Olsen kg(-1) with six significant indicator plant species. Above the threshold, a small increase in phosphorus resulted in a disproportionally large drop in biomass for the indicator species, including four typical Nardus grassland species. The decline in these 'oligotrophic indicator species' was also linked to increasing plant community biomass, so we suggest the oligotrophic indicator species to be outcompeted for light by fast-growing plant species. We did not find an effect of the soil biota treatment on the biomass of the oligotrophic indicator species, but did observe a positive effect of inoculation with soil biota on the total biomass of the plant community.
   Interestingly, the threshold for the plant communities in the mesocosm experiment was comparable to the upper bioavailable phosphorus concentrations in remnant Nardus grasslands in northern Belgium. For the restoration of Nardus grasslands, such phosphorus-poor soil conditions appear to be essential, because the plant species that typically occur in these grasslands are able to handle nutrient limitation, but not light limitation.

AB  - With low potential to generate harmful by-products, peracetic acid (PAA) has drawn increasing attention as an alternative oxidant for disinfection and advanced oxidation processes in wastewater treatment. Commercial formulations contain significant concentrations of both PAA and H2O2 in aqueous solutions and a robust method to distinctively quantify the two respective oxidants simultaneously is needed. This study aimed to improve the accuracy of employing methyl p-tolyl sulfide (MTS) and triphenylphosphine (TPP) as indicators for PAA and H2O2, respectively, under various environmental conditions, by the detection of the oxidation products of sulfoxide MTSO and phosphine oxide TPPO using HPLC-UV. To improve the analytical method, the reaction rates of MTS and TPP with PAA and H2O2, impact of pH on the detection, and matrix effects of real wastewater effluents and produce wash water were evaluated to minimize the interference of H2O2 with PAA determination. The determined rate constants of PAA reaction with MTS (k(PAA/MTS) = 34.6 +/- 0.4 M(-1)s(-1) in 2/1 H2O/acetonitrile (ACN) (v/v)) and H2O2 reaction with TPP (k(H2O2)/(TPP) = 2.7 +/- 0.2 M(-1)s(-1) in 1/1 H2O/ACN (v/v)) provided the fundamental guidance to optimize the method. Overall, a highly accurate and sensitive method for simultaneous quantification of PAA and H2O2 (method quantification limit = 0.8 and 6.0 mu M, respectively) is established and will be useful for various environmental samples with PAA and H2O2 applications.

AB  - Calcium has long been known to regulate the metabolism of chloroplasts, concerning both light and carbon reactions of photosynthesis, as well as additional non photosynthesis-related processes. In addition to undergo Ca2+ regulation, chloroplasts can also influence the overall Ca2+ signaling pathways of the plant cell. Compelling evidence indicate that chloroplasts can generate specific stromal Ca2+ signals and contribute to the fine tuning of cytoplasmic Ca2+ signaling in response to different environmental stimuli. The recent set up of a toolkit of genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators, targeted to different chloroplast subcompartments (envelope, stroma, thylakoids) has helped to unravel the participation of chloroplasts in intracellular Ca2+ handling in resting conditions and during signal transduction. Intra-chloroplast Ca2+ signals have been demonstrated to occur in response to specific environmental stimuli, suggesting a role for these plant-unique organelles in transducing Ca2+-mediated stress signals. In this mini-review we present current knowledge of stimulus-specific intra-chloroplast Ca2+ transients, as well as recent advances in the identification and characterization of Ca2+-permeable channels/transporters localized at chloroplast membranes. In particular, the potential role played by cMCU, a chloroplast-localized member of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) family, as component of plant environmental sensing is discussed in detail, taking into account some specific structural features of cMCU. In summary, the recent molecular identification of some players of chloroplast Ca2+ signaling has opened new avenues in this rapidly developing field and will hopefully allow a deeper understanding of the role of chloroplasts in shaping physiological responses in plants.

AB  - Google Earth provides potential for exploiting an enormous reservoir of freely-available remotely sensed data to support river science and management. In this paper, we consider how the platform can support investigation of river physical forms and processes by developing an empirically-based reach-scale classification of semi-natural European single thread to transitional rivers. Using strict reach and image selection criteria, we identified 194 reaches of 68 rivers for analysis. Measurements of channel dimensions and counts of in-channel and floodplain features, standardised for reach length and channel width where necessary, were used to derive a series of geomorphologically-relevant process indicators. A suite of multivariate analyses were then applied to this data set, resulting in the discrimination of five river types: laterally stable, laterally active sinuous-meandering; transitional (near-braided); bedrock; and cascade/step dominated. The results of the classification were tested by examining the characteristics and distribution of the river classes in relation to known independent controls of river form including reach-scale energy and valley confinement conditions. Our results show that if methods of data extraction are carefully developed, physically meaningful river reach discrimination can be achieved using Google Earth. Although there are limits to the types of information that can be extracted such that field investigations cannot always be avoided, there is enormous potential to mine Google Earth across different space and time scales, supporting the assembly of large, reliable data sets relevant to river forms and processes in a very cost-effective way.

AB  - Growing world population along with fast economic growth and increased living standards have increased the municipal waste generation making its management be a foremost global issue. The problem is even more serious in urban areas as its improper management prompts tainting of soil, water, and environment which create public health risks. These problems of waste disposal and management were usually assessed by traditional methods which require loads of data. The recent development in the new software technologies and Internet along with the introduction of gradually more compact and dependable hardware products have presented the ability to accurately deal with these procedures more easily than costly and tedious field experiments. This paper presents an outline of the utilization of different scientific models in solving the environmental problems of municipal waste disposal. The examination of past literature uncovered that usually optimization models were used to find the answer of 'what is the best' under an explicit arrangement of conditions, while, simulation models were usually helpful to get an answer to 'what if? ' due to their predictive capability. An indication of the municipal waste disposal problems and its management alongside the ramifications of the investigation is provided. The rationale and backdrop of the waste disposal issues are described. The applications of optimization modeling, multi-objective approach, multi-criteria decision analysis, and artificial neural networks in waste management are presented and applications of these modeling techniques in diverse case studies worldwide are described. And finally, the conclusions of the analysis are summarized.

AB  - Background: The care of critically ill patients is a strong indicator of service quality provided in the emergency department. Since families are the major social support sources, assessing the family members' needs may reduce their anxiety and depression owing to the acute situation of their loved ones while improving the patients' recovery. Objective: We aimed to evaluate the expectations and needs of relatives of critically ill patients to formulate solutions to improve the quality of emergency department service. Methods: We conducted a prospective, cross-sectional survey of 873 relatives of nontraumatic, critically ill patients who completed the Turkish version of the Critical Care Family Needs Inventory in the emergency department of a university hospital in Turkey. The needs statements were evaluated under five subheadings: meaning, proximity, communication, comfort, and support. Results: In total, 249 (28.5%) participants were females and 624 (71.5%) were males (mean age, 41.79 years). The "meaning" category was given the highest priority, followed by "communication," with average points of 3.75 and 3.57, respectively. The most important needs were being informed regularly about the patient's condition and being assured that the patient is under the best possible care, whereas personal, physical, and emotional needs were the least important. Conclusion: Relatives of critically ill patients primarily focus on the quality of patients' care. Creating a positive rapport based on trust and providing a healthcare environment where the expectations and needs of relatives are met should be prioritized by emergency department physicians, nurses, and other staff while caring for critically ill patients.

AB  - Regulations that are indirectly driving the substitution of hazardous chemicals, such as the EU REACH regulation, necessitate improvements in chemical alternatives assessment frameworks. In those frameworks, life cycle thinking lacks some important aspects such as systematic and quantitative occupational safety methods and risks from intermediate chemicals that are not released to the environment under normal operating conditions. Concerns of companies about regulatory drivers regarding substances of very high concern often lead to inadequate evaluation of the baseline situation; an issue also overlooked by the frameworks. Moreover, life cycle assessment is optional for assessors with limited resources, such as small and medium enterprises. However, the success of substitution should not be evaluated without life cycle concerns. An environmental impact assessment model has been suggested to overcome these shortcomings of the chemical alternatives assessment frameworks. The model was applied to a case study of primed metal sheet production, where the company was driven to substitute reprotoxic 2-methoxypropanol used in their formulations. The results show that the proposed model is promising for solving the mentioned shortcomings, informing the assessor about substances of very high concern along the life cycle, and it has the potential to be further improved with the help of supporting software and databases. Particularly, in the occupational safety area that concerns risks of accidents at work, improvements to the EU occupational health database can drastically increase the accuracy of the assessments. Besides, the development of methodologies for the quantification of the impacts of reprotoxic, bioaccumulative and endocrine disruptor substances is necessary. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The evolving spatial and temporal knowledge about vineyard performance through the use of remote sensing offers new perspectives for vine water status studies. This paper describes the application of aerial thermal imaging to evaluate vine water status to improve irrigation scheduling decisions, water use efficiency, and overall winegrape quality in the Coonawarra viticultural region of South Australia. Airborne infrared images were acquired during the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons in the region of Coonawarra, South Australia. Several thermal indices of crop water status (CWSI, I-g, (T-c-T-a)) were calculated that correlated with conventional soil and vine water status measures (Psi(pd,) Psi(s,) g(s)). CWSI and I-g could discriminate between the two cultivars used in this study, Cabernet Sauvignon (CAS) and Shiraz (SHI), as did the conventional water stress measures. The relationship between conventional vine water status measures appeared stronger with CWSI in the warmer and drier season (2016) compared to the cooler and wetter season (2017), where I-g and (T-c-T-a) showed stronger correlations. The study identified CWSI, I-g and (T-c-T-a) to be reliable indicators of vine water status under a variety of environmental conditions. This is the first study to report on high resolution vine water status at a regional scale in Australia using a combination of remote and direct sensing methods. This methodology is promising for aerial surveillance of vine water status across multiple blocks and cultivars to inform irrigation scheduling.

AB  - How to address improving degraded soil has become an increased concern for agricultural production. Biomass ash is used for remediation of degraded soil and improvement in soil structure. To investigate the responses of aggregate stability and soil consistency by biomass ash and other amendments, a pot experiment with a degraded soil and seven treatments including a control (CK), no fertilizer or amendment; only N-P-K fertilizer (F); N-P-K fertilizer with lime (FL), lime and zeolite (FLZ), biomass ash (FBA), biological fertilizer (FBF) and peat ash (FPA), respectively, were conducted. Stability of soil aggregate, water-holding capacity, and soil consistency was analyzed within a lettuce-water spinach-lettuce planting system. Results showed that amendment additions significantly raised the fractions of >0.25 mm soil aggregate. Applications of biomass ash reduced the percentage of aggregate destruction (PAD) by 45.07%-59.97% and reduced the value of fractal dimension (D) by 1.79-2.16 during whole cultivation period, indicating the stability of soil aggregates. Soil organic matter (SOM) plays a key role in soil consistency because of significant relationship between SOM and soil consistency indicators including plastic limit (PL), liquid limit (LL), plasticity index (PI) and liquidity index (LI). While, hydrodynamic characters and potential low clay content occurred in the soil treated with biomass ash during high moisture conditions. These findings suggest that the application of biomass ash improved the stability of soil aggregate, which improved the structural stability of degraded soil but may pose a risk to soil erosion by water force.

AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that both dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) and insular cortex (IC) are critical for somatic sensory information transmission and regulation, especially for pain, and neurons in the DR send projection fibers to the IC. However, whether these ascending connections are involved in the processing of itch sensation remains unknown. In order to provide evidence for that, fluoro-gold (FG) retrograde tracing combined with immunofluorescent histochemical staining was performed for revealing the chemical nature of the projection neurons and the FOS expression induced by acute itch stimulation via intradermal histamine or chloroquine injection in the mouse. Both FOS- and p-ERK-containing neurons were increased in the DR and IC in the acute itch mice compared to those in the sham group. After FG was injected into the IC, FG-labeled retrograde neuronal cell bodies were observed in the whole extent of the brainstem, especially in the DR. About 81% of the total number of FG-labeled neurons in the DR showed serotonin (5-HT)-immunopositive staining. About 32% FG-labeled 5-HT-ergic neurons within DR expressed FOS in chroloquine-induced acute itch, whereas only 6% FG-labeled 5-HT-ergic neurons within DR expressed FOS in histamine-induced acute itch. These results provide morphological evidence for that there are 5-HT-ergic projections from the DR to IC which might be involved in the sensory information processing of acute itch. These results are helpful for understanding functional roles of 5-HT-ergic ascending projection under the condition of acute itch.

AB  - Sand layers deposited in coastal backbarrier lakes and marshes have been taken as indicators of overwash processes generated by hurricane landfalls, but sand layers discovered in sediments from non-backbarrier estuarine settings have not been as thoroughly investigated. Sedimentological and diatom analyses of a 44-cm core (WB 08-04) taken from a seep forest on the north shore of Weeks Bay in southern Alabama contains an 8-cm-thick sand layer embedded in dark gray peat. As an aid to determining the provenance of the sand layer, diatoms were also analyzed from eight surface samples taken from five nearby environments representing different salinity conditions. The diatom assemblage in the sand layer is dominated by acidophilous (Eunotia spp., Frustulia krammeri) and freshwater (Pinnularia neomajor, Pinnularia latevittata) species, suggesting that they were transported by fluvial processes from the acidic and freshwater bogs above the banks of Fish River. The sand layer also contains small percentages of brackish and marine diatoms (Tryblionella marginulata, Planothidium delicatulum), suggesting that incursion of seawater and brackish water from Weeks Bay and Mobile Bay also played a role in its deposition. It is inferred that the sand layer was deposited by a hurricane that brought both intense precipitation to coastal Alabama and a storm surge into Weeks Bay. Heavy rainfall caused overbank flooding of Fish River, which transported sand from the river banks and diatoms from nearby bogs to the coring site. Concurrently, storm surge waters also deposited marine and brackish diatoms at the site. Historical records suggest that the Bernard Romans' Gulf Coast Hurricane in AD 1772 may have been responsible for the flooding that resulted in the deposition of the sand layer.

AB  - Rural areas are in decline, globally, and their revitalization requires the symbiotic development of rural housing and industry. Whereas previous studies have examined the relationship between urban jobs and housing and rural population flows, a systematic examination of the relationship between rural housing and industry is lacking. In the Taihang Mountains in China, natural conditions and other factors have constrained symbiotic rural housing-industry development, leading to their separation in most areas. Consequently, a case study of Fuping County, in this region, was conducted to measure the rural housing-industry symbiotic level (HISL). The HISL was established through an assessment of population, land, and industry indicators that were used to construct an evaluation model. The spatial characteristics of HISL, population-land-industry interaction forces, and functional zones were analyzed to ascertain the causes of the rural housing-industry disjuncture. The results of the analysis indicated that the county's overall HISL was low, with clear spatial east-west differences. The unbalanced development of the population-land-industry system and the interactions of its components have led to the emergence of three village types: population-land force leading (PLL), population-industry force leading (PIL), and land-industry force leading (LIL). Three functional zones relating to symbiotic rural housing -industry development were identified: key development, potential development, and steadily improving zones. The low level of population-industry coordination is a significant cause of the housing-industry disjuncture. The use of the above model for assessing the relationship between rural housing and industry can yield insights for promoting sustainable rural development and revitalization through geographical engineering.

AB  - White sand heath forests (WS) or kerangas, an unusual variant of tropical forests in Borneo, characterized by open scrubby vegetation, low productivity, and distinctive plant species composition and soil microbial community, are regarded as a stressful lowpH and/or nutrient environment. We investigated whether the functional soil metagenome also shows a predicted set of indicators of stressful conditions in WS. Based on stress-tolerant strategies exhibited by larger organisms, we hypothesized that genes for stress tolerance, dormancy, sporulation, and nutrient processing are more abundant in the soil microbiota of WS. We also hypothesized that there is less evidence of biotic interaction in white sand soils, with lower connectivity and fewer genes related to organismic interactions. In Brunei, we sampled soils from a WS and a normal primary dipterocarp forest, together with an inland heath, an intermediate forest type. Soil DNA was extracted, and shotgun sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq platform, with classification by the Metagenomics Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology (MG-RAST). The results, on one hand, supported our hypothesis (on greater abundance of dormancy, virulence, and sporulation-related genes). However, some aspects of our results showed no significant difference (specifically in stress tolerance, antibiotic resistance, viruses, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindrome repeats (CRISPRs)). It appears that in certain respects, the extreme white sand environment produces the predicted strategy of less biotic interaction, but exhibits high soil microbiota connectivity and functional diversity.

AB  - Existing analytical and semianalytical solutions for density-driven flow (DDF) in porous media are limited to 2-D domains. In this work, we develop a semianalytical solution using the Fourier Galerkin method to describe DDF induced by salinity gradients in a 3-D porous enclosure. The solution is constructed by deriving the vector potential form of the governing equations and changing variables to obtain periodic boundary conditions. Solving the 3-D spectral system of equations can be computationally challenging. To alleviate computations, we develop an efficient approach, based on reducing the number of primary unknowns and simplifying the nonlinear terms, which allows us to simplify and solve the problem using only salt concentration as primary unknown. Test cases dealing with different Rayleigh numbers are solved to analyze the solution and gain physical insight into 3-D DDF processes. In fact, the solution displays a 3-D convective cell (actually a vortex) that resembles the quarter of a torus, which would not be possible in 2-D. Results also show that 3-D effects become more important at high Rayleigh number. We compare the semianalytical solution to research (Transport of RadioACtive Elements in Subsurface) and industrial (COMSOL Multiphysics (R)) codes. We show cases (high Raleigh number) where the numerical solution suffers from numerical artifacts, which highlight the worthiness of our semianalytical solution for code verification and benchmarking. In this context, we propose quantitative indicators based on several metrics characterizing the fluid flow and mass transfer processes and we provide open access to the source code of the semianalytical solution and to the corresponding numerical models.

AB  - Cervical carcinoma is known as one of the most lethal and common conditions in women worldwide. Increasing evidence shows that microRNAs (miRs) may be involved in the pathogenesis of cervical carcinoma. This study investigates the correlation between expression of miR-224 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and both diagnosis and prognosis of cervical carcinoma to clarify the effect miR-224 has on the biological behaviors of the subjected cervical carcinoma cells. Initially, 132 patients diagnosed with cervical carcinoma and 120 healthy subjects were recruited. Peripheral blood expression of miR-224 and PTX3 was detected. A telephone follow-up was performed every 3 months after treatment. The diagnostic value of miR-224 in cervical carcinoma was analyzed using the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. The effects of both miR-224 and PTX3 on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were evaluated with an intervention of miR-224 ectopic expression or depletion and PTX3 silencing. The bioinformatics prediction website and dual-luciferase reporter assay revealed PTX3 to be a target gene for miR-224. Moreover, miR-224 was detected as over-expressed, but PTX3 was under-expressed in cervical carcinoma. Additionally, as a diagnostic biomarker, a high miR-224 expression was closely linked with the progression of cervical carcinoma. Both miR-224 overexpression and PTX3 silencing promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, whereas, the aforementioned properties were depressed when miR-224 was inhibited. Altogether, the miR-224 overexpression may be a biological indicator in predicting the progression of cervical carcinoma. Thus, miR-224 inhibition may significantly prevent cervical carcinoma progression by targeting the PTX3 gene.

AB  - In light of global trends in human population growth and urbanization, burgeoning cultural heritage tourism industries, and climate change, cultural heritage places in nearly every corner of the world are significantly threatened, and will remain so into the foreseeable future. Rock art sites are some of the most imperiled, with their exposed contexts posing unique challenges to conservation. Consequently, effective management of publically accessible rock art sites necessitates a sustainable approach that weighs visitation in regard to cultural significance and site stability. This essay integrates rock art stability and sustainability assessment methodologies at the Painted Rock Petroglyph Site in southwestern Arizona. The study specifically applies the Rock Art Stability Index (RASI) to evaluate the natural and anthropogenic weathering forces impacting the site, and the Heritage Asset Sensitivity Gauge (HASG) to assess site sustainability under existing management practices in relation to current and forecasted rates of visitation. A spatial analysis of aggregated RASI data shows that visitor foot traffic has had some of the most profound impacts to the petroglyphs. Unrestricted access to the site area is also highly correlated with the presence and location of vandalism and graffiti, and visitor-related trampling has adversely affected the site's surface artifact assemblage. Application of the HASG projects that, while existing management practices are fairly sustainable, they become less so under forecasted increases in visitation. Further, the HASG appraises the site's cultural significance as outweighing its market appeal, indicating management efforts should prioritize conservation over tourism-related development.

AB  - Grazing lands support the livelihoods of millions of people across nearly one-half of the globe. Soils are the backbone of stability and resilience in these systems. To determine livestock grazing impacts on soil health, we conducted a global meta-analysis of soil organic carbon (SOC), total N, C/N ratio, and bulk density responses to grazing strategies (continuous, rotational, and no grazing) and intensities (heavy, moderate, and light grazing) from 64 studies around the world. Across all studies and grazing intensities, continuous grazing significantly reduced SOC, C/N, and total N compared with no grazing. Soil compaction (i.e., increased bulk density) was greater under both continuous and rotational grazing compared with no grazing; however, rotational grazing had lower bulk density than continuous grazing. Rotational grazing had greater SOC than continuous grazing and was not different from no grazing. The positive responses of SOC to rotational grazing could create climate change mitigation opportunities. Grazing strategy comparisons were minimally conditioned by aridity class (i.e., arid, subhumid, and humid); however, complete observations were notably limited or missing for many rotational grazing comparisons. For continuous and no grazing strategy comparisons, we found that grazing management can significantly influence soil function and health outcomes; however, site-specific environmental factors play important moderating roles. Greater coordination across regional, national, and global efforts, as well as consistent guidelines for soil health evaluation, would help overcome these knowledge gaps and vastly improve our collective understanding of grazing impacts on soil health, providing greater management and policy impacts.

We apply the City Blueprint (R) Approach which consists of three indicator assessments: (1) the Trends and Pressures Framework (TPF), (2) the City Blueprint Framework (CBF) and (3) the water Governance Capacity Framework (GCF). The TPF summarizes the main social, environmental and financial pressures that may impede water management. The CBF provides an integrated overview of the management performances within the urban watercycle. Finally, the GCF provides a framework to identify key barriers and opportunities to develop governance capacity. The GCF has only been applied in NYC. Results show that all cities face pressures from heat risk. The management performances regarding resource efficiency and resource recovery from wastewater and solid waste show considerable room for improvement. Moreover, stormwater separation, infrastructure maintenance and green space require improvement in order to achieve a resilient urban watercycle. Finally, in New York City, the GCF results show that learning through smart monitoring, evaluation and cross-stakeholder learning is a limiting condition that needs to be addressed. We conclude that the City Blueprint Approach has large potential to assist cities in their strategic planning and exchange of knowledge, experiences and lessons. Because the methodology is well-structured, easy to understand, and concise, it may bridge the gap between science, policy and practice. It could therefore enable other cities to address their challenges of water, waste and climate change.

AB  - Coastal towns along the coast of Africa are among the most vulnerable to climate change impacts such as flooding and sea level rise. Yet, because coastal conditions in many parts of the region are poorly understood, knowledge on which population groups are at the most risk is less known, particularly in the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA) of Ghana, where the capital city Accra is located. Without adequate information about the risk levels and why, the implementation of locally appropriate adaptation plans may be less effective. This study enriches our understanding of the levels of flood risks along the coast of GAMA and contributes knowledge to improve understanding of place-specific adaptation plans. The study uses data from a 300-household survey, stakeholder meetings, and interviews with local community leaders to construct an integrated vulnerability index. The index includes seven components made up of: dwelling type; house and house environment; household socioeconomic characteristics; experience and perception of flood risk; household and community flood adaptation strategies; house location, and physical characteristics. Our findings show that exposure to floods, particularly from local flash floods is relatively high in all communities. However, significant differences in sensitivity and adaptive capacity of the communities were observed due to differences in location, socioeconomic characteristics, and perception of risks to flooding and sea level rise. The complexity of factors involved in the determination of local-level vulnerability requires that the implementation of adaptation strategies needs to involve cross-sectorial partnerships, involving local communities, in building a comprehensive multi-risk adaptation strategy.

AB  - Background: Earthworms are sensitive to toxic chemicals present in the soil and so are useful indicator organisms for soil health. Eisenia fetida are commonly used in ecotoxicological studies; therefore the assembly of a baseline transcriptome is important for subsequent analyses exploring the impact of toxin exposure on genome wide gene expression.
   Results: This paper reports on the de novo transcriptome assembly of E. fetida using Trinity, a freely available software tool. Trinotate was used to carry out functional annotation of the Trinity generated transcriptome file and the transdecoder generated peptide sequence file along with BLASTX, BLASTP and HMMER searches and were loaded into a Sqlite3 database. To identify differentially expressed transcripts; each of the original sequence files were aligned to the de novo assembled transcriptome using Bowtie and then RSEM was used to estimate expression values based on the alignment. EdgeR was used to calculate differential expression between the two conditions, with an FDR corrected P value cut off of 0.001, this returned six significantly differentially expressed genes. Initial BLASTX hits of these putative genes included hits with annelid ferritin and lysozyme proteins, as well as fungal NADH cytochrome b5 reductase and senescence associated proteins. At a cut off of P = 0.01 there were a further 26 differentially expressed genes.
   Conclusion: These data have been made publicly available, and to our knowledge represent the most comprehensive available transcriptome for E. fetida assembled from RNA sequencing data. This provides important groundwork for subsequent ecotoxicogenomic studies exploring the impact of the environment on global gene expression in E. fetida and other earthworm species.

AB  - Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) method decline soot and NOx emission by offering high thermal efficiency in order of diesel engine. However, controlling HCCI combustion phenomena is known as the significant setback for its development. Control-oriented models use CA5, CA10, CA50 and CA90 as the most important dependent variables. Start of combustion (SOC), for instance, has already been traced via pressure rise versus crank angle. In fact, these simplifications have been progressed to reach real-time response as the main nature of controlling target. In this study, a 3D CFD model coupled with detailed chemical kinetics has been modified to devise a brief relation between these controlling parameters and what really happens in combustion chamber. The model has been validated with experimental results in four distinct conditions. To detect combustion phase, hydroxyl radical (OH) has been suggested as an indicator among all other chemical species due to its significant role in CNG combustion. Various sets of simulations have come up with noticeable findings that CA50 in CNG fueled HCCI engine equals crank angles when OH concentration and pressure rise rate reach their peaks. This result represents OH as a potential robust parameter in HCCI engine control even though this relation is not established well in weak combustion region rather than high heat release rate (HHR) cases. Finally, IMEP and BSFC, as the most important performance parameters of an engine have studied versus CA50 and OH concentration variation. The comparison proved good agreement between these two terms except in nearTDC combustion cases. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common complex associated with numerous adverse health outcomes, affecting women of different ages throughout the world. The etiology of BV remains poorly understood due to the difficulty of establishing a molecular genetic criterion to recognize the vaginal microbiota of BV-positive women from that of the normal women. We used techniques of broad-range PCR-DGGE and gel imaging analysis system cooperated with 16S rRNA gene sequencing and statistical analysis to investigate the community structure of the healthy and BV-affected vaginal microbial ecosystems. The community of vaginal bacteria detected in subjects with BV was far more luxuriant and diverse than in subjects without BV. The mean number of microbial species in 128 BV-positive women was nearly two times greater than in 68 subjects without BV(4.05 +/- 1.96 versus 2.59 +/- 1.14). Our sequencing efforts yielded many novel phylotypes (198 of our sequences represented 59 species), including several novel BV-associated bacteria (BVAB) and many belonging to opportunistic infections, which remain inexplicable for their roles in determining the health condition of vaginal microflora. This study identifies Algoriphagus aquatilis, Atopobium vaginae, Burkholderia fungorum, Megasphaera genomosp species as indicators to BV and subjects with BV harbor particularly taxon-rich and diverse bacterial communities. Maybe Bifidobacterium, Staphylococcus or even more alien species are commensal creatures in normal vaginal microbiota. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Protein glycosylation plays an important role in various biological processes, such as modification of protein function, regulation of protein protein interactions, and control of turnover rates of proteins. Moreover, glycans have been considered, as potential biomarkers for many mammalian diseases and development of aberrant glycosylation profiles is an important indicator of the pathology of a disease or cancer: Hence, quantitation is an important aspect of a comprehensive glycomics study. Although numerous MS based quantitation strategies have been developed in the past several decades, some issues affecting sensitivity and accuracy of quantitation still exist, and the development of more effective quantitation strategies is still required. Aminoxy tandem mass tag (aminoxyTMT) reagents are recently commercialized isobaric tags which enable relative quantitation of up to six different glycan samples simultaneously. In this study, liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry conditions have been optimized to achieve reliable LC-MS/MS quantitative glycomic analysis using aminoxyTMT reagents. Samples were resuspended in 0.2 M sodium chloride solution to promote the formation of sodium adduct precursor ions, which leads to, higher MS/MS reporter ion yields. This method was first evaluated with glycans from model glycoproteins and pooled human blood serum samples. The observed variation of reporter ion ratios Was generally less than 10% relative to the theoretical ratio. Even for the highly complex minor N-glycans, the variation was still below 15%. This strategy was further applied to the glycomic profiling of N-glycans released from blood serum samples of patients with different esophageal diseases. Our results demonstrate the benefits of utilizing aminoxyTMT reagents for reliable quantitation of biological glycomic samples.

AB  - The development of a strategic approach to manage pollution of surface waters with pharmaceutical residues is in centre of interest in Europe. In this context a lack of reliable standard procedures for sampling and subsequent assessment of pharmaceutical mass flows in the water cycle has been identified. Authoritative assessment of relevant substance concentrations and flows is essential for environmental risk assessments and reliable efficiency analysis of measures to reduce or avoid emissions of drugs to water systems. Accordingly, a detailed preparation of monitoring campaigns including an accuracy check for the sampling configuration provides important information on the reliability of the gathered data. It finally supports data analysis and interpretation for evaluations of the efficiency of measures as well as for cost benefit assessments. The precision of mass flow balances "is expected to be particularly weak when substances with high short-term variations and rare upstream emissions are considered. This is especially true for substance flow analysis in sewers close to source because of expectable highly dynamic flow conditions and emission patterns of pollutants.
   The case study presented here focusses on the verification of a monitoring campaign in a hospital sewer in Luxembourg.
   The results highlight the importance for a priori accuracy checks and provide a blueprint for well designed monitoring campaigns of pharmaceutical trace pollutants on the one hand. On the other hand, the study provides evidence that the defined and applied continuous flow proportional sampling procedure enables a representative monitoring of short-term peak loads of the x-ray contrast media iobitridol close to source.

AB  - Current World Health Organisation figures estimate that 2.5 million deaths per year result from recreational contact with contaminated water sources. Concerns about quantitative risk assessments of waterways using faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) as surrogates to infer pathogenic risk currently exist. In Melbourne, Australia, the Yarra River has come under public scrutiny due to perceived public health risks associated with aquatic recreation; a characteristic shared with urban estuaries worldwide. A 10-month study of the Yarra estuary investigated the processes that affect FIOs and pathogens within this system. A total of 74 samples were collected from three estuarine and two upstream, freshwater, locations under different climatic and hydrological conditions, and the levels of Escherichia coli, enterococci, Clostridium perfringens, fRNA coliphages, Campylobacter spp. Cryptosporidium oocysts, Giardia cysts, adenoviruses, and enteroviruses were monitored. Reference pathogenic bacteria, protozoa, and viruses were detected in 81%, 19%, and 8% of samples, respectively. Variations in FIO concentrations were found to be associated with changes in specific climatic and hydrological variables including: temperature, flow, humidity and rainfall. In contrast, pathogen levels remained unaffected by all variables investigated. Limitations of current national and international culture-based standard methods may have played a significant role in limiting the identification of correlative relationships The data demonstrate the differences between FIOs and microbial pathogens in terms of sources, sinks, and survival processes within an urban estuary and provide further evidence of the inadequacy of FIO inclusion in the development of worldwide regulatory water quality criteria and risk assessment models.

AB  - The main causes of biodiversity decline are related to human use of resources, which is ultimately triggered by the socioeconomic decisions made by individuals and nations. Characterizing the socioeconomic attributes of areas in which biodiversity is most threatened can help us identify decisions and conditions that promote the presence or absence of threats and potentially suggest more sustainable strategies. In this study we explored how diverse indicators of social and economic development correlate with the conservation status of terrestrial mammals within countries explicitly exploring hypothesized linear and quadratic relationships. First, comparing countries with and without threatened mammals we found that those without threatened species are a disparate group formed by European countries and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) with little in common besides their slow population growth and a past of human impacts. Second, focusing on countries with threatened mammals we found that those with a more threatened mammalian biota have mainly rural populations, are predominantly exporters of goods and services, receive low to intermediate economic benefits from international tourism, and have medium to high human life expectancy. Overall, these results provide a comprehensive characterization of the socioeconomic profiles linked to mammalian conservation status of the world's nations, highlighting the importance of transborder impacts reflected by the international flux of goods, services and people. Further studies would be necessary to unravel the actual mechanisms and threats that link these socioeconomic profiles and indicators with mammalian conservation. Nevertheless, this study presents a broad and complete characterization that offers testable hypotheses regarding how socioeconomic development associates with biodiversity.

AB  - Using surrogate species to monitor the status of target biodiversity in areas undergoing exceptional habitat loss requires extending the traditional assessment of surrogates for taxonomic diversity to validating surrogates for functional diversity. This validation will be critical to inform about broader ecosystem processes and stability. We compared the surrogacy reliability of the habitat-specialist Rufous-legged Owl (Strix rufipes) and the habitat-generalist Austral Pygmy-Owl (Glaucidium nana), and we examined potential underlying mechanisms for surrogacy relationships in Andean temperate forests, a global biodiversity hotspot in southern Chile. During 2011-2013, we conducted 1,145 owl surveys, 505 vegetation surveys, and 505 avian point-transect surveys across 101 sites comprising a range of conditions from degraded forest habitat to structurally complex old-growth forest stands. The habitat-specialist S. rufipes was a reliable surrogate for all avian biodiversity measures, including avian endemism and functional diversity measures (degree of community specialization and density of large-tree users, understory users, and cavity-nesters). On the contrary, the habitat-generalist G. nana did not function as a surrogate. With increasing occurrence of S. rufipes, the density of target specialized biodiversity (species, guilds, and communities) increased nonlinearly and peaked at the least degraded sites. This specialist aggregation might be driven by stand structural complexity available in older, more stable, forests. These results suggest that management actions tailored to promote occurrence of habitat-specialist owls, such as the S. rufipes, may result in enhanced density of endemic species, specialized communities, and likely ecosystem stability.

AB  - Before the emergence of modern modes of transport, the traditional road infrastructure was the major historical means of carrying out nationwide socio-economic exchange. However, the history of transport infrastructure has received little attention from researchers. Given this background, the work reported here examined the long-term development of transport networks in China. The national road network was selected for study and the 3500 years from 1600 BC to 1900 AD was chosen as the study period. Indicators were designed for the maturity level of road networks and an accessibility model was developed for the paths of the shortest distance. The evolution of the road network in China since the Shang Dynasty (1600 BC) was described and its major features were summarized to reveal long-term regularities. The maturity level of the road network and its accessibility was assessed and regions with good and poor networks were identified. The relationship between China's natural, social, and economic systems and the road network were discussed. Our analysis shows that the road network in China has a number of long-term regularities. The continuously expanding road network follows a path of inland expansion especially towards the border areas. However, its coverage and accessibility are characterized by a core-peripheral configuration, which has close relationships with, not only the natural conditions, but also national defense and warfare. The centralization of national power, national land governance, postal transport, the transport of specialized cargos, and international trade are also related to the development of the road network. This research draws attention to the evolving regularities of transport networks.

AB  - An inexpensive, disposable and highly selective microfluidic paper-based analytical device (mu PAD) is described for the determination of ammonia (molecular ammonia and ammonium cation) in wastewaters which implements for the first time a gas-diffusion separation step on a paper-based platform. Its hydrophilic reagent zones were defined by printing filter paper with a hydrophobic paper sizing agent using a conventional inkjet printer. The sample was introduced into the sodium hydroxide impregnated sample zone of the mu PAD. This allowed the quantitative conversion of the ammonium ion to molecular ammonia which diffused across the hydrophobic microporous Teflon membrane of the device into an adjacent hydrophilic reagent zone containing the acid base indicator 3-nitrophenol or bromothymol blue. The change in indicator color was measured using a desktop scanner for ammonia quantification. Under optimal conditions, the mu PAD is characterized by a limit of detection of 0.8 and 1.8 mg NL-1 and repeatability of 3.1 and 3.7% (n >= 10, 20 mg N L-1), expressed as relative standard deviation, in the case of 3-nitrophenol or bromothymol blue, respectively. This mu PAD was used successfully for the determination of ammonia in sewage and soil water samples. The small dimensions, minimal reagent consumption, low cost, simplicity of operation, and possibility of using a portable scanner make the proposed mu PAD suitable for on-site ammonia monitoring in contaminated environmental waters and domestic, agricultural and industrial wastewaters. The successful implementation of the gas-diffusion approach on a paper-based platform is expected to result in the development of other mu PADs for volatile analytes.

AB  - Ciliates are a primary component of the periphyton microfauna and play a crucial role in the functioning of microbial food webs. Seasonal variation in community structures of periphytic ciliate communities was studied, using glass slides as an artificial substratum, during a 1-year cycle (August 2011-July 2012) in coastal waters of the Yellow Sea, northern China. Samples were collected monthly at a depth of 1 m from four sampling stations. A total of 144 ciliate species representing 78 genera, 43 families, 17 orders and eight classes were recorded. Among these species, 31 distributed in all four seasons, while 11, 11, 13 and two forms occurred only in spring, summer, autumn and winter season, respectively. The species number and total abundance peaked in spring and autumn, with minimum values in winter. Ciliate community structures differed significantly between seasons, and were significantly correlated with the changes in environmental variables, especially temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO) and the nutrients. Of 36 dominant species (top 15 ranked contributors in each season), nine (e.g. Pseudovorticella paracratera, Trochilia minuta and Zoothamnium sp.) were significantly correlated with pH, DO or nutrients. Species richness, evenness and diversity measures were significantly correlated with temperature, pH, DO or soluble reactive phosphates. Results demonstrated that periphytic ciliates exhibited a clear seasonal variation in community structures in response to environmental conditions and potentially might be used as a robust bioindicator for assessing environmental quality status in coastal waters.

AB  - Objective. Lumbar spinal stenosis is one of the most commonly diagnosed spinal disorders in older adults. Although the pathophysiology of the clinical syndrome is not well understood, a narrow central canal or intervertebral foramen is an essential or defining feature. The aim of the present study was to estimate the magnitude of genetic versus environmental influences on central lumbar spinal stenosis and to investigate disc degeneration and stature or bone development as possible genetic pathways. Methods. A classic twin study with multivariate analyses considering lumbar level and other covariates was conducted. The study sample comprised 598 male twins (147 monozygotic and 152 dizygotic pairs), 35-70 years of age, from the population-based Finnish Twin Cohort. The primary phenotypes were central lumbar stenosis as assessed qualitatively on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and quantitatively measured dural sac cross-sectional area. Additional phenotypes (to examine possible genetic pathways) included disc bulging and standing height, as an indicator of overall skeletal size or development. Results. The heritability estimate (h2) for qualitatively assessed central lumbar spinal stenosis on MRI was 66.9% (95% confidence interval [ 95% CI] 56.8, 74.5). The broad-sense heritability estimate for dural sac cross-sectional area was 81.2% (95% CI 74.5, 86.1), with a similar magnitude of genetic influences across lumbar levels (h2 72.4-75.6). The additive genetic correlation of quantitatively assessed stenosis and disc bulging was extremely high. There was no indication of shared genetic influences between stenosis and stature. Conclusion. Central lumbar spinal stenosis and associated dural sac dimensions are highly genetic, and disc degeneration (bulging) appears to be one pathway through which genes influence spinal stenosis.

AB  - Long-term projections for key drivers needed in urban water infrastructure planning such as climate change, population growth, and socio-economic changes are deeply uncertain. Traditional planning approaches heavily rely on these projections, which, if a projection stays unfulfilled, can lead to problematic infrastructure decisions causing high operational costs and/or lock-in effects. New approaches based on exploratory modelling take a fundamentally different view. Aim of these is, to identify an adaptation strategy that performs well under many future scenarios, instead of optimising a strategy for a handful. However, a modelling tool to support strategic planning to test the implication of adaptation strategies under deeply uncertain conditions for urban water management does not exist yet. This paper presents a first step towards a new generation of such strategic planning tools, by combing innovative modelling tools, which coevolve the urban environment and urban water infrastructure under many different future scenarios, with robust decision making. The developed approach is applied to the city of Innsbruck, Austria, which is spatially explicitly evolved 20 years into the future under 1000 scenarios to test the robustness of different adaptation strategies. Key findings of this paper show that: (1) Such an approach can be used to successfully identify parameter ranges of key drivers in which a desired performance criterion is not fulfilled, which is an important indicator for the robustness of an adaptation strategy; and (2) Analysis of the rich dataset gives new insights into the adaptive responses of agents to key drivers in the urban system by modifying a strategy.

AB  - Stable isotopic compositions of carbon (delta C-13) and oxygen (delta O-18) in plants reflect growth conditions. Therefore, these isotopes might be good indicators of changes in environmental factors, such as variations in air temperature caused by climate change. It is predicted that climate change will lead to a greater increase in minimum air temperatures (primarily during the night) than in maximum air temperatures (primarily during the day) in many parts of Japan. In the present study, we investigated whether the delta C-13 and delta O-18 of the rice grain Koshihikari (Oryza sativa L.) from the northern latitudes (30.49A degrees-37.14A degrees) of Japan reflect variations in air temperature during grain filling and are related to the yield and proportion of first-grade rice (< 15 % transparency, roundness, and cracking) as an indicator of quality. We revealed that rice delta C-13 was not correlated with mean maximum or minimum air temperatures for each prefecture. By contrast, rice delta O-18 was positively correlated with mean minimum air temperature, suggesting that rice delta O-18 reflects changes in night air temperature. We further showed that an increase in the mean minimum air temperature during grain filling had a negative effect on rice yield and quality. Our findings indicate that the delta O-18 of rice grain may be a good indicator of physiological changes in response to minimum air temperatures during grain filling.

The purpose of this paper is to seek to compare and contrast these two economies in terms of key indicators related to impacts, performance measures and determinants of entrepreneurship.
   Design/methodology/approach - The approach of this study can be described as theory building from multiple case studies. The analysis is based on secondary data from a number of sources related to impacts, performance measures and determinants of entrepreneurship.
   Findings - Among the major findings is that in order to shift to a higher gear, South Korea's entrepreneurial weakness must be addressed through broad institutional reforms that include the corporate governance, and policies and attitudes toward immigrants and immigration. In Estonia's case, while continuing attention must be paid to institutional reforms, immediate action is needed to improve policies that affect basic economic, technological and infrastructural conditions.
   Research limitations/implications - A crucial lesson from a comparison of these two economies is that multiple paths of entrepreneurial success exist. Practical implications - The lessons each can learn from the other to improve the entrepreneurial ecosystem are suggested. Other emerging, developing and less developed economies also have much to learn from the success paths of these two economies.
   Originality/value - This paper provides unique insights into alternative ways that emerging economies can follow to develop successful entrepreneurial ecosystems and achieve entrepreneurial success as well as advantages and limitations of the alternatives.

AB  - A modern training set covering 55 surface sediment samples from Pumoyum Co, a freshwater lake on the southern Tibetan Plateau, was analysed in order to quantify relationships between ostracod species distribution and environmental conditions. The extensive data set referring to nine ostracod species includes physico-chemical parameters for water depths ranging between 1 m and 62 m. Canonical correspondence analysis suggests that water depth significantly controls the spatial distribution of modern ostracods in the lake. On this basis, an ostracod-based water depth transfer function was established for reconstructing palaeo-lake levels. The transfer function presents a good correlation between measured and estimated water depth (R-2 = 0.87), with a root mean square error of prediction of 15.5 m. This transfer function was applied to fossil ostracod associations of 38 sediment samples from a gravity core which covers the last 6 ka BP. Three stages of lake level fluctuations since 6 ka BP were inferred: a low lake level (similar to-25 m compared to the present 65 m depth) between 6.0 ka BP and 4.3 ka BP, a fluctuating lake level (-25 to 5 m) from 4.3 to 2.0 ka BP, and a rise from a low level (-25 m) to that of present day within the last two millennia. Together with other proxies including ostracod diversity and grain size as well as total organic carbon and total inorganic carbon content of the gravity core sediments, the water depth transfer function was used to reconstruct past climate change in the Pumoyum Co area as a response to Indian Monsoon dynamics.

AB  - Across the planet, high-intensity farming has transformed native vegetation into monocultures, decreasing biodiversity on a landscape scale. Yet landscape-scale changes to biodiversity and community structure often emerge from processes operating at local scales. One common process that can explain changes in biodiversity and community structure is the creation of abrupt habitat edges, which, in turn, generate edge effects. Such effects, while incredibly common, can be highly variable across space and time; however, we currently lack a general analytical framework that can adequately capture such spatio-temporal variability. We extend previous approaches for estimating edge effects to a non-linear mixed modeling framework that captures such spatio-temporal heterogeneity and apply it to understand how agricultural land-uses alter wildlife communities. We trapped small mammals along a conservation-agriculture land-use interface extending 375 m into sugarcane plantations and conservation land-uses at three sites during dry and wet seasons in Swaziland, Africa. Sugarcane plantations had significant reductions in species richness and heterogeneity, and showed an increase in community similarity, suggesting a more homogenized small mammal community. Furthermore, our modeling framework identified strong variation in edge effects on communities across sites and seasons. Using small mammals as an indicator, intensive agricultural practices appear to create high-density communities of generalist species while isolating interior species in less than 225 m. These results illustrate how agricultural land-use can reduce diversity across the landscape and that effects can be masked or magnified, depending on local conditions. Taken together, our results emphasize the need to create or retain natural habitat features in agricultural mosaics.

AB  - As the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) increases substantially, the spatial distribution of atmospheric CO2 should be considered when estimating the effects of CO2 on the carbon and water cycle coupling of terrestrial ecosystems. To evaluate this effect on future ecohydrological processes, the spatial-temporal patterns of CO2 were established over 1951 - 2099 according to the IPCC emission scenarios SRES A2 and SRES B1. Thereafter, water use efficiency (WUE) was used (i.e., Net Primary Production/Evaportranspiration) as an indicator to quantify the effects of climate change and uneven CO2 fertilization in China. We carried out several simulated experiments to estimate WUE under different future scenarios using a land process model (Integrated Biosphere Simulator, IBIS). Results indicated that the geographical distributions of averaged WUE have considerable differences under a heterogeneous atmospheric CO2 condition. Under the SRES A2 scenario, WUE decreased slightly with a 5% value in most areas of the southeastern and northwestern China during the 2050s, while decreasing by approximately 15% in southeastern China during the 2090s. During the period of the 2050s under SRES B1 scenario, the change rate of WUE was similar with that under SRES A2 scenario, but the WUE has a more moderate decreasing trend than that under the SRES A2 scenario. In all, the ecosystems in median and low latitude areas had a weakened effect on resisting extreme climate event such as drought. Conversely, the vegetation in a boreal forest had an enhanced buffering capability to tolerate drought events.

AB  - Lipocalin-2 is expressed under pernicious conditions such as intoxication, infection, inflammation and other forms of cellular stress. Experimental liver injury induces rapid and sustained LCN2 production by injured hepatocytes. However, the precise biological function of LCN2 in liver is still unknown. In this study, LCN2-1 mice were exposed to short term application of CCl4, lipopolysaccharide and Concanavalin A, or subjected to bile duct ligation. Subsequent injuries were assessed by liver function analysis, qRT-PCR for chemokine and cytokine expression, liver tissue Western blot, histology and TUNEL assay. Serum LCN2 levels from patients suffering from liver disease were assessed and evaluated. Acute CCl4 intoxication showed increased liver damage in LCN2 / mice indicated by higher levels of aminotransferases, and increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-ty. and MCP-1/CCl2, resulting in sustained activation of STAT1, STAT3 and JNIK pathways. Hepatocytes of LCN2 / mice showed lipid droplet accumulation and increased apoptosis. Hepatocyte apoptosis was confirmed in the Concanavalin A and lipopolysaccharide models. In chronic models (4 weeks bile duct ligation or 8 weeks CCl4 application), LCN2-1 mice showed slightly increased fibrosis compared to controls. Interestingly, serum LCN2 levels in diseased human livers were significantly higher compared to controls, but no differences were observed between cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients. Upregulation of LCN2(-/-) is a reliable indicator of liver damage and has significant hepato-protective effect in acute liver injury. LCN2(-/-) levels provide no correlation to the degree of liver fibrosis but show significant positive correlation to inflammation instead. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The interest in animal personality, broadly defined as consistency of individual behavioural traits over time and across contexts, has increased dramatically over the last years. Individual differences in behaviour are no longer recognised as noise around a mean but rather as adaptive variation and thus, essentially, raw material for evolution. Animal personality has been considered evolutionary conserved and has been shown to be present in all vertebrates including fish. Despite the importance of evolutionary and comparative aspects in this field, few studies have actually documented consistency across situations in fish. In addition, most studies are done with individually housed fish which may pose additional challenges when interpreting data from social species. Here, we investigate, for the first time in fish, whether individual differences in behavioural responses to a variety of challenges are consistent over time and across contexts using both individual and grouped-based tests. Twenty-four juveniles of Gilthead seabream Sparus aurata were subjected to three individual-based tests: feed intake recovery in a novel environment, novel object and restraining and to two group-based tests: risk-taking and hypoxia. Each test was repeated twice to assess consistency of behavioural responses over time. Risk taking and escape behaviours during restraining were shown to be significantly consistent over time. In addition, consistency across contexts was also observed: individuals that took longer to recover feed intake after transfer into a novel environment exhibited higher escape attempts during a restraining test and escaped faster from hypoxia conditions. These results highlight the possibility to predict behaviour in groups from individual personality traits.

AB  - In this two-part paper (Background and Initial Assumptions (part 1) and Results of Survey Research (part 2)), we present surveys whose main objective is to determine whether, and to what extent, the life cycle assessment (LCA) technique is used for the identification and assessment of environmental aspects in environmental management systems (EMS) and whether there are any differences in this respect between the companies and countries analysed.
   The survey research was carried out using the computer assisted self-administered interviewing method among selected Polish, German and Swedish organisations which implement EMS in accordance with the requirements of ISO 14001 and/or the EMAS regulation.
   The organisations investigated, regardless of their country, are dominated by qualitative and semi-quantitative techniques of assessment and identification of environmental aspects. LCA was used sporadically, although some differences can be observed between the countries analysed.
   The environmental managers accustomed to traditional qualitative and semi-quantitative solutions have not been given preparation to enable them to understand and adopt different approaches such as LCA. On the other hand, representatives of the organisations investigated declared that they were ready to accept an even longer timescale for the identification and assessment processes relating to environmental aspects, which represents a potential opportunity for LCA. The more precise understanding and definition of environmental problems that are precisely defined in LCA would represent a novelty for environmental managers. In practice, environmental problems are defined in a general sense and rather ambiguously, as this level of detail is sufficient in the context of qualitative and semi-quantitative techniques commonly used for the identification and assessment of environmental aspects.

AB  - Water application is a low-cost strategy to control emissions of soil fumigant to meet the requirements of the stringent environmental regulations and it is applicable for a wide range of commodity groups. Although it is known that an increase in soil moisture reduces emissions, the range of soil moisture for minimizing emissions without risking pest control, is not well defined for various types of soils. With two column studies, we determined the effect of different soil moisture levels on emission and distribution of 1,3-dichloropropene and chloropicrin in three different textured soils. Results on sandy loam and loam soils showed that by increasing soil moisture from 30% to 100% of field capacity (FC), peak fluxes were lowered by 77-88% and their occurrences were delayed 5-15 h, and cumulative emissions were reduced 24-49%. For the sandy soil, neither peak fluxes nor the cumulative emissions were significantly different when soil moisture increased from 30% to 100% FC. Compared to the drier soils, the wetter soils retained consistently higher fumigant concentrations in the gas-phase, suggesting efficacy may not be impacted in these soils. The air-filled porosity positively and linearly correlated with the cumulative emission loss across all soil types indicating that it may serve as a good indicator for estimating emissions. These laboratory findings can be further tested under field conditions to conclude what irrigation regime should be used for increasing soil water content before fumigant application that can achieve maximum emission reduction and uniform fumigant distribution with high exposure index values.

AB  - . 1. Altitudinal gradients offer a unique scenario to elucidate how the increase in harsh climatic conditions towards the top of the mountain interacts with other environmental factors at regional and local scale to influence the spatial variation in local species composition and biodiversity maintenance. We analysed the altitudinal variation in the taxonomic composition of epigaeic beetle assemblages across five mountains in north-western Patagonia (Argentina) to address whether substantial change in species composition was associated (i) at regional spatial scale, with changes in vegetation types, and the presence of dry and moist mountains, and (ii) at local spatial scale, with variation in temperature, plant cover and richness and several soil characteristics. 2. We collected beetles using 486 pitfall traps arranged in fifty-four 100-m2 grid plots of nine traps settled at about 100 m of altitude apart from each other, from the base to the summit of each mountain. We used multivariate analyses to identify beetle assemblages and to evaluate their association with environment. 3. We identified different beetle assemblages, associated more with vegetation types rather than with mountains; indicator species showed higher degree of fidelity and specificity to vegetation types rather than to mountains. Local variation in temperature, plant cover and richness, and soil characteristics influence the variation in species composition. 4. Our study suggests the existence of a regional beetle fauna that is shared across these mountains. Major regional changes in vegetation types and local variation in environment drive the variation in the species composition of beetle assemblages at these latitudes.

AB  - The presence of phytoplankton, like other particulate organic matter, can interfere with the effects of hydrophobic contaminants such as pyrethroid pesticides. However, the reduction or elimination of toxicity by algae added as food during testing is not taken into account in standard US EPA whole effluent toxicity (WET) zooplankton tests. On the other hand, WET test conditions may overestimate toxicity of such compounds in highly productive surface waters with high concentrations of detritus and other particulate matter. In addition, WET tests do not measure impaired swimming ability or predator avoidance behavior as an indicator of increased mortality risk. This study used a modified version of the US EPA WET Ceriodaphnia dubia acute test to investigate the effects of phytoplankton on toxicity of the pyrethroid insecticide, esfenvalerate. Animals were exposed simultaneously to different concentrations of esfenvalerate and green algae (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata). Mortality and predation risk were recorded after 4 and 24 h. Algae at or below concentrations specified in the WET protocol significantly reduced mortality. Regardless, organisms exposed to esfenvalerate were unable to avoid simulated predation in the presence of algae at any concentration. After 12 h, esfenvalerate adsorbed to algae represented 68-99 % of the total amount recovered. The proportion of algae-bound insecticide increased with algal concentration indicating that conclusions drawn from toxicity tests in which algae are added as food must be interpreted with caution as the dissolved fraction of such hydrophobic contaminants is reduced. Additionally, our results strongly suggest that the EPA should consider adding ecologically-relevant endpoints such as swimming behavior to standard WET protocols.

AB  - A flexible statistical framework is developed for the analysis of read counts from RNA-Seq gene expression studies. It provides the ability to analyse complex experiments involving multiple treatment conditions and blocking variables while still taking full account of biological variation. Biological variation between RNA samples is estimated separately from the technical variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific variability, even when there are relatively few biological replicates from which to estimate such variability. The pipeline is implemented in the edgeR package of the Bioconductor project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates the ability of generalized linear model methods (GLMs) to detect differential expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific expression changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow for gene-specific variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion across genes or a fixed relationship between abundance and variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on changes that are consistent between biological replicates. Parallel computational approaches are developed to make non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the application of GLMs to genomic data more convenient and practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of biological variability in complex situations. When variation is gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an advantageous compromise between the extremes of assuming common dispersion or separate genewise dispersion. The methods developed here can also be applied to count data arising from DNA-Seq applications, including ChIP-Seq for epigenetic marks and DNA methylation analyses.

AB  - Understanding the foraging behaviour of seabirds and its plasticity is vital to establish their role in marine food webs and their use as indicators of change in the availability of prey. The foraging behaviour of penguins is known to differ with locality, sex, stage of breeding and between years. We studied the diving behaviour of breeding Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus), using time-depth recorders, during incubation and brooding in the 2003-04 and 2004-05 breeding seasons at Isla Martillo, Tierra del Fuego, Argentina. Foraging trips during the incubation period were longer than those during the brooding period for both sexes in both years of the study. Sex-related differences in foraging behaviour were observed during the incubation stage. During the incubation stage females performed longer foraging trips than males, foraging effort was lower, and did not dive as deep as males in both years. Foraging success was lower for females than males during incubation only in 2003. Our results suggest that sexual differences, expressed as differences in the foraging parameters of males and females, only develop when Fuegian Sprat (Sprattus fuegensis), the main prey in this locality, is not abundant close to the colony. Females may be extending the volume of water they can exploit by extending the duration of trips (horizontal distance), whereas males do so by diving deeper (vertical distance). Our results show the fundamental differences in foraging strategies between the sexes in Magellanic Penguin are a consequence of environmental conditions not morphological differences between sexes.

AB  - Regional climate responses to large-scale forcings, such as precessional changes in solar irradiation and increases in anthropogenic greenhouse gases, may be nonlinear as a result of complex interactions among earth system components. Such nonlinear behaviors constitute a major source of climate "surprises" with important socioeconomic and ecological implications. Paleorecords are key for elucidating patterns and mechanisms of nonlinear responses to radiative forcing, but their utility has been greatly limited by the paucity of quantitative temperature reconstructions. Here we present Holocene July temperature reconstructions on the basis of midge analysis of sediment cores from three Alaskan lakes. Results show that summer temperatures during 10,0005,500 calibrated years (cal) B.P. were generally lower than modern and that peak summer temperatures around 5,000 were followed by a decreasing trend toward the present. These patterns stand in stark contrast with the trend of precessional insolation, which decreased by similar to 10% from 10,000 y ago to the present. Cool summers before 5,500 cal B.P. coincided with extensive summer ice cover in the western Arctic Ocean, persistence of a positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation, predominantly La Nina-like conditions, and variation in the position of the Alaskan treeline. These results illustrate nonlinear responses of summer temperatures to Holocene insolation radiative forcing in the Alaskan sub-Arctic, possibly because of state changes in the Arctic Oscillation and El Nino-Southern Oscillation and associated land-atmosphere-ocean feedbacks.

AB  - Vessel features of broadleaf trees may contain information about both spatial and temporal variations of environmental conditions. We report quantitative data about annual vessel characteristics for Oriental beech (Fagus heinous Lipsky) in the Caspian forest in the Alborz Mountains, northern Iran. Time series of tree-ring width and of various vessel variables were constructed over a 50-year period for three sites along an altitudinal gradient from 1260 to 2200 m a.s.l. We evaluated the dependencies between ring width and vessel variables and estimated the influence of altitude and climate on these variables.
   Mean ring width and average vessel-lumen area decreased towards the high-elevation site whereas total vessel-lumen area was independent from altitude, and vessel density increased. Above-average warm summer and autumn seasons in the year prior to growth were negatively correlated with ring width and average vessel-lumen area whereas precipitation in the current June showed a positive association; vessel density responded exactly opposite to these climatic variables. Total vessel-lumen area was the only variable that reacted differently from site to site, mainly positively to temperature at 1200 m a.s.l. and negatively at 2000 and 2200 m a.s.l., whereas a consistent response to precipitation was lacking. The results indicate that vessel variables are meaningful indicators of changes in dynamics of wood formation in relation to climate along an altitudinal gradient in the Caspian mountains. As for climate reconstruction, we have to conclude that for our study area, vessel variables do not add much to information derived from ring width.

AB  - Histomorphological features of piscine thyroids are widely accepted and frequently used as bioindicators of environmental pollution. This despite the fact that there is marked variation in thyroid morphology resulting from numerous pathological and physiological conditions. Our hypothesis was that there will be variations in histological features in thyroids collected from different shark species during the summer season in the northwestern Atlantic. To test our hypothesis, we examined histological features encountered in grossly normal thyroids from three species of sharks, the shortfin mako, Isurus oxyrhinchus, thresher, Alopias vulpinus and blue sharks, Prionace glauca. In addition, microscopic lesions from these thyroids were described. Ninety-four sharks were collected in summer 2001, 2002 and 2004. Routine, haematoxylin and eosin-stained paraffin-embedded sections were studied by light microscopy. We found inter-species but not intra-species variation in histological patterns of thyroids, which were distinct enough to allow 'blind' assignment of a thyroid to the specific species. The most common lesions encountered were lymphofollicular hyperplasia and chronic thyroiditis. In addition, one case each of intravascular larval nematodes and a myxosporean infection was found. Our results provide the first data on species-specific morphology of thyroids collected during summer months from sharks. The results indicate that familiarity with normal thyroid morphology is crucial before using shark thyroids in biomonitoring of environmental contamination or interpreting data from this gland in shark-health studies.

AB  - Not all environmental problems get the same level of policy attention. An interesting question is thus why certain aspects receive attention and others do not. This paper studies the level of policy attention given to different environmental aspects in agriculture and energy policy in Sweden and explores empirically some factors that can explain the level of attention. The first step was to explore the link between environmental issue characteristics and the level of policy attention. The level of policy attention was measured through a content analysis of Swedish government bills. The results from the content analysis are clear and stable over the studied time period. In the agriculture sector biodiversity and toxicity are in focus whereas in the energy sector climate change and resources are given the attention. Besides these aspects, the attention is limited. These results were compared with the results from sector-wide environmental assessments of the same sectors. These assessments were based on hybrid input-output analysis and life cycle assessment methodologies. A main finding from the study is that issue importance is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for policy attention. Other explanations are needed to understand which environmental issues get attention in sectoral policy. Our assessment showed that while the level of knowledge does not provide an explanation, the presence of strong and well-organised stakeholders within the sector, with an interest in having a certain issue on the agenda, might be decisive for issue attention. Path dependency and limited attention capacity are other important factors. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Dendrochemistry has been used for the historical dating of pollution. Its reliability is questionable due primarily to the radial mobility of elements in sapwood. In the present study, the extractability of seven elements was characterized to assess their suitability for the monitoring of environmental conditions. Nine mature sugar maple trees (Acer saccharum Marsh.), a wide-ranging species in eastern North America that has suffered decline in past decades, were sampled in three Quebec watersheds along a soil acidity gradient. Five-year groups of annual tree rings were treated by sequential chemical extractions using extractants of varying strength (deionized H2O, 0.05 M HCI, and concentrated HNO3 to selectively solubilize the elements into three fractions (water-soluble, acid-soluble, and residual). Monovalent K; divalent Ba, Ca, Cd, Mg, Mn; and trivalent Al cations were found mostly in the water-soluble, acid-soluble, and residual fractions, respectively. Forms more likely to be mobile within the tree (water-soluble and acid-soluble) do not seem to be suitable for temporal monitoring because of potential lateral redistribution in sapwood rings. However, certain elements (Cd, Mn) were responsive to current soil acidity and could be used in spatial variation monitoring. Extractability of Al varied according to soil acidity; at less acidic sites, up to 90% of M was contained in the residual form, whereas on very acidic soils, as much as 45% was found in the water-soluble and acid-soluble fractions. Sequential extractions can be useful for determining specific forms of metals as key indicators of soil acidification.

AB  - The contact of inland and coastal prehistoric groups in Brazil is believed to have been restricted to regions with no geographical barrier, as is the case in the Ribeira de Iguape valley. The inland osteological collection from the riverine shellmound Moraes (5800-4500 BP) represents a unique opportunity to test this assumption for this region. Despite cultural similarities between riverine and coastal shellmounds, important ecological and site distribution differences are expected to impact on lifestyle. The purpose of this study is thus to document and interpret health and lifestyle indicators in Moraes in comparison to coastal shellmound groups. Specifically we test if the rare evidence of fish and mollusc remains in the riverine shellmound led to (a) higher caries rates and (b) lower auditory exostosis frequency and (c) if the small size of the riverine shellmound translates into reduced demographic density and thus rarity of communicable infectious diseases. Of the three hypotheses, (a) was confirmed, (b) was rejected and (c) was partly rejected. Bioanthropological similarities between Moraes and coastal shellmounds include auditory exostoses with equally high frequencies; significantly more frequent osteoarthritis in upper than in lower limbs; cranial and dental morphological affinities and low frequencies of violent trauma. However, there are also important differences: Moraes subsisted on a much broader protein diet and consumed more cariogenic food, but showed a stature even shorter than coastal groups. Thus, despite the contact also suggested by treponematoses in both site types, there was enough time for the people at the riverine site to adapt to local conditions. (c) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - There are several decisions in investment management process. Security selection is the most time-consurning stage. Tatical allocation is in order to take advantage of market opportunities based on short-term prediction (Amenc and Le Sourd in Portfolio theory and performance analysis. Wiley, 2003). Although it is difficult to keep track of the fluctuations of volatile financial markets, the capacity of artificial intelligence to perform spatial search and obtain feasible solutions has led to its recent widespread adoption in the resolution of financial problems. Classifier systems possess a dynamic learning mechanism, they can be used to constantly explore environmental conditions, and immediately provide appropriate decisions via self-aware learning. This study consequently employs a classifier system in conjunction with real number encoding to investigate how to obtain optimal stock portfolio based on investor adjustment cycle. We examine the constituents of the TSEC Taiwan 50 Index taking moving average (MA), stochastic indicators (KD), moving averaae convergence divergence (MACD), relative strength index (RSI) and Williams %R (WMS %R) as input factors, adopting investor-determined adjustment cycle to allocate capital, and then constructing stock portfolio. We have conducted empirical testing using weekly and monthly adjustment cycle; the results revealed that this study's decision-making assistance model yields average annual interest rate of 49.35%, which is significantly better than the -6.59% of a random purchase model. This research indicates that a classifier system can effectively monitor market fluctuations and help investors obtain relatively optimal returns. The assistance model proposed in this study thus can provide really helpful decision-making information to investors.

AB  - A comparative limnological study was carried out to present a snapshot of crustacean zooplankton communities and their relations to environmental factors to test whether there is a consistent relationship between crustacean biomass and trophic indicators among lake groups with similar trophic conditions. The study lakes showed a wide range of trophic status, with total phosphorus (TP) ranging from 0.008 to 1.448mgL(-1), and chlorophyll a from 0.7 to 146.1 mu g L-1, respectively. About 38 species of Crustacea were found, of which Cladocera were represented by 25 taxa (20 genera), and Copepoda by 13 taxa (I I genera). The most common and dominant species were Bosmina coregoni, Moina micrura, Diaphanosoma brachyurum, Cyclops vicinus, Thermocyclops taihokuensis, Mesocyclops notius and Sinocalanus dorrii. Daphnia was rare in abundance. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that except for four species (D. hyalina, S. dorrii, C. vicinus and M. micrura), almost all the dominant species had the same preference for environmental factors. Temperature, predatory cyclopoids and planktivorous fishes seem to be the key factors determining species distribution. TP was a relatively better trophic indicator than chlorophyll a to predict crustacean biomass. Within the three groups of lakes, however, there was no consistent relationship between crustacean biomass and trophic indicators. The possible reason might be that top-down and bottom-up control on crustaceans vary with lake trophic state. The lack of significant negative correlation between crustacean biomass and chlorophyll a suggests that there was little control of phytoplankton biomass by macrozooplankton in these shallow subtropical lakes.

AB  - Palynological and sedimentological studies were performed at two Holocene profiles in erosion gullies (Ze'elim and Ein Feshkha) which dissect the retreating western shore of the Dead Sea. The aim of the project was to analyse possible links between climate, lithology, and vegetation development. The section in Ze'elim shows both lacustrine and fluvial sediments, whereas sedimentation at Ein Feshkha is predominantly lacustrine. The Ze'elim profile, previously used for paleo-lake reconstruction provides an opportunity to compare climate triggered lake levels as paleo-hydrological indicators and vegetation history by use of palynology. The vegetation development in Ze'elim and Fin Feshkha is influenced by both climate and human impact. The pollen record of Ze'elim begins in the Pottery Neolithic, the section of Ein Feshkha in the Late Bronze Age. both records end in the Middle Ages. The Ze'elim section is characterized by sedimentary hiati between the beginning of the Chalcolithic Period until the Middle Bronze Age and within the Late Bronze Age. Settlement periods during the Middle Bronze Age, Iron Age and Hellenistic-Roman-Byzantine Period are indicated by high values of anthropogenic indicators and/or Mediterranean trees. Collapses of agriculture, which can be related to climate effects, are evident during the Late Bronze Age, during the Iron Age and at the end of the Byzantine Period when the lake level curve indicates and conditions. A comparison of the two pollen records, from different environments, illustrates a more prominent influence of Mediterranean vegetation and cultivated plants in the pollen diagram of Ein Feshkha. The southern Dead Sea region (at the desert fringe) is more vulnerable to regional climate change. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The extreme alpine environment around the mid-Yalong Zangbo River on the Tibetan plateau supports a unique avifauna. To understand the structure and habitat selection of this poorly known bird assemblage, we quantified abundance of the birds in four representative types of vegetation and a human settlement inside a shrub-covered alpine valley ( 29 degrees 27' N, 91 degrees 40' E, 4000-5200 m a.s.l.) in the Lhasa mountains, Tibet, from September 2004 to January 2005. A total of 40 species of birds was recorded, six of which were summer breeders, one vagrant autumn migrant, 29 permanent residents, and four local wintering migrants. Latitudinally migrating taxa were absent. Of the 33 wintering species, 70% were alpine specialists. Patterns of distribution of species and individuals differed across habitats. The highest bird species richness was found in Rose-Barberry shrub where vegetation was most complex, and fruiting and seeding plants abundant. From autumn to winter, birds tended to aggregate in the human settlement for foods supplemented by local Buddhists; as a consequence this habitat contained the highest individual density. In terms of trophic guilds, plant-eating birds were predominant in composition (65.8-75.8%) and numerically abundant (89.8-96.7%) in all the habitats. We concluded that vegetation diversity and food supply significantly influence species composition and individual abundance of the alpine bird community. For long-term survival of the unique bird assemblage, we argue for protection of the shrub vegetation as it is difficult to regenerate in the harsh high-altitude conditions.

AB  - Greentree reservoir management was initiated during a period when riparian forests of the Mississippi Alluvial Valley were disappearing rapidly. Greentree reservoirs (GTRs) were intended to provide a refuge for overwintering migratory waterfowl within a landscape of decreasing habitat availability. However, GTRs frequently are flooded as much as 2.5 months longer than unimpounded bottomland forests (UBF), and previous work has shown that such unnatural hydroperiods can have substantial negative effects on such ecosystem attributes as tree assemblage composition and invertebrate production. We conducted the present study to quantify (1) frequency of canopy gaps and (2) tree species composition in GTRs, as compared with UBFs. In general, GTRs were quite similar to UBF stands, in terms of canopy density, proportion of trees in the canopy versus mid-story, degree of stress exhibited by individual trees, gap frequency, and species diversity. However, multivariate comparisons of GTRs versus unimpounded areas indicated differences in species composition. Indicator Species Analyses and examination of the dominant species showed clear differences between GTRs and UBFs, with GTR tree species being, on average, better adapted to flooded conditions, based on wetland indicator Status. Greentree reservoir canopies generally were dominated by a Taxodium distichum - Acer rubrum - Quercus lyrata mix, whereas unimpounded forest canopies were characterized as Liquidambar styracifua - mixed Quercus stands. The midstories of the groups were more similar to one another. with dominance by Acer- Carpinus caroliniana - Planera aquatica in GTRs and Liquidambar - Carpinus - Acer in unimpounded stands. The GTRs included in this study had been managed for 40 to 48 years, providing a long history of flooding which served to select for highly adapted species assemblages.

AB  - Shrub cover was quantified by species for a 1.9-ha shrub carr adjacent to White Clay Lake near Shawano, WI, USA and related to soil properties and sedimentation rates. Principal components analysis of soil characteristics distinguished two distinct groups: alluvial surface soils having organic matter contents less than 30 g/100g and histic surface soils having organic matter contents averaging 56 g/100g. The alluvial surface soils were on slightly elevated natural levees along a relict stream bed that had received 1.3 cm/yr of silty sediments from agricultural runoff. Alluvial surface soils had twice the bulk density and organic P concentrations, nearly three times the reactive P, and 4.5 times the NO3-N concentrations of histic surface soils. Total shrub cover and shrub overlap was significantly greater on the alluvial surface soils, but there was no difference between the two soil groups in proportion of open space, suggesting that the increased total shrub cover on alluvial surface soils was due to increased shrub layering rather than infilling of canopy gaps. Shrub diversity was greater on the alluvial surface soils: average shrub species richness per 30.5 m line segment was five species on alluvial surface soils as opposed to three species on histic surface soils. Four willow species were strongly associated with the alluvial surface soils and may serve as indicators of sediment deposition: Salix discolor, S. eriocephala, S. interior, and S. lucida. The most common shrub species present, Cornus sericea spp. sericea and Salix petiolaris, were poor indicators of soil conditions within the wetland.

AB  - Vocal displays are supposed to be an honest signal of the phenotypic and genetic quality of individuals and their territory. Moreover, signal interactions are nearly always associated with individuals in aggregations, and their function could in part be explained as social behaviour. Conspecific density has been shown to be a particularly strong proximate and ultimate factor acting on several individual/population features; thus, it may be expected to affect vocal behaviour too. Here, I investigate the hypothesis that, in long-lived, territorial species, density affects the vocal displays of mated males, masking their honesty as a possible signal of male/territory quality. Each month I listened to the dusk calls of 17 breeding male Eurasian Eagle Owls Bubo bubo during their prelaying period. Nine males bred in a low-density situation, the other eight in a high-density one. Conspecific density was found to affect the honesty of call features as signals of male and/or territory quality. The call display as a reliable predictor of male fitness measured as productivity persisted only in situations of high breeding owl density, where male-male competition was stronger. Accommodation of call activity allows individuals to minimize the costs of aggressive calling by adjusting the territoriality threshold to local conditions. The results of this study emphasize the importance, when investigating the evolution and maintenance of honest territorial or sexual signals, of considering the environmental and social context experienced by the individual, thereby corroborating the idea that male-male competition contributes to the maintenance of honest signalling.

AB  - Two cores (CSS 2 and CSS 10) were collected from two lakes situated in the Carajas area (6 degrees 35'S, 49 degrees 30'W) that show different stages of silting up. The results of geochemical and petrographic organic analyses, backed up by C-14 radiometric dating, lead to a reconstruction of the variations in the hydrological regime of these lakes over the last 30,000 years. Evidence is revealed for a period of drying up, characterized by a sedimentary hiatus between 22,000 and 13,000 C-14 years BP, followed by a period of refilling between 13,000 and 11,000 C-14 years BP. (15,400-12,900 cal years BP). The latter interval is primarily characterized by a mainly elastic sedimentary input rich in quartz, kaolinite and iron hydroxides, leading on to the authigenic formation of siderite. This type of sedimentation implies the erosion of the small catchment basin during periods of transition between arid and humid climatic regimes. From 8000 to 4000 C-14 years BP (8900-4500 cal years BP), as well as from 2700 to 1500 C-14 years BP (2780-1360 cal years BP), special hydrological conditions prevailed. They are characterized in the sedimentary record by the presence of micro-laminae containing wood charcoal interlayered with sponge spicule material. This interlamination reflects the rapid alternation of dry and humid periods. A comparison with the results obtained by pollen analysis shows that sedimentological indicators, once filtered for strictly local effects, can provide a full record of the regional scale variations in the environment.

AB  - The aim of the present paper is to describe the framework of a new method for assessing dairy cows' welfare at farm level. In contrast with TGIs, the method is based on observations of animals and leads to several scores according to the needs of the animals. We started with five general needs. These were the five freedoms: freedom from hunger and thirst, freedom from discomfort; freedom from pain, injury or disease: freedom to express normal behaviour; and freedom from fear and distress. These were further subdivided into 16 basic needs. A list of the 49 indices, or welfare-indicators, most commonly measured in animals (behaviours, injuries etc.) was produced and the patterns each index can have were described. Each pattern was rated on a value-scale with regard to any need. On this basis frequencies within a herd reflecting a very low, low, high or very high level of welfare were determined, allowing us to attribute a score to a given herd for any pattern. We then proposed to pool the scores obtained by a herd for all patterns of a given index into a single score for that index. To this end. we defined logical rules that limited compensation between scores. Step by step, the information can be pooled to obtain a single score for indices that are closely related, for basic needs, and finally for each of the five freedoms. Ways to validate such a method are discussed. The method can be used in a survey to detect relations between environmental conditions and animal welfare. It can also be used in connection with dairy farm labelling.

AB  - Background and purpose: For several decades the Krka National Park was faced with an increasing number of tourists. Also, along its course to the National Park, the Krka river receives sewage loaded with inorganic and organic matter from surrounding inhabited areas. To evaluate all these influences on wafer quality in the National Park aquatory, an intensive monitoring program started in 1995.
   Materials and methods: Sampling was carried out every month over a one-year period (1995/96) at three different sites along the river course and every three months at additional four sites. Physical, chemical and bacteriological parameters were measured at several points down a vertical profile. These parameters were measured onsite by standard methods.
   Result and conclusion: The results of one year research showed that the water in this region was still of high quality The content of nutrients and organic matter in water was mainly poor, and microbial density was also low. Only during the wet weather conditions the number of coliform bacteria increased in water However, alter severed days their number decreased in upper layers due to sedimentation process. This process was also observed near the Roski waterfall. On the waterfall and in the surrounding water bacteria were present in abundance near the surface, while several kilometres downstream they appeared only in a deeper layer. Furthermore, an unusually high number of heterotrophic plate-count bacteria (CFU/vol.) was observed in the water in late spring (June) and in autumn (November), especially at 10-m depth. Results of qualitative and quantitative analysis of phytoplankton indicated that a high phytoplanktonic activity occurred in the watercourse in May and late September.

AB  - Macrophyte species distribution in the marsh and slough areas of the northern Everglades mere examined along a surface mater and soil P gradient to characterize the effects of nutrient enrichment on the macrophyte community changes in the Everglades ecosystem. Macrophyte species distribution and frequency examined at 51 sites located in the Water Conservation Area (WCA-2A) revealed distinct trends in species changes with P enrichment. Marshes in the unentrends ; and enriched areas were dominated by Cladium jamaicense and Typha domingensis, respectively. Open water areas were characterized by Eleocharis sp., Utricularia sp., Chara zeylanica, and Nymphaea odorata in the unenriched areas and by floating plants and Polygonum sp. in the enriched areas. We compared the macrophyte species distribution with the soil P contour map of WCA-ZA and derived six major categories of P enrichment (labeled 0-5) that may be used to adequately describe macrophyte species distribution in the WCA-2A. Soil and surface water P values that correspond to the different P-enrichment categories and the number of macrophyte species in each category have been estimated. Examination of the relative abundance of the macrophyte species in the six P-enrichment categories showed a decline in characteristic slough macrophyte species with P enrichment. Increase in P status of the system was also accompanied by the advent and gradual establishment of macrophytes such as Mikania scandens, Sarcostemma clausum, Polyganum sp., A crostichum danaeifolium, and a variety of floating plants. Characteristic slough macrophyte species such as Utricularia purpurea, Eleocharis elongata, and Eleocharis cellulosa serve as indicators of the unenriched P conditions.

AB  - The results of an environmental mutation and teratologic epidemiological study are presented which was performed in inhabitants living in the surrounding region of an acrylonitrile factory in Nyergesujfalu. The endpoint of the study was congenital abnormalities in 46,326 infants born to mothers living in the 30 settlements of the study region within a 25 km radius of the acrylonitrile factory between 1980 and 1996. The ascertainment of cases with congenital abnormalities was based on the dataset of the Hungarian Congenital Abnormality Registry complemented with the review of pediatric, pathology and cytogenetic records. A particular attention was paid to the indicators of germinal mutations as sentinel anomalies, Down syndrome and unidentified multiple congenital abnormalities and the indicators of teratogens as the specific pattern of multiple congenital abnormalities. Three congenital abnormalities: pectus excavatum in Tate, 1990-1992 (OR with 95%CI: 78.5, 8.4-729.6), undescended testis in Nyergesujfalu between 1980 and 1983 (8.6, 1.4-54.3) and in Esztergom, 1981-1982 (4.2, 1.3-13.5) and clubfoot in Tata, 1980-1981 (5.5, 1.5-20.3) showed significant time-space clusters in the study region. There was a decrease in risk of undescended testis with increasing distance from the acrylonitrile factory. An unusual increase was found in the combination of oral cleft and cardiac septal defects in multimalformed babies in Tatabanya, 1990. The detailed analysis of congenital abnormalities in all settlements of a given territory may help to detect clusters of congenital abnormalities and their possible relation to the environmental hazards.

AB  - Differential genotypic tolerance of two species of fish native to the Great Plains of North America (the western mosquitofish [Gambursia affinis] and the sand shiner [Notropis ludibundus]) was examined in 96-h acute exposures to the pesticides lindane and parathion. Although a significant amount of data is available indicating that heavy metals cause selective genotypic mortality in aquatic organisms, very few studies have focused on the effects of pesticides on population genetic structure. Fish used in this experiment were captured from field populations in Kansas, USA, and acclimated to laboratory conditions for I month before the acute toxicity tests. Two hundred individuals of each species were exposed, in two separate experiments, to estimated LC70 concentrations of each pesticide for 96 h. Dead individuals were removed at 3-h intervals allowing for comparison of genotypic times-to-death. Individuals of each species were electrophoretically examined at two polymorphic loci. Phenotypes of mosquitofish were determined for phosphoglucose mutase (PGM) and malic enzyme (ME). Phenotypes of sand shiners were determined for PGM and aspartate aminotransferase (AAT). Three of eight statistical tests (two species x two loci x two pesticides) indicated significant differences among survival curves of genotypic classes. Genotypes of,ME and PGM of mosquitofish exhibited significantly different survivorship functions in the parathion and lindane time-to-death tests, respectively. Genotypes of AAT of sand shiners exhibited significantly different survivorship curves when exposed to lindane. Given certain experimental limitations, these results support a continued examination of population genetic characteristics as biomarkers of environmental contamination.

AB  - Concentrated organic residues extracted from 5 blended aliquots of commercial beers were evaluated for their ability to induce sister chromatid exchange (SCE), chromosomal aberrations and forward mutation in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Each extract was prepared by blending 4 commercial beers of similar ingredients and brewing method, passing the beer pool over XAD-2 resin, extracting the resin and concentrating the extract. Studies were performed both with and without metabolic activation using variable amounts of reconstituted residues from 225-fold concentrates of the blended samples. CHO cultures were treated with 0.75 /mul/ml through 10.0 mul/ml of the concentrates in the SCE assays, 1.0 mul/ml through 10.0 mul/ml of the extracts in the aberration assays and 2.5 mul/ml up to 20 mul/ml for forward mutation assays. In preliminary screening for SCE as an indicator of potential DNA damage, a significant increase was observed for 3 of 5 concentrated samples; however, no increase in SCE was induced by any of the 5 samples when S9 was added as a source of exogenous metabolic activation. More definitive tests for induction of genetic events, i.e., chromosome aberrations and forward HGPRT mutations, were negative for all 5 extracts whether or not S9 mix was present. Since SCE were not induced in tests with metabolic activation and since there was no concordant aberration or point mutation induction, the preliminary indication of potential DNA damage shown by elevated SCE under conditions without metabolic activation appears to have little biological significance.

AB  - Hyperscanning-the simultaneous recording of hemodynamic or neuroelectric activity of the brain-is the new technology to directly observe the brain communication between individuals. Since the publication of the first hyperscanning study in 2002, it has developed rapidly in the past decade. Brain-to-brain coupling (BBC) technology of human interaction was widely used in the research of action coordination, cooperative game, classroom teaching and other interactive tasks, which involved the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), Electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and other neuroimaging technologies. In addition, hyperscanning research experienced a leap from pseudo-interaction to real interaction, a leap from a strictly controlled laboratory paradigm to the "field research" paradigm in nature situations. Based on the differentiation and analysis of the core concepts such as coupling and synchronization, taking the development of time and technology as the main line, this paper reviewed the common BBC indicators and their application conditions, introduced the related theories and forecasted the future research direction of BBC.
   In hyperscanning study, BBC refers to the interaction and influence of two or more brains, or between two or more brain regions within a single brain, while the inter-brain synchronization (IBS) refers to the consistency (relative stability) in frequency, phase, and other characteristics of signals from different brain or different regions of the brain. Thus, the similarities and differences between hyperscanning, BBC and IBS can be summarized as follows: Hyperscanning is the technique of recording the neural activity of two or more brains simultaneously. BBC refers to the interaction or interaction between two or more brains. BBC sometimes manifests as IBS, the degree of IBS can represent the strength of BBC in this case, but BBC is not the same as IBS: (1) In addition to IBS, BBC can also be manifested as functional connections and interactions between the brains; (2) due to the possibility of pseudo-synchronization, the occurrence of IBS does not mean that there must be BBC.
   In the field of physics and electronic engineering, the characteristics of a signal can be described by multiple indicators such as amplitude, period, frequency and phase. Accordingly, neurologic studies have found that brain activity induced by external events may take the form of phase response, frequency response, amplitude response, and production of new components. Therefore, it is not surprising that many different indicators are used to characterize the strength of BBC in existing hyperscanning studies. These indicators including the circular correlation coefficient (CCorr), wavelet transform coherence (WTC), directed coherence, phase-locking value (PLV), the coupling indexes based on the event-related potentials (ERP) such as the latency difference and the amplitude difference, the coupling indexes based on the Graph Theory such as the shortest path length, global efficiency, local efficiency, divisibility, modularity, small-word network.
   Through the review, we found the following three issues deserve the attention of the future hyperscanning research. Firstly, as different coupling indicators have different characteristics and applicable conditions, we suggest that the selection of indicators should be based on specific research methods, technical equipment and research problems. There are no best indicators, only the most suitable ones. Secondly, the existing theory of BBC is not complete, integrating existing theories and proposing theories with stronger explanatory power should be the focus of future hyperscanning theory research. Thirdly, there are many forms of coupling in neural processing, and the meaning of coupling is different in different forms. Therefore, it is necessary to take into account the comprehensive consideration of the specific research task type, interactive mode and other factors when discussing the significance of coupling.

AB  - The Coniacian-Santonian interval has been proposed as the youngest of the Cretaceous ocean anoxic events (OAE3), but this designation has long been debated. OAE3 is associated with a long-lasting (similar to 3 myr) succession of black shales from the central and South Atlantic, Caribbean region, and the North American Western Interior; in the Western Interior it is characterized by an abrupt increase in total organic carbon (TOC) and corresponding trace metal indicators for anoxia. However, the modern concept of OAEs is predicated on detection of global carbon cycle perturbations as recorded by substantial carbon isotope excursions (CIE), and the protracted Coniacian-Santonian black shale interval does not have a large CIE. A more conservative definition of OAE3 might limit the event to the modest positive carbon isotope excursion restricted to the upper Coniacian Scaphites depressus Ammonite Zone. Trace metal proxies suggest that oxygen levels abruptly declined prior to the onset of this CIE in the Western Interior Sea (WIS), but it is unknown whether regional anoxic conditions were confined to sediments/pore waters, or how anoxia may have affected the biota. In an effort to characterize the oxygenation history of the WIS and to better understand the nature of the hypothesized OAE3, we present micropaleontological evidence of declining oxygen in bottom waters prior to the event using benthic foraminifera, which are sensitive to dissolved oxygen. Changes in benthic foraminiferal abundances suggest a decline in oxygen at least 1-myr prior to the CIE (including a nadir immediately below the start of the excursion), improving bottom water oxygen during the CIE, and re-establishment of persistent anoxia following the isotope excursion. Anoxia endured for nearly 3 myr in the central seaway, showing some signs of recovery toward the top of the Niobrara Formation. Our findings suggest that declining oxygen concentrations in the seaway eventually reached a tipping point, after which dissolved oxygen quickly dropped to zero.
   The late Coniacian CIE is an exception to the trend of declining oxygen in the WIS, and part of a larger pattern in the oxygenation history of the Niobrara Formation which suggests that it does not adhere to standard black shale models. Transgressive periods, including the Fort Hays Limestone and the lower limestone unit of the Smoky Hill Shale (which corresponds to the CIE) are relatively oxic, while periods of highstand (i.e., most of the Smoky Hill) correspond to deteriorating oxygen conditions. This contrasts with the standard black shale model for sea level and oxygen, where transgressions typically correlate with maximum TOC enrichment, interpreted to result from both sediment condensation and oxygen deficiency. The association of global carbon burial/anoxia (as indicated by carbon isotopes) with a regional increase in oxygen and decrease in organic matter preservation is reminiscent of the Cenomanian-Turonian Greenhorn Limestone, which contains OAE2. In both cases, the facies are not typical black shales, but instead have appreciable carbonate content Western Interior redox trends support the rejection of the original concept of a protracted Coniacian-Santonian OAE3 because it is not a distinct "event" Increasing local oxygen during the late Coniacian CIE also argues against a narrower OAE designation for this event, because the excursion can't be tied to anoxia here or anywhere else it has been described. Nevertheless, the Late Coniacian Event (as we prefer to call this CIE) still represents an important perturbation of the global carbon cycle. This is emblematic of the shift away from widespread, discrete anoxic events during the ongoing paleoceanographic reorganization of the Late Cretaceous, even as large carbon cycle perturbations continued.

AB  - The results of the design and validation of an Intellectual Capital (CI) management model for the quality of IES, Colombia 2014-2016 are shown. Applied research, mixed-nature. The qualitative approach was from the confrontation of the theory with the specific conditions of the object addressed (its characteristics and needs) which allowed the design of the model. The quantitative data approach was statistical. The population corresponds to the educational actors (teachers, students, administrative and management) of the medicine program, a total of 2139. The sampling was stratified and to determine the size of each of the stratum, took into account the population variances of the same and opted to use the criterion of Neyman's Affixation. For data analysis, they were presented in frequency distribution tables, with range and confidence interval measurements at 95 % (CI-95 %). Also, to observe the relationship between the variables (aspects) and the actors, a simple correspondence analysis was performed. All information was processed in the R-CRAN program. Seven surveys were designed which were validated by experts in higher education, who qualified coherence with the objectives of the study, the shape of the instrument and the clarity of the questions. The analysis of theories on intellectual capital allowed the design of the systemic-dynamic model of management of intellectual capital for the quality of institutions of higher education-SIDIGCIES, is based on three theories: Theory of dynamic capacities in the business world, of Teece, Pisano and Shuen; And, Theory of knowledge creation of Nonaka and Takeuchi. The guidelines of the National Accreditation Council (CNA) of Colombia were also taken into account for both programs and institutions. It is structured by four dynamic subsystems: human talent, research and innovation, academic administration and Social recognition. Its name is due to the way the management of intellectual capital in the IES must work, which requires an interconnected system, whose relationship is developed in a dynamic and non-static way when it is constantly moving, constantly improving and Adjustments, in constant internal interaction in each one of its elements and with the external medium. It is precisely the continuous interaction between the members of the Organization and other external agents in a careful way, which leads to the creation of new knowledge. Around the dynamic subsystems the elements that make possible the promotion and distribution of knowledge are undulating, they are: tacit knowledge, explicit knowledge, organizational knowledge and inter-organizational knowledge. In turn, the dynamic subsystems are influenced by four elements that directly affect their integral behavior and the achievement of the objectives of the IES. Without them, is not possible effective management of intellectual Capital; these are: Financial condition, national and international context, ethical-Legal aspects and physical infrastructure and material resources. The validation of the model in a medical program showed the relevance of SIDIGCIES, with the national and international requirements established for the accreditation of programs and institutions. We achieved the design of 92 indicators for measurement, distributed in each of the subsystems with this is possible a comprehensive analysis of their reality and not fractionally.
   Seven instruments were also designed for the actors of the teaching-learning process duly validated, counting in this way with reliable tools of measurement of the management of the CI SIDIGCIES, that allows the systematic and interdisciplinary study, oriented to identify the intellectual resources to share, employ, keep and protect them at the individual, organizational, social and global levels. It is a tool that will orient the proper management of the CI, will motivate the recognition of the value of the human talent for the production of the intangibles that there are produced, towards the recognition of the quality by the society and the State.

AB  - Aim, Scope and background. Given the communication limitation of a damage-oriented approach, the question addressed in this paper is how normalisation can be developed instead. Normalisation of product service systems without value choices is, in accordance to ISO 14042, suitable for external communication. Reason normalisation approaches use a geographically-defined baseline year of emissions, optionally combined with politically established target emissions (Guinee 2002, Stranddorf et al. 2001). In contradiction to these approaches, this paper aims to draw up the general structure of an alternative normalisation procedure. The normalisation procedure suggested here is based on environmental quality objectives (EQO), in order to streamline the result to include as few output parameters as possible, without compromising the scientific robustness of the method.
   Main Features. This article describes a normalisation procedure based on environmental quality objectives. Comparison between this approach and a damage-oriented approach is conducted. The relevant working area concerning dose and effect is evaluated. Then a discussion is conducted focusing on the trade-off necessary to achieve an integrated category indicator, covering the following issues; model reliability, user applicability and the unambiguously of the result.
   Result. A damage-oriented approach will have to take into account all the defined consequences from all impact categories that affect the safeguards in parallel. In other words, each impact category indicator and its potential effects on all safeguards must be evaluated and accounted for. In the case where a single category indicator cannot be found without utilising value choices, a number of category indicators will then have to constitute an intermediate category indicator result, where weighting must be applied in order to streamline the result. In contrast to the above approach, the suggested normalisation procedure utilises the precautionary principle with respect to the essential EQO in order to achieve a category indicator result, called a critical load category indicator result. In practice, this means that the number of figures in an LCIA-profile based on critical load will always be the same as the number of impact categories.
   Conclusions. The suggested EQO normalisation procedure forms a set of critical loads per impact category, where each is defined by a critical load function where linearity is defined between a zero load and the critical load. This procedure will affect the temporal resolution and the field of application of the LCIA method. The positive aspect is that the suggested normalisation procedure renders the method applicable for long-lived products like, for example, buildings or other infrastructures. This aspect is gained by reducing the damage-oriented resolution. Consequently, for long-lived products where the main environmental loads will appear in the future, it is hard to assess by a damage-oriented LCIA method (if all boundary conditions are not assumed to be fixed). The EQO normalisation method will, in this respect, improve the overall reliability of the outcome of an LCA when long-lived products are assessed. For short-lived products, adequate boundary conditions can be achieved, and for this reason a damage-oriented approach will have the possibility to address current consequences. Nevertheless, a damage-oriented approach working area is not applicable beneath thresholds unlike the EQO normalisation procedure. The most effective decision support of short-lived products is therefore achieved when both approaches are applied.
   Outlook. A complementary paper will be produced where the described normalisation procedure is exemplified in a case study, with special interest on assessment of chemical substances.

AB  - Decision-making in highly altered catchments occurs at different temporal and spatial scales, requiring integration of various datasets and models. This paper introduces two of the components of an environmental multiscale decision support system (EMDSS) for highly altered catchments, designed to make decisions at different time scales. First, an integrated dynamic flow and water quality model is proposed to analyze the river system, including wastewater discharges and water intakes. This integrated model is capable of representing unsteady flow conditions, allowing analysis at different time scales. Second, three postprocessing tools are presented to support short- (hours to days), medium- (days to months), and long- (years to decades) term operational, management, and planning decisions. The water quality component of the model can represent conventional and toxic determinands to simultaneously analyze domestic and industrial pollution throughout a river system. The first postprocessing tool of the EMDSS is useful in defining concentration limits for wastewater discharges for different water users downstream. The second tool allows the assessment of river water quantity and quality to determine water availability for intake extensions and medium-term wastewater flow augmentation. The third makes it possible to simulate and perform effective operational reservoir releases to improve water quality in the river during short-term pollution incidents. The proposed integrated model and postprocessing tools are applied in the upper Bogota River stretch in Colombia, one of the most altered catchments and polluted rivers in the world. The results obtained illustrate the utility of the proposed EMDSS for river management and decision making regarding water quality at different time scales.

AB  - A growing photovoltaic industry shows exponential deployment worldwide, and it is expected to largely contribute to the energy transition. Because PV technologies will play a major role in achieving global sustainable development and climate goals, driving more energy-efficient scenarios will require efficient approaches to evaluate systems, especially when dealing with big data of a large region or portfolio. In this work, a novel approach for the PV performance assessment of photovoltaic systems, called "Typical Daily Profiles" (TDP), is presented. This approach is tested on the entire PV fleet operating in Chile from 2014 to 2019. The TDP approach can help to calculate key performance indicators, identify the mounting configuration of PV systems, and to detect major technical issues. A detailed validation carried on the Chilean PV fleet confirms the TDP approach's capabilities to provide accurate PV performance results, neglecting external factors such as failures, grid curtailment, or poor operation activities. Chile was chosen due to the large variety of climate zones in its unique geography, which helps to understand the PV performance under different environmental conditions. Besides, this study reveals the immense potential of PV technologies in Chile compared to mature PV markets worldwide. On an annual basis, their unit capacity factors can reach up to 38%, performance ratios above 90%, and the highest energy yield close to 3350 kWh/kWp. Proving to be an accurate tool, the Typical Daily Profiles approach can be easily applied to other PV portfolios in different regions, and a periodical execution could help to identify and understand long-term performance losses.

AB  - Purpose As part of the COVID-19 preventive measures that have entirely impacted individuals' lives worldwide, remote work has been indicated as one of the most challenging aspects that have passed through great adaptation in the past months, highlighting the need for its better understanding. Following the fundamental theoretical frameworks of motivation, the authors argue that remote work tasks and the environment highly determine employees' productivity and satisfaction, which in turn influence their intention to continue working from home once the restrictions are relaxed. Design/methodology/approach Data from 363 remote work employees were collected, indicating their personal experiences of working from home during COVID-19 quarantine. The analyses were carried out using partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) methodology, employing the SmartPLS3 software. Findings The results reveal the possibility for reconciliation and the adequate remote work's flow as motivating, and the interruptions and technology-related anxiety as interfering impacts, in the process of achieving functional home office. However, although employees might be productive, it is not a sufficient condition for them to show an intention to continue working remotely after the COVID-19 pandemic is over, contrary to their satisfaction, which is found crucial for their future intentions. Originality/value The theoretical and practical implications of this study suggest several avenues for productive management of the transition to remote work, especially when the need is imposed urgently and an adequate selection of the most indispensable aspects for constructive working from home must be rapidly reached.

AB  - Aluminum (Al) release and deposition in drinking water distribution systems (DWDS) are highly detrimental to tap water quality. In this study, five drinking water treatment plant supply areas in two cities of China were examined to understand the transportation stability of Al in the DWDS. The two cities were selected based on the wide disparity reported in pH and turbidity in the finished and tap water qualities, with higher fluctuation of pH (average 8.0) and turbidity (average 0.78 NTU) reported in the northern and southern cities, respectively. Results showed that hydraulic conditions such as hydraulic shock or increased flow velocity had a more significant effect on the release and deposition of particulate Al, which could be reflected by turbidity when it was greater than 0.3 NTU, since turbidity and particulate Al were significantly positively correlated. Particulate Al concentration varied by more than 140 mg/L when turbidity fluctuated within 0.45-1.67 NTU. However, when turbidity was below 0.3 NTU, the particulate Al transported stably at low concentration. pH fluctuations contributed to the change of soluble Al concentration. Even above 50 mg/L soluble Al in the finished water could transport stably in the DWDS when pH fluctuated slightly in 6.6-7.0. However, when the pH fluctuated in 7.8-8.4, the soluble Al concentration varied by more than 100 mg/L. This study provides reference indicators of turbidity and pH for identifying the risk of Al in the DWDS. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lacustrine laminar coal is an unusual and rare sedimentary deposit, especially when it coexists with oil shale; this combination has special significance for indicating the evolution of the paleoenvironment. The coal-bearing and oil shale strata of the Early Jurassic Badaowan Formation in the Dachanggou Basin, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, present an ideal example to reveal the evolution of high-frequency environmental changes in the Early Jurassic. Based on bulk geochemical data, the paleoenvironmental, paleoclimatic and genetic differences between lacustrine laminar coal and oil shale were studied. The Badaowan Formation oil shale has high organic matter abundance and hydrocarbon-generating potential and contains type I and type II1 organic matter. However, compared with oil shale, interlayered laminar coal has higher organic matter abundance and hydrocarbon-generating potential, and the type of organic matter is II1. Various environmental geochemical indicators suggest that oil shale formed in a warm and humid climate and was deposited in fresh water under oxic-suboxic conditions and that algae were the main source of organic matter, followed by terrigenous organic matter. Laminar coal formed in relatively high-temperature periods and accumulated in suboxic-euxinic saline lakes. The source of organic matter was mainly higher plants or hydrophilic plants around the basin, followed by algae. Short-term thermal events swamped the lake margins and increased the input of terrigenous organic matter, which promoted the formation of thin laminar coal interbedded with oil shale.

AB  - The concentration of As, Pb, Cd, Zn, Fe, Mn, and Cu and the Sr and Pb isotopic compositions were determined in four species of the vascular epiphyte Tillandsia (T. caput medusae, T. ionantha, T. recurvata, and T. sp), to evaluate their capacity to biomonitor the air quality and the sources of lithogenic particles and toxic elements in a severely contaminated site from the mining region of Taxco de Alarcon, Guerrero (southern Mexico). With the exception of Cu, mean concentrations are typically higher in the contaminated site relative to a reference (uncontaminated) site, and the incrustation of metal-bearing particles (mainly PM10 and PM2.5) on leaves and roots seems to be the most significant mechanism of incorporation of these pollutants to plants. The Sr isotopic composition indicated that surrounding lithology is the main source of lithogenic particles, whereas statistical tools and Pb isotope ratios revealed a genetic link of toxic elements in epiphytes with Taxco ores and mining wastes, which confirm the capacity of the evaluated epiphytes to record local environmental conditions. The presence of abundant metal-bearing particles, particularly in the PM2.5, may represent a serious threat to the health of wild fauna, livestock, and humans in the zone. The study demonstrated that vascular epiphytes of the Tillandsia genus could be used as an efficient, low-cost, biotechnological tool for monitoring the air quality in severely contaminated polymetallic sites such as mining and smelting zones, as well as for sourcing lithogenic and metal-bearing particles.

AB  - Water deficit (WD), a major contributor to yield reductions in faba bean (Vicia faba), is a complex phenomenon that varies across daily to seasonal cycles. Several studies have identified various morphological and physiological indicators of WD tolerance, which generally show limited water use during WD. Limited information is available on the impact of WD on nutrient content and reproductive biology of the faba bean. We studied carbohydrates, amino acids, mineral nutrients and the abundance of naturally occurring carbon isotopes (delta C-13) in leaf and grain tissues of faba bean genotypes grown under well-watered (WW) and WD conditions. delta C-13 of leaf tissues were found to indicate changes in water use due to WD but this was not reflected in grain tissues. Nutrient concentrations with regard to amino acids and minerals were not influenced by WD. However, carbohydrate accumulation was found to be significant for WD, specifically through the presence of a higher concentration of myo-inositol in WD leaf tissues. Alternatively, sucrose concentration in grain tissues was reduced under WD treatment. WD hampered reproductive functionality by reducing pollen viability and germination with the severity and duration of stress and this reduction was less prominent in the drought-tolerant genotype (AC0805#4912) compared to the sensitive one (11NF010c-4). It was also demonstrated that WD caused developmental impairment in the stamen and pistil, where the pistil appeared more sensitive than stamen. These findings suggest that WD impairs pollen viability and pistil function reducing yield volume, but the nutrient content of the resulting yield is not significantly affected.

AB  - Climate change alters environmental conditions that are expected to have a profound effect on the biodiversity, community composition, and metabolic processes of microeukaryotic plankton in Arctic and Subarctic coastal waters. The molecular biodiversity [large subunit (LSU) rRNA gene] of three plankton size-fractions (micro-, nano-, and picoplankton) from coastal waters of ice-influenced west Greenland was compared with fractions from ice-free northwest Iceland within their summer environmental context. Putative metabolic functions were determined by differentially expressed mRNA (metatranscriptomics) of the microplankton. Temperature and salinity variations were more closely correlated than inorganic macronutrients with metabolic functions and community composition. Temperature explained much of the community variance, approximately 20% among micro- and nanoplankton, whereas other environmental factors accounted for rather low fractional variance (<7%). Species of smaller cell-size were more evenly distributed (Pielou's evenness index J) across regions, with a higher diversity and total abundance, and thereby indicating high plasticity. The metatranscriptomic profiles in these respective microeukaryotic communities revealed that diatoms were more plastic in their gene expression than dinoflagellates, but dinoflagellates had a more diverse, albeit homogeneously expressed, gene pool. This could be interpreted as expression of alternative lifestyle strategies, whereby the functionally more conservative diatoms fill their niches primarily through variable resource use, whereas dinoflagellates apparently differentiate their niches through more diverse lifestyles. Patterns of microeukaryotic diversity are thus primarily associated with differences in metabolic function and activity of diatom- versus dinoflagellate-dominated communities in Arctic and Subarctic waters during summer.

AB  - Well-being has a multidimensional nature as it depends on multifaceted factors such as material conditions and quality of life. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has developed the Better Life Index (BLI) as part of the OECD Better Life initiative to facilitate the better understanding of what drives well-being of people. The BLI is a three-level hierarchical composite indicator that covers several socio-economic aspects. In this paper, considering the entire hierarchical structure of the index, we introduce a bottom-up procedure for the aggregation of the components at each level. We formulate the assessment of BLI as a multiple objective programming (MOP) problem that facilitates the implementation of different concepts to derive different aggregation schemes. We incorporate the data from previous years into the normalization process of the indicators, to take into account the discrepancy on their observed values and smooth their deviations across the years. Also, we consider the public opinion about well-being that is captured from the worldwide responses in the web platform of OECD BLI. We incorporate the public opinion into the assessment models in the form of weight restrictions. In this way, we reduce the effect of compensation that might be imposed by the adopted modelling approach. We apply our methodology to the data of 38 countries (35 OECD and 3 non-OECD economies) for the year 2017. Our findings illustrate that the public opinion in the form of weight restrictions can effectively drive the optimization process and depict the collective preferences to the BLI scores.

AB  - Urbanization is a major threat to native biodiversity. Invasion of tramp species is a major consequence of urbanization, which might threaten native species. Ants are established robust ecosystem indicators. We assessed the changes of ant community in sacred groves (SGs) of urban and rural landscapes of south India between 2013 and 2019, and asked, 1) what is the effect of urbanization on ant community? 2) has the population of invasive ants, particularlyAnoplolepis gracilipes- a globally notorious tramp species, changed in response to urbanization and year? 3) is species composition of ants in SGs different between landscapes and years? and 4) has the population of native ants or any ant functional groups responded with the population of invasive ants? The richness of overall species, native species, and invasive species was not affected by year or landscape, but the abundance was. In six years, the abundance of ants doubled, but due toA. gracilipes.A. gracilipes, previously restricted only in the urban SGs had established in rural SGs in six years. A significant turnover of native species was observed across years and with the population rise ofA. gracilipes. While Generalist Myrmecines and Tropical Climate Specialists increased with the abundance of invasive ants, Cryptic Species decreased. We consider the stability maintained in the native species composition and richness in SGs, the aftermath of the conditions provided by SGs. However, the evident shift in the composition of native ants over the years point out how invasive ants affect the native species composition.

AB  - Background: The Posta Sanitaria Las Lilas (La Posta) is a health promotion project of the medical school. Its purpose is to improve the health of individuals and the society by fostering qualitative changes in people's attitudes and habits in relation to every aspect of their health. The project serves a population of 25,000 inhabitants that live in conditions of vulnerability and poverty. It is based on a specific approach to social commitment and accountability that integrates teaching, research, and care with the whole community. Activities: The project activities are oriented toward key dimensions for each person and the community. There are two programs: health and education that involve physicians, students, residents, teachers, volunteers, and community members. Outcomes: The project has increased the number of medical appointments, medical records, and workshop participants. It is difficult to establish objective indicators that may reflect the changes in the life of the community members. In this article, findings of an impact evaluation study are presented. We also describe unexpected results for those who participated in the project. Conclusion: La Posta is part of the University's agenda and a place of meaningful and formative learning. All program activities are implemented with the support and resources of the institution. A network of various organizations cooperates with La Posta in order to help promote the welfare of the community. They are all committed to contributing to the development of project participants' personal resources rather than merely addressing their unmet needs. This requires thinking about people in all dimensions (biological, psychological, social, and spiritual).

AB  - Agriculture is affected daily by climatic phenomena, but limited information is available on the impacts of extreme climate variability (ECV) in agricultural systems of tropical countries. Citrus was used as a model system to explore whether ECV scenarios cause severe impacts on the climatic suitability of the crop in the eastern plains of Colombia, a key agricultural hub for the country. Because this region is a national food basket, climate risks need to be identified across the territory. Our study developed species distribution modelling of citrus used to generate the first agro-climatic zonification for citrus in Colombia. We used this model to investigate the interannual ECV impacts based on the latest ensemble modelling approaches. The ECV scenarios in this study are unique and highly valuable because we analyze maximum and minimum interannual values recorded daily from 1980 to 2010 rather than monthly. Four citrus growing climatic zones were identified. In the worst-case scenarios, these zones experienced a loss of climatically suitable area by 50%. However, in some cases optimum areas remained unchanged and/or new suitable areas emerged. Strong rainfall and high temperatures triggered negative impacts in the most critically-affected zones, weakening a large proportion of the ideal climatic space for citrus growing. Our study provides new evidence that could be used to generate climate-based ecological indicators for regions of high vulnerability. Delimitation maps and modelling results may be used by citrus growers to develop more efficient citrus production systems in tropical conditions and ultimately increase resilience to climate variability.

AB  - Berscheid and Walster (1974) suggested that women marry men who are taller than them. On average, in all populations, men are taller than women, but sexual dimorphism in height has different degrees of severity and affects both the cultural environment and the phylogenetic development of a particular society (Holden & Mace, 1999). In Western cultures (North America and Europe), being tall gives men additional opportunities and facilitates their goals. At the same time, in populations where resources are obtained in a different way than in industrial societies, the importance of the man's height differs. In this study, we analyzed the male-female height ratio preferred by married couples from the Indian Diaspora in Tanzania (Dar es Salaam). As a method, stimulus images were used, whereby the respondents were asked to choose two male-female pairs from six silhouettes depicted. The first pair chosen reflected the Indians' height preferences in a married couple, whereas the second one showed the real situation in the respondents' life: the difference in height between them and their husband / wife. Considering the results obtained for the Indians, it appears important to search for similarities / differences, as well as cause-and-effect relationships regarding the preferred severity of sexual dimorphism in height, within certain groups of populations (Western, industrial, pre-industrial, developed and developing countries, traditional societies, etc.) and to take into account the specificity of local environment and living conditions, of health indicators and cultural norms.

AB  - Two experiments were conducted in different areas of the Rafael Fernandes Experimental Farm, located in Lagoinha district, 20 km from Mossoro municipality (RN), in the period from June to September of the years of 2015 and 2016 with the objective of evaluating and estimating agronomic and economic feasibility indicators of cowpea-vegetable as a function of amounts of hairy woodrose (Merremia aegyptia (L.) Urb.) biomass incorporated into the soil in two crops. Treatments consisted of the following amounts of hairy woodrose biomass: 20, 35, 50 and 65 t ha(-1) on a dry basis. The cultivar of cowpea-vegetable planted was "BRS Itaim". The evaluated characteristics were: length of green pods, number of green pods per m(2), productivity and dry mass of green pods, weight of 100 green grains, yield and dry mass of green grains. In addition, the following economic indicators were evaluated: gross income, net income, rate of return and profitability index. The optimization of the agronomic efficiency of the cowpea-vegetable was obtained in the amount of 45 t ha(-1) of hairy woodrose biomass incorporated into the soil and the optimization of the agroeconomic viability of the cowpea-vegetable cultivation was reached in the quantity of hairy woodrose biomass of 37.70 t ha(-1) added to the ground. The first growing crop yielded better agroeconomic efficiency of cowpea-vegetable than the second crop. The use of hairy woodrose as green manure is economically feasible and recommended to the farmer in the production of cowpea-vegetable under the evaluated conditions.

AB  - Electrical power generation by burning fossil fuels leads to the formation of a significant amount of industrial waste that is often stored at ash disposal sites, which leads to a negative impact on the environment. Therefore, studies devoted to soil formation within such areas are rather sufficient for planning their reclamation. The proposed paper presents the results of a study of soil development at the inactive self-grown ash disposal area of Tyumen combined heat and power (CHP-1) plant (Western Siberia, Russia), formed due to the combustion of peat from the local Tarman deposit. Four soil pits representing different areas of ash dumps with grassy and woody vegetation were selected for detailed studies. The laboratory analyses included chemical, mineralogical and microscopic studies. The obtained results showed that the studied soils are characterised by a poorly developed humus horizon and strong stratification of the ash parent material and can be classified as Spolic Technosols. The studied technogenic soils are characterised by neutral and alkaline pH values, high LOI values, diversity of pedogenic carbonates and strong heterogeneity of the profile, due to the alteration of layers composed of fly and bottom ash material. These peculiarities of soils are related to properties of peat ashes, technology of peat consumption, and the intensity of weathering under cold continental climate conditions. The main indicators of pedogenic processes are the formation of humus horizons, the decrease in alkalinity in the upper part of the profile, disturbance of the primary stratification of the parent material, and the formation of pedogenic carbonates. It is possible to suppose further evolution of studied soils towards Andosol-like soils.

AB  - Understanding the processes that influence octopus abundance is important in order to manage the fishing grounds and offer advice on the exploitation of this important resource. Fluctuations in abundance of exploited stocks may be due to a great variety of factors. However, in short-lived animals such as cephalopods, in which abundance depends on strength of the recruitment, it is well known that population abundance is highly influenced by the environmental conditions.
   In this study we investigated the relationship between octopus (Octopus vulgaris) catches from the fishery located in the area off the Gulf of Cadiz (Spanish South Atlantic Region) and several hydrographic and oceanographic parameters such as sea surface temperature, surface chlorophyll-a, inorganic surface turbidity and climatic indicators such as the NAO index, rain, WeMoi Index, AMO index and or Guadalquivir River discharges. In addition, a recruitment index was obtained from fishery-independent surveys, which was also used to investigate its effect on annual catches. Results revealed that abundance of octopus showed a significant negative relationship with rain in the previous year as well as a positive effect of the recruitment index.
   We have obtained a model using the rain and the recruit index to forecast the catches.
   This model explained a high percentage of variation in annual catches and was used to forecast the next year's catch providing results within the expected confidence intervals. This represents a potentially useful tool to guide fishery managers since no assessment of the species is currently conducted in the area.

AB  - Strains selection for inoculation is the key to the successful construction of a bioaugmentation system, a promising strategy for specific pollutant removal. Pseudomonas aeruginosa SD-1 wild-type (WT) strain exhibited high capacity for biofilm formation but low efficiency for nitrate (NO3-) removal. Meanwhile, quorum sensing deficient strain Delta lasR showed excellent efficiency for NO3- removal but poor capability for colonization in activated sludge. The opposite effect of biofilm formation and NO3- removal exist in WT or Delta lasR, which limits the construction of bioaugmentation system of strain SD-1 and its application. To solve this issue, a mixture of WT and Delta lasR (viv = 1:1) was used to construct a bioaugmentation system. Compared with the inoculation of WT or Delta lasR alone, the mixed inoculation not only was beneficial for activated sludge development but also for pollutant removal. The indicators for activated sludge including the abundance of P. aeruginosa, the sludge volume index and the average particle size in mixed inoculated reactors were close to those of reactors with single and repeated inoculation of WT. The effluent of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and NO3--N were stable at 3.9-22.6 mg L-1 and 0-5.53 mg L-1 after d 3, respectively. This study presents a detailed case on the ecological tradeoff of colonization and pollutant removal of inoculated strains during bioaugmentation. The results provide information on the appropriate conditions for application of P. aeruginosa SD-1 for livestock wastewater treatment and further enrich our ecological understanding of bioaugmentation.

AB  - Energy and emergy methods were applied to assess two groups of agricultural farms in the Kujawsko-Pomorskie Province, north-central Poland. The first group consisted of 11 farms operating in 2002-2003, i.e. before the accession of Poland to the European Union (EU) occurred in 2004. The second group consisted of 8 farms operating in 2009-2012, i.e. after the accession of Poland to the EU. The objective of the study was to assess the effect of accession to the EU on agriculture in terms of energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. All the investigated farms used conventional production methods for crop and livestock farming. The size of farms ranged from 8 to about 98 ha. The agricultural activities were conducted in agricultural holdings with similar physiographic, soil, and climatic conditions. Despite similar values of the total energy input to agricultural production, farms after accession to the EU showed higher yields and energy efficiency.
   While significant differences were found between energy-based indicators (energy efficiency, and production output) calculated before and after accession to EU, the emergy-based indicators did not show significant differences. The access to EU subsidies and new regulations determined a massive replacement of agricultural machinery with more modern and efficient ones while improving the use of chemical inputs.
   Future studies might focus on assessing the environmental performance and sustainability of Polish agriculture taking into account a larger set of farms located in different regions.

AB  - The Neognathodus Index (NI) is developed as a primary biostratigraphic indicator for the Desmoinesian Series of the Illinois Basin in Indiana, Illinois, and Kentucky. It is based on the gradual evolutionary morphotypic variations of P1 elements of named species of Neognathodus Dunn, 1970. The NI analyses and zonations presented herein are constructed from 472 productive conodont samples from 105 different localities. NIs for the Illinois Basin show morphologic drift in Indiana from the Perth Limestone Member of the Staunton Formation (NI = 2.03) to the Velpen Limestone and Mecca Quarry Shale members of the Linton Formation (NI = 5.04) followed by stability through the Alum Cave (NI = 4.83). Further morphologic drift then occurred through the Providence Limestone Member of the Dugger Formation (NI = 5.43) and continued through the West Franklin Limestone Member of the Shelburn Formation (NI = 6.32) until the extinction of Neognathodus at the end of Desmoinesian. The patterns of drift and stability translate to Neognathodus biozones and are supported by Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of standardized Neognathodus morphotype distributions. Localized NI variations are due to morphologic shifts and differential evolution in response to localized environmental conditions. Examination of the NI differences in the states of Illinois, Kentucky, and Indiana reflect similar morphologic simplification of the P1 element from Perth to Velpen and Mecca Quarry in Indiana (NI = 2.03-5.04) and from Seville to Brereton in Illinois and Kentucky (NI = 2.80-5.00). Post-Brereton in Illinois and Kentucky (NI = 5.00-5.65) and post-Providence in Indiana (NI = 5.43-6.32) saw progressive P1 simplification, but it was much more pronounced in Indiana.

AB  - Identifying geochemical paleo-proxies of vegetation type in watersheds could become a powerful tool for paleoecological studies of ecosystem dynamics, particularly when commonly used proxies, such as pollen grains, are not suitable. In order to identify new paleological proxies to distinguish ecosystem types in lake records, we investigated the differences in the sediment geochemistry of lakes surrounded by two boreal forest ecosystems dominated by the same tree species: closed-canopy black spruce-moss forests (MF) and open-canopy black spruce-lichen woodlands (LW). This study was designed as a first calibration step between terrestrial modern soils and lacustrine sediments (0-1000 cal yr BP) on six lake watersheds. In a previous study, differences in the physical and geochemical properties of forest soils had been observed between these two modern ecosystems. Here we show that the geochemical properties of the sediments varied between the six lakes studied. While we did not identify geochemical indicators that could solely distinguish both ecosystem types in modern sediments, we observed intriguing differences in concentrations of C:N ratio, carbon isotopic ratio, and aluminum oxide species, and in the stabilization of their geochemical properties with depth. The C accumulation rates at millennial scale were significantly higher in MF watersheds than in LW watersheds. We suggest that these variations could result from organic matter inflows that fluctuate depending on forest density and ground vegetation cover. Further investigations on these highlighted geochemistry markers need to be performed to confirm whether they can be used to detect shifts in vegetation conditions that have occurred in the past.

AB  - The Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum has become a common and dominant macrobenthic species in coastal areas of the northwestern Pacific and temperate waters of Europe; it is also a major cultured shellfish, with annual worldwide production exceeding 3.3 million tonnes. This species faces greater risk of exposure to hypoxia as eutrophication worsens throughout its coastal habitats; however, its tolerance to hypoxia remains unclear, and the toxicological indicators including LC50 and LT50 have not yet been assessed. Previous studies on the effects of hypoxia on marine benthos have focused largely on functional responses, such as metabolism and gene expression, leaving potential structural damage to the mitochondria or the cells unknown. In this study we assessed the effects of hypoxia on Manila clam in terms of survival, behavior, metabolism and cellular damage, using a newly designed automated hypoxia simulation device that features exceptional accuracy and good stability. The clams exhibited strong tolerance to hypoxia as the 20-day LC50 for dissolved oxygen (DO) was estimated to be 0.57 mg L-1, and the LT50 at 0.5 mg L-1 DO was 422 hours. Adaptations included fewer buried clams and a depressed metabolism, while the unexpected rise in the activities of key enzymes involved in glycolysis may indicate a diverse strategy of shellfish under hypoxia. Cellular damage was observed as collapse of the mitochondrial cristae and both cellular and mitochondrial vacuolization. This multi-level study complements and updates our knowledge of the effects of hypoxia on marine benthos, by improving our understanding of the potential for marine ecological transformation under hypoxic conditions and providing useful information for Manila clam farming.

AB  - Chronic inflammation mediated by the interaction of immune cells and adipocytes is a key underlying factor in obesity-associated type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Therefore, methods to investigate adipocyte-immune cells interaction and their immuno-metabolic status in obese/T2DM subjects not only serve as an early indicator of disease development but also provide an insight into disease mechanism. A microfluidic-based in vitro model of the human adipose that is interfaced with a co-culture of immune cell has been developed for in vitro immune-metabolic analysis. This miniaturized system integrates a biologically active in vitro cellular system within a perfusion-based microfluidic device for mimicking the major processes that characterize the interaction of adipose tissue with immune cells. A viable immune competent model of the adipocytes/PBMCs co-culture has been demonstrated and characterized. Our testing results showed that the inflammatory cytokine profile obtained from the on-chip culture agrees with those from static transwell based co-culture with more intense responses observed in the chip-based system. The microfluidic chip also allows time-resolved measurement of cytokines that provide reliable data and detailed mechanisms of inflammation. In addition, glucose uptake by the adipocytes from the chip-based cultures showed correlated insulin responsivity/resistivity to the expression of the cytokine profile in different dynamic culture conditions. Testing of the known diabetic drug, metformin, and neutraceutical compound, omega-3, on-chip show agreeable results as compared to the previously reported data. This organotypic culture system offers a physiologically relevant model that exhibits a key characteristic of type 2 diabetic adipose tissues and can be used to study the T2DM mechanisms and diabetic drug screening.

AB  - Nowadays, one of the most urgent tasks facing the state authorities in the Russian Federation is to manage the comprehensive development of the regions. The complexity of this subject to management, multidimensionality of existing problems and the inconsistency of the targets in conjunction with the dynamically changing operating conditions require the use of modern methods and tools to forecasting of changes in the key parameters of regional development. The article describes approach to the formation of an adaptive simulation model of regional socio-economic system. This model allows to take into account the behaviour of economic agents in their interaction with each other and the environment. The conceptual scheme of this model is presented. The basic elements of model, including blocks of adaptive behaviour of agents, use of resources and maintenance of balances are revealed. The control subsystem including the goal setting and control blocks is allocated separately. A set of rules governing the activation of a particular block of the model is justified. To implement this task, the adjustment mechanism of the indicative plan is formalized based on fuzzy logic methods. The knowledge base of fuzzy rules for the formation of target indicators for management of the regional system development is developed. At the end of the article the scheme of implementation of information support of regional development management based on the proposed adaptive simulation model of the region is described. In our opinion, the proposed tools which combines the methods of management theory and economic and mathematical methods will improve the efficiency of regional development strategies.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major metabolic disease and a key epigenetic risk factor for the development of additional clinical complications. Among them, periodontitis (PD), a severe inflammatory disease ascribable to a dysregulated physiology and composition of the oral microbiota, represents one of the most relevant complications. Periodontitis can impact the structure of the tooth and likely the stem and progenitor cell pool, which actively contributes to the periodontal microenvironment and homeostasis. Modifications of the oral plaque play a key role in the etiopathogenesis of PD caused by T2D. However, to what extent the biology of the progenitor pool is affected has still to be elucidated. In this short report, we aimed to explore the biological effects of oral plaque derived from T2D patients with PD in comparison to non-diabetic patients with PD. Oral plaque samples were isolated from T2D and non-diabetic subjects with PD. Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), derived from the premolar tooth, were conditioned for 21 days with oral plaque samples and tested for their clonogenic ability. Cultures were also induced to differentiate towards the osteogenic lineage, and ALP and osteocalcin gene expression levels were evaluated by real-time qPCR. Results have shown that the number of clones generated by DPSCs exposed to T2D oral plaque was significantly lower compared to controls (ctl). The multivariate analysis confirmed that the decreased clonogenesis was significantly correlated only with T2D diagnosis. Moreover, the effect of T2D oral plaque was specific to DPSCs. Indicators of osteogenic differentiation were not significantly affected. This study provides a new biological insight into the effects ascribable to T2D in PD.

AB  - Naturally, plants possess a weak capacity of generating negative air ions (NAIs). NAIs were demonstrated as an indicator of air condition. Improving concentration of NAls could be beneficial for human health. Previous studies revealed that stimulating plant by a pulsed electrical field (PEF) resulted in a burst of NAIs emission. However, little is known about the processing or mechanism of NAls generation in plants under PEF stimulation. This study investigated the physiological mechanism underlying plant NAIs generation following PEF stimulation. We found that aloe (Aloe vera var. chinensis (Haw.) Berg.), sansevieria (Sansevieria frifasciata Prain) and agave (Agave americana var. variegata Linn.) naturally generated more NAIs than others. Various parameters (pulsed voltage, interval and width) of PEF input influenced the capacity of NAIs generation in plants. Optimal combinational parameters (CP) on of PEF for efficient generation of NAIs had species difference. Under optimal CP, a higher voltage of a plant was helpful for NAIs generation (P < 0.05). The intensity of illumination enhanced the ability of NAIs emission by plants (P < 0.05) under optimal CP stimulation. Furthermore, the capacity of NAIs generation by plants is highly related to the characteristics of leaf stomata A greater degree of stomatal opening and stomatal density significantly enhanced the ability of NAIs emission from plants (P < 0.05). These results indicated that the presence of PEF stimulation, illumination intensity, plant voltage, and the specific plant physiological characteristics (e.g. stomatal area and stomatal density) influence plant NAIs generation. Our findings provide guidance for designing plant NAIs generator to improve air quality for human. (C) 2019 Friends Science Publishers

AB  - This article introduces the AHC model as a new tool for modeling and assessing the agroecosystem processes. The AHC, as a one-dimensional numerical physical model, simulates the soil water and salt/nitrogen dynamics, heat transport, and crop growth and yield in various soil-crop environments. The key features of the AHC include that it provides the optional function for simulating the fate of salt or nitrogen; it has an efficient global method for sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation; and it is useful in a wide range of field conditions, especially for those in northern China. A menu-driven program is developed as a user-friendly interface for efficient data manipulation. This paper primarily describes the main structures and algorithms of the AHC and presents its field applicability. Model testing and application was conducted with two cases: (1) a salinity case with maize growing in salt-affected fields under arid and shallow groundwater environments (Hetao, upper Yellow River basin, northwest China); and (2) a nitrogen case with a wheat-maize rotation system in the semihumid monsoon region (Tai'an, North China Plain). Good agreement was obtained between the simulated and observed data, including the soil water contents, salt/nitrogen contents, and crop growth indicators. The soil water and salt/nitrogen dynamics, crop growth processes, and their complex interactive effects were also well interpreted using the AHC. Rational simulation proves the good applicability of the AHC for practical field use.

AB  - The Port Askaig Formation (PAF) is a diamictite-bearing succession in the Dalradian Supergroup of Scotland that provides an excellent archive of a Cryogenian glaciation in the Garvellach Islands and Islay, Argyll. The formation is similar to 1100 m thick, comprises 5 members and includes 47 diamictite beds, interbedded with siltstones, dolostones and sandstones. Here we document seven features of the PAF that indicate its relative stratigraphic completeness. There are gradual, progressive changes up-section in the lithologies of the diamictites, their interbeds, and clast lithologies. The sharp basal surfaces of the diamictites each show the same, repeated pattern of environmental change, from non-glacial to glacial. Many of the top surfaces of the diamictites show evidence of periglacial conditions. The succession in the PAF records a total of 76 climatically-related stratigraphic episodes: 28 glacial episodes, 25 periglacial episodes and 23 non-glacial episodes. Parts of Member 1 (Diamictites 1-12 and Diamictites 16-18) and Member 2 (Diamictite 31 to the base of Member 3) are most compete on the east coast of Garbh Eileach. The PAF in the Garvellach Islands occurs within a succession that is several kilometres thick, as newly revealed by sea-floor mapping. Compared with other Cryogenian and Phanerozoic glacial successions, the PAF is exceptional in its combination of formation thickness, the number of climatically-related stratigraphic episodes, and the considerable thickness of its host supergroup. Furthermore, these indicators of relative stratigraphic completeness provide evidence that the base of the PAF on the east coast of Garbh Eileach is a succession without a major break in deposition, supporting the account of the strata at and below the base of the PAF in the companion article by Fairchild et al. (2018).

AB  - The performance of every plant in an environment is an indicator on how the plant can withstand various environmental conditions. This study investigates the toxicity of crude oil on growth performance, chlorophyll contents, enzymatic activities, and oxidative stress biomarkers of eight accessions of Zea mays. It assays growth enzyme activities (for amylase and invertase) as well as oxidative stress biomarkers (malondialdehyde, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase) in Z. mays, using spectrophotometric method. The maize accessions have been grown in experimental pots with crude oil treatments (2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, and 10%) and harvested after 14 days of seedling emergence. Results show that the percentage seedling emergence, leaf size, root length, stem girth, and shoot length of each accession have decreased significantly (p<0.001, p<0.01, and p<0.05) as pollution level has ascended. Significant differences in chlorophyll content have also been observed in the plants grown in soil samples, polluted by crude oil, compared to non-polluted soil (p<0.0001; p<0.01; p<0.05) with a decrease in growth enzymes activities as well as oxidative stress biomarkers at 10% pollution. TZE Comp 5 accession and BR-9928 DMR SR-Y have been the most resistant and the most sensitive accessions, respectively. Results suggest that parameters, activities, and expression levels of growth enzymes as well as oxidative stress responses can be used as biomarkers to evaluate the influence of crude oil on the growth of Z. mays. They also suggest that there are intraspecific differences in the responses of the accessions of Z. mays to crude oil pollution.

AB  - Rare earth elements (REEs) are commonly used in the production of modern devices, and their application has been increasing dramatically recently. Elevated environmental contamination has already been found in areas surrounding factories and mines, but there is still little knowledge about their potential accumulation in the urban environment. Dandelion was tested as a possible bioindicator of the human and environmental risk of REEs. Moreover, relations between REE concentrations in plants and land use were also analysed. Analysis of spatial distribution revealed differentiation in the city area, which suggests that dandelion can be a suitable biomonitor of rare earth elements in the urban environment with regard to type of land use. Moreover, some relations between particular types of land use and light REEs (LREEs) and heavy REEs (HREEs) were also discovered. Positive relations between LREEs and such land use as forests, wetlands and waters were found, while HREEs showed a positive relation to agricultural land use. There was no relation or a negative relation to urban and industrial land use. Overall, based on our preliminary studies in the city area, we can conclude that dandelion is a promising REE bioindicator, which can be found in all types of land use and in almost every city in the northern hemisphere. Moreover, additional detailed analysis of other factors is necessary to create in the future a full map of interrelationships between accumulation of REEs in T. officinale and influencing factors, such as meteorological conditions, soil parameters, green area type, and landscape structure.

AB  - Relative abundances of 157 diatom taxa from Yakutian lake surface-sediments were investigated for their potential to indicate certain environmental conditions. Data from 206 sites from Arctic, sub-Arctic and boreal environments were included. Redundancy analyses were performed to assess the explanatory power of mean July temperature (T-July), conductivity, pH, dissolved silica concentration, phosphate concentration, lake depth and vegetation type on diatom species composition. Boosted regression tree analyses were performed to infer the most relevant environmental variables for abundances of individual taxa and weighted average regression was applied to infer their respective optimum and tolerance. Electrical conductivity was best indicated by diatom taxa. In contrast, only few taxa were indicative of Si and water depth. Few taxa were related to specific pH values. Although T-July, explained the highest proportion of variance in the diatom spectra and was, after conductivity, the second-most selected splitting variable, we a priori decided not to present indicator taxa because of the poorly understood relationship between diatom occurrences and T-July. In total, 92 diatom taxa were reliable indicators of a certain vegetation type or a combination of several types. The high numbers of indicative species for open vegetation sites and for forested sites suggest that the principal turnover is the transition from forest-tundra to northern taiga. Overall, our results reveal that preference ranges of diatom taxa for environmental variables are mostly broad, and the use of indicator taxa for the purposes of environmental reconstruction or environmental monitoring is therefore restricted to marked rather than subtle environmental transitions.

AB  - Accurate continuous daily evapotranspiration (ET) at the field scale is crucial for allocating and managing water resources in irrigation areas, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. The authors integrated the modified perpendicular drought index (MPDI) as an indicator of water stress into surface energy balance system (SEBS) to improve ET estimation under water-limited conditions. The new approach fed with Chinese satellite HJ-1 (environmental and disaster monitoring and forecasting with a small satellite constellation) images was used to map daily ET on the desert-oasis irrigation fields in the middle of the Heihe River Basin. The outputs, including instantaneous sensible heat flux (H) and daily ET from the MPDI-integrated SEBS and the original SEBS model, were compared with the eddy covariance observations. The results indicate that the MPDI-integrated SEBS significantly improved the surface turbulent fluxes in water-limited regions, especially for sparsely vegetated areas. The new approach only uses one optical satellite data and meteorological data as inputs, providing a considerable operational improvement for ET mapping. Moreover, HJ-1 high-resolution data promised continuous daily ET at the field scale, which helps in understanding the corresponding relationships among field, crop, and water consumption. Such detailed ET information can greatly serve water resources management in the study area as well as other arid and semi-arid regions.

AB  - Oxidative stress plays a major role in critical biological processes in human reproduction. However, a reliable and biologically accurate indicator of this condition does not yet exist. On these bases, the aim of this study was to assess and compare the blood and follicular fluid (FF) redox status of 45 infertile subjects (and 45 age-matched controls) undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF), and explore possible relationships between the assessed redox parameters and IVF outcomes. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production, assessed by flow cytometry analysis in blood leukocytes and granulosa cells, significantly increased (p < 0.05) in infertile patients. Also, oxidative stress markersThioBarbituric Acid-Reactive Substances (TBARS) as an index of lipid peroxidation, and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC) to account for total antioxidant capacity, both assayed by fluorometric proceduresin blood and FF were significantly (p < 0.001) modified in infertile patients compared to the control group. Moreover, a significant correlation between blood redox markers and FF redox markers was evident. An ORAC/TBARS ratio, defined as the redox index (RI), was obtained in the plasma and FF of the patients and controls. In the patients, the plasma RI was about 3.4-fold (p < 0.0001) lower than the control, and the FF RI was about six-fold (p < 0.0001) lower than the control. Interestingly, both the plasma RI and FF RI results were significantly correlated (p < 0.05) to the considered outcome parameters (metaphase II, fertilization rate, and ongoing pregnancies). Given the reported findings, a strict monitoring of redox parameters in assisted reproductive techniques and infertility management is recommended.

AB  - Comprehensively evaluating water quality with a single method alone is challenging because water quality evaluation involves complex, uncertain, and fuzzy processes. Moreover, water quality evaluation is limited by finite water quality monitoring that can only represent water quality conditions at certain time points. Thus, the present study proposed a dynamic fuzzy matter-element model (D-FME) to comprehensively and continuously evaluate water quality status. D-FME was first constructed by introducing functional data analysis (FDA) theory into a fuzzy matter-element model and then validated using monthly water quality data for the Poyang Lake outlet (Hukou) from 2011 to 2012. Results showed that the finite water quality indicators were represented as dynamic functional curves despite missing values and irregular sampling time. The water quality rank feature curve was integrated by the D-FME model and revealed comprehensive and continuous variations in water quality. The water quality in Hukou showed remarkable seasonal variations, with the best water quality in summer and worst water quality in winter. These trends were significantly correlated with water level fluctuations (R = -0.71, p < 0.01). Moreover, the extension weight curves of key indicators indicated that total nitrogen and total phosphorus were the most important pollutants that influence the water quality of the Poyang Lake outlet. The proposed D-FME model can obtain scientific and intuitive results. Moreover, the D-FME model is not restricted to water quality evaluation and can be readily applied to other areas with similar problems.

AB  - Substantial evidence shows that physical activities of daily living are positively correlated with affective states in middle-aged and older adults. However, people's physical activity decreases when they grow older, and conditions that enhance older individuals' physical activities of daily living are not well understood.
   This study investigated need satisfaction (competence, relatedness, and autonomy) and its moderating effect on the within-subject relation between physical activities of daily living and three dimensions of affective states (valence, energetic arousal, and calmness) based on an ambulatory assessment that used activity-triggered e-diaries.
   The physical activities of daily living of 68 adults aged 50+ (mean age = 60.1 +/- 7.1) were measured objectively for three consecutive days, and need satisfaction and affective states were assessed as a function of the amount of physical activity during the preceding 10 min before the affect measurement (in activity-triggered e-diaries). Hierarchical multilevel analyses were performed.
   Need satisfaction was significantly and positively correlated with the three dimensions of affective states. Further, physical activities of daily living were significantly associated with energetic arousal and calmness, but not valence. However, when physical activities of daily living were more autonomously regulated, the association of physical activities of daily living and valence became significant and positive.
   The findings regarding the significant moderating effects of need satisfaction are crucial for interventions aiming to improve the health-enhancing effects of physical activity in adults aged 50+. Positive feelings owing to physical activities in daily living depend on the extent that psychological needs are satisfied.

AB  - City Prosperity Initiative (CPI) as a comprehensive multidimensional index agreed globally, is a broad and flexible conceptual framework for measuring and monitoring the urbanization and urbanism as a consequence of this process. This initiative is a fundamental approach for defining an integrative and incremental vision and subsequently multi-sectorial and spatial analysis based direction for its fulfilment towards the sustainability path and sustainable urban development in different hierarchical levels and scales of global, national, regional, and local. The CPI is accompanied by a conceptual matrix, the Wheel of Urban Prosperity, in terms of six key components or dimensions associated with the city and urban settlement, including Productivity, Infrastructure Development, Quality of Life, Equity and Social Inclusion, Environmental Sustainability, and Urban Governance and Legislation. Each of these aspects includes 3 to 5 subdimensions defined and measured by a group of variables or indicators. Thus, the City Prosperity Initiative Index is essential basis to found and promote a new pattern or model of urbanization in the global scale which is adaptive to the contextual conditions and dynamics. Therefore, one of the most key issues in relation to the CPI Index is the weights of the dimensions and sub-dimensions in terms of the conceptualizations of a prosperous city based on the local priorities. Accordingly, this paper has been focused on the City Prosperity Initiative Index and subsequently recalculating the weights of its dimensions and sub-dimensions using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method according to the contextual situation of Tehran Metropolis in Iran.

AB  - Maturation ponds are a type of waste stabilisation pond (WSP) designed to reduce carbon, nutrients and pathogens in the final stages of a WSP wastewater treatment system. In this study, a one-dimensional plug-flow pond model is proposed to predict temperature and E. coli concentration distributions and overall pond disinfection performance. The model accounts for the effects of vertical mixing and ultraviolet light-dependent die-off rate kinetics. Measurements of radiation, wind-speed, humidity and air temperature are recorded for model inputs and good agreement with measured vertical temperature distributions. and outlet E. colt concentrations is found in an operational, subtropical maturation pond. Measurements and the model both show a diurnal pattern of stratification during daylight hours and natural convective mixing at night on days corresponding to low wind speeds, strong heat input from solar radiation and clear night skies. In the evenings, the thermal stratification is shown to collapse due to surface energy loss via longwave radiation which triggers top-down natural convective mixing. The disinfection model is found to be sensitive to the choice of die-off kinetics. The diurnal mixing pattern is found to play a vital role in the disinfection process by ensuring that pathogens are regularly transported to the near-surface layer where ultraviolet light penetration is effective. The model proposed in this paper offers clear advantages to pond designers by including geographical specific, time-varying boundary conditions and accounting for the important physical aspects of vertical mixing and sunlight inactivation processes, yet is computationally straightforward.

AB  - Background: Physical growth of children and adolescents depends on the interaction of genetic and environmental factors e.g. diet and living conditions. Aim: We aim to discuss the influence of socioeconomic situation, using income inequality and GDP per capita as indicators, on body height, body weight and the variability of height and weight in infants and juveniles. Material and methods: We re-analyzed data from 439 growth studies on height and weight published during the last 35 years. We added year-and country-matched GDP per capita (in current US$) and the Gini coefficient for each study. The data were divided into two age groups: infants (age 2) and juveniles (age 7). We used Pearson correlation and principal component analysis to investigate the data. Results: Gini coefficient negatively correlated with body height and body weight in infants and juveniles. GDP per capita showed a positive correlation with height and weight in both age groups. In infants the standard deviation of height increases with increasing Gini coefficient. The opposite is true for juveniles. A correlation of weight variability and socioeconomic indicators is absent in infants. In juveniles the variability of weight increases with declining Gini coefficient and increasing logGDP per capita. Discussion: Poverty and income inequality are generally associated with poor growth in height and weight. The analysis of the within-population height and weight variations however, shows that the associations between wealth, income, and anthropometric parameters are very complex and cannot be explained by common wisdom. They point towards an independent regulation of height and weight.

AB  - There is a growing understanding of the biophysical processes that regulate the stability of the Earth system, yet human pressures on the planet continue to increase rapidly. Here, recent advances in defining Earth-system thresholds using the planetary boundaries framework are translated down to national and sub-national levels. A set of 10 indicators is developed in a biophysical accounting framework that links the sustainability of resource flows from the biosphere to final consumption. The indicator set includes three measures of physical stocks, three measures of aggregate resource consumption, and four indicators of sustainable scale. The four scale indicators are ratios of ( i) cumulative carbon footprint relative to carbon budget, (ii) nutrient use relative to biogeochemical boundaries, (iii) blue water consumption relative to monthly basin-level availability, and (iv) land footprint relative to biocapacity. Taken together, the indicators measure how close high-consuming societies are to meeting the conditions of a "steady-state economy", defined here as an economy with non-growing physical stocks and flows maintained within shares of planetary boundaries. The framework is applied over a 15-year period to the economies of Canada and Spain, along with two sub-national regions (Nova Scotia and Andalusia). Nova Scotia is the only study site experiencing stable or decreasing biophysical stocks and flows. None of the study sites are consuming resources within their shares of all four planetary boundaries. Overall, the set of indicators provides guidance for prioritizing which environmental pressures need to decline (and by how much) for societies to be more effective stewards of Earth-system stability.

AB  - In the performance influencing factor (PIF) hierarchy, person-based influencing factors reside in the top level along with machine-based, team-based, organization-based and situationistressor-based factors. Though person-based PlFs like morale, motivation, and attitude (MMA) play an important role in shaping performance, it is nearly impossible to assess such PIFs directly. However, it is possible to measure behavioral indicators (e.g. compliance, use of information) that can provide insight regarding the state of the unobservable person-based PIFs. One common approach to measuring these indicators is to carry out a self-reported questionnaire survey. Significant work has been done to make such questionnaires reliable, but the potential validity problem associated with any questionnaire is that the data are subjective and thus may bear a limited relationship to reality. This paper describes the use of a virtual environment to measure behavioral indicators, which in turn can be used as proxies to assess otherwise unobservable PlFs like MMA. A Bayesian Network (BN) model is first developed to define the relationship between person-based PlFs and measurable behavioral indicators. The paper then shows how these indicators can be measured using evidence collected from a virtual environment of an offshore petroleum installation. A study that focused on emergency evacuation scenarios was done with 36 participants. The participants were first assessed using a multiple choice test. They were then assessed based on their observed performance during simulated offshore emergency evacuation conditions. A comparison of the two assessments demonstrates the potential benefits and challenges of using virtual environments to assess behavioral indicators, and thus the person-based PlFs.

AB  - Optimal foraging theory predicts tradeoffs in animals balancing net energy intake and predator avoidance. In particular, overall foraging activity could be low if (1) perception of predation risk is high or (2) abiotic conditions are suboptimal. American pikas (Ochotona princeps) are small, food-hoarding mammals whose foraging opportunities are restricted by heat and risk of predation. If hiking disturbance is perceived by pikas as predation risk, it could reduce the amount of food stored overwinter, possibly affecting survival. We simulated hiker disturbance events for 48 pikas in Mount Revelstoke and Glacier National Parks, British Columbia, to estimate foraging time lost due to hikers. We tested risk avoidance hypotheses using four indicators of risk behavior: alert distance (D-A), flight initiation distance (D-F), exit delay (T-E), and delay in return to forage (T-R). All hiker disturbance events elicited antipredator behaviors in foraging pikas and reduced foraging time; however, when compared to increasing temperatures over 4-6 hour observation periods, the latter best predicted a reduction in pikas' foraging activity. For every 1 degrees C increase in temperature, pika foraging activity decreased by 3%. Pikas near trails (< 50 m) lost an average of 4.1 (SE = 0.6) minutes of foraging time per disturbance event compared to 13.2 (SE = 1.7) minutes lost by pikas with territories > 100 m away from trails. Such differences might reflect habituation in pikas undergoing frequent disturbance. Monitoring pika populations for declines would be sensible given projected trends in warming climate and potential increases in hiking traffic.

AB  - Disposal of fecally contaminated poultry litter by land application can deliver pathogens and fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) into receiving waters via runoff. While water quality is regulated by FIB enumeration, FIB testing provides inadequate information about contamination source and health risk. This microbial source tracking (MST) study compared the persistence of the Brevibacterium sp. strain LA35 16S rRNA gene (marker) for poultry litter with that of pathogens and FIB under outdoor, environmentally relevant conditions in freshwater, marine water, and sediments over 7 days. Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, Bacteroidales, and LA35 were enumerated by quantitative PCR (qPCR), and Enterococcus spp. and E. coli were quantified by culture and qPCR. Unlike the other bacteria, C. jejuni was not detectable after 48 h. Bacterial levels in the water column consistently declined over time and were highly correlated among species. Survival in sediments ranged from a slow decrease over time to growth, particularly in marine microcosms and for Bacteroidales. S. enterica also grew in marine sediments. Linear decay rates in water (k) ranged from -0.17 day(-1) for LA35 to -3.12 day(-1) for C. coli. LA35 levels correlated well with those of other bacteria in the water column but not in sediments. These observations suggest that, particularly in the water column, the fate of LA35 in aquatic environments is similar to that of FIB, C. coli, and Salmonella, supporting the hypothesis that the LA35 marker gene can be a useful tool for evaluating the impact of poultry litter on water quality and human health risk.

AB  - Bacterial blight (BB) caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is a major disease of rice in the tropics for which genetic resistance in the host plants is the only effective solution. This study aimed at identification of resistance gene combinations effective against Xoo isolates and fingerprinting of the Xoo isolates of Andaman Islands (India). Here, we report the reaction of 21 rice BB differentials possessing Xa1 to Xa21 genes individually and in different combinations to various isolates of pathogen collected from Andaman Islands. Pathological screening results of 14 isolates revealed that among individual genes tested across 2years, Xa4, Xa7 and Xa21 conferred resistance reaction across all isolates, whereas among combinations, IRBB 50 (Xa4+xa5), IRBB 52 (Xa4+Xa21) and IRBB 60 (Xa4+xa5+xa13+Xa21) conveyed effective resistance against tested isolates. The nature of genetic diversity among four isolates selected on the basis of geographical isolation in the islands was studied through DNA finger printing. The RAPD primers S111, S119, S1117, S1109, S1103, S109 and S105 were found to be better indicators of molecular diversity among isolates than JEL primers. The diversity analysis grouped 14 isolates into three major clusters based on disease reaction wherein isolate no. 8 was found the most divergent as well as highly virulent. The remaining isolates were classified into two distinct groups. The importance of the study in the context of transfer of resistance gene(s) in the local cultivars specifically for tropical island conditions is presented and discussed.

AB  - The production of marine shrimp in biofloc systems has a low environmental impact; the shrimp benefit from the maintenance of water quality and possibly utilize the system's microbial community as a food resource, which also positively affects the synthesis of digestive enzymes produced by the hepatopancreas. The aim of this study was to determine the performance, the post-larvae quality indicators and the development of the hepatopancreas and tubules of post-larvae Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei produced in a BFT system during the nursery stage. Two experiments were conducted: NI (PL1-PL15; 75 shrimps L-1) and NII (PL16-PL30; 50 shrimps L-1). Both experiments included a control treatment simulating a traditional nursery with water renewal and a biofloc treatment without water renewal but including organic fertilization with dextrose every time the ammonia nitrogen concentration exceeded 0.5 mg L-1. Daily water quality analyses were performed. The best performance and the final quality of the production were observed in the biofloc treatment of both experiments. The total area of the hepatopancreas was significantly different between treatments in experiment NI, while the thickness of the tubules was significantly different between treatments in experiment NII. In both experiments, the hepatopancreas tubules from the biofloc treatment showed increased thickness and an apparent greater amount of enzyme producing cells (B cells) than the control treatment. The results suggest that when compared to conventional production systems, the bioflocs system may provide better nutritional support, allowing for proper development of the hepatopancreas and better nutritional conditions, resulting in healthier post-larvae shrimp.

AB  - Darwin's naturalization hypothesis (DNH) proposes that colonization is less likely when the colonizing species is related to members of the invaded community, because evolutionary closeness intensifies competition among species that share similar resources. Studies that have evaluated DNH from correlational evidence have yielded controversial results with respect to its occurrence and generality. In the present study we carried out a set of manipulative experiments in which we controlled the phylogenetic relatedness of one colonizing species (Lactuca sativa) with five assemblages of plants (the recipient communities), and evaluated the colonizing success using five indicators (germination, growth, flowering, survival, and recruitment). The evolutionary relatedness was calculated as the mean phylogenetic distance between Lactuca and the members of each assemblage (MPD) and by the mean phylogenetic distance to the nearest neighbor (MNND). The results showed that the colonization success of Lactuca was not affected by MPD or MNND values, findings that do not support DNH. These results disagree with experimental studies made with communities of microorganisms, which show an inverse relation between colonization success and phylogenetic distances. We suggest that these discrepancies may be due to the high phylogenetic distance used, since in our experiments the colonizing species (Lactuca) was a distant relative of the assemblage members, while in the other studies the colonizing taxa have been related at the congeneric and conspecific levels. We suggest that under field conditions the phylogenetic distance is a weak predictor of competition, and it has a limited role in determining colonization success, contrary to prediction of the DNH. More experimental studies are needed to establish the importance of phylogenetic distance between colonizing species and invaded community on colonization success.

AB  - This paper presents a simplified test procedure of the terrestrial laser scanners (TLS) accuracy investigation by the general criteria of the ISO17123 standard. The proposed procedure covers investigation, analysis and accuracy estimation of the TLS system in the controlled environmental conditions. This procedure is mainly developed based on the model of a system calibration and network design procedures. Metrological Laboratory of the Faculty of Civil Engineering in Belgrade is customized for TLS testing. The accuracy investigation of a commercial TLS has been performed. The accuracy of the resulted point cloud, which is indirectly represented by the coordinates of the acquired control points, is determined. Beside the analysis of the residuals of the 3D spatial transformation, the analysis of the true and the measured distance differences is also performed. The results show that these two approaches give the statistically same uncertainty indicators. Precision of the target recognition and influence of the unlevelled point cloud to the TLS centering error is also analyzed. Normality tests are used to determine whether a data set is well modeled by a normal distribution or not before testing of hypothesis for the variances. By varying the number of the control and check points it is shown that increasing the number of the control points more than three well distributed is not relevant for significantly higher transformation accuracy. On the basis of the conducted spherical orientation analyzes it can be concluded that the global orientation of the error vectors follows the laser beam direction due to relatively short distances. The most important result related to investigated TLS is that this particular sensor must be used only by indirect georeferencing experiment design. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this work, a procedure for total hardness determination in drinking and natural waters, expressed by the equivalent mass concentration of CaCO3, , using an in-house complexometric titration with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid based on standardized procedure was detailed. Compliance of the procedures requirements with legislation is discussed. Validation and quality control actions were implemented, and a limit of detection of 0.6 mg L-1 was determined fulfilling the target limit of detection of 15 mg L-1 imposed by specific legislation. Measurement precision was estimated under repeatability conditions, where relative standard deviations close to 1 % were estimated, and in within-laboratory reproducibility, where relative standard uncertainties of 4 % and 0.5 % were obtained for lower and higher than 100 mg L-1, respectively. The results were considered unbiased whenever recoveries were within the range 0.90-1.10, fulfilling the target trueness value stated as 10 % of parametric value. The performance of the measurement procedure was also assessed by proficiency testing and z scores less than 2 were obtained. Measurement uncertainty was estimated by a modeling approach, using the law of propagation of uncertainty for variables not independent, and by empirical ones, such as single-laboratory validation and quality control data and proficiency testing. Measurement uncertainty computed from each model was assessed by xi score performance indicator showing a good estimated uncertainty (|xi| < 2). Finally, a way is proposed to assess the suitability of the combined uncertainty by the different models, comparing them to a target expanded measurement uncertainty within the analytical range, calculated from maximum decreed precision and trueness criteria since no target uncertainties were stated in the legislation.

AB  - An increasing number of pharmaceutical active substances are produced through biotechnological processes. For sustained and safe growth of the host organisms as well as optimal expression, purification, and formulation of the product, biotechnological manufacturing processes need optimal and robust environmental conditions, which are attained through the use of buffers, chelators, and antibiotics, beside nutrients. These ancillary substances are drained with the wastewater to a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and are released after treatment with the effluent to receiving waters. The potential risks of such substances to WWTPs and surface waters were investigated. Three common buffers (morpholinoethane sulfonic acid [MES], morpholinopropanesulfonic acid [MOPS], 1,4-piperazine (diethanesulfonic acid) [PIPES]), one chelator (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA]), and one antibiotic (gentamycin) were searched in the literature for environmental data or tested for biodegradability and inhibition of activated sludge as well as acute toxicity to algae, daphnids, and fish. Amounts of the ancillary substances used in the European biotechnological production plants of F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd in Basle (Switzerland) and Penzberg (Germany), and actual wastewater fluxes through the respective WWTP, as well as realistic dilution factors for the local receiving water, were documented. Based on this information, site-specific predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) for the WWTPs and surface waters in Basle and Penzberg were extrapolated. These PECs were compared with predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs) for the WWTP and surface waters, derived from sludge inhibition and ecotoxicity results, respectively. For all five ancillary substances investigated, all PEC/PNEC risk characterization ratios are <1, indicating no significant risk to the WWTPs or the receiving waters at both sites. Environ. Toxicol.

AB  - A valid assessment of selective aerobic degradation on organic matter (OM) and its impact on OM-based proxies is vital to produce accurate environmental reconstructions. However, most studies investigating these effects suffer from inherent environmental heterogeneities. In this study, we used surface samples collected along two meter-scale transects and one longer transect in the northeastern Arabian Sea to constrain initial OM heterogeneity, in order to evaluate selective aerobic degradation on temperature, productivity and alteration indices at the sediment-water interface. All of the studied alteration indices, the higher plant alkane index, alcohol preservation index, and diol oxidation index, demonstrated that they are sensitive indicators for changes in the oxygen regime. Several export production indices, a cholesterol-based stanol/stenol index and dinoflagellate lipid- and cyst-based ratios, showed significant (more than 20%) change only over the lateral oxygen gradients. Therefore, these compounds do not exclusively reflect surface water productivity, but are significantly altered after deposition. Two of the proxies, glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraether-based TEX86 sea surface temperature indices and indices based on phytol, phytane and pristane, did not show any trends related to oxygen. Nevertheless, unrealistic sea surface temperatures were obtained after application of the TEX86, TEX86L, and TEX86H proxies. The phytol-based ratios were likely affected by the sedimentary production of pristane. Our results demonstrate the selective impact of aerobic organic matter degradation on the lipid and palynomorph composition of surface sediments along a short lateral oxygen gradient and suggest that some of the investigated proxies may be useful tracers of changing redox conditions at the sediment-water interface.

AB  - Annual economic losses by bovine brucellosis in Latin America are estimated at 600 million American dollars (USD). In Mexico, the economic impact has not been quantified since reliable information about disease prevalence in cattle is scarce. In endemic areas the use of RB51 strain is a common practice, nevertheless the information about their efficiency is also scarce. The objective of the present study was to evaluate by clinical trial the efficiency of this vaccine in dual purpose herds naturally infected with brucellosis under tropical conditions. Vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups were integrated with 88 females each one. Reactor animals were not eliminated or separated from cattle population. A herd with an initial seroprevalence rate of 5% was selected and monitored during eighteen months post-vaccination. The vaccination efficiency shows that there were no losses with the control program and without the control program there were losses in the amount of 38,680 USD ($406,140 Mexican currency [Mex. cy]) estimating the loss per animal at 325 USD ($3,419.56 Mex. cy). The preventive program cost was 6,112 USD ($64,184 Mex. cy). The cost for maintaining non-productive reactor animals in the herd was estimated at 31,137 USD ($326,940.00 Mex. cy). The most affected parameters were fertility and milk production indicators. Benefit/cost ratio was 4.7:1 for milk production, 6.2:1 for calf sales and 6.6:1 for the combination of milk production and calf sales. It was concluded that the use of RB51 vaccine in the control program gives assurance of economic profitability.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of three alternative (ALT) rearing systems for growing pigs (outdoor: 150 m(2)/pig; straw bedding: 1.30 m(2)/pig; and hut with access to a courtyard: 1.30 m(2)/pig) compared with a conventional system (fully slatted floor: 0.65 m(2)/pig, considered as control), on pre-slaughter stress indicators in relation with meat quality. To that end, the number of skin lesions on whole carcasses, as well as blood creatine kinase (CK) activity and urine levels in cortisol and catecholamines (adrenaline and noradrenaline) were determined at slaughter. Glycolytic potential (GP) and ultimate pH of the semimembranosus muscle were also measured. The global correlation network calculated between all these parameters shows that the indicators of pre-slaughter muscle activity (plasma CK) and/or stress indicators (e.g. adrenaline) are negatively (r = -0.26, P < 0.01; r = -0.29, P < 0.05, respectively) correlated with muscle GP and positively (r = 0.17, P < 0.05; r = 0.44, P < 0.001, respectively) with meat ultimate pH. Although some traits measured were sensitive to the degree of pre-slaughter mixing, they differed across rearing systems. The differences were most pronounced for the comparison of outdoors v. slatted floor. The lower levels of plasma CK and urinary catecholamines, and the lower number of carcass skin lesions of pigs reared outdoors, were related to a lower meat ultimate pH. Thus, ALT rearing systems influence animal welfare and meat quality, by providing enriched environmental conditions to the animals.

AB  - This perspective reviews water metrics for accounting total water demand to produce bioenergy at various spatial scales. Volumes of water abstracted, consumed, and altered are estimated to assess water requirements of a bioenergy product, providing useful tools for water resource management and planning at local, regional, and global scale. Blue-water use accounting, integrated over time and space, provides the most direct measurements of the effects of bioenergy production on freshwater allocation among various end-users, and on human and ecosystem health and well-being. Measurement of total water demand for crop evapotranspiration, which includes both blue and green water, communicates vital information of how land and water productivity supports/constrains bioenergy expansion, and helps identify potential areas to increase the productivity of agriculture through improved soil and water conservation, changes in crop choice, and improved crop management. Life-cycle water use accounting provides a useful comparison of water required for production and conversion of feedstock to various forms of energy, and opportunities to improve water use efficiency throughout the supply chain. In addition, life-cycle water use may be used to account for water use avoided as a result of displacement of products by coproducts of biofuel production; though these applications must be interpreted with caution. Local or regional conditions and the objective of the analysis at hand determine which water accounting metrics are most relevant and the relative importance of water use impact compared to other impacts, such as impacts to soil quality and biodiversity.

AB  - Quantifying per capita impacts of invasive species on resident communities requires integrating regression analyses with experiments under natural conditions. Using multivariate and univariate approaches, I regressed the abundance of 105 resident species of groundcover plants and tree seedlings against the abundance and height of an invasive grass, Microstegium vimineum, within 117 plots in four mesic floodplain forests in Mississippi (USA). Microstegium vimineum was most productive (i.e., tallest and most abundant) in canopy gaps in floodplains, and a significant amount of variation in resident species composition was directly explained by canopy gaps and stand age. The relatively small (but statistically significant) percentage of variation in resident species composition (1.8%) explained by M. vimineum in the multivariate analysis was attributable to significant relationships with a few common species. Most of these were negative relationships with shady mesic forest indicators. Most positive relationships were with infrequent disturbance indicators and with species with growth phenologies that differed from that of M. vimineum. Results of field competition experiments with the three most common species to show significant relationships with M. vimineum revealed asymmetric competitive effects of M. vimineum on Chasmanthium laxum and positive responses of Quercus alba seedlings and Leersia virginica adults to the removal of M. vimineum in one growing season. Results of this study suggest that negative per capita community-level effects of M. vimineum are likely to be greater in shady forests than in open floodplain forests due to the relative paucity of vulnerable species in the latter.

AB  - Lutjanus carponotatus ranges from the Indian Ocean to northern Australia and Papua New Guinea and is an important species for both commercial and recreational fisheries. Due to its life history characteristics and fishing pressures, L carponotatus is vulnerable to overfishing and suitable management is essential. This phylogenetic and population genetic study assessed the population genetic structure of L carponotatus at seven locations in three bioregions in Western Australia (WA) using the mitochondria! DNA control region. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated no genetic differentiation among locations within (empty set(CT) = 0.051) and among bioregions (empty set(SC) = 0.026). Phylogenetic analyses indicated no geographic partitioning within WA, though two distinct lineages were found. Within these two lineages there was no significant spatial partitioning, suggesting a panmictic population that can, under current conditions, be managed as a single stock. WA and Great Barrier Reef (GBR) population genetic data were then combined to determine the broad-scale connectivity between the east and west coast of Australia. L. carponotatus from the GBR did differ significantly (F-ST = 0.64, p = < 0.001) from the WA population, indicating the two populations do not exchange any migrants and should be managed as discrete stocks. As an indicator of population resilience, genetic variability was compared among WA and GBR populations of L carponotatus and we show that the WA population has almost three times the genetic variability of the GBR population, suggesting that it will be better able to adapt to environmental change expected during the 21st century.

AB  - Purpose One of the central issues related to global changes in weather is the increasing occurrence of flood events that can result in the re-suspension of contaminated sediments in rivers. Here, we report on a proof-of-concept study combining hydraulic engineering and ecotoxicology in a new interdisciplinary approach to assess the toxicity of re-suspended polluted sediments after a simulated flood event.
   Materials and methods Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were exposed for 5 days under simulated flood conditions in an annular flume with artificial sediments that were spiked with a mixture of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) at environmentally relevant concentrations. Specifically, the objective of this study was to bridge the gap between the physical re-suspension of pollutants and resulting toxicological impacts on aquatic organisms. A suite of different molecular, biochemical and histological markers was used to test the hypothesis that re-suspension of sediments can lead to re-mobilization of PAHs and subsequently to effects on aquatic organisms.
   Results and discussion The micronucleus frequency was significantly 4.3-fold elevated after exposure. There was no significant indication of Aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling (no EROD induction or increased CYP1A protein content, only slight induction of CYP1A gene expression). Biliary metabolite concentration was the most sensitive marker of PAH exposure. Results for other biomarkers (glutathione-S-transferase, catalase and lipid peroxidation) were inconclusive.
   Conclusions In combination with chemical analyses of suspended matter, the presented approach will be used to improve understanding of the re-mobilization of pollutants from sediments in support of environmental risk assessment.

AB  - Zeolite minerals are ideal for removing ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) from animal wastes, leachates, and industrial effluents The objectives of this study were to compare NH4+ removal and kinetics among several commercially available zeolites under various conditions and determine if calorimetry could provide information regarding kinetics of NH4+ removal Ammonium sorption onto potassium (K) saturated zeolites was compared using synthetic vs natural swine effluent and with either traditional batch-shaken system or a "tea bag" approach in which zeolites were contained in a mesh sack and suspended in a solution of swine effluent Ammonium sorption was measured at four retention times using a flow-through system, and the resulting heat response was measured using isothermal calorimetry Ammonium removal was not significantly different in synthetic vs. natural swine effluent. Ammonium removal was lower in batch-sorted compared to batch-shaken systems, suggesting that diffusion between particles was rate-limiting in the former system How-through cells possessing contact times >100 s displayed greater NH4+ sorption than batch systems, suggesting that maintaining high NH4+ concentration in solution, removal of exchange products, and sufficient reaction time are critical to maximizing NH4+ removal by zeolites Within 100 s after NH4+ addition, endothermic heat responses indicated that NH4+-K+ exchange had peaked, this was followed by significant hear rate reduction for 50 mm This confirmed findings of an initial fast NH4+-K+. exchange followed by a slower one and suggests the 100-s period of rapid reaction is an indicator of the minimum flow through retention time required to optimize NH4+ sorption to zeolites used in this study

   The control group (n = 27) used standard NS (NS was prescribed when gastrointestinal (GI) events occurred; on day 1 after HSCT, the study group (n = 26) had modified NS added by glutamine dipeptide (0.57 g/kg/day). Energy demands were 35 kcal/kg/day; protein requirements were 1.5-1.7 g/kg/day. Artificial nutrition preparations were daily given through infusion pumps for 24 hours. In both groups, the criteria for NS discontinuation were natural assimilation of 60% of the required energy within 3 consecutive days or day 14 after HSCT when GI function was preserved.
   Results. The patients receiving modified NS showed reductions in the incidence and severity of mucositis (p = 0.05), a less significant decrease in the laboratory and anthropometric indicators of nutritional status (p = 0.01), and a better hospital outcome on day 100 after HSCT (p = 0.01). There were no differences in the rate and severity of acute graft-versus-host reaction (p = 0.7%) and in one-year overall survival (p = 0.7%).
   Conclusion. As compared with standard NS, modified NS enables a patient to sustain negative consequences of the conditioning regimen, HSCT in the early posttransplantation period.

AB  - Little is known about the effects of grazing on vegetation composition on the Arabian Peninsula. The aim of this study therefore was to analyse the vegetation response to environmental conditions of open woodlands along an altitudinal and a grazing gradient in the Jabal al Akhdar mountain range of Oman. The species composition, vegetation structure, grazing damage and several environmental variables were investigated for 62 samples using a nested plot design. Classification analysis and a Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA) were used to define vegetation types and to identify underlying environmental gradients. The relationship between environmental variables and diversity was analysed using correlation coefficients and a main-effects ANOVA. The plant species richness followed a unimodal distribution along the altitudinal gradient with the highest number of species at the intermediate altitudinal belt. The cluster analysis led to five vegetation groups: The Sideroxylon mascatense-Dodonaea viscosa group on grazed and the Olea europaea-Fingerhuthia africana group on ungrazed plateau sites at 2000 m a.s.l., the Ziziphus spina-christi-Nerium oleander group at wadi sites and the Moringa peregrina-Pteropyrum scoparium group at 1200 m a.s.l, and the Acacia gerrardii-Leucas inflata group at 1700 in a.s.l. The CVA indicated a clear distinction of the groups obtained by the agglomrative Cluster analysis. The landform, altitude and grazing intensity were found to be the most important variables distinguishing between clusters. overgrazing of the studied rangeland is an increasing environmental problem, whereas the plant composition at ungrazed sites pointed to a relatively fast and high regeneration potential of the local vegetation.

AB  - An Emergy assessment study of 24 bioethanol production scenarios was carried out for the comparison of bioethanol production using winter wheat grains and/or straw as feedstock and conversion technologies based on starch (1st generation) and/or lignocellulose (2nd generation). An integrated biomass utilization system (IBUS) was used for combining the two kinds of feedstock. The crop was cultivated under four combinations of Danish soil conditions (sand or sandy loam) and crop managements (organic or conventional). For each of the production processes, two scenarios, with or without recycling of residues, were considered. Material and energy flows were assessed to evaluate the bioethanol yield, the production efficiency in terms of Emergy used compared to energy produced (transformity), and the environmental load (ELR) in terms of use of non-renewable resources. These three indicators varied among the four feedstock production scenarios to the same extent as among the three different industrial production scenarios and in each case the efficiency was lower and the use of non-renewables higher for the non-recycling system. The system most efficient for production of bioethanol (lowest transformity) and with the lowest environmental load (ELR) was bioethanol produced from grains cultivated in the organic sandy loam scenario; systems with the highest transformity and ELR were bioethanol production based on straw from conventional cultivation and without recycling of residues. The IBUS concept obtained the best bioethanol production efficiency for each cultivation system but its consumption of non-renewable resources was not optimal. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The German National Assessment Catalogue for Animal Husbandry (NACAH) is a resource-based approach for a combined assessment of the effects of housing systems on the environment and on animal welfare. The effects on animal behaviour, as one aspect of animal welfare, are evaluated on the basis of indicators. They are classified according to the restriction of normal behaviour in each of the selected housing systems and then aggregated into three categories (A to C).
   In Germany, many housings are constructed with subsidies from the Farm Investment Scheme (FIS), a measure of the EU Rural Development Programme. The FIS contains numerous goals including the improvement of animal welfare. We applied and adapted the NACAH to evaluate the effect of the FIS on animal behaviour for dairy cows and fattening pigs. Information on animal housing conditions before and after the investment was gathered in a representative telephone survey carried out in 2007.
   Before the investment, dairy housing received a much better rating in the behavioural aspect of animal welfare than that for fattening pigs. In the new stables, the behavioural aspect did not change for 23% of the dairy and 48% of the pig farms, deteriorated on 3% of dairy and 40% of pig farms, and improved on 74% of dairy and 12% of pig farms.
   Major efforts are thus necessary to improve animal welfare, especially for fattening pigs. These can not be limited to improved investment support but need to involve a variety of policy measures including consumer information and labelling.

AB  - This contribution presents a simple behavioral template model for beach profile evolution which is calibrated and tested against a 6-year time series of shoreline position, derived from a coastal imaging system at the Gold Coast, Australia. From a coastal management perspective, the position of the shoreline is arguably one of the most important morphodynamic parameters to be monitored and predicted and therefore forms the focus of this paper. The template model attempts to encapsulate some of the current understanding of coastal dynamics deduced from both scientific investigations and observations. The model framework is based on a simple relaxation model, whereby the profile approaches a template exponentially with time under conditions of constant forcing. The template evolves dynamically in response to incident wave forcing such that when a threshold value of the dimensionless fall velocity (Omega = H-s/wT(p), where H-s = offshore significant wave height, T-p = peak wave period, and w = sediment fall velocity) is exceeded, the beach face erodes and flattens, and the shoreline retreats landward, forming an erosional scarp and a breakpoint bar. Conversely, when the W falls below threshold, progradation and steepening of the shoreface ensues, accompanied by the evolution of a swash bar and breakpoint step. The Gold Coast data are used to calibrate the threshold value of W (approximate to 4.0) which is close to the time series mean (3.8). Testing the calibrated model on unseen data shows that it is able to reproduce the dominant seasonal/interannual shoreline succession observed at this site and up to 77% of the detrended shoreline variability.

AB  - The Juan de Fuca eddy is a toxic "hot spot." Domoic acid (DA) was detected in the eddy during each of six cruises over a 4-yr study, although Pseudo-nitzschia abundance and toxin concentrations were highly variable. During the September 2004 eddy bloom, Pseudo-nitzschia spp. exceeded 13 X 10(6) cells L-1, and particulate DA reached 80 nmol L-1. Of the >10 species of Pseudo-nitzschia identified in this region, those coincident with the most toxic blooms are P. cf. pseudodelicatissima, P. cuspidata, P. multiseries, and P. australis. However, the presence of any particular species could not be used as an indicator of toxicity because of the high level of variability in intracellular DA in field assemblages. Pseudo-nitzschia cells were typically associated with blooms of other diatom taxa but also were coincident with blooms of euglenoids and dinoflagellates in the eddy region. Pseudo-nitzschia always comprised <17% of the total carbon biomass, thereby rendering remote sensing an unsuitable means for predicting toxigenic Pseudo-nitzschia blooms in this region. Our results support the hypothesis that the Juan de Fuca eddy region and not the nearshore zone is the primary initiation site for toxic blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia affecting the Washington coast. Although particulate DA was observed near the edges of the Columbia River plume, whether toxin can be produced in situ in plume water is not resolved. No first-order predictive relationships were found for either Pseudo-nitzschia abundance or DA concentration and environmental data from all six cruises.

AB  - A series of 34 layers of struvite (hydrous Mg-ammonium-phosphate) were deposited in laminated sediments of Kettle Lake, North Dakota, in the Northern Great Plains, USA. Sedimentologic, mineralogic and nitrogen isotopic evidence suggest that struvite was deposited during nutrient-enriched eutrophication events within a Mg-rich lacustrine environment. The struvite layers are dispersed between 4650 and 8700 cal. yr BP, with particularly high frequency between 8068 and 8700 cal. yr BP. The youngest struvite layer dates to 2734 cal. yr BP. Key features of the struvite-forming events were (a) relatively low water stage and consequent elevated water salinity associated with the dry mid Holocene, (b) disappearance of most lakes and wetlands in the region, and (c) focused, but brief, visitations by large populations of migratory waterfowl. The lack of more frequent occurrence Of struvite is ascribed to the rarity with which this combination of conditions was achieved, in combination with difficulty of preservation for this salt. N-15 isotopes in struvite (mean 7.5 1 parts per thousand) are heavy relative to N-15 in sediment and also extremely uniform over time. The isotopes are interpreted to reflect a waterfowl waste Source Without extensive NH4 volatilizaton. The timing of the struvite events does not closely correspond to century-scale mid-Holocene drought cycles inferred from oscillating aragonite concentrations, although there is a weak preferred Occurrence in the humid phase of these cycles. Thus the struvite events are ephemeral prairie features of this generally and period but tend not to occur at precisely the most and intervals.

AB  - Culex pipiens L. reared under diapause-inducing conditions (short daylength; 18 degrees C) were more cold tolerant and desiccation resistant than their nondiapausing counterparts (long daylength; 18 degrees C). Upon cold exposure (-5 degrees C), diapausing mosquitoes reared at 18 degrees C survived nearly twice as long as nondiapausing mosquitoes reared at 18 degrees C and 10 times longer than nondiapausing mosquitoes reared at 25 degrees C. Thus, rearing temperature provided partial protection against low temperature injury in nondiapausing mosquitoes, but maximum resistance to cold was attained by the diapause state. In this species, the supercooling point is not a good indicator of cold tolerance. Both diapausing and nondiapausing females had supercooling points of approximately -16 degrees C, but diapausing as well as nondiapausing females died at temperatures well above the supercooling point, suggesting that low temperature mortality was due to indirect chilling injury. Diapause also conferred greater resistance to desiccation (1.6-2-fold increase in survival) compared with the nondiapause state. The gene encoding a 70-kDa heat shock protein, hsp70, was not up-regulated (i.e., more highly expressed) as a part of the diapause program, nor was it up-regulated by desiccation stress, but it was up-regulated during recovery from cold shock. Cx. pipiens thus differs from a number of other diapausing insect species that are known to developmentally up-regulate hsp70 during diapause.

AB  - Whether or not it is related to stratospheric ozone depletion, Antarctic microalgae experience ultraviolet-B radiation (UVBR) stress in situ, leading to decreased photosynthetic performance, DNA damage, and/or altered community composition. UVBR vulnerability is known to be species specific, but may also be affected by a range of environmental growth conditions, including the light history of the cells. This study investigates the influence of acclimation to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) on the vulnerability to UVBR-induced DNA damage in Antarctic microalgae. Chaetoceros dichaeta, Pyramimonas gelidicola, Phaeocystis antarctica and Polarella glacialis were acclimated to 5 PAR levels, after which growth rate, pigment composition, malondialdehyde (MDA, a general indicator of oxidative stress) and UV-absorbing compounds were measured. Photoacclimated cultures were then exposed to a single UVBR treatment and the accumulation of UVBR-induced DNA damage was determined by the number of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs). Acclimation to increasing irradiance enhanced both the xanthophyll to chlorophyll a ratio and xanthophyll deepoxidation in all species. Increased cellular MDA levels were found at the highest irradiance in all species except P. gelidicola. Yet, growth rates were only reduced at the 2 lowest PAR levels. P. antarctica and P. glacialis showed a strong linear induction of UV-absorbing compounds at increasing PAR intensities, whereas P. gelidicola showed no induction of these compounds. The UVBR treatment induced CPDs in P. gelidicola only, and CPD levels were elevated at the highest PAR acclimation intensities. Thus, sensitivity to UVB-induced CPD accumulation was species specific, and, counterintuitively, acclimation to high PAR increased the sensitivity of P. gelidicola to UVB-induced DNA damage.

AB  - Fat content (as % of total body wet wt) of the sprat Sprattus sprattus phalericus in the Black Sea was determined annually during the peak feeding period (i.e. summer) between 1960 and 2001. Interannual variations of this characteristic were quite high (from 8.0 to 16.0%). Sprat fat content can be used as an indicator of food supply (or recent feeding history). In the Black Sea, different periods could be distinguished with respect to food supply of this species: Period I (1960 to 1964) with stable sprat fat content values of 11.2 to 13.7 %; Period II (1965 to 1972) with decreased values of 8.5 to 10.3 %; Period III (1974 to 1982) with higher values of 11.4 to 15.7 %; Period IV (1983 to 1990) when there were the highest interannual fluctuations and a decrease to 9.9 to 10.7 %; Period V (1991 to 1997) again with high fat content values of 12.2 to 14.7 %; Period VI (1998 to 2001) with stabilized fat content values of 12.0 to 12.3 %. These periods are closely related to the general situation in the Black Sea ecosystem caused by climatic changes, increased trophic competition, eutrophication and pollution. Relationships between interannual fluctuations in sprat fat content, on the one hand, and sprat biomass and phytoplankton concentration, on the other, are revealed. The features of the interannual dynamics of the Black Sea sprat fat content are similar to those (biomass and catches) of small pelagic fishes in the Mediterranean and in some other parts of the World Ocean.

AB  - Climate change may affect the dynamics of ecosystems and the goods and services they provide. To investigate the consequences of warming and drought for the goods and services provided by different shrublands in various western European countries, an assessment was carried out using results of field manipulation experiments of the CLIMOOR and VULCAN projects. Goods and services of these shrublands mainly encompass biodiversity, various forms of recreation, conservation of culturally and historically important landscapes, groundwater as a drinking water source, and carbon sequestration. Warming of dry lowland heathlands in The Netherlands and Denmark increases nutrient availability, which may lead to grass encroachment reducing biodiversity and decreasing recreational values. Drought may reduce the chances of grass encroachment but increase the chances of disturbances to heather vegetation. Similarly, warming increases and drought decreases the chances of nitrate pollution to the groundwater, which is often used as a drinking water source. Warming of the upland heathland in the UK increases its productivity, which might enable higher grazing densities leading to improved agricultural production. However, complex interactions between heather and invading species may be affected. Furthermore, nitrate production is increased, which may lead to groundwater pollution. Under drought conditions, productivity decreases and agricultural production capacity drops. in the Mediterranean shrubland in Spain, both warming and drought led to a shift in the species composition of seedlings and recruitment, which might lead to a change in the plant community and a reduction in biodiversity. In the drought treatment, a decreasing soil carbon content may lead to a loss of biodiversity, recreational possibilities, and an increased threat of wildfires and erosion.

AB  - Relationships between taxonomic composition of shallow epilithic algal communities and nine environmental variables in 32 lakes of different trophic states in Ireland were explored using gradient analysis. A canonical correspondence analysis using four representative environmental variables, alkalinity (correlated with pH and conductivity), maximum phytoplankton chl a (CHLmax) (correlated with total P, total N, and chl), turbidity, and water color explained 21% of the variance in taxa distributions. The first two axes were significant and accounted for 77% of the variance in the periphyton-environmental relationship. The first axis was strongly related to alkalinity and color, which reflected geology and land use in the watersheds. The second axis was most correlated with CHLmax, and separation of lakes corresponded to their Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) trophic classification based on water chemistry. Eutrophic lakes were characterized by cyanobacteria taxa and Stigeoclonium sp. Diatoms and desmids were generally more abundant in oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes. Values for diatom trophic indices were poor indicators of trophic state. Weighted averaging regression and calibration techniques were used to develop transfer functions between 84 taxa and total P, total N, and CHLmax. The total P inference model predicted OECD trophic classification correctly for 84% of the lakes. Values for taxa preferences resulting from such models can provide the foundation for biomonitoring schemes using extant periphyton communities. The turnover time of periphyton taxa should integrate changes in environmental conditions at a temporal scale intermediate to surface-sediment fossil diatom assemblages and water column variables, which may be more appropriate for detecting annual changes.

AB  - 1. Benthic-algal distributions in the upper Illinois River basin, IL, U.S.A., were examined in relation to geology, land use, water chemistry and stream habitat using (detrended) (canonical) correspondence analysis, autecological metrics and indicator-species analysis in order to identify the major environmental gradients influencing community variation.
   2. Ionic composition and major nutrient [i.e. nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)] concentration of surface waters, salinity (Na-Cl type), substratum type and physiognomic form of dominant species were primary factors contributing to variation in benthic-algal assemblages of the basin. Basin geology was a significant contributing factor, but the explained variance associated with this factor was less than that related to land use.
   3. Proportions of algal biomass consisting of cyanophytes, filamentous chlorophytes, halophilic diatoms and diatoms which utilize nitrogen heterotrophically were greater in eutrophic river segments than in less nutrient-enriched segments. Composition of the benthic flora indicated meso-eutrophic or eutrophic conditions throughout the basin; there were few diatoms indicative of hypertrophic waters. Shifts in diatom-assemblage structure in response to nutrient loading provided an incomplete representation of the community-response curve.
   4. A weighted-averages regression model based on total P and benthic-algal abundances tall divisions included) yielded a highly significant correlation (r(2) = 0.83) between species-inferred [WA((tol))] and observed total P, with systematic bias (increased deviation of residuals) occurring only at concentrations greater than similar to 1.0 mg L-1 total P. This result indicates that total P regression and calibration models can be predictable for a river basin receiving excessive loadings of phosphorus.

AB  - Past clearing and harvesting of the deciduous hardwood forests of eastern USA released large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, but through recovery and regrowth these forests are now accumulating atmospheric carbon (C). This study examined quantities and distribution of aboveground biomass density (AGBD, M-g ha(-1)) of US eastern hardwood forests and assessed their biological potential for continued biomass accumulation in the future. Studies have shown that the presence of a large proportion of the AGBD of moist tropical forests in large diameter trees (> 70 cm diameter) is indicative of mature and undisturbed conditions. This relationship was tested as a criterion for the eastern US deciduous forests to assess their stage of recovery and maturity, and evaluate their potential for continued C storage. The approach was to compare AGBD and its distribution in large trees for old-growth forests derived from published studies and for oak-hickory and maple-beech-birch forests using the extensive US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data base. Old-growth forests generally had AGBD of 220-260 Mg ha(-1) with up to 30% in trees with diameter > 70 cm. In contrast, maximum AGBD for the FIA units was about 175-185 Mg ha(-1) with 8%-10% in large trees. Most units, however, were below these maximum values, suggesting that the forests represented by the FIA inventory are in various stages of recovery from past disturbance. Biologically, therefore, they have the potential to accumulate significant quantities of additional biomass, if left unharvested, and thus storing atmospheric C into the future.

AB  - On the Schulterberg, at an altitude of 1640m as.l. (Achenkirch project area), investigations on mycorrhiza and fine roots were carried out at the end of the 1991 grazing season in an area used as pasture. The evaluation of 900 cylinder samples (100 mi), taken from an area of 400 m(2), showed considerable differences between small forest and pasture sites. Where there were trees the dry weight and the density of mycorrhizae and fine roots were higher. The diversity of the mycorrhizae and their vitality were those of a healthy forest in good condition. In areas used for grazing dead mycorrhizae and fine roots were frequently found. It is assumed that this damage, as well as the resulting poorer vitality, is due to the mechanic stress of the soil caused by grazing cattle or sheep. It is evident that the quantitative features which can be established in respect of mycorrhizae do not provide sufficient information to allow an evaluation of the site quality and that qualitative features must be taken into account for that purpose. No pollutant-related deformation of mycorrhizae was observed. From seed experiments, which can be used to assess natural regeneration, the following results have been obtained: The roots of 2-year old seedlings developed poorly on sites used for grazing, moderately around trees, and well or even very well, on rotting wood. The feature assessed was the length of the roots. The development of the mycorrhizae also proved to be heavily dependent on the substrate and, therefore, can be used as-a site indicator.

AB  - Purpose In the process of building the "Belt and Road" and "Bright Road" community of interests between China and Kazakhstan, this paper proposes the construction of an inland nuclear power plant in Kazakhstan. Considering the uncertainty of investment in nuclear power generation, the authors propose the MGT (Monte-Carlo and Gaussian Radial Basis with Tensor factorization) utility evaluation model to evaluate the risk of investment in nuclear power in Kazakhstan and provide a relevant reference for decision making on inland nuclear investment in Kazakhstan. Design/methodology/approach Based on real options portfolio combined with a weighted utility function, this study takes into account the uncertainties associated with nuclear power investments through a minimum variance Monte Carlo approach, proposes a noise-enhancing process combined with geometric Brownian motion in solving complex conditions, and incorporates a measure of investment flexibility and strategic value in the investment, and then uses a deep noise reduction encoder to learn the initial values for potential features of cost and investment effectiveness. A Gaussian radial basis function used to construct a weighted utility function for each uncertainty, generate a minimization of the objective function for the tensor decomposition, and then optimize the objective loss function for the tensor decomposition, find the corresponding weights, and perform noise reduction to generalize the nonlinear problem to evaluate the effectiveness of nuclear power investment. Finally, the two dimensions of cost and risk (estimation of investment value and measurement of investment risk) are applied and simulated through actual data in Kazakhstan. Findings The authors assess the core indicators of Kazakhstan's nuclear power plants throughout their construction and operating cycles, based on data relating to a cluster of nuclear power plants of 10 different technologies. The authors compared it with several popular methods for evaluating the benefits of nuclear power generation and conducted subsequent sensitivity analyses of key indicators. Experimental results on the dataset show that the MGT method outperforms the other four methods and that changes in nuclear investment returns are more sensitive to changes in costs while operating cash flows from nuclear power are certainly an effective way to drive investment reform in inland nuclear power generation in Kazakhstan at current levels of investment costs. Research limitations/implications Future research could consider exploring other excellent methods to improve the accuracy of the investment prediction further using sparseness and noise interference. Also consider collecting some expert advice and providing more appropriate specific suggestions, which will facilitate the application in practice. Practical implications The Novel Coronavirus epidemic has plunged the global economy into a deep recession, the tension between China and the US has made the energy cooperation road unusually tortuous, Kazakhstan in Central Asia has natural geographical and resource advantages, so China-Kazakhstan energy cooperation as a new era of opportunity, providing a strong guarantee for China's political and economic stability. The basic idea of building large-scale nuclear power plants in Balkhash and Aktau is put forward, considering the development strategy of building Kazakhstan into a regional international energy base. This work will be a good inspiration for the investment of nuclear generation.
   Originality/value This study solves the problem of increasing noise by combining Monte Carlo simulation with geometric Brownian motion under complex conditions, adds the measure of investment flexibility and strategic value, constructs the utility function of noise reduction weight based on Gaussian radial basis function and extends the nonlinear problem to the evaluation of nuclear power investment benefit.

AB  - During three years of testing (1988-1990) the effects of plant density (200, 400, 800 and 1200 plants/m2) and nitrogen fertilization (40 kg/ha N and 80 kg/ha N) on yield and yield physiology of linseed (Linum usitatissimum L. cv. Atalante) were tested on two locations both representing the cool humide climate of Schleswig-Holstein, Northern Germany, but differing in soil type (free draining sandy loam soil and poor sandy soil). On sandy loam soil yields were two-fold as high as on poor sandy soil. Doubling of the N-dose from 40 to 80 kg/ha N was effective in the better soil conditions, exclusively. It could be clearly demonstrated that stand establishment widely governed variation in yield. Independently of location and N-nutrition, the 400 plants/m2 M2 variant led to considerably high seed yields while narrow stands resulted in significantly lower yields. The overall highest yield (24.4 dt/ha) was established when the N-dose of 80 kg/ha was combined with 400 plants/m2. Total dry matter accumulated progressively from 49 to 63 days after field emergence (DAE). During this phase, start of the flowering period occurred. Hence, accelerated vegetative growth and reproductive development proceeded simultaneously. Increasing plant density resulted in higher rates of linear growth (LGR) and higher maximum growth rates (MGR). On the other hand, duration of linear growth rate (DLGR) decreased and day of maximum growth rate (MGRD) was reached much earlier in the same conditions. Shoot diameter was under plain control of stand density from 49 days after field emergence (DAE) to maturity. Plants from stands with extremely low competition revealed stem diameters of abt. 3.5 mm in maximum. Extremely narrow stands generated individuals not even reaching 2 mm in diameter. Increasing plant density caused a sharp decrease in net assimilation rate (NAR). This reaction was mainly controlled by competition rather than environment as no differences were proved between the two locations. NAR was measured at two stages of development, start of stem elongation and full flowering. At both stages, NAR was highest at 200 and 400 plants/m2, respectively. Chlorophyll content of leaves was assessed as an indicator of source activity for assimilate production. Pigment contents of upper and lower leaves were analysed at five sampling dates as related to stand density and N-fertilization. After relatively low levels were found at 21 DAE, chlorophyll accumulation was raised until full flowering (63 DAE) and then slowed down during the reproductive period. Low population stands and enhanced N-nutrition excelled by comparatively high chlorophyll contents and, with the exception of day 21, apical leaves were superior to basal ones. Independently of stand density, the higher N-supply resulted in higher chlorophyll contents at all stages and during the post-flowering period the loss of chlorophyll was delayed significantly on both levels of the vertical leaf canopy. As early as full flowering occurred, capsules were already formed to some extent (63 DAE). Until end of flowering capsule mass per area rose thoroughly due to initiation of capsules but also to growth of seeds and pericarps. During the post-flowering stages there was a further sharp increase caused by the most intensive period of seed filling.
   Low stand densities and the more favourable location promoted reproductive biomass. The highest harvest index (46.96 %) was attained with the lowest plant population grown on sandy loam soil. In contrast, 1200 plant/m2 adapted to poor sandy oil resulted in the overall lowest harvest index (22.63 %). Independently of location, the proportion of capsules to total biomass (% CI) was improved with low stand densities.

AB  - The subject of the study is a set of theoretical and methodological aspects of the development of organizational and economic relations that arise in the process of interaction of economic subjects while shaping the potential of territorial marketing as a factor of its socio-economic development. The purpose of the study is to substantiate the methodology for assessing the integral indicator of the territorial marketing functioning. The methodology of the presented study of marketing management in territorial units is based on the multivariate assessment of various economic entities that clearly shows the priorities and unevenness in the areas'development. Area economic entities themselves are interested in the area development and determine the direction of area development. Economic entities' direct residence and economic activity conducted by them in the area should be taken into account. This makes them serious experienced experts who are really interested in the effective and rapid development of their area. Economic entities themselves determine the measurable criteria for assessing the directions that they were originally offered. The "brainstorming" is used where the experts in the area development are involved. There is a joint process aimed at obtaining the most concrete and measurable results that actual state is assessed from 0 to 10 by the process participants based on personal observations and statistics. The evaluation of marketing results is based on the multicriteria socio-economic approach. The evaluation criteria should include the economic mechanism formation. This mechanism provides an effective interaction of market institutions and business entities in the area; selection of wholesale and retail organizational and economic forms, financial and credit and business services, as well as organizational and legal forms of trade and economic interregional ties; the markets system creation that is based on the priority provision of consumers and small owners interest; the choice of the most effective channels for goods movement, transportation, warehousing, material, financial, and information flows rationalization.
   The methodology for estimating the integral indicator of territorial marketing functioning that is presented in the work is based on the next indicators: financial stability, business activity, profitability, technical and technological stability, social sustainability, environmental sustainability that allows monitoring the functioning of the territorial marketing system. This methodology is universal since it allows evaluating areas of different industrial orientations and comparing them in order to identify the greatest functioning stability. Methodology for marketing research of areas potential is based on the system approach, complex consideration of conceptual principles of areas' marketing potential formation and development; key features of territorial marketing allow carrying out purposeful actions for the sustainable development of area marketing potential, within the framework of which the conditions of its formation are determined, and their aggregate acts as a point of growth of market marketing component of the economic potential of the territory and is the basis for constructing the model of infrastructure of the marketing potential of the territory, used to make sound and balanced management decisions; developed a methodology for assessing the integral indicator of the functioning of territorial marketing. Research conclusion: grounded methodology of research of territorial marketing potential that is based on the system approach, complex consideration of concepts of area marketing potential formation and development. The key features of territorial marketing are distinguished that allow carrying out purposeful actions for the stable development of the area marketing potential, within the framework of which the conditions for its forming are determined, and their complex serves as a point of growth of market marketing component of the area economic potential and is the basis for the creation of the infrastructure model for the area marketing potential that is used to make substantiated and balanced management decisions; a methodology for assessing the integral indicator of territorial marketing is developed.

TI  - MANAGEMENT OF YOUNG SESSILE OAK STANDS
T2  - FORSTWISSENSCHAFTLICHES CENTRALBLATT
LA  - German
AB  - The Oberforstdirektion Wurzburg (Wurzburg Regional Office of the Bavarian State Forest Service), responsible for the area in question, expresses its opinion about two publications by MOSANDL et al. (M.) concerning newly established permanent experimental plots in young sessile oak stands of the High Spessart and the Franconian Tableland. The reports need to be corrected because wrong statements are made there on important matters. In addition, they are not based on the pertinent inventory results but obviously on lump-sum, more theoretically established teaching opinions or other work which cannot be applied to the research objects. Out of this, irritations have arisen, and therefore the following has to be pointed out.
   Beginning, management with the aim to produce high-value timber (sessile oak) in this region is briefly described for the sake of general understanding, after quite often references to it  have been made. Such management is oriented, as this is known, on the natural development dynamics of the stands: establishment by seeding, resembling conditions of natural regeneration; then directing the fight for survival of the young oaks through elimination of agressive badly formed trees with selection for quality following; and finally the harvest of trees having the desired dimensions. In doing this, without sacrificing quality a considerably increased increment (compared to the old oaks) is achieved.
   In the comments to the two publications by M. the following is being dealt with: the remarkable fact that already at the beginning of the ''longterm experiment'' principal statements are made and recommendations offered which cannot vet come out of the experiment; not using relationships between growing space, branch formation, and bole quality which have been recognized as being correct; overestimating the so-called ''mortality'' in the oak sapling stand which is absolutely natural in populations with large numbers of trees that have originated from seed (experimental stands), and is also favoring the selection of the most vital ones. overestimating the H/D-ratio as indicator for stability, not considering the fact that stability problems do not play a role with sessile oak in this area; the statement that vitality be the excelling criterion in young oak stands, and that only a restricted collective consisting of ''vital'' trees has chances to survive competition. This is confronted with the fact that there is such a large area of oak stands of good quality in the region which have grown up having had large numbers of trees to begin with; the mathematical criteria for overdensity cited by M. for which there is no proof in the current experiment. Also here previously mentioned counter-examples in the region and M.'s hint that seed should be used sparingly; this does especially not apply in Lower Francinia in view of the fact that acorns are very abundant.
   Since the described experiment obviously leans very closely towards the cited investigation by Leibundgut (1976) and repeatedly reference is made to its results, the different conditions under which these sessile oak experiments are conducted in terms of site, operational structure, and objectives are pointed out.
   Concluding, it shall be emphasized that there is no prejudice against the experiment as such and that it not shall be questioned by any means, but that the long-range objective of such should be considered; and there is no uniform oak management in Central Europe; establishment and tending of oak stands can be rather diverse. However, if trials on how to manage are conducted in regions where there is very high oak quality und such is also the objective of such work, the long-term experiences available from stands on large areas cannot remain un-noticed.
   There is no doubt that objectively investigating effects of management of sessile oak, which is highly differentiated in its value, other than such proven in this region is certainly interesting. A critical review, however, is only possible after many decades of uniform experimental work that is aimed towards definite objectives.

AB  - Relevance. Currently, Russia is creating an intelligent power system with an actively-adaptive network - IES AAS (abroad - Smart Grid). The basic Smart Grid group architecture is FACTS-devices; the complexity is the multi-criterion nature of the problem. Reactive power optimization is a secondary problem of the optimal power floss, when the setting of the correct reactive power variables, such as values of voltage, transformer position stages and reactive power characteristics of compensation devices, is determined. The solution for the problems to reactive power optimization, which are not linear and discrete, using traditional optimization methods is accompanied by certain difficulties associated with the processing of data that has different nature. Therefore, at the present, an adequate method of multi -object data processing is being searched, for example, using the evolutionary optimization algorithm
   The aim of the research is to develop a mathematical method to find an optimal solution from the whole set of possible ones, which would be better than others for at least one objective. In this case, the model must perform a calculation of the power flux at the fundamental and harmonic frequency for a particular mode, with a large number of restrictions.
   Methods. The simulation modeling of the FACTS device implementation was carried out in a program called DYCSE. We used the random search algorithm, which is a variable integration method modification and allows solving convergence problems when it is applied to a very large data set. The calculation method and the results of the study of Arzola Ruiz lose As were taken as an example and the basis for developing our method. The Chebyshev method was used in the objective function. This methods allows reducing the weighted distance from the calculated value to the desired one of each indicator included in the objective function. It is obvious that a population with a high level of initial data represents the best solution to the problem and, under certain conditions, it can present even the only optimal solution. From the initial generation of potential solutions for the process that is repetitive, the new generations of solutions were derived, each time with better characteristics approaching the optimal solution of the problem. The criteria for stopping the calculation were a mixed condition the difference between the worst and the best decisions. Each experiment was performed with the initial population that has a random character, obtaining acceptable solutions about 7 % according to the estimated value.
   Results. The use of evolutionary methods in optimization allows simultaneous consideration of several independent solutions, creating a set of so-called optimally effective solution or Pareto solutions that satisfy the research objectives. In all the experiments, the effective solutions were obtained to estimate the population size about 10 % of all possible solutions. The obtained solutions can be considered effective in comparison with the calculations that could be performed with absolutely all required initial data and full-scale calculations performed.
   Conclusions. To achieve energy efficiency in industrial networks, new optimization methods that improve the technical and economic performance of networks are required. The use of the Chebyshev method, which makes it possible to reduce the weighted distance from the calculated value to the desired one of each indicator included in the objective function, was tested obtaining satisfactory results in theoretical and practical studies, It is proved that for values close to 10 % of the spectrum of all possible solutions we can obtain solutions that satisfy the search for effective solutions, and that coincide with the recommendations proposed by Arzola. The developed algorithm significantly reduces the computation time, with results convergence guarantee.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine green logistics activities using a three-axis approach (financial-economic, social and environmental activities) and how these activities affect the sustainable monetary expansion indicators for the Sultanate of Oman.
   Design/methodology/approach: This study begins by defining elements of green logistics and how this concept has evolved in recent years. This concept is analyzed after surveying previous studies on green logistics. The independent variables of green logistics are threefold: financial-economic, social and environmental, and are applied to clarify the impact on monetary expansion indicators (broad, narrow and reserve money), which are important indications for determining the economic condition of a country. This study used data published in the annual statistical report by the Central Bank of Oman as representative of the economic condition of the Sultanate of Oman during the period 2008 to 2015.
   Findings: Two variables within the environmental activities were found to be statistically significant at 1% and 5%: government support to the electricity sector (GSE) and subsidy on soft loans to the private housing sector (SSLPH). Only one variable (transport and communication (TC)) within the financial-economic activities was statistically significant at 1% and 5%, but all variables (community, social and personal (CSP) relations; cultural and religious affairs (CRA); and social security and welfare (SSW)) within the social activities were statistically significant at 1%, 5% and 10%. Finally, a multiple regression test was also performed on all the variables within the green logistics activities and all the monetary expansion indicators, and they were found to be statistically significant at 1% and 5%. The study recommends that attention should be given to financial-economic activities as a quantitative standard that contributes to developing green logistics. This would entail a diagnosis of the priorities and the existing economic and financial system that contributes to sustainable development of the country's economy. It would also be important to activate the industrial sectors by reducing operating costs and improving the quality of service provided to customers, an indicator of the social activities that conform green logistics, and to increase corporate awareness of the environmental variables and the behavior of consumers in order to establish a financial-economic system based on the concept of green logistics.
   Research limitations: The available data in the annual statistical report for Oman is limited, which limits the period and all the variables of the study.
   Practical implications: The management of companies should be adopting green logistics operations if they compare the results of the concepts considered in this study with those of their competitors in the market, in order to consolidate their position in the market. Furthermore, the concept of green logistics helps companies build an intellectual model that contributes to enhancing added value. The results of this study enhance the stability of monetary expansion indicators reflecting economic growth.
   Social implications: Green logistics plays a behavioral role in the company's and country's performance and determines the trends and attitudes for the future growth of companies, especially regarding the environmental indicators.
   Originality/value: This study aims to analyze green logistics in the financial-economic, social and environmental areas, which reflect the greatest variations, especially as they are affected by changes in global markets, particularly with respect to oil prices, the main source of revenue for the Sultanate of Oman. This is of particular interest as green logistics is one of the modern concepts that are influencing the development of corporate strategies to implement economic plans in the country. This study has also supplied a conceptual research framework to explain green logistics in preparation for many future studies that will examine its elements.

AB  - Paleoclimate at the time of deglaciation (14,000-10,000 C-14 yr B.P.) in different sectors of the Southern Ocean has followed a continuous warming trend, but also warming broken by a transitory episode, the Younger Dryas stadial event, during which on the order of a millennium, colder conditions prevailed. Evidence is from Antarctic ice cores, deep-sea cores, glacier fluctuations, and pollen and beetle records. Reasons for the apparent nonuniformity include differential sensitivity of each sector to climatic change, uneven dating control, and the variable forcing-response nature of biota used as climatic indicators. Establishing the Late Glacial paleoclimate of the Southern Ocean is of significance, as it bears on comprehending the character of deglaciation in a global context. With the object of investigating further the sequence of deglacial climatic events, pollen stratigraphic studies at Canal Beagle at the southern extremity of South America were extended westward to the vicinity of Ushuaia and Lapataia, supplementing work done previously at Caleta Robalo, Puerto Harberton, and Bahia Moat. At Ushuaia, pollen frequency and influx records of the Late Glacial, as well as the Holocene, chronologically controlled by 25 C-14-age determinations, are from four Sphagnum-Empetrum mires. Results obtained at sites dating from 12,500 to 12,000 yr B.P. show Late Glacial climatic variability. Most indicative among tundra communities of grass and dwarf shrub heath is a drop both in frequency and influx of the singular arboreal component Nothofagus at the time of the Younger Dryas, when estimated summer (January) temperature was greater than or equal to 3 degrees C lower than at present at Ushuaia. In general terms, the Late Glacial pattern is not unlike the northwestern European sequence (sensu Walker, 1995), which exhibits a Late Glacial interstadial (13,000-11,000 yr B.P.) followed by a Younger Dryas stadial (11,000-10,000 yr B.P.). Within limits of the chronology in the American sector, there is no indication, as shown by marine cores from the Southern Ocean and by Antarctic ice cores, that deglacial climatic events at higher latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere, exemplified by the Younger Dryas, lead similar events in the Northern Hemisphere. Uninterrupted warming evident in the marine and ice cores occurred after 11,600-11,500 yr B.P; at Canal Beagle, in contrast, the trend toward steadily milder climate, indicated by continuous expansion of Nothofagus frequency, followed in the early Holocene after 10,000 yr B.P. Early Holocene Nothofagus woodland containing grass and composites replaced tundra under a warmer and drier set of conditions coupled with burning. Estimated summer temperature averaged similar to 1 degrees C higher than today and annual precipitation similar to 100 mm less. Pollen influx remained generally low until about 5000 yr B.P., when the rate of Nothofagus greatly increased together with increase in the rate of Empetrum, a characteristic mire component. The implication is of late Holocene spread of both closed forest and mire, the result of greater precipitation and lower temperatures, while burning abated. Summer temperatures evidently varied within about 0.5 degrees C and precipitation by similar to 100 mm compared with the present. Renewed, albeit fluctuating, glacial activity is recorded after 5000 yr B.P. under a variable, cooler and more humid, late Holocene climatic regime. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The preweaning growth of the progeny from 2531 first-calf heifers calving on commercial properties in the south-west of Western Australia was studied over 5 years.  Animals included the progeny of Angus sires mated to Angus, Angus x Friesian, Simford, Hereford and Beef Shorthorn crossbred heifers; the progeny of Hereford sires mated to Hereford, Hereford x Friesian, and Beef Shorthorn crossbred; and those of Devon crossbred, Simford or Wokalup multibreed heifers mated inter se.  Calves were born between mid January and July of each year and date of birth, calving information and calf growth through to weaning at an average age of 230 days were recorded.  Data recorded on the calves' dams included regular liveweight and condition score assessment and the date of second calving.
   Angus-sired calves were lighter at birth than Hereford-sired calves; breed means ranged from 25.1 kg for purebred Angus to 33.2 kg for Wokalup multibreeds, with male calves weighing 1.4 kg more than females at birth.  Calf birth weight was positively and linearly related to weight of dam at the beginning of joining.
   Breed of calf, sex of calf, year of birth, day of the year born, liveweight and liveweight change of the dam at the beginning of rejoining all significantly influenced calf growth, with up to 64% of variation accounted for.  At 50 days of age, Devon crossbreds, Simfords and Wokalup multibreeds were significantly heavier than crossbred Hereford or Angus calves, and this trend persisted until weaning.  The average growth rate to 200 days of Angus calves was 0.113 kg/day slower, and Hereford calves 0.77 kg/day slower, than the average growth rate of their respective crossbred calves.  Heaviest 200-day weights were found in Devon crossbred (235 kg), Simford (221 kg) and Wokalup multibreed (219 kg) calves.  A strong seasonal influence on calf growth was detected.  Each 1 day increase in calf age in calves born between mid January and June resulted in 0.29 kg extra liveweight at 100 days and 0.68 kg extra liveweight at 200 days of age.
   Overall, the liveweight of the dam at the beginning of re-joining was positively associated with calf growth, with 0.119 kg of calf liveweight/kg dam liveweight at 100 days and 0.123 kg at 200 days.  There was less effect of dam liveweight in Herefords and Hereford x Friesians on calf growth to 200 days, but this relationship was closer in faster growing and later maturing breeds, including Angus x Friesian, Simford, and Wokalup multibreed.  The dairy crossbreeds generally lost weight at the beginning of re-joining, resulting in a negative association between this weight change and calf growth to 100 days.
   No assistance was required in 93% of calvings and the highest incidence of dystocia corresponded with the highest birth weight calves in Wokalup multibreeds.  The most common calving difficulty was an apparently slow birth where no assistance was given, resulting in a stillborn calf.  Male calves experienced 3 times the level of dystocia recorded for female calves.  There was no association detected between dystocia and dam liveweight subsequent to calving.  The study highlighted the importance of dam breed, liveweight and condition of the dam and timing of calving as important influences on the growth of progeny reared by first-calf heifers.

AB  - The quality of bank loan portfolios and the incurred credit risk loss is determined by the development of the economy of the country as well as the financial state of the debtors. With loans accounting for the largest share of the assets of Lithuanian banks, the credit risk is the main individual source of risk. With the current recession of the world economy and the respective situation in Lithuania, when the economy of the country started to recede at the end of 2008, it is obvious that in the future the processes of development of economy of Lithuania will surely be a major influence on the credit risk and results of activities of the bank system of the country, therefore evaluation of this effect under current conditions becomes critical. The importance of research of the influence of macroeconomic processes on the sorts of risks incurred by the bank sector is also proved by the abundance of theoretical research. Testing of the credit risk of the Lithuanian bank sector upon change of risk factors is carried out combining the models used in research performed by M Sorge (2004), M A. Segoviano Basurto, P. Padilla (2007) and other scientists. The research covers five phases: the first phase - modeling of macroeconomic scenarios performing an analysis of the current macroeconomic situation of the country, analyzing expert evaluations and establishing the main risk factors. During the second phase indicators describing the quality of bank loan portfolio are evaluated performing an evaluation of the current quality of loan portfolio and calculating the probability of default according to loan sectors. The third phase covers the establishment of macroeconomic indicators influencing the change of the probability of default and the net profit of banks by selecting macroeconomic indicators that can influence the change of the probability of default according to loan sectors and the net profit of banks, by eliminating the seasonal fluctuations of the selected indicators, by evaluating correlation between macroeconomic indicators and the probability of default as well as the net profit, by defining the parameters of explanatory macroeconomic variables, by employing the model of linear regression and verifying reliability. The fourth phase is the research of the influence of macroeconomic scenarios on the credit risk of the bank sector by providing a prognosis of explanatory macroeconomic variables under the formulated macroeconomic scenarios and evaluating the influence of the macroeconomic scenarios on the probability of default according to loan sectors and the net profit of banks. The research is completed with a prognosis of the reserves accumulated by banks for covering the probable losses on the basis of different scenarios: scenario 1- expensive loans, i.e. the rate of interest for loans in litas remains very high, scenario 2 dropping real estate prices. Evaluation of the credit risk of the bank sector combining the models created by M Sorge (2004) & M A. Segoviano Basurto, P. Padilla (2007) helps to raise the most relevant questions of the macroeconomic state for the current period, and the integration of the analysis of the indicators of financial stability into the critical testing of the bank system and drawing up of macroeconomic prognosis helps to form an efficient future activity strategy for the bank sector or an individual financial institution.
   The results of the research showed that in case the macroeconomics of the country develops according to scenario 2 the Lithuanian bank system would face deficit of capital for coveringthe probable losses, therefore the banks of the country should accumulate more capital in order to be able to avoid such risk in the future.

AB  - Background
   Dizziness is common among older people and is associated with a cascade of debilitating symptoms, such as reduced quality of life, depression, and falls. The multifactorial aetiology of dizziness is a major barrier to establishing a clear diagnosis and offering effective therapeutic interventions. Only a few multidisciplinary interventions of dizziness have been conducted to date, all of a pilot nature and none tailoring the intervention to the specific causes of dizziness. Here, we aimed to test the hypothesis that a multidisciplinary dizziness assessment followed by a tailored multifaceted intervention would reduce dizziness handicap and self-reported dizziness as well as enhance balance and gait in people aged 50 years and over with dizziness symptoms.
   Methods and findings
   We conducted a 6-month, single-blind, parallel-group randomized controlled trial in community-living people aged 50 years and over who reported dizziness in the past year. We excluded individuals currently receiving treatment for their dizziness, those with degenerative neurological conditions including cognitive impairment, those unable to walk 20 meters, and those identified at baseline assessment with conditions that required urgent treatment. Our team of geriatrician, vestibular neuroscientist, psychologist, exercise physiologist, study coordinator, and baseline assessor held case conferences fortnightly to discuss and recommend appropriate therapy (or therapies) for each participant, based on their multidisciplinary baseline assessments. A total of 305 men and women aged 50 to 92 years (mean [SD] age: 67.8 [8.3] years; 62% women) were randomly assigned to either usual care control; n = 151) or to a tailored, multifaceted intervention (n = 154) comprising one or more of the following: a physiotherapist-led vestibular rehabilitation programme (35% [n = 54]), an 8-week internet-based cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) (19% [n = 29]), a 6-month Otago home-based exercise programme (24% [n = 37]), and/or medical management (40% [n = 62]). We were unable to identify a cause of dizziness in 71 participants (23% of total sample). Primary outcome measures comprised dizziness burden measured with the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) score, frequency of dizziness episodes recorded with monthly calendars over the 6-month follow-up, choice-stepping reaction time (CSRT), and gait variability. Data from 274 participants (90%; 137 per group) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. At trial completion, the DHI scores in the intervention group (pre and post mean [SD]: 25.9 [19.2] and 20.4 [17.7], respectively) were significantly reduced compared with the control group (pre and post mean [SD]: 23.0 [15.8] and 21.8 [16.4]), when controlling for baseline scores (mean [95% CI] difference between groups [baseline adjusted]: -3.7 [-6.2 to -1.2]; p = 0.003). There were no significant between-group differences in dizziness episodes (relative risk [RR] [95% CI]: 0.87 [0.65 to 1.17]; p = 0.360), CSRT performance (mean [95% CI] difference between groups [baseline adjusted]: -15 [-40 to 10]; p = 0.246), and step-time variability during gait (mean [95% CI] difference between groups [baseline adjusted]: -0.001 [-0.002 to 0.001]; p = 0.497). No serious intervention-related adverse events occurred. Study limitations included the low initial dizziness severity of the participants and the only fair uptake of the falls clinic (medical management) and the CBT interventions.
   Conclusions
   A multifactorial tailored approach for treating dizziness was effective in reducing dizziness handicap in community-living people aged 50 years and older. No difference was seen on the other primary outcomes. Our findings therefore support the implementation of individualized, multifaceted evidence-based therapies to reduce self-perceived disability associated with dizziness in middle-aged and older people.

AB  - Background: Having investigated the decision making of world class elite and subelite athletes (see Parkin and Walsh, 2017; Parkin et al., 2017), here the abilities of those at the earliest stage of entry to elite sport are examined. Junior elite athletes have undergone initial national selection and are younger than athletes examined previously (mean age 13 years). Decision making under mental pressure is explored in this sample. During performance an athlete encounters a wide array of mental pressures; these include the psychological impact of errors, negative feedback, and requirements for sustained attention in a dynamic environment (Anshel and Wells, 2000; Mellalieu et al., 2009). Such factors increase the cognitive demands of the athletes, inducing distracting anxiety-related thoughts known as rumination (Beilock and Gray, 2007). Mental pressure has been shown to reduce performance of decision-making tasks where reward and loss contingencies are explicit, with a shift toward increased risk taking (Pabst et al., 2013; Starcke et al., 2011). Mental pressure has been shown to be detrimental to decision-making speed in comparison to physical stress, highlighting the importance of considering a range of different pressures encountered by athletes (Hepler, 2015).
   Objective: To investigate the influence of mental pressure on key indicators of decision making in junior elite athletes. This chapter concludes a wider project examining decision making across developmental stages in elite sport. The work further explores how psychological insights can be applied in an elite sporting environment and in particular tailored to the requirements of junior athletes.
   Methods: Seventeen junior elite athletes (10 males, mean age: 13.80 years) enrolled on a national youth athletic development program participated in the study. Performance across three categories of decision making was assessed under conditions of low and high mental pressure. Decision making under risk was measured via the Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT; Rogers et al., 1999), decision making under uncertainty via the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART; Lejuez et al., 2002), and fast reactive responses to perceptual stimuli via the Visual Search Task (Treisman, 1982). Mental pressure was induced with the addition of a concurrent verbal memory task, used to increase cognitive load and mimic the distracting effects of anxiety-related rumination.
   Results: In junior elite athletes, fast reactive responses to perceptual stimuli (on the Visual Search Task) were slower under conditions of mental pressure. For decision making under risk there was an interaction of mental pressure and gender on the amount of points gambled, under pressure there was a higher level of risk taking in male athletes compared to females. There was no influence of mental pressure on decision making under uncertainity. There were no significant correlations in the degree to which individual's responses changed under pressure across the three measures of decision making. When assessing the applicability of results based on group averages there were no junior elite athletes who showed an "average" response (within 1SD of the mean) to mental pressure across all the three decision-making tasks.
   Conclusion: Mental pressure affects decision making in a sample of junior elite athletes, with a slowing of response times, and modulations to performance of decision making under risk that have a high requirement for working memory. In relation to sport, these findings suggest that novel situations that place high cognitive demands on the athlete may be particularly influenced by mental pressure. The application of this work in junior elite athletes included the feedback of individual results and the implementation of a decision-making taxonomy.

AB  - Manganese in serum, hair and excrements of 2,720 dairy cows was determined under the practical conditions of animal husbandry. Mn content in the above-mentioned materials indicated the state of sufficient supply in 1,480 dairy cows and Mn deficiency in 1,240 dairy cows. The results of Mn content in the followed materials obtained from dairy cows in a different state of organism supplying are presented in Tabs. I - III. Sufficiently supplied dairy cows (Tab. I, Ist group) displayed a significantly higher (P < 0.01) content of Mn in serum equal to 0.042 mg/l with 95 % interval of reliability, of the mean value (95 % IR) 0.039 - 0.046 mg/l compared with the pooled group of deficient dairy cows (K) with the content of Mn in serum 0.037 mg/l and 95 % IR in the range of 0.034 - 0.040 mg/l of serum.
   Mn content in hair (Tab. II) of sufficiently supplied dairy cows (Ist group) exceeds the limit value 7.0 mg/kg DM as for both the mean value and the 95 % IR. The content of this element in dairy cows in the state of primary and secondary deficiency (groups II and IV) lies below the limit value within the range. The IIIrd group of dairy cows, which was in the state of depletion, contained Mn above the limit value. The dynamic process of deficiency development is in progress in this group of dairy cows, indicated by a reduced content in serum and excrements and for time being a still sufficient content in hair which is expected to decline with time and further growth and eventually lead to primary deficiency.  Mn content in hair of sufficiently supplied dairy cows (Ist group) was significantly higher (P < 0.01), reaching the value 17.17 mg/kg DM and the range of 95 % IR 15.17 - 19.17 mg/kg DM, in comparison with dairy cows in different states of Mn deficiency (IInd, IIIrd and IVth group) in which the mean values varied in the range 5.09 - 13.28 mg/kg DM and 95 % IR ranged from 4.74 to 14.51 mg/kg DM. Differences in Mn content in hair between the deficient groups were statistically significant.
   Mn content in excrements (Tab. III) of sufficiently supplied dairy cows (Ist group) amounted to 312.6 mg/kg DM with 95 % IR in the range 287.8 - 337.4 mg/kg DM. This content was significantly higher (P < 0.01) in comparison with Mn deficient dairy cows (IInd, IIIrd and IVth group) in which the mean values varied in the range 126.7 - 230.7 mg/kg DM and 95 % IR ranged from 118.9 to 251.6 mg/kg DM.  Differences in Mn content between the deficient groups of dairy cows were also significant. The results indicate a marked difference in Mn content in excrements with regard to the state of supplying of dairy cows. Manganese content in dairy cows in the state of sufficient supply exceeded the limit value 265.0 mg/kg DM, and in cows in different deficiency states Mn content below limiting value was recorded. Our results confirmed that the content of Mn in excrements can serve as a reliable indicator of Mn supplied by feed and indirectly of the state of its supplies to the organism.
   The results indicate the occurrence of Mn deficiency in dairy cows under practical conditions. Out of the total number of examined dairy cows, 46 % were in the deficiency state. Our results confirm that the content of manganese in serum, hair and excrements reflect the state of manganese supply to the dairy cow organism.  In order to evaluate correctly the state of organism supply in dairy cows or to diagnose the manganese deficiency, one must consider all three indicator materials simultaneously.

AB  - Starting from the fact that stand structure is significantly disturbed and from the assumption that all stands of pedunculate oak at forest level older than 100 years are potentially considered for stand regeneration, it is obvious that forest planning and management have to define their priorities on the basis of which individual, potentially mature and mature stands, will be regenerated. The general objective of this paper is to research the structure and mutual impacts of stand, site and economic factors on the elements of stand structure in a greater area of pedunculate oak forests consisting of old or potentially mature pedunculate oak stands with a disturbed structure. Based on obtained structural relations, the goal was to determine by modeling the easily obtainable elements of the variable (model), which will represent the objective criterion for stand ranking according to the regeneration priority and structural and economic requirements.
   The subject of the research are pedunculate oak forests in the Central Posavina region, where 37 stands, with stocking of less than 0.8, were randomly selected and divided into 3 age groups (101-120 years, 121-135 years, > 135 years) in 16 management units.
   On a total of 146 established plots of 25 m radius, estimates and measurements were carried out of variables at the level of individual model trees (6 trees of the main species upper storey layer nearest to the plot centre) and of stand and site variables (2 breast-height diameters, crown diameter, tree height, base height of the crown and height of the widest part of the crown, varietal trunk structure, crown defoliation, increment core, breast-height diameter of all trees higher than 1.3 m, seedlings, potential intermediate cutting, died trees, diameters of stump of cut trees, shrub layer, microrelief, canopy, health status, litter, understorey vegetation). The estimated and measured data were processed and appropriate variables for data analysis derived. The complex potential revenue (rent) difference was defined for stand regeneration (Equation 3) as a dependent variable and objective criterion for stand ranking according to regeneration priority. By means of partial linear analyses, multivariate analysis and modeling (generalized linear modeling), mutual and complex impacts of stand, site and economic factors on elements of stand structure and potential revenue (rent) difference were investigated. Statistical analyses were performed by application of the SAS software package, whereas descriptive statistics, correlation analyses, integration of functions and development of graphical presentations were carried out by means of the STATISTICA 8.2 software package.
   The research included different management, stand and structural characteristics (Table 1) and determined a statistically significant mutual impact of individual variables of stand, site and economic factors on certain elements of stand structure and potential revenue (rent) difference (Table 2). Multivariate analysis revealed models of complex impacts of stand, site and economic factors on standing volume of pedunculate oak and revenue (rent) difference (Table 3). According to the obtained data, all three models are statistically significant for the estimated standing volume of pedunculate oak and also for the estimated revenue (rent) difference. The stand factors in total account for 35% variability of standing volume of pedunculate oak and for 22% variability of revenue (rent) difference. The site factors account for 39% variability of standing volume of pedunculate oak and for 34% variability of revenue (rent) difference, whereas economic factors account for even 45% variability of standing volume of pedunculate oak and for 43% variability of revenue (rent) difference. The results of the Tukey post hoc (HSD) test for statistically significant variables of multivariate analysis of the revenue (rent) difference and the standing volume of pedunculate oak (Table 4) indicate that there exists a relation between the standing volume of pedunculate oak as a complex structure element and the potential revenue (rent) difference. The results proved the existence of a direct impact of individual elements of main tree species as well as a complex impact of structure elements on the variable of potential revenue (rent) difference (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2).
   The standing volume of pedunculate oak as a complex structure element is a suitable dependent variable, along with the revenue (rent) difference, for comparative analysis of impacts of statistically significant stand, site and economic factors on stand regeneration priority. Due to a significantly smaller standing volume of pedunculate oak as a consequence of its disturbed structure, there is a higher regeneration priority for the youngest stand group (100 to 119 years) in comparison with the older stands. Accordingly, in forests with disturbed structure age cannot be an objective criterion for planning stand regeneration. Stands with disturbed canopy of understorey layer with the smallest and lowest value of standing volume expectedly have the highest regeneration priority, i.e. their maintenance would lead to both economic losses and disturbed site conditions. In view of site preservation, the problem is particularly marked in case of pure stands, where pedunculate oak trees do not cover the soil in a sufficient measure, and have a worsening tendency due to weakening and dying of trees. According to the obtained results, which indicate that there is a relation between site and standing volume of pedunculate oak and revenue (rent) difference, stands with better site have lower regeneration priority. This is related to the fact that stand structure on a higher quality site is characterized by a lower number of pedunculate oak trees of larger dimensions and potentially large value increase, which is also characteristic of forest communities of pedunculate oak and common hornbeam. On average, a smaller standing volume of pedunculate oak in a floodplain pedunculate oak forest and a higher regeneration priority indicate disturbed structure conditions. Due to hydro-ameliorative works, this community has suffered even greater site changes and is more in danger of dieback, so regeneration will be more difficult and expectably less successful in case of stands with disturbed site and structure conditions, both at early and delayed regeneration. Regarding the proportional relation between the quantity of prescribed cut and the standing volume of pedunculate oak, stands with better structure and higher prescribed intermediate cut are expected to have a lower regeneration priority. A prescribed cut below 15 m(3)/ha (50% sampled plots) indicates a significant share of preserved stands left to natural development, with necessary felling of only weak and dying trees by the beginning of regeneration or recovery. The stand structure characteristics according to their belonging to individual management units are more a consequence of spatial differences in site and structure conditions than a management characteristic. Thus we can separate 3 management units in the centre of the Lonjsko polje floodplain (Zutica, Kutina flood plain forests and Brezovica), where dieback of pedunculate oak was the highest and which have a more marked stand regeneration priority in comparison to the management units with a more preserved structure of old stands (Trstika, Josip Kozarac). The impact of individual structure elements of pedunculate oak, unlike the rent, has a high correlation, with the exception of numbers of pedunculate oak trees. This can be explained by the fact that the same number of pedunculate oak trees can represent very different structural relations in terms of average dimensions of pedunculate oak trees, basal area and standing volume of pedunculate oak as well as different rate of other tree species in the structure.
   A particular significnce with regards to the application of the results can be seen in the fact that easily obtainable structural elements, such as pedunculate oak basal area, number of pedunculate oak trees and diameter increment of pedunculate oak, proved to be very good indicators, which can explain nearly 70% variability of the complex impact on the revenue (rent) difference.
   The obtained research results prove the existence of a direct relation between stand structure and regeneration priority. There is, therefore, a practical possibility to apply the established complex variable of revenue (rent) difference for ranking of stands or stand parts (stand dividing) according to regeneration priority, which can be determined by means of easily obtainable elements of structure (tree numbers, basal area and diameter increment of pedunculate oak). An extension of the research into site-structure relations to include a greater, or even the entire area of pedunculate oak forests in Croatia as well as spatial and multiobjective forest management criteria (spatial distribution and area of stands for regeneration, habitat requirements) for stand regeneration planning would be a welcome continuation of this work.

AB  - Goal, Scope and Background. During the last decades, a technique for assessing atmospheric deposition of heavy elements was developed based on the principle that samples of moss are able to accumulate elements and airborne particles from rain, melting snow and dry deposition. Despite a broad interest in bioindication there are still ongoing works aimed at the preparation of a standard procedure allowing for a comparison of research carried out in various areas. This is why the comparison of living and dry moss of the same species and growth site seems to be interesting, logical and promising. A most reliable approach seems to be the application of bioindication connected with multivariate statistics and efficient visualization techniques in the interpretation of monitoring data. The aim of this study was: (i) to present cumulative properties of transplanted Sphagnum palustre moss with differentiation into dry and living biomaterial; (ii) to determine and geographically locate types of pollution sources responsible for a structure of the monitoring data set; (iii) to visualize geographical distribution of analytes in the Gdansk metropolitan area and to identify the high-risk areas which can be targeted for environmental hazards and public health.
   Materials and Methods. A six month air pollution study based on Sphagnum palustre bioindication is presented and a simplified procedure of the experiment is given. The study area was located at the mouth of the Vistula River on the Baltic Sea, in Gdansk City (Poland). Sphagnum palustre was selected for research because of its extraordinary morphological properties and its ease in being raised. The capability of dry and living moss to accumulate elements characteristic for anthropogenic and natural sources was shown by application of Principal Component Analysis. The high-risk areas and pollution profiles are detected and visualized using surface maps based on Kriging algorithm.
   Results. The original selection of elements included all those that could be reliably determined by Neutron Activation Analysis in moss samples. Elimination of variables covered the elements whose concentrations in moss were lower than the reported detection limits for INAA for most observations or in cases where particular elements did not show any variation. Eighteen elements: Na, Ca, Sc, Fe, Co, Zn, As, Br, Mo, Sb, Ba, La, Ce, Sm, Yb, Lu, Hf, Th, were selected for the research presented.
   Discussion. Two runs of PCA were performed since, in the first-run a heavy polluted location (Stogi - 'Sto') understood as outlier in the term of PCA approach was detected and results in the form of block diagrams and surface maps were presented. As ensues from the first-run PCA analysis, the factor layout for both indicators is similar but not identical due to the differences in the elements accumulation mechanism. Three latent factors ('phosphatic fertilizer plant impact', 'urban impact' and 'marine impact') explain over 89% and 82% of the total variance for dry and living moss respectively. In the second-run PCA three latent factors are responsible for the data structure in both moss materials. However, in the case of dry moss analysis these factors explain 85% of the total variance but they are rather hard to interpret. On the other hand living moss shows the same pattern as in first-run PCA. Three latent factors explain over 84% of the total variance in this case. The pollution profiles extracted in PCA of dry moss data differ tremendously between both runs, while no deterioration was found after removal of Stogi from data set in case of living moss. Performance of the second-run PCA with exception of Stogi as a heavy polluted location has led to the conclusion that living moss shows better indication properties than dry one.
   Conclusions. While using moss as wet and dry deposition sampler it is not possible to calculate deposition values since the real volume of collected water and dust is hard to estimate due to a splash effect and irregular surface. Therefore, accumulation values seam to be reasonable for moss-based air pollution surveys. Both biomaterials: dry and living Sphagnum palustre show cumulative properties relative to elements under interest. Dry moss has a very loose collection of the atmospheric particles, which can also easily get lost upon rinsing with rainwater running through exposed dry moss material. The living moss may, on the contrary, incorporate the elements in its tissue, thus being less susceptible to rinsing and thus better reflecting the atmospheric conditions. Despite the differences in element uptake and uphold capabilities dry and living moss reflect characteristic anthropogenic and natural profiles. Visible differences in impacts' map coverage exist mostly due to the accumulation mechanisms differentiating dry from living moss. However, in case of each indicator 'phosphatic fertilizer plant impact' is recognized as the strongest pollution source present in examined region.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. General types of pollution sources responsible for a structure of monitoring data set were determined as high-risk/low-risk areas and visualized in form of geographic distribution maps. These locations can be targeted for environmental hazards and public health. Chemometric results in the form of easy defined surface maps can became a powerful instrument in hands of decision-makers working in the field of sustainable development implementation.

To improve the technical performance of lubricants, and to reduce friction and wear, the use of additives is nowadays obligatory. The collaborative research center SFB 442 aims at developing environmentally acceptable lubricants that facilitate the avoidance of these additives by transferring their function to suitable coatings. For a complete assessment of the ecological performance of these newly developed lubricants, the whole life cycle including production, application as well as disposal and fate in the environment is studied. In the following study the focus was on the application and its influence on the environmental behavior of the lubricant. The application of lubricants leads, among other things, to the intake of metals due to abrasion from tools, work pieces or mechanical components. Previous examinations indicated a possible influence of metals on the toxicity of eluates prepared from used lubricants (Erlenkaemper et al. 2005). To clarify if the apparent toxicity of used lubricants solely results from the intake of metals, the extractability of these metals from the oil matrix is determined. By combining chemical analyses with bioassays, the bioavailability of metals that are present in the extract is estimated. To further investigate the relevance of metals on toxicity, toxic units (TU) were calculated and related to the results of the bioassays. Interactions between the metals were investigated with aqueous mixtures of metal chlorides and calculations based on the concept of concentration addition and independent action.
   Methods. A lubricant mixture was applied to a tribological test bench that simulates real conditions of use and extremely short time load, respectively. Samples were taken at particular times, water soluble fractions (WSF) of these fluids were prepared and dilution series were investigated in several bioassays. Concentration of metals and total organic carbon (TOC) were determined in the eluates. TUs were calculated according to Sprague (1970) and mixture toxicity was calculated according to the concept of concentration addition (Loewe and Muischnek 1926) and independent action (Bliss 1939).
   Results. Analyses of the metal content of the lubricant and the eluates clearly revealed the availability of the metals in the aqueous extracts. Especially copper, zinc, nickel and chromium were found and their concentrations increased during the time of use. The water extractable fraction, e.g., of copper, rose from 8.8% to 45.3% of the total content in the lubricant after 33.5 hours of use. Tests performed with the algal growth inhibition assay and the luminescence inhibition assay revealed the uptake or absorption by the organisms and, thus, the bioavailability of the metals. The calculation of TUs partly indicated a possible influence of the metals on ecotoxicity of the eluates. Copper reached concentrations equal to or higher than the EC50 Value of copper chloride in the growth inhibition assays with algae and Ps. putida as well in the immobilization assay with daphnids. TUs for copper are also larger than 1 for the algal growth inhibition assay. The EL50 values indicated that the luminescence inhibition assay was the most sensitive test system, with values between 4.7% and 9.6%. While the toxicity towards algae and V. fischeri in the growth inhibition assay decreased until both organisms were no longer influenced by the exposure, the EL50 values for the D. magna immobilization assay and the Ps. putida growth inhibition assay decreased with the progressing use of the lubricant. The tested metal salt mixtures showed that Ps. putida, algae and daphnids are the most sensitive organisms with EC50 values below 1 mg/l.
   Discussion. Although the intake of metals mainly occurred via abrasion of particles, the results revealed the availability of these metals in water. The availability varied for each of the four metals. For both the algal growth inhibition assay and the luminescence inhibition assay, an uptake or absorption of the metals could be demonstrated. The calculated TUs indicated an effect in some bioassays that was not verified in the test itself. The influence of copper on V. fischeri, for example, was not confirmed while the EL50 values for the daphnid bioassay decreased, meaning that the eluates became more toxic with progressing use of the lubricant. The calculations of mixture toxicity based on the concept of concentration addition demonstrated good correlations with the tested metal mixtures, but also a different sensitivity of the organisms.
   Conclusions. The results presented here reveal the availability of those metals in water that were taken in during the use of the lubricant in a tribological test bench and, thus, have the possibility of interacting with the organisms. The availability of the metals in the bioassays was proven by chemical analyses. The calculation of TUs and the corresponding EL50 values, however, indicate different availabilities of the metals. The results of the metal salt mixtures show good correlations with calculations of mixture toxicity based on concentration addition. Moreover, the varying sensitivity of the organisms when exposed to eluates or metal mixtures indicates a different bioavailability of the metals and/or the presence of other compounds that exert toxic action.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. For further investigations, the organic oil matrix and its influence on the toxicity have to be taken into account. The toxicity of the eluates may not only be due to metals; additional effects could arise from changes in the lubricant itself.

AB  - Introduction Dissociative disorders are characterized by impaired conscious integration functions, personal identity, memory and environment perception. Their frequent psychopathological manifestations are amnesia, depersonalization, fugue states, extra sensorial experiences, trance states and total personality changes.
   They usually appear under different life stressors, and their clinical course is highly variable. Prevalence estimates give figures ranging from 5 to 10% among general population, and reach 10.2 to 41.4% among psychiatric populations. This wide variation is one of the indicators of the complexity of this diagnostic entities and of its difficulty to be studied. Culture is a key factor in functionality of subjects with a dissociative disorder, because the acceptance of many of its clinical features varies.
   It is accepted that these diagnostic categories are barely-recognized, not only by general physicians, but by experienced mental health specialists.
   The original Structured Diagnostic Interviews (SCID, CIDI, SADS, SCAN), did not include them in their widely distributed packages, and many of them decided to create a separate appendix to address them. Unfortunately, structured interviews face an important limitation as there is a lack of trained, and some times, experienced psychopathologist, a fact that difficults to use them in large samples.
   Self-report instruments, when they show good reliability and validity, are of great value in terms of time, costs and feasibility. Their major limitation is the low reliability that they show in psychiatric conditions in which lack of insight is present (psychotic disorders).
   To evaluate the psychometric properties of translated versions of instruments is highly desirable. This is specially important when elusive disorders are being evaluated.
   Given that the cultural environment of Mexico is surrounded by several factors that influence this kind of disorders, the availability of reproducible research instruments is of outmost relevance. Therefore, the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES) -the most widely used measure in this field- in contrast with the Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule (DDIS), was evaluated, with the purpose to give a first approach to a 12 month prevalence of some Dissociative disorders in Mexican psychiatric patients.
   Methods Subjects: A non-random, consecutive sample of male and female patients, between 18 and 63 years old were included. They were receiving treatment, regardless of the diagnosis, at the Institute of Mental Health of Jalisco, from the State's Ministry of the Health in Mexico. The ethics committee authorized the study, and they all gave informed consent.
   Translation: The Spanish version of the DES, has a Spanish translation, and a Mexican Spanish idiomatic adaptation was performed by consensus. The DDIS was translated by one bilingual psychiatrist, and independently reviewed by another. Consensus was reached in controverted items. Once a final translated version was obtained, it was given to 10 subjects (mainly with primary school level), to assess item understanding. A second review was performed to reach a culturally compatible version, concentrating in respecting item content validity. Back translation was not considered, because this method does not capture common language of low school population, which is the case of most Mexicans.
   Measures Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES): This is a 28 items, self-report scale, designed to evaluate different kinds and severity of Dissociative conditions, in a 0 to 100 range. Most populations without a psychiatric condition or with a non-Dissociative disorder, scored under 20. A cut-off point of 30, usually indicates the possibility of a Dissociative disorder diagnosis. Given that a Spanish version of the DES is available from Spain, only an idiomatic adaptation to Mexican Spanish was performed (changes in slang or word content differences between countries).
   Dissociative Disorder Interview Scale (DDIS): This is a structured diagnostic interview, of 132 yes/no items, designed to assess the presence of DSM-IV Dissociative disorders entities. It is to be applied by mental health professionals, properly trained on its use. It does not give a total score, it assesses each disorder independently, As previous studies performed in different languages, it has adequate psychometric properties, and is the usual golden standard for Dissociative categories. Previous reports on DDIS correlation with DES have shown variations between disorders, with Kappa values for Identity Dissociative Disorder ranging 0.68 to 0.95.
   Procedures A 4 h year general psychiatry residency doctor was trained in the DDTS, and, after obtaining the patient's consent, applied the DDIS interview, and then gave the patient the DES to be completed. Demographic and clinical variables were obtained, as well as the diagnosis assigned in the patient chart. To analyze results two procedures were planned: 1) compare DES total score punctuation between positive and negative presence of Dissociative disorders according with the DDIS and 2)compare between patients with a Dissociative disorder with or without concomitant major depression.
   Results A total of 100 subjects were included, 63% female, with a mean age of 32.4 12.5 (range 18 - 63) years old. The DES internal consistency index was 0.96. Patients with a Dissociative Disorder (according to the DDIS), shoved clinically and significantly higher DES values than non-Dissociative patients (34.7 +/- 24.8 n = 38 vs. 10.7 +/- 9.6 n = 62; T -6.8, d.f. 98, p < 0.001).
   Frequency of Dissociative disorders and symptoms: Mean DES total score was 19.8 +/- 20.6. According to DDIS criteria, 38 subjects fulfilled DSM IV diagnostic criteria for a Dissociative disorder: Dissociative identity disorder 24, Depersonalization Disorder 6, psychogenic fugue 3. The most common concomitant diagnosis as assessed in the patient chart was unipolar major depression (17 44.7%. When a Dissociative disorder was comorbid with major depression, comparing it with Dissociative disorders only, the difference was greater (34.7 +/- 24.2 n = 38, 9.3 +/- 8.55, T 6.3, d.f. 80, P < 000.1.
   Discussion Dissociative disorder measurements evaluated, seem to work adequarely in Mexican population. Prevalence of dissociative disorders found in this psychiatric population, is consistent with other studies. Further research in the field is needed, to evaluate the influence of cultural factors, including rural and indigenous samples.

AB  - In this work, the potential for using olive-mill solid waste as an organic amendment for biochemical and biological restoration of a trichloroethylene-contaminated soil, which has previously been stabilized through vermicomposting processes, has been explored.
   Trichloroethylene-contaminated water was pumped into soil columns with a layer of vermicompost at 10-cm depth (biobarrier system). The impacts of the trichloroethylene on the microbial community were evaluated by determining: (1) the overall microbial activity (estimated as dehydrogenase activity) and enzyme activities related to the main nutrient cycles (beta-glucosidase, o-diphenoloxidase, phosphatase, urease, and arylsulphatase activities). In addition, isoelectric focusing of the soil extracellular humic-beta-glucosidase complexes was performed to study the enzymatically active humic matter related to the soil carbon cycle. (2) The soil bacterial diversity and the molecular mechanisms for the bacterial resistance to organic solvents were also determined. For this, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was used to detect changes in bacterial community structure and PCR-single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) was developed and optimised for detection and discrimination of the resistance-nodulation-division (RND) genes amplified from the contaminated soils.
   Vermicompost reduced, with respect to the unamended soil, about 30% of the trichloroethylene leaching during the first month of the experiment. Trichloroethylene had a marked negative effect on soil dehydrogenase, beta-glucosidase, urease, phosphatase, and arylsulphatase activities. Nevertheless, the vermicompost tended to avoid this toxic effect. Vermicompost also displays stable humic-beta-glucosidase complexes that increased the extracellular activity related to C-cycle in the contaminated soils. The isoelectric focusing technique showed a more biochemically active humic matter in the soil sampled under the vermicompost. The behaviour of the three main phyla of bacteria isolated from the DGGE bands was quite different. Bands corresponding to Actinobacteria disappeared, whereas those affiliated with Proteobacteria remained after the trichloroethylene contamination. The disappeared Actinobacteria became visible in the soil amended with the vermicompost. Bands corresponding to Bacteriodetes appeared only in columns of contaminated soils. In this study, six types of RND proteins were detected by PCR-SSCP in the natural soil, three in the trichloroethylene-contaminated soil and 7/5 in trichloroethylene-contaminated soil above/below the vermicompost in the biobarrier columns. Trichloroethylene tended to reduce or eliminate all the clones detected in the uncontaminated soil, whereas new efflux pumps appeared in the biobarrier columns.
   Although enzymes incorporated into the humic substances of vermicomposted olive wastes are quite stable, trichloroethylene also inhibited the background levels of the soil extracellular beta-glucosidase activity in the amended soils. The decrease was less severe in the biobarrier system, but in any case, no relation was found between the levels of trichloroethylene in soil and extracellular beta-glucosidase activity, or between the latter and the quantity of humic carbon in soils. The isoelectric focusing technique was carried out in the humic fraction to determine whether the loss of activity occurred in overall extracellular beta-glucosidase or in that linked to stable humic substances (humic-enzyme complexes). The contaminated soils showed the lower enzyme activities, whereas contaminated and amended soils presented greater quantity of focalised (and therefore stable) humic carbon and spectra heterogeneity: very different bands with higher enzyme activities. No clear relationship between trichloroethylene concentration in soil and diversity of the bacterial population was noted. Similar patterns could be found when the community structures of bacteria and microbial activity were considered. Since the use of the dehydrogenase assay has been recognised as a useful indicator of the overall measure of the intensity of microbial metabolism, these results could be attributed to PCR-DGGE methodology, since the method reveals the presence of dominant populations regardless of their metabolic state. Trichloroethylene maintained or even increased the number of clones with the DNA encoding for RND proteins, except for the contaminated soil located above the vermicompost. However, the main effect of trichloroethylene was to modify the structure of the community in contaminated soils, considering the type of efflux pumps encoded by the DNA extracted from soil bacteria.
   Trichloroethylene inhibited specific functions in soil and had a clear influence on the structure of the autochthonous bacterial community. The organic matter released by the vermicomposted olive waste tended to avoid the toxic effect of the contaminant. Trichloroethylene also inhibited the background levels of the soil extracellular beta-glucosidase activity, even when vermicompost was present. In this case, the effect of the vermicompost was to provide and/or to stimulate the humic-beta-glucosidase complexes located in the soil humic fraction > 10(4), increasing the resistance of the enzyme to the inhibition. The bacterial community from the soil presented significantly different mechanisms to resistance to solvents (RND proteins) under trichloroethylene conditions. The effect of the vermicompost was to induce these mechanisms in the autochthonous bacterial community and/or incorporated new bacterial species, able to grow in a trichloroethylene-contaminated ambient. Coupled biochemical and molecular methodologies are therefore helpful approaches in assessing the effect of an organic amendment on the biochemical and biological restoration of a trichloroethylene-contaminated soil.
   Since the main biochemical and biological effects of the organic amendment on the contaminated soil seem to be the incorporation of biochemically active humic matter, as well as new bacterial species able to grow in a trichloroethylene-contaminated ambient, isoelectric focusing and PCR-SSCP methodologies should be considered as parts of an integrated approach to determine the success of a restoration scheme.

AB  - This article presents the results of combined osteological and archival research into the demographics, preservation condition, taphonomy, pathology, cultural modification, and collecting history of that specific portion of the Parkinson collection of human crania from New Britain, collected c. 1897, currently housed in the Etnografiska Museet (Ethnography Museum), Stockholm, Sweden. This assemblage of crania (n = 45) was acquired by Richard Heinrich Robert Parkinson (1844-1909), a Danish explorer and anthropologist initially in the employ of the Hamburg based J. C Goddefroy & Sohn in Samoa trading firm. In 1897, after independently settling on the Gazelle Peninsula of New Britain with his family and beginning to make collecting trips to local communities and those on neighboring islands, this collection of crania eventually came to reside at its present location. This article provides the first in-depth analysis of the osteology of this collection contextualized within what is known and knowable about its ownership history and movement between collection and arrival in Stockholm. This includes translation of previously untranslateded correspondence from the original German that provide heretofore undisclosed information about Parkinson's collecting activities. Osteological analysis includes age and sex estimation, taphonomic modification as an indicator of initial depositional environment, discussion of select examples of pathology and trauma, and the comparative analysis of decorative motifs (where present). Results indicate a primarily young adult male assemblage, but with all major age classes and both sexes present. Incidents of trauma and pathology are low, but some unique examples are highlighted. The results of the taphonomic analysis reveal new insights into most probable means of primary and secondary deposition before collection and export to Europe. Overall, the work presented here furthers the argument that research into colonial-era collecting and trading of human remains is most effective when osteological and archival research is conducted together whenever possible.

AB  - Development of sound criteria for metal and metalloid bioaccumulation risk assessment in river basins affected by mining activities is a necessary tool to protect the aquatic communities. The aim of this study is to propose integrative scores for tissue residues that are suitable for surveillance programs and readily interpreted in terms of risk assessment in mining impacted rivers. Tissue residues of 7 trace metals and 2 metalloids were measured in ten macroinvertebrate taxa from the Nal ' on River basin (Spain), affected by Hg, Cu and Au mining activities. Compared with reference sites, biomonitor taxa from Hg and Au mining districts showed the highest bioaccumulation. However, low or non-significant bioaccumulation was found in sites influenced by historical Cu mining. Multivariate analyses (ANOSIM) performed on individual taxa revealed significant differences in tissue residues between sites classified according to their ecological status. The bioaccumulation risk assessment was based on the average ratio of the actual metal tissue residues in each macroinvertebrate taxon to the corresponding Ecological Threshold tissue concentration (Tissue residue Ratio to Threshold, TRT). The suitability of the biomonitors was evaluated using linear regression models fitted to the relationships between TRT scores and site sediment pollution or ecological status scores. Biomonitor selection also considered differences in invertebrate functional traits, which can influence metal and metalloid bioavailability. Site bioaccumulation risk was assessed on an Integrated Tissue concentration score (INTISS), calculated over a selection of the most relevant chemicals (As, Cu and Hg) and 3 biomonitor taxa (Baetidae, Hydropsychidae, Microdrile oligochaetes) comprising a set of feeding styles. Based on INTISS, it was possible to predict community alteration scores, using linear regression models. A comparison of site bioaccumulation and ecological status assessments based on the departure from reference conditions showed that operational monitoring programs in basins impaired by mining can be optimized by combining both approaches.

AB  - This aim of this study was to analyze the influence of socieoconomic, environmental and farm variables on the existing genetic values (Expected Progeny Differences - EPDs) of the different clusters of Nelore animals in Brazil. The data evaluated included EPDs of 1,462,485 animals, males and females born between 2000 to 2011, same period of the compiled variables used (socieoconomic, environmental and farm), distributed in 171 municipality from 15 Brazilian states by GENEPLUS (Genotype Breeding Program of Embrapa Beef Cattle). The municipality averages of sixteen variables were used for weight traits (maternal and direct genetic effects for weight at 120 days, maternal and direct genetic effects at birth and weaning weight, post-yearling weight and average daily gain post-weaning), carcass quality (carcass conformation at weaning, carcass conformation at post-yearling, eye muscle area, subcutaneous fat thickness and marbling) and reproductive traits (scrotal perimeter at weaning, scrotal perimeter at post-yearling, age at first calving and cow weight at weaning) as well as their respective accuracies. The data were spatialized in the ArcGIS program along with environmental factors and human development indicators. The statistics included clustering, discriminant and canonical analyzes using the SAS (R) program. Three clusters for weight traits, five for carcass quality, four for reproductive traits and five for accuracy were formed. The clusters showed good distribution across the country, highlighting the clusters with highest genetic values for each trait type. Discrimination was seen among environments for beef cattle at pasture, depending on climatic conditions. The spatial distribution of the Nelore cattle breed may provide a better understanding of the real situation of the breed in different Brazilian climates and environments. The results of this study can be used to correct possible errors of genetic selection programs that use the same breeders and females for different environments.

AB  - Sewer deterioration caused by sulfide-induced concrete corrosion is spreading worldwide. Within the strategies to overcome this problem, dosing iron salts into the pipeline has attracted more attention. However, there is not yet research that evaluates this method whether it is overall environmentally friendly. Here, we conducted a comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to adjudge the benefits of dosing ferric chloride over non-dosing option in three different H2S concentration levels (High, Medium, Low). Compared with taking no precautions, dosing ferric chloride performs better for all impact categories only in High H2S situation, which can reduce the environmental impacts by 10% to 50%. In Medium H2S situation, dosing ferric chloride shows lower environmental impacts of Global Warming, Fossil Fuel Depletion, Acidification, and Eutrophication, while leads to the deterioration of Human Toxicity and Freshwater Ecotoxicity by 10% and 13%, respectively. In Low H2S situation, dosing ferric chloride performs even worse for all impact categories. Therefore, from an LCA perspective, this study recommends iron salts dosing technology to be applied in severe corrosion conditions caused by high H2S concentrations. Contribution analysis shows that asphalt and diesel consumed during the sewer construction and renovation dominate all impact categories for non-dosing option, whereas the main contributor of Human Toxicity and Freshwater Ecotoxicity is shifted to ferric chloride production in dosing option, average at around 50%. Sensitivity analysis on the length of pipes protected by iron salts confirms that the initial dosing location is more preferable to be set at upstream of the sewer system. From an LCA perspective, as alternatives to ferric chloride, ferrous chloride is superior in all impact categories, and ferric sulfate could reduce the toxicity-related impacts and other effects at the expense of exacerbation of acidification. In the end, a systematic optimization of salts dosing should be considered in urban sewer management practice.

AB  - Introduction. Learning about the productive and behavior indicators of poultry allows optimizing the pasture access system. Objective. Describe performance, pasture management, and behavior of Rhode Island Red (RIR) and Sex Link Black (SLB) hens in a lodging system on a floor with pasture access. Materials and methods. The research took place in Turrialba, in the province of Cartago, between October 2016 and January 2018, with 210 SLB and 180 RIR hens, aged from 13 to 80 weeks. Body weight, uniformity, mortality, discard, and weekly production percentage, hen housed egg production, feed conversion, feed intake, natural behavior, egg weight and egg mass, were obtained. Pasture management in pasture areas, forage availability, leaf/stem ratio, and the behavior of the poultry in the parks were described. Results. Lower production performance of the SLB and RIR were observed when compared to the Isa Brown genetic line, only the weight of the egg was higher for the RIR hens. Food waste was observed in both groups of birds, the main cause of death was the discard of subordinate birds, pecking, and cannibalism. The most commonly observed behaviors were scratching, pecking, and sand baths. When SLB and RIR poultry entered the parks, fodder production of 5033 and 3460 kg MF GM ha(-1) was recorded, respectively. A leaf/stem ratio of >1 was obtained, which reflected a higher preference of the hens for the leaves when grazing. Conclusion. In the flat housing system with access to grazing, the assessed birds displayed low production performance, stress from the heat, loss of feathers due to pecking, cannibalism, and food waste. The production system with access to pasture under the conditions studied was not optimal for the hens used.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to assess alternative financial stress indicators for India in terms of tracing crisis events, mapping with the business cycle and the macroeconomic effect of stress indices. Design/methodology/approach The study constructs the composite indicator of systemic stress of Hollo, Kremer and Lo Duca (2012) for India using two different methods for computing time-varying cross-correlation matrix, namely, exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) and dynamic conditional correlation-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (DCC-GARCH). The derived indices are evaluated with widely used, equal variance and principal component weighting indices in terms of tracing stress events, mapping with the business cycles and the macroeconomic effect. For this purpose, the study identifies various episodes of financial stress and uses the business cycle dates in the sample covering from January 2001 to October 2018. Findings The results suggest that stress indices based on EWMA and DCC-GARCH accurately identify the well-known stress periods and capture the recession dates and show an adverse effect on economic activity. Primarily, the DCC-GARCH-based stress index emerges as a better indicator of stress because it efficiently locates all the major-minor events, traces the build-up of stress and reverts to the normal level during stable times. Practical implications The DCC-GARCH-based stress index is a very useful indicator for policymakers in regularly monitoring India's financial conditions and providing timely identification of systemic stress to avoid adverse repercussion effects of the financial crisis. Originality/value The 2007-2008 financial crisis and subsequent recurrent instability in the financial markets highlighted the requirement for an appropriate financial stress indicator for a timely assessment of the system-wide financial stress. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that incorporates the systemic nature of financial stress in the construction of stress indices for India and provides a holistic evaluation of the financial stress from an emerging country's perspective.

AB  - Quantitative PCR (qPCR) has been used to quantify antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in water, wastewater, soil, sediment and tissue samples. Concerns regarding the comparability of data obtained in different laboratories has been a major bottleneck to incentivize the compilation of publicly available of ARGs quantifications gathered from different reports. In this study, the influence of the DNA extraction kits (NZY Tissue gDNA Isolation kit or DNeasy PowerWater kit) and of the operator on the DNA extraction yield and on qPCR genes quantification was assessed. Since in wastewater and water samples the matrix effect can affect the DNA recovery and, therefore, gene quantification, an internal standard, consisting in a cloned gene not found in environmental samples, was tested. The aim was to assess how qPCR determinations in wastewater and water samples can be affected by the matrix effect. The results show that the DNA extraction operator did not significantly influence DNA yield. The use of distinct kits resulted in qPCR gene quantifications that did not differ in more than 1 log-unit mL(-1). The matrix effect, assessed based on the use of an internal standard, was associated with an underestimation that ranged 0.1-0.9 log gene copy number mL(-1) of sample, irrespective of the water type.
   The reliability on the use of a DNA extraction kit that costs about 3 times less than the most commonly used can be an incentive for the use of DNA based analyses of ARGs in environmental waters. Moreover, the fact that both the DNA extraction operator and the reduced matrix effect have little influence on the final results, are good news, encouraging the compilation of data produced in distinct laboratories. Nevertheless, harmonization efforts are still necessary to minimize bias that may be due associated with other conditions, such as equipment.

AB  - World experience shows that the companies' social responsibility nowadays is becoming a prerequisite for ensuring competitiveness in global markets. The customers want to see not only eco-friendly products, but also they want to know that the production process is also not posing a threat to the environment. This has become a new condition of leadership and sustainable consumption. At the present day, the eco-technologies have become a new technology trend, which also spread in recent years following the information technologies, communication technologies, and biotechnologies. The developed countries' experience on the example of Finland shows that investing in efficient and environmentally friendly economic trends leads to savings in energy, resources, and raw materials costs, which generally leads to lower production costs in future. The article discusses the development trends of the global market for environmental goods and services. The annual growth of the global market for environmental goods and services is estimated at an average of 5%. Overall, it is forecasted that the share of products and technologies related to ecology and energy rise up to 40% of total world production in the first half of the 21st century. In this context, the corporate sustainability has already become a global trend, and thus determines the features for some markets' development. The most part in assessing corporate responsibility is made by environmental responsibility, and impacts upon environment. This indicates on an attempt to maximize the companies' involvement in preserving environmentally-friendly factors in all their observed occurrences. The article discusses the corporate practices for implementing the corporate sustainability concept regarding these indicators (At Northrop Grumman, Target, and other companies). However, this is not enough at the present stage of the market development, thus the companies must comply with "the rules of the game" not only within their production cycle, but also to observe the "environment sustainability" of all inputs and outputs.

AB  - The purpose of the study is to evaluate, by means of correlation analysis, the correlation between the main biometric indicators for three cotton varieties. The study was conducted in the field of experience of the Department of Crop Production. Faculty of Agriculture at the University of Trakia, Stara Zagora during the period 2018-2019. The field experience is derived by the method offractional plots. The influence of both factors (fertilization and irrigation) on the development and productivity of the three varieties of cotton was studied. The relationships between the mass of one boll, the number of bolls per plant, the biomass by phase, the total yield per plant and the total yield of cotton per hectare were studied. Correlation dependencies were found with a high degree ofHelius correlation between the structural elements: mass of one boll and bud formation (r = 0.989), mass of one boll and number of bolls per plant (r = 0.988) under irrigation conditions. Darmi is distinguished by a high degree of correlation between flowering and the number of bolls in a plant (r = 0.996). Colored naturally of Isabel! is characterized by a high degree of correlation between positive depending of bud-formation and ripening (r = 0.967) and between the number of bolls in a plant and a total yield (r = 0.958). For irrigation are established correlations between bud-formation and flowering (r = 0.983) and between ripening and number of bolls in one plant (r = 0.979) in Helius. With a high degree of correlation feature dependencies between bud formation and ripening (r = 0.963), and bud formation number of bolls in a plant (r = 0.994) in Darmi. Strong positive correlation is drawn between bud-formation and flowering (r = 0.964) and between flowering and ripening (r = 0.956).

AB  - A glasshouse experiment was conducted to study if glyphosate spraying has immediate short-term effects on the growth, reproduction and residue incorporation of the earthworm species Lumbricus terrestris L. The experiment simulated post-harvest conditions in no-till cereal cultivation, where L. terrestris often abound, and glyphosate is widely used. Pairs of adult, field-collected L. terrestris (median total mass 11.2 g fresh weight) were kept in fine sand-filled cylinders, with chopped wheat straw on the soil surface as feed. The treatment cylinders were sprayed with glyphosate at normal field application rate [Rodeo (R) XL 3.0 1 ha(-1), resulting in 1080 g a.i. ha(-1) and "Contact" surfactant (0.51 ha(-1))]; the controls were sprayed with water (N = 12 for both). The treatment and control cylinders were maintained for two months at + 15 degrees C, approximate 60% air humidity and 12h:12h light:dark cycle. All individuals survived the experiment. There was no difference in L. terrestris mass change over the experiment, with an average weight change of + 0.96% in glyphosate treatment and -0.93% change in the control (p = 0.66). Glyphosate treatment and control did not differ in cocoon production rate (31 vs 28 cocoons cylinder(-1) respectively; p = 0.30). The straw incorporation was slightly but not significantly lower in glyphosate-treated soil (decline in surface straw mass 27.5% vs. 30.5%; p = 0.07). The glyphosate treatment applied represents a commonly used practice in spring cereal cultivation, and it did not affect negatively L. terrestris. The varying study results on the effects of glyphosate on earthworms - and on L. terrestris in particular - may partly arise from notable variation in application rates and the formulation-surfactant combinations used in different experiments which needs to be considered in the ecological risk assessment of glyphosate use.

AB  - Marine habitat mapping provides essential information for environmental management and design of marine reserves. In tropical regions, particularly along the Brazilian coast, the spatial variability of marine habitats is poorly known. The aim of this study is to evaluate the geodiversity of the region as an indicator to benthic habitat distribution, applying an integrative approach utilizing existing broad-scale bathymetric and seafloor geological data sets. A digital bathymetric model (DBM) of the Pernambuco Continental shelf (PCS) was generated at 80 m resolution from available bathymetric data. Through the benthic terrain model (BTM), DBM derivatives and the benthic structures were generated. These structures were combined with the textural seabed classification using tools in ArcGIS (TM) 10.5 Spatial Analyst to identify 22 seabed geomorphic features, including a submarine canyon confirmed around 8 degrees 20 ' S. These geomorphological features describe the surficial characteristics of the seafloor, providing the baseline for subsequent habitat-mapping studies, and can therefore be considered a potential habitat map. Three profiles taken to describe the cross-shelf seafloor environment (North, Center, and South) extracted from interpolated seabed geomorphological map revealed that sediment grain size becomes coarser from inshore to offshore, with predominantly sand and gravel sediment grain sizes. Overall, these results indicated a great potential for PCS due to the geodiversity present in the area, which leads to a higher biodiversity as well. Based on that, the central portion of PCS is suggested as a priority area for conservation because it was the most geomorphologically diverse. These terrain features influence the environmental conditions, such as currents, waves, nutrients, and other oceanographic parameters, which results in high diversity of benthic habitats in the region. This study presents a first step in characterizing the geomorphology of PCS by using reliable, standardized data.

AB  - This trial evaluated the individual and interactional effects of diet and type of pregnancy (twin or single) on plasma metabolic response in ewes and their lambs from late pre-partum to late post-partum. Thus, a flock of 18 Ile de France breed sheep, consisting of 8 twin-bearing and 10 single-bearing ewes, were allocated to one of two groups according to their diet, either based on ad libitum naturalized pasture hay (NPH) or red clover hay (RCH), from d 45 pre-partum to d 60 post-partum. Plasma samples were collected at different times to determine albumin, cholesterol, total protein and urea, plus glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentration in ewes. The data was processed using the lme4 package for R, and SPSS Statistics 23.0 for Windows. The results showed that both diet and type of pregnancy influenced the metabolic profile in ewes, showing an inverse relationship between single- and twin-bearing ewes regarding glucose and especially BHB proportions from pre-partum to birth. During post-partum, higher urea concentrations were observed in twin- and single-bearing ewes fed RCH in contrast to those fed NPH, as a result of the higher-quality forage offered to ewes. Regarding lambs, the diet and type of pregnancy influenced the total protein and urea levels, where an inverse relationship at birth and early post-partum between albumin and cholesterol vs. total protein and urea was detected, reflecting a trend (P value between 0.06 and 0.07) to a better performance by groups of single lambs, especially those from single-bearing ewes fed RCH. Finally, under the conditions of this study, the maternal diet and type of pregnancy influenced the plasma metabolic response in ewes and their lambs, affecting the lamb performance especially at birth.

AB  - Dynamically developing world has caused fundamental changes in the field of education, so there come new trends in the implementation of traditional approaches and new aspects in education sphere, in particular in the context of the formation of educational strategies in solving urgent problems of creative realization of students' personal potential. The relevance of the implementation of the differentiated approach within the educational system in the modernization of Russian education at the present stage is explained by the fact that it makes it possible, on the one hand, to adapt the educational system to the levels of training, students' individual characteristics and interests, on the other hand - to formulate a desire for self-education, development of the professional competence of future specialists. The differentiated approach in higher education is aimed at overcoming the contradictions between the level of requirements in educational and professional activities and the real possibilities of each student. The implementation of this approach involves updating the content and professional components, taking into account the characteristics of each student these are individual, age and professional. The main purpose of the study was to determine the efficient criteria and indicators on the implementation of the differentiated approach to students that is to their communicative competence, knowledge of foreign language professional terminology, orientation in cognitive professional and communicative values and the nature of a person's focus on these values. The results of the study showed that in the process of students professional education the differentiated approach performs the following functions: it is a means of development of an individual personality and future student's creative potential; it affects the personal and professional adaptation of a future student in society; it contributes to the effective formation of conditions for resourceful professional self-realization of a future student.

AB  - The composition of water significantly affect the flow of the process and the main indicators of the finished drink. The article presents the results of theoretical and experimental researches on improvement of the technology of preparation of drinking water for the production of non-alcoholic fermented beverages, in particular, bread kvass. The high efficiency of the application of natural minerals - clinoptilolite, rock crystal and activated carbon with combined treatment of water in the technology of bread kvass is proven. The quality and usefulness of the product depend on the content of its impurities. The integrated action of investigated materials with adsorption, ion exchange and redox properties provides water conditioning and achievement of the intensification of the technological process and high organoleptic qualities of the finished product. The work presents the physical-mechanical characteristics of the investigated materials, technological parameters of treatment, the influence of filter materials on the organoleptic and physical and chemical parameters of water and finished product. The article also gives a taste-aroma profile of bread kvass, made from the use of prepared water. The materials of the conducted research testify to the expediency of water treatment for the production of bread kvass in the sequence of clinoptilolite, active coal, rock crystal with a filtration rate of 8-15 m / h. In this case, the total iron content is reduced by 5 times, the total stiffness decreases by 75%, permanganate oxidation is 9 times. It has been established that such processing allows for high organoleptic qualities of prepared water and end product and increases the tasting score of bread kvass by 7 times, with no unpleasant taste and aroma that is characteristic of chlorinated water and decreases the turbidity of the beverage as a result of a decrease in the overall rigidity of water.

AB  - Climate change associated heat stress was established to be the crucial factor, which negatively influences animal production. The animals possess several adaptive mechanisms which are helpful for their survival in harsh environmental conditions, but while doing so their productive performances are compromised. Among the various mechanisms, which helps to maintain homeostasis in animals, Physiological adaptability was considered one of the primary response mechanisms by which the heat stressed animals survive the heat stress. This review is therefore an attempt to provide the audience an updated review on the subject to signify the importance of physiological responses in animals and their role in surviving the stressful environment. Respiration rate (RR), pulse rate (PR), rectal temperature (RT), sweating rate (SR) and skin temperature (ST) are the cardinal physiological variables which helps to maintain the heat balance and homeostasis in the stressed animals. Among the various physiological variables, RR, RT and ST were established to be ideal indicators for quantifying heat stress in several farm animals. Therefore, these variables can be effectively used to assess the severity of heat stress in livestock. Although these variables are considered significant in establishing the heat stress impact in animals, a wide genetic variation was also established in these response mechanisms. Further, variations in physiological adaptability were also established between indigenous, cross bred and pure bred animals. The indigenous livestock breeds were tipped to be exhibiting less physiological variability as compared to their counterparts. These discussions vividly indicate the importance of studying in detail the physiological adaptive mechanisms in different farm animals and these efforts can help the farming community to identify the suitable agroclimatic zone specific livestock breeds which can go in long way to help to ensure climate resilient livestock production.

AB  - The thermal comfort and its changes in the 31 provincial capital cities of mainland China in the past 30 years were comprehensively evaluated using the Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET) and Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) indicators. The PET and UTCI values were highly correlated with each other and presented similar thermal comfort pattern, although their sensitivities might differ slightly. The results showed that these cities covered, respectively, 4-8 and 6-8 thermal comfort classes of the PET and UTCI scale. On the whole, the annual cumulative number of pleasant days was more than 160 days/year. In terms of seasonal variations in thermal comfort conditions, the 31 provincial capital cities in mainland China can be classified into 5 types, which are, respectively, characterized by pleasant summer and severe cold winter (type-I); pleasant spring, autumn, winter, and severe hot summer (type-II); pleasant spring and autumn, slightly pleasant summer, and cold winter (type-III); pleasant spring and autumn, hot stress summer, and slightly cold winter (type-IV); and pleasant spring, summer, autumn, and cool winter (type-V). Type-II cities are rare winter resorts, while type-I cities are natural summer resorts. Type-V cities are the year round pleasant resorts. In the past three decades, the cities in mainland China had experienced increasing pleasant duration in late winter and early spring and intensifying heat stress in summer. The reduction in annual cumulative number of cold stress days in higher latitude/altitude cities outweighed the increase in duration of heat stress in subtropical cities. These may provide some references for urban planning and administration in mainland China.

AB  - Despite being a widespread and important game species in Europe, scientifically reliable, easy applicable and cost effective methods for monitoring abundance of roe deer Capreolus capreolus populations do not yet exist. The currently recommended kilometric index (AI-p) captures temporal variation in the relative abundance of populations; however, because this index is carried out on foot, it is demanding in terms of sampling effort and difficult to apply at spatial scales of several hundred km(2) typical of deer management units. Here, we propose and test a modified version of the kilometric index by using a vehicle to carry out transects over large areas (AI-v). To validate this abundance index, we compared variation in population abundance estimated with AI-p and AI-v with capture-mark-recapture (CMR) estimates of population density in a roe deer population, Chize (France), monitored for 24 years (including eight years when both indices were collected). We found no detectable effect of conditions of observation (temperature and precipitation) on either AI-p or AI-v. AI-p and AI-v were both positively and linearly related (on a log scale) to CMR estimates of population density, after accounting for uncertainty of CMR estimates by using a bootstrap procedure. AI-p was slightly better correlated to population density (r = 0.76) than AI-v (r = 0.58). The positive correlation of AI-p and AI-v with CMR density estimates as well as the reduced costs of conducting surveys by car instead on foot (-47%) suggest that diurnal vehicle counts of roe deer can provide a suitable abundance index to monitor temporal trends in roe deer populations at operational management scales. For reliable management of wildlife populations, diurnal vehicle counts of roe deer could be used in association with measures of animal performance and herbivore impacts on the habitat, within the framework of the indicators of ecological change.

AB  - Transgenic plants with desirable gene are biotechnological tool to alleviate food deficiencies in sustainable agriculture. Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is an important fiber crop and a source of raw materials for the textile industry. Drought stress is an utmost factor that ravages cotton quality and limits crop production. Transgenic plants with overexpression of AVP1 gene have ability to survive in salt and water stress conditions. However, introduction of transgenic plants can affect rhizosphere environment. Bacterial abundance, survival and plant growth promotion activities can be good indicators to study the effects of transgenic plants in rhizospheric environment. Present study demonstrated that culturable bacterial populations were not significantly different in the rhizosphere of AVP1 transgenic (TC) and non-transgenic (NTC) cotton plants at three different growth stages. Three bacterial strains were isolated from the rhizosphere of cotton and identified as Arthrobacter, Azospirillumand Brevibacillus spp. based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Plant growth promoting traits i.e. phosphate solubilization and phytohormone (IAA) production were detected in all three bacterial isolates. Growth promotion of transgenic and non-transgenic cotton plants by inoculation of these three strains indicated significant increase in growth and yield of both TC and NTC plants. Maximum growth promotion was observed in plants inoculated with Brevibacillus spp. strain TN4-3NF which showed an increase of 17.9% in root dry weight, 18.4% in shoot dry weight, 17.6% in yield of TC-pants, and 14.4% in root dry weight, 5.5% in shoot dry weight, and 13.9% in yield of NTC-plants compared with respective non-inoculated controls. From the present study it can be concluded that transgenic plants have no apparent drastic effect on rhizosphere microflora and both the AVP1 transgenic and non-transgenic cotton plants are equally responsive to bacterial inoculations.

AB  - The climate has warmed dramatically over recent decades, especially since the 1980s. Global climate change impacts can already be tracked in many biological systems. Plant phenology is often used as a good indicator for climate changes. Previous analyses have stated an advance of spring events, a delay of autumn events, and a lengthening of the growing season over recent decades. Here, we continuously observed the bloom date and defoliation date of seven peach varieties from 1983 to 2012. We demonstrate that the bloom date of peach has advanced by 11.1 days, whereas the defoliation date has been delayed by 8.7 days. These observations suggest that the growing season has lengthened by 19.8 days over 30 years. The climate data indicates that the annual mean temperature has warmed by 0.67 degrees C per decade at NPGRC since the 1980s. The bloom date was negatively correlated with the average air temperature from February to April (r = -0.83, p < 0.01), indicating that higher temperatures from February to April may accelerate developmental processes and finally lead to an advance of spring events. To verify how winter warming influenced the spring event, we designed different winter chill units treatments to simulate different degrees of warming conditions. Simulative experiments indicated that the decrease in winter chill delayed the bloom date, which also suggests that the warming from February to April was the major reason for the advancing bloom date: Our results show a more dramatic trend of phenological change than other previous studies. This difference may be because our observations were focused on local climate changes and a relatively temperature-sensitive species. Our studies found a different pattern of phenological changes and could provide insights into local climate change research. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sustainability considerations in manufacturing scheduling, which is traditionally influenced by service oriented performance metrics, have rarely been adopted in the literature. This paper aims to address this gap by incorporating energy consumption as an explicit criterion in shop floor scheduling. Leveraging the variable speed of machining operations leading to different energy consumption levels, we explore the potential for energy saving in manufacturing. We analyze the trade-off between minimizing-makespan, a measure of service level and total energy consumption, an indicator for environmental sustainability of a two-machine sequence dependent permutation flowshop. We develop a mixed integer linear multi-objective optimization model to find the Pareto frontier comprised of makespan and total energy consumption. To cope with combinatorial complexity, we also develop a constructive heuristic for fast trade-off analysis between makespan and energy consumption. We define lower bounds for the two objectives under some non-restrictive conditions and compare the performance of the constructive heuristic with CPLEX through design of experiments. The lower bounds that we develop are valid under realistic assumptions since they are conditional on speed factors. The Pareto frontier includes solutions ranging from expedited, energy intensive schedules to prolonged, energy efficient schedules. It can serve as a visual aid for production and sales planners to consider energy consumption explicitly in making quick decisions while negotiating with customers on due dates. We provide managerial insights by analyzing the areas along the Pareto frontier where energy saving can be justified at the expense of reduced service level and vice versa. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Understanding hydrological effects of ecological restoration (ER) is fundamental to develop effective measures guiding future ER and to adapt climate change in China's Loess Plateau (LP). Streamflow (Q) is an important indicator of hydrological processes that represents the combined effects of climatic and land surface conditions. Here 14 catchments located in the LP were chosen to explore the Q response to different driving factors during the period 1961-2009 by using elasticity and decomposition methods based on the Budyko framework. Our results show that (1) annual Q exhibited a decreasing trend in all catchments (-0.30 similar to -1.71 mm yr(-2)), with an average reduction of -0.87 mm yr(-2). The runoff coefficients in flood season and nonflood season were both decreasing between two periods divided by the changing point in annual Q series; (2) the precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (E-0) elasticity of Q are 2.75 and -1.75, respectively, indicating that Q is more sensitive to changes in P than that in E-0; (3) the two methods consistently demonstrated that, on average, ER (62%) contributing to Q reduction was much larger than that of climate change (38%). In addition, parameter n that entails catchment characteristics in the Budyko framework showed positive correlation with the relative area of ER measures in all catchments (eight of them are statistically significant with p< 0.05). These findings highlight the importance of ER measures on modifying the hydrological partitioning in the region. However, ER actions over the sloping parts of the landscape weakened the impact of those in channels (i.e., check-dams) on Q, especially after the implementation of the Grain-for-Green project in 1999.

AB  - Palms (Arecaceae) are a dominant feature of some landscapes in Africa and may provide different subsistence elements for humans such as construction materials, fabrics, fuel, food, medicine, and ornamentals. Palms have been identified through phytolith analyses in different localities and palaeoanthropological levels of Olduvai Gorge (northern Tanzania) dated to approximately 1.8 Ma. Thus, the presence of palms poses some interesting questions mostly related to the information they can provide in terms of ecological and vegetation reconstructions as well as the interaction between these plants and the possible use of them by hominins. We present here the study of modern soils from Serengeti National Park, Lake Eyasi and Lake Manyara, where palms are still present. The main goal is the reconstruction of palm landscapes and their interaction with other geographical factors (palaeolake, fresh water courses, etc.) through phytolith analyses and taking into account preservation conditions. Contrary to what was expected, characteristic palm phytoliths do not accumulate in the same amounts as observed in the palaeoanthropological samples from Olduvai Gorge. The short cell phytoliths of grasses, also common in the area, do not correspond to the grasses growing in the spots where the samples were collected. There are several reasons for these inconsistencies. Preservation of phytoliths is poor in disturbed areas, open grasslands and scarcely vegetated areas. Fresh watercourses may also influence in the number of phytoliths and preservation caused presumably by erosion and water transport. This study reaffirms the idea that the absence in the archaeological and palaeontological/palaeoecological record of some phytolith morphotypes it is not always related to their absence on the past. Most importantly, the presence of plant groups is very significant but the relative abundance is not easily interpreted because of preservation and disturbance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

AB  - Background: Assessment of mother-child interactions is a core issue of early child development and psychopathology. This paper focuses on the concept of "synchrony'' and examines (1) how synchrony in mother-child interaction is defined and operationalized; (2) the contribution that the concept of synchrony has brought to understanding the nature of mother-child interactions.
   Method: Between 1977 and 2013, we searched several databases using the following key-words: "synchrony" "interaction" and "mother-child". We focused on studies examining parent-child interactions among children aged 2 months to 5 years. From the 63 relevant studies, we extracted study description variables (authors, year, design, number of subjects, age); assessment conditions and modalities; and main findings.
   Results: The most common terms referring to synchrony were mutuality, reciprocity, rhythmicity, harmonious interaction, turn-taking and shared affect; all terms were used to characterize the mother-child dyad. As a consequence, we propose defining synchrony as a dynamic and reciprocal adaptation of the temporal structure of behaviors and shared affect between interactive partners. Three main types of assessment methods for studying synchrony emerged: (1) global interaction scales with dyadic items; (2) specific synchrony scales; and (3) microcoded time-series analyses. It appears that synchrony should be regarded as a social signal per se as it has been shown to be valid in both normal and pathological populations. Better mother-child synchrony is associated with familiarity (vs. unknown partner), a healthy mother (vs. pathological mother), typical development (vs. psychopathological development), and a more positive child outcomes.
   Discussion: Synchrony is a key feature of mother-infant interactions. Adopting an objective approach in studying synchrony is not a simple task given available assessment tools and due to its temporality and multimodal expression. We propose an integrative approach combining clinical observation and engineering techniques to improve the quality of synchrony analysis.

AB  - Leucobryum juniperoideum (Brid.) Milll.Hal., a common moss in eastern China, grows in three typical habitats in the Tianmu Mountain National Nature Reserve, Zhejiang, China. This study aims to reveal the role of soil nitrogen and phosphorus in the distribution of Leucobryum juniperoideum by investigating soil conditions in the Tianmu Mountain National Nature Reserve. Epigeic populations of this bryophyte were found only in areas with a Moso bamboo forest, while the epixylous populations always occurred in areas with Chinese fir forest and Chinese cedar forest, and the epilithic populations occurred in all three habitat types. Analyses showed that nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations in the soils of Chinese fir forests and Chinese cedar forests were remarkably higher than those of Moso bamboo forests. In the laboratory, experiments showed that the growth of L. juniperoideum was remarkably reduced by N additions of 0.1 mol/L over a period of six months, while growth was increased by P additions of up to 0.1 mol/L over six months. In addition, physiological responses to N indicated that the mosses were sensitive to N additions, but not to additions of P. Also, high concentrations of N (200 mg/L) can significantly reduce the germination rates and can delay the development of early germination stages and stable germination stages for 2 to 4 days. Phosphorus additions did not affect the germination rate, but did cause delays in the development of germination stages. The combination of N and P caused remarkable declines in the germination rate and delayed the germinating time. Taken together, our results demonstrate that soil N is the primary determinant in limiting the distribution of L. juniperoideum populations.

AB  - The aim of the study was to analyse trends of the pollen season with its duration, start and end dates, as well as trends of the annual total pollen count and annual peak pollen concentration for the Szeged agglomeration in Southern Hungary. The data set covered an 11-year period (1997-2007) that included eight taxa and seven daily climate variables. Trend analysis was performed on both annual and daily bases. Trend analysis on a daily basis is a new approach that provides information on the annual cycles of the trends. To quantify the strength of the relationship between the annual cycle of the slope of a pollen concentration trend and the annual cycles of the slopes of the climate variable trends, an association measure and a multiple association measure are introduced. Individual taxa were sorted into three categories according to their climate sensitivities. These were compared with two novel climate change-related forces, namely risk potential and expansion potential due to the climate change. The total annual pollen counts indicated significant trends for 4 taxa and 3 of these 4 trends increased on a daily basis. At the same time, significant changes were detected for the pollen season characteristics of three taxa. The association measures performed well when compared to the climate change-related forces. Significant changes in pollen season characteristics were also in accordance with the risk potential and expansion potential due to the climate change. A novel procedure was applied to separate the effects of the past and current weather conditions that influence the current Ambrosia pollen concentrations. The potential effect of land use changes on pollen release of the given taxa was also discussed using the CORINE Land Cover Database. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Shallow-water carbonate platforms evolve in an interplay of local, regional and global dynamics, thereby generating a detailed record of environmental conditions. Platform sediments constitute important archives of past environmental change and, as such, they are increasingly analysed for the information they contain on wider-scale patterns. The integration of this information with palaeoceanographic data obtained from deeper-water sediments provides a powerful tool to develop a more diverse and complete image of past environmental change. In this contribution, the remains of the northern Tethyan carbonate platform of Early Cretaceous age cropping out in the western Swiss Jura and the Helvetic Alps are used to illustrate the advantage of a palaeoceanographic approach in their interpretation. The tools applied are biostratigraphy and chemostratigraphy (carbon and strontium isotopes) in order to obtain a precise age model for correlation with (hemi-)pelagic sediments in adjacent basins, sequence stratigraphy as a means to reconstruct the impact of sea-level change, phosphorus stratigraphy as a proxy for trophic levels, facies and microfacies analyses as a gateway to gain better insight into the carbonate factory, and the detailed analysis of platform-drowning unconformities as an indicator of wider-scale palaeoenvironmental change. It is shown that changes from periods of predominantly photozoan to predominantly heterozoan carbonate production near the BerriasianValanginian boundary and middle early Aptian coincided with substantial increases in phosphorus burial rates and major carbon-isotope excursions. Furthermore, the majority of the platform-drowning episodes occurred just prior to and during episodes of major palaeoenvironmental change and, last but not least, the platform itself may have influenced the chemistry of adjacent basins and the carbon-isotope composition of associated carbonates by the export of periplatform ooze.

Symptoms of enlarged prostate (EP) are common and may frequently progress into a condition with profound adverse effects on quality of life. Despite the high prevalence, EP is underdiagnosed and undertreated. This situation may result from patient-and provider-related issues. Assessment of symptoms of EP should be initiated with a discussion of LUTS. Evaluation includes a focused history, physical examination and selected laboratory tests. Certain factors put the symptomatic patient at risk for disease progression; however, not all factors can be readily evaluated in the PCP setting. The serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level acts both as an indicator of prostatic size and a screening tool for prostatic cancer, and thereby provides an important tool for PCPs. The STEP plan is a logical guide to patient management. Step 1, watchful waiting, is appropriate in patients with symptoms that are not bothersome. If symptoms cause bother, the initiation of an alpha-blocker (AB) in step 2, provides relatively rapid symptom improvement. Patients with bothersome symptoms and a PSA >= 1.5 ng/ml are at risk for progression and consideration should be given to combination treatment with an AB and a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor (step 3). Patients with refractory symptoms should be referred to a urologist (step 4). Identification, evaluation and management of EP are within the domain of the primary care setting. The STEP approach provides a simple and practical framework for PCPs to manage most men with symptoms of EP.

AB  - Farmers constantly require incentives to stay in production. This paper discusses findings on farmers' personal characteristics salient in production among sweet potato farmers from the study done in Teso, Uganda. Both fanners and agricultural advisers consulted agreed that the weather is a big factor in agricultural production. Over 91% of the farmers expressed positive attitudes towards growing sweet potatoes which spelt their interest in farming. Conditions under which farmers worked affected enterprise productivity. Key elements in the farmers' work environment in Teso included basic factors in agricultural production, essential needs, accelerating needs, health, rights and readiness to work. The assuring farmers' personal characteristics on sweet potato productivity in Teso were: farmer's income, marital status, age, years of school agriculture done, and exposure to agricultural extension. The income sources at any one period varied by fanner. The exposure to agricultural extension was significantly related statistically to two productivity indicators of income per ha and income per person. On formal education, 96% of the farmers surveyed had attained primary education, which was found significant in their work. Farmer's age was significantly related statistically to the productivity indicator of income per hectare. There was gender division of tabour. Gender is significant in sweet potato production in Teso. Majority of farmers had more than 45 years of fanning which was significant experience. Therefore, based on the study, the farmers' personal characteristics found significant on agricultural productivity among the farmers are: income level, exposure to agricultural extension, years of school agriculture done (educational level) which determined the farmers' knowledge of what to do, marital status, fanner's age, gender and fanning experience such as years in growing sweet potatoes.

AB  - Rice may have negative effects on the soil due to intensive levelling tasks required for flood irrigation. Therefore, rotations including rice influence soil physical, chemical and biological properties differently. In our study, the effects of rotations with rice on biological properties were evaluated and associated with the capacity of the soil to supply N to crops. Furthermore, the relationships among the variables were studied and those most sensitive to detect the resulting changes were determined. The study was conducted on four crop sequences over a 4-year period: rice monoculture (RR), rice-soybean (RS), rice-soybean-maize-soybean (RSMS) and rice-pasture (RP). The four rotations evaluated had a strong effect on soil properties. Principal components analysis showed that RR and the RP rotation were discriminated clearly, while RSMS and RS were in the middle of the biplot, forming two different groups. Microbial biomass N (MBN), potential of N mineralization measured by anaerobic incubations (PMN-AI) and the microbial biomass C to N ratio were the variables that differed most the studied rotations. The PMN-AI variable was positively associated with MBN, microbial biomass C, organic C, total N, urease, and fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis (FDA) variables. The potential of N mineralization measured with hot KCl neither evidenced differences among the evaluated situations nor was associated to the other variables. This is why it is assumed this is not a good soil quality indicator. The differences found in microbial analysis indicate that microbiological variables (MBC, MBN), nitrogen availability index (PNM-AI), and biochemical variables (FDA) were sensitive variables to evaluate soil rotations' effects and they might be used as good soil quality indicators once their critical values have been determined for different conditions.

AB  - Aggressive behaviour against conspecifics is considered a costly behaviour that forms part of reproductive investment. Previous studies have suggested that the intensity of agonistic behaviour may indicate individual quality since it exhibits a positive correlation with brood value. However, this relationship has been demonstrated after clutch completion, and by creating a nexus between efforts it has not been possible to disentangle other hypotheses that could explain such findings. Here, by presenting a trio of natural decoys (adult male, adult female and 1-year-old male) to Eurasian kestrels, Falco tinnunculus, we tested whether the aggressive behaviour to conspecifics prior to laying predicted posterior reproductive performance (clutch size). We also tested the effect of breeding stage and breeding density on this behaviour. In addition, we examined the effect of the presence of moulted versus unmoulted 1-year-old males on aggressive behaviour of breeders. Intrasexual agonistic behaviour, measured as attack intensity to the decoys, was positively correlated with clutch size in females, but negatively in males. In males, aggressive behaviour was lower during the female fertile stage than during previous stage, but in females, was similar over stages. Furthermore, agonistic behaviour increased with breeding density in females but not in males. We discuss these results in the context of sexual selection theory, and propose that the link between agonistic behaviour prior to laying and clutch size is via the connection to courtship feeding and that may be considered as an indicator of individual quality for both sexes.

AB  - Fusarium-infected wheat seed decreases germination, seedling emergence, and causes post emergence seedling death, and can contribute to wheat scab and ear rot of maize, with consequent production of mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol and zearalenone. Current seed treatments have proved ineffective in controlling seedling blight and scab. A patented endophytic bacterial strain, Bacillus mojavensis RRC 101, and several other strains of this species were studied to determine in vitro antagonism to some Fusarium species and to assess the potential of this bacterium to serve as an endophytic biocontrol for seedling blight of wheat produced by species within the F graminearum complex, as well as other species of Fusarium. Seedling emergence and seed germination were two tests used as indicators of seedling blight. These tests were conducted in growth rooms with two wheat cultivars highly susceptible to scab, Norm and Pioneer 2552, and other cultivars with varying resistance to scab. The results indicated that all strains of this bacterium were antagonistic in vitro to the strains of E graminearum and its seven related species, as well as four strains of E pseudograminearum and the two strains of E verticillioides. Germination of the highly scab susceptible cultivar 2552 was increased from 77 to 97% when planted in soil containing a mixed inoculum of F graminearum and related species. Seedling emergence in the very susceptible wheat cultivar Norm increased from 20 to 82% when treated with the bacterium. The data indicated that inoculating wheat kernels with B. mojavensis reduced seedling blight of wheat produced by F graminearum and related Fusarium species indicating the potential for this bacterium as a biocontrol under field condition.

AB  - The changes in caddisfly community structure and composition in the Sil River basin ( NW Spain), associated with a gradient in natural conditions and a succession of alterations induced by human activity ( mainly urban wastes and coal mining), were studied. Twenty-nine Trichoptera taxa belonging to 11 families were collected. The community diversity analysis showed important spatial differences from source to mouth. Towns and, above all, coal mines produced an increase in sulphate and chloride concentrations and conductivity, which adversely affected the trichopteran assemblages. A stepwise regression model, which introduced sulphate and chloride as variables, explained the changes in diversity produced in the basin ( r = 0.837, p < 0.01). The lowest diversity and richness values were recorded in the rivers suffering the greatest impact from coal mining or urban wastes. The heterogeneity values of the communities for the main rivers were clearly different. The greatest community heterogeneity corresponded to the main axis of the basin and was explained by spatial variability in water chemical composition. No relation was detected between structural changes at spatial level and geographical distance, such that pollution processes basically controlled the dynamics of the Trichoptera communities. Partial-CCA using distance from the source as a covariable revealed alkalinity and urban and mining-derived pollution as the main factors influencing caddisfly distribution. However, an ordination of sites in relation to the corresponding vectors did not fully agree with the chemical characteristics of the water. The species composition of the Trichoptera communities, therefore, did not seem to be good indicators of the chemical features of the rivers. The structure of the community (as expressed by richness and the Shannon index) appeared to be the better indicator of pollution.

AB  - A method of surveying vegetation complexes was tested for its suitability for assessing and typifying the diversity of landscape sections. The hierarchical levels of biodiversity were redefined. Results were related to the physico-geographical conditions and to hemeroby. Thirty-six valley sections in the Odenwald and Black Forest consisting of a defined physiotope system served as model systems. Each valley section comprises a maximum of nine physiotopes and corresponding vegetation complexes. They were surveyed by synsociological releves using newly developed classification keys. Thirteen different major complex types were determined and divided into subtypes on the basis of ordinations. By means of their recurring combinations five geosigmeta were distinguished. Minimum area analyses of all physiotope types unveiled basic characteristics of minimum areas at the vegetation complex level. The quantitative analysis of all diversity data revealed very similar mean values for the nine different complexes and mean diversity values for vascular plants and plant communities showing very similar characteristics. If the mean Values of community richness are related to the size of the complex releve plots, the flowing water, the roadside, and partly the shrub/hedge/grove complexes represent centers of community diversity. At the model systems, the effects of physico-geographical factors on diversity are superimposed upon by anthropogenic interferences, resulting in a strong levelling of the natural factors within the diversity patterns. An actualistic comparison focusing on the succession of grassland complexes proved the intermediate disturbance hypothesis to be valid at the level of vegetation complexes. Over against the richness of species and complex types, the community diversity has proved to be a particular indicator of the entire physico-geographical structure of a landscape section. By means of vegetation complexes corresponding to defined physiotopes regularities of landscape diversity were assessed that are impossible to infer from analyzing lower complexity levels of the system.

AB  - A pollen and sediment record of a core 4.2-m-long from Laguna Baja (7 degrees 42' S, 77 degrees 32' W, 3575 m) in the Cordillera Oriental of northern Peru suggests several episodes of major vegetational and climatic change over the past 13,000 yr. The oldest pollen assemblage consists of a mixture of paramo elements (tropical alpine vegetation), including high percentages of Poaceae (40%) that decline upward, moist montane forest (Compositae and Polylepis), and wet montane forest (e.g., Hedyosmum and Podocarpaceae). Organic carbon content range from <2% to 8%. About 11,600 yr B,P. this mixed pollen assemblage was replaced by Poaceae (>60%), with high percentages of Jamesonia, a fern characteristic of paramo, and decreasing values of Plantago tubulosa and the wet montane forest elements Hedyosmum and Podocarpaceae. Charcoal percentages are at a maximum during this: period, magnetic susceptibility and sand percentages are high, and percentages of organic matter are low. Several explanations for these changes are possible, including a reduction in temperature and moisture, more frequent periods of aridity with increased fires, or natural succession. The Holocene record begins with pronounced increases in organic carbon and pollen of wet montane forest, primarily Hedyosmum, Podocarpaceae, and Urticales. High values of Podocarpaceae pollen (>35%) and a decline in charcoal suggest temperature and moisture levels above modern-day values. Wet montane forest pollen remain high and charcoal values are low from about 10,000 to 6000 yr B.P., suggesting that warm and moist conditions prevailed for about 4000 yr. Subsequently Podocarpaceae and Urticales decline, and for a brief time Alnus is prominent in the pollen record. Following the Alnus maximum at about 5000 yr B.P., Poaceae, Ambrosia and Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae become frequent, Increased paramo and disturbance indicator pollen suggest increased anthropogenic activities in this region from the middle Holocene to the present.

AB  - Accumulation of amino acids in response to application of 500 kg N ha(-1) as a single dose of NH4NO3 was measured for four common Swedish forest species. Addition of N resulted in increased levels of especially glutamine and arginine in Vaccinium myrtillus L. and in V. vitis-idaea L., whilst, in fertilized Deschampsia flexuosa L., asparagine and glutamine were most prominent. In Epilobium angustifolium L. glutamine and arginine increased most after fertilization. In a second study, five different forest species, V. myrtillus, V. vitis-idaea, D. flexuosa, Pleurozium schreberi Wild. and Polytrichum commune Menz. were studied in a Norway spruce fertilization experiment. In this experiment, plots had been irrigated with a complete mixture of nutrients during the growing period for five subsequent years. Arginine in Pl. schreberi, glutamine in P. commune and asparagine in D. flexuosa were all elevated on fertilized plots, while in fertilized V. vitis-idaea and V. myrtillus only minor increases of amino acid concentrations were found. In a third investigation, amino acid concentrations were measured in Pl. schreberi, Hylocomium splendens L., V. myrtillus, V. vitis-idaea and D. flexuosa growing on different plots in an area with relatively high nitrogen deposition. The plots were divided into two groups, one characterized by high, and one by low concentration of arginine in spruce needles from trees growing on the same plot. Asparagine in D. flexuosa, arginine and asparagine in Pl. schreberi and arginine in H. splendens were significantly higher in plants from plots with high concentrations of arginine in needles of Norway spruce. Differences between species in the metabolism of nitrogen during conditions of high nitrogen supply are discussed as well as possible usage of specific amino acids in the studied species as indicators of nitrogen saturation.

AB  - In this ecoacoustic study we used the setting of a tropical tree diversity planted forest to analyze temporal patterns in the composition of soundscapes and to test the effects of tree species richness on associated biodiversity measured as acoustic diversity. The analysis of soundscapes offers easy, rapid and sustainable methods when assessing biodiversity. During the last years the quantification of regional or global acoustic variability in sounds and the analysis of different soundscapes has been evolving into an important tool for biodiversity conservation, especially since case studies confirmed a relationship between land-use management, forest structure and acoustic diversity. Here we analyzed soundscapes from two seasons (dry and rainy season) and aurally inspected a subset of audio recordings to describe temporal patterns in soundscape composition. Several acoustic indices were calculated and we performed a correlation analysis and a non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis to identify acoustic indices that: (i) were complementary to each other and such represented different aspects of the local soundscapes and (ii) related most strongly to differences in acoustic composition among tree species richness, season and day phase. Thus, we chose "High Frequency Cover," "Bioacoustic Index," and "Events Per Second" to test the hypothesis that acoustic diversity increases with increasing tree species richness. Monocultures differed significantly from polycultures during night recordings, with respect to High Frequency Cover. This index covers sounds above 8 kHz and thus represents part of the orthopteran community. We conclude that increasing tree species richness in a young tropical forest plantation had positive effects on the vocalizing communities. The strongest effects were found for acoustic activity of the orthopteran community. In contrast to birds, orthopterans have smaller home ranges, and are therefore important indicator species for small scale environmental conditions.

AB  - Molecular catalysts, often deployed in homogeneous conditions, are favorable systems for structure-reactivity correlation studies of electrochemical reactions because of their well-defined active site structures and ease of mechanistic investigation. In pursuit of selective and active electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reactions which are promising for converting carbon emissions to useful fuels and chemical products, it is desirable to support molecular catalysts on substrates because heterogeneous catalysts can afford the high current density and operational convenience that practical electrolyzers require. Herein, we share our understanding in the development of heterogenized metal phthalocyanine catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2. From the optimization of preparation methods and material structures for the electrocatalytic activity toward CO2 reduction to CO, we find that molecular-level dispersion of the active material and high electrical conductivity of the support are among the most important factors controlling the activity. The molecular nature of the active site enables mechanism-based optimization. We demonstrate how electron-withdrawing and -donating ligand substituents can be utilized to modify the redox property of the molecule and improve its catalytic activity and stability. Adjusting these factors further allows us to achieve electrochemical reduction of CO2 to methanol with appreciable activity, which has not been attainable by conventional molecular catalysts. The six-electron reduction process goes through CO as the key intermediate. Rapid and continuous electron delivery to the active site favors further reduction of CO to methanol. We also point out that, in homogeneous electrocatalysis where the catalyst molecules are dissolved in the electrolyte solution, even if the molecular structure remains intact, the actual catalysis may be dominated by molecules permanently adsorbed on the electrode surface and is thus heterogeneous in nature. This account uses our research on CO2 electroreduction reactions catalyzed by metal phthalocyanine molecules to illustrate our understanding about heterogeneous molecular electrocatalysis, which is also applicable to other electrochemical systems.

AB  - Aim. To study the influence of cultivation technology on the number of ecological and trophic groups of microorganisms and the yield of winter wheat on the common chernozem of the Central Caucasus.
   Material and Methods. The number of microorganisms was determined by counting colonies on dense nutrient media according to generally accepted methods.
   Results. The number of microorganisms that transform organic and mineral forms of nitrogen and soil yeast was determined, depending on meteorological conditions, soil cultivation and fertilizers. Mineral fertilizers had the most significant effect on the activity of the soil microbiota. In years of varying moisture availability, fertilizers improved the nutrient regime of the soil, which contributed to increased plant development, microflora activity and increased winter wheat yield. In both the technologies applied, the largest number of all groups of microorganisms studied was observed when applying a complete mineral fertilizer - Ns(52)P(52)K(52).This dose of fertilizer also provided the highest yield of winter wheat - 6.07-6.33 t/ha. With a balanced plant nutrition regime (Ns(52)P(52)K(52)), the processes of decomposition and mineralization of plant residues proceeded at the same rate in both technologies. At the same time, without the use of fertilizers, the total activity of microorganisms in the no-till technology exceeded the minimum technology by 23.4x10(5) column-forming units, which indicates the beginning of the process of self-healing of the soil in the third year after the transition to direct sowing of crops.
   Conclusion. The number of microorganisms is one of the most sensitive indicators of the direction of complex biochemical processes, allowing us to assess the combined influence of all factors on the overall state of the soil microbiocenosis.

AB  - Automated, homecage behavioral training for rodents has many advantages: it is low stress, requires little interaction with the experimenter, and can be easily manipulated to adapt to different experimental conditions. We have developed an inexpensive, Arduino-based, homecage training apparatus for sensory association training in freely-moving mice using multiwhisker air current stimulation coupled to a water reward. Animals learn this task readily, within 1-2 days of training, and performance progressively improves with training. We examined the parameters that regulate task acquisition using different stimulus intensities, directions, and reward valence. Learning was assessed by comparing anticipatory licking for the stimulus compared to the no-stimulus (blank) trials. At high stimulus intensities (>9 psi), animals showed markedly less participation in the task. Conversely, very weak air current intensities (1-2 psi) were not sufficient to generate rapid learning behavior. At intermediate stimulus intensities (5-6 psi), a majority of mice learned that the multiwhisker stimulus predicted the water reward after 24-48 hrs of training. Both exposure to isoflurane and lack of whiskers decreased animals' ability to learn the task. Following training at an intermediate stimulus intensity, mice were able to transfer learning behavior when exposed to a lower stimulus intensity, an indicator of perceptual learning. Mice learned to discriminate between two directions of stimulation rapidly and accurately, even when the angular distance between the stimuli was <15 degrees. Switching the reward to a more desirable reward, aspartame, had little effect on learning trajectory. Our results show that a tactile association task in an automated homecage environment can be monitored by anticipatory licking to reveal rapid and progressive behavioral change. These Arduino-based, automated mouse cages enable high-throughput training that facilitate analysis of large numbers of genetically modified mice with targeted manipulations of neural activity.

AB  - Desertification is a global problem that impacts a significative part of the Earth's surface, which cause a large environmental and social losses in several regions of the world. The Brazilian semiarid region, located mainly in the northeast part of the country, includes areas of moderate to very high susceptibility to desertification. In order to contribute to a comprehension of the dimensions of desertification in the Brazilian semiarid region, this paper aimed to develop a potential indicator for the evaluation and monitoring of this area, considering an appropriate temporal and spatial scales. For this objective, satellite data were used for the identification and monitoring of sub-areas potentially undergoing degradation/desertification. Thus multitemporal series of Enhanced Vegetation Index 2 (EVI2) covering the period between 2000 and 2016 was used, which were calculated from data provided by the MODIS sensor carried aboard the Terra satellite. Besides, previous samples were selected for the calibration and validation of the methodology. The results show an increase of areas potentially undergoing degradation/desertification, covering an area equal to 167,814.24 km(2) at the end of the period analyzed (around 16.7% of the study area). Approximately 23.63% of the total degraded area comprises both the Very High Degradation Trajectory and High Degradation Trajectory. The proposed methodology contributed to the determination of the degree of the degradation through the determination of Degradation Trajectories, which differentiates it from the ones proposed in other studies; however, it is emphasized that this approach must be analyzed in association with additional information, such as trends and climatic scenarios of land use and land cover, as well as retrospective analyses of the landscape, soil erosion, field recognition, socioeconomic conditions, among others.

AB  - Three newly synthesized Cu(II) ion selective electrodes based on 1,8-dihydoxyanthraquinone (DHAQ), as an ionophore; have been developed. Carbon paste electrode has been modified with DAHQ (sensor I), graphene and DHAQ (sensor II) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and DHAQ (sensor III), in order to improve the conductivity and transduction of chemical signal to electrical signal. Under optimized conditions, the electrodes I, II and III revealed Nernstian slopes of 29.78 +/- 0.17, 30.25 +/- 0.12, and 30.55 +/- 0.19 mV decade(-1), respectively, at 25 +/- 1 degrees C covering a wide concentration range from 1x10(-6) to 1x10(-1) mol L-1 for sensors I and II and from 1x10(-5) to 1 x 10(-1) mol L-1 for sensor III with detection limit values of 8x10(-7), 5x10(-7), and 3.3x10(-6) mol L-1, respectively. The response of the proposed electrodes is very fast and independent of pH in the range of 2.4-6.5 and the response mechanism is studied using IR, SEM and EDX analyses: Selectivity coefficients have been determined by applying separate solution method and matched potential method, where the obtained values indicated the good discrimination of Cu(II) from other cations by the proposed sensors. The developed sensors have been used successfully for quantitative determination of Cu(II) ions in different matrix of spiked real water samples and biological fluids (urine and serum). These sensors have also been used successfully as indicator electrodes in the potentiometric titration of Cu(II) with EDTA.

AB  - Kettle holes are commonly found in areas embraced by the last Pleistocene glaciations. They are a natural element of the landscape; together with their closed drainage basins they occupy a large proportion of the area. There are many natural conditions that determine their salinity, those listed most often including alimentation, morphometric features, the dynamics of processes taking place in a drainage basin, paths of water supply, the land-use pattern, agricultural pollution, primary production, and the kind of soil cover. The primary goal of this paper is to determine the level of salinity of kettle holes located in the area of young glacial accumulation on the basis of variations in the chemical composition of their waters. An additional goal is to establish factors, including differences in the hydrographic network and the use and development of land, affecting their salinity. The research was conducted in 6 kettle holes in the Parseta catchment and in 10 depressions in the Borucinka drainage basin in northern Poland. Laboratory analyses concerned primarily the concentrations of ions determining the hydrogeochemical types of water. The examined kettle holes have lower electrolytic conductance than the water of lakes in the study area. This may be indicative of the dominant role of atmospheric alimentation of their waters. The ions dominating in the chemical composition of water in both drainage basins were HCO3- and Ca2+, with elevated levels of Cl-, Na+, Mg2+, SO42-, and sporadically of K+. The land-use pattern was found to have a significant effect on the level and range of concentrations of the ions under study. The highest average concentrations and their fluctuations were noted in basins located near farms.

AB  - Numerous studies have established a positive association between economic development and physical growth of humans. While South Korea has commonly been credited as the world's fastest growing economy after World War II, multivariate research conducted on the height development of South Koreans remains insufficient, as previous studies were limited to descriptive analysis by exploring broad anthropometric trends. Pooling several waves of the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (KNHANES), heights of men and women were first plotted by sex and birth decade. Heights of men and women increased from about 169 cm to 176 cm and 157 cm to 162 cm, respectively, over the second half of the twentieth century. Next, upon regressing height on basic social, economic, educational and demographic confounding variables contained in the datasets, individuals born in rural districts were found to be significantly shorter by 0.3 to 0.7 cm than their urban counterparts. Yet, residential dummies proxied by administrative provinces did not come out as consistent in the regressions. Expectedly, individuals with a low household income were significantly shorter (by 0.5 to 0.6 cm) than those in the high income group. Most strikingly, individuals with a high education level were 4 to 5 cm taller than those with low education (no or only elementary education). This suggests that educational status has been the most important factor influencing heights of South Koreans. The latter finding has not been given much discussion in the anthropometric literature, which has traditionally focused on gross-nutritional and income indicators as drivers of human growth.

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the occurrence of faecal indicator and microbial pathogens (bacteria and virus) in the shallow urban aquifer of the Besos River Delta (NE Spain). To this end, human adenovirus (HAdV) and Norovirus of genogroups I and II (NoV GI and NoV GII) as well as the faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) Escherichia coli (EC) and faecal enterococci (FE) were monitored in groundwater and in the River Besos in December 2013 and in July 2104. None of the targeted pathogens were detected in groundwater in December 2013 but contamination of human origin was observed in approximately 50% of the points sampled in July 2014 reaching concentrations up to 99 GC/100 mL for HAdV. Generally, microbial concentrations in river water were higher than those detected in groundwater. This observation indicates that pathogens are naturally attenuated when river water infiltrates and flows through the aquifer, however HAdV were detected at a sampling point located at 380 m from the river in the absence of FIB. The presence of human viral contamination may represent a risk for the use of groundwater as a drinking water source. Further research is needed to understand the dynamics of pathogens in river-groundwater interface over long time periods and a wide range of flow conditions (wet and dry periods) since the urban groundwater of this aquifer might be a valuable drinking water resource in Barcelona especially during drought periods. The methodology followed in this research can be applied to other urban aquifers with similar purposes since the scarcity and contamination of freshwater resources are worldwide issues.

AB  - Mining activities have environmental impacts. The rupture of the Fundao tailing dam ejected a significant volume of iron ore mining waste (IOMW) and was characterized as the greatest disaster in mining history. The use of microorganisms to monitor the affected soils is ideal due to their sensitivity to environmental changes and their capacity for soil remediation, as they can promote plant growth under stressed conditions. This study aimed to evaluate the total fungi diversity and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) community structure of the area affected by IOMW that is currently under rehabilitation. Soil and root samples were collected from an impacted site without rehabilitation (REC1), two revegetated areas with grass and leguminous species (REC2 and REC3), and one reference area in the undisturbed forest (UND) during two seasons (rainy and dry). The total fungal diversity was analyzed by next generation sequencing. The AMF was identified morphologically and the number of spores, colonization, and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) were identified for this group of fungi. Total fungi diversity, AMF community structure, and soil chemical indicators differed among areas and between seasons. UND exhibited the highest organic matter content whereas rehabilitated areas were more affected by pH and presented higher values. The total fungal diversity and AMF community structure in REC areas showed that spore number and species richness increased along with the revegetation process. Glomus and Rhizophagus comprised the most abundant genera. In both climate seasons, AMF diversity in UND was higher than in REC areas but increased diversity in REC was observed in subsequent sampling. The fungal community diversity in affected areas was altered by the revegetation process-which increased the total fungal diversity-as well as AMF helping the recovery of this area.

AB  - Across the world, the assessment of environmental impacts attributable to infrastructure and development projects often require a comparison between observed post-impact outcomes with what "would have happened" in the absence of the impact (i.e., the counterfactual). Environmental impact assessment (EIA) methods traditionally determine the counterfactual based on strong assumptions of stationarity (e.g., using before and after comparisons) and can be particularly challenging to use in the context of substantial data gaps, a vexing problem when combining several time-series data from different sources. Here we propose and test a widely applicable statistical approach for quantifying environmental impacts that avoids the stationarity assumption and circumvents issues associated with data gaps. Specifically, we used a Gaussian Copula (GC) model to assess the hydrological impacts of the Tucurui dam on the Tocantins River in the Brazilian Amazon.
   Using multi-source water level and climate data, GC predictions of pre-dam hydrology for the validation period were excellent (Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients of 0.83 to 0.98 and 93-96% of observations within the 95% predictive intervals). In the post-dam period, the river had higher dry-season water levels both upstream and downstream relative to the predicted counterfactual, and the timing and duration of wet-season drawdown was delayed and extended, substantially altering the flood pulse. These impacts were evident as far as 176 km away from the dam, highlighting widespread hydrological impacts. The GC model outperformed standard multiple regression models in representing predictive uncertainty while also avoiding the stationarity assumption and circumventing the issue of sparse and incomplete data. We thus believe the GC approach has wide utility for integrating disparate time-series data to quantify the impacts of dams and other anthropogenic phenomena on riverine hydrology globally.

AB  - Afforestation projects for mitigating CO2 emissions require to monitor the carbon fixation and plant growth as key indicators. We proposed a monitoring method for predicting carbon fixation in afforestation projects, combining a process-based ecosystem model and field data and addressed the uncertainty of predicted carbon fixation and ecophysiological characteristics with plant growth. Carbon pools were simulated using the Biome-BGC model tuned by parameter optimization using measured carbon density of biomass pools on an 11-year-old Eucommia ulmoides plantation on Loess Plateau, China. The allocation parameters fine root carbon to leaf carbon (FRC:LC) and stem carbon to leaf carbon (SC:LC), along with specific leaf area (SLA) and maximum stomatal conductance (g(smax)) strongly affected aboveground woody (AC) and leaf carbon (LC) density in sensitivity analysis and were selected as adjusting parameters. We assessed the uncertainty of carbon fixation and plant growth predictions by modeling three growth phases with corresponding parameters: (i) before afforestation using default parameters, (ii) early monitoring using parameters optimized with data from years 1 to 5, and (iii) updated monitoring at year 11 using parameters optimized with 11-year data. The predicted carbon fixation and optimized parameters differed in the three phases. Overall, 30-year average carbon fixation rate in plantation (AC, LC, belowground woody parts and soil pools) was ranged 0.14-0.35 kg-C m(-2) y(-1) in simulations using parameters of phases (i)-(iii). Updating parameters by periodic field surveys reduced the uncertainty and revealed changes in ecophysiological characteristics with plant growth. This monitoring method should support management of afforestation projects by carbon fixation estimation adapting to observation gap, noncommon species and variable growing conditions such as climate change, land use change.

AB  - In this study, biomarkers, together with stable carbon (C-13) and hydrogen (D) isotopic compositions of n-alkanes have been examined in a suite of condensates collected from the East China Sea Shelf Basin (ECSSB) in order to delineate their source organic matter input, depositional conditions and evaluate their thermal maturity. Previously, GC-MS analyses have shown that all the condensates are formed in oxidizing environment with terrestrial plants as their main source input. No significant differences were apparent for biomarker parameters, likely due to the low biomarker content and high maturity of these condensates. Conventional GC-MS analysis however, may provides limited information on the sources and thermal maturity of complex mixtures due to insufficient component resolution. In the current study, we used comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOFMS) to increase the chromatographic resolution. Compounds such as alkyl cyclohexanes, alkyl cyclopentanes and diamondoids, which can be difficult to identify using conventional GC-MS analysis, were successfully identified using GCxGC-TOFMS. From our analyses we propose two possibly unreported indicators, including one maturity indicator (C-5(-)-cyclohexane/(+)(5)-cyclohexane) and one oxidation-reduction environment indicator (alkyl-cyclohexane/alkyl-cyclopentane). Multiple petroleum charging events were proposed as an explanation for the maturity indicators indexes discrepancy between methyl-phenanthrene index (MPI) and methyl-adamantane index (MDI). In addition, the stable isotopic results show that condensates from the Paleogene have significantly higher positive C-13 values of individual n-alkanes than the Neogene samples. Based on D values, the samples can be divided into two groups, the differences between which are likely to be attributed to different biosynthetic precursors. Variation within each group can likely be attributed to vaporization.

AB  - Background: Ethiopia is frequently cited as a country that is highly vulnerable to climate variability and change. The country's high vulnerability arises mostly from climate-sensitive agricultural sector that suffers a lot from risks associated with rainfall variability. The vulnerability factors (exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity) of the agricultural livelihoods to climate variability and change differ across agro-ecological systems (AESs). Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze AES-specific vulnerability of smallholder farmers to climate variability and change in the Fincha'a sub-basin. We surveyed 380 respondents from 4 AESs (highland, midland, wetland, and lowland) randomly selected. Furthermore, focus group discussion and key informant interviews were also performed to supplement and substantiate the quantitative data. Livelihood vulnerability index was employed to analyze the levels of smallholders' agriculture vulnerability to climate variability and change. Data on socioeconomic and biophysical attribute were collected and combined into the indices and vulnerability score was calculated for each agro-ecological system.
   Results: Considerable variation was observed across the agro-ecological systems in profile, indicator, and the three livelihood vulnerability indices-Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change dimensions (exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity) of vulnerability. The lowland AES exhibited higher exposure, low adaptive capacity, and high vulnerability, while the midland AES demonstrated lower exposure, higher adaptive capacity, and lower vulnerability. The wetland and highland AESs scored intermediate results.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that resilience-building adaptation strategies are vital to reduce the vulnerability of smallholder farmers. The measures taken should consider site-specific agro-ecological system requirements to reduce the vulnerability of smallholder mixed crop-livestock agriculture system. Since the approach based on the long-term realization of the community, any strategy designed based on such assessments is applicable to local condition.

AB  - Large-scale palaeovegetation reconstruction plays a critical role in improving our understanding of the response of vegetation to climate change and in reducing the uncertainty in predictions of vegetation change under global warming scenarios. Here, we present quantitative vegetation reconstructions for China since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), using 286 selected fossil pollen records analyzed using the biomization method. The results show that from 23 to 19 ka (1 ka = 1000 cal yr BP), steppe and desert expanded southeastwards, dominating northern China, whereas forest in eastern China shrank southwards to near the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River; the percentage of forested sites at this time was the lowest during the studied interval. Forest then developed gradually during 18-12 ka. During the early and middle Holocene, tropical seasonal forest, broad-leaved evergreen/warm mixed forest, and temperate deciduous forest shifted northwards by 2 degrees, 4 degrees and 5 degrees in latitude, respectively, relative to today, and then declined in the late Holocene. In detail, forest flourished in the middle Holocene (9-4 ka) in semi-arid and semi-humid northern China, whereas it reached a maximum in the early and middle Holocene (11.5-6 ka) in humid southern China. Our results suggest that although forest throughout China exhibited the expected response to the evolution of the East Asian summer monsoon, precipitation exerted a more significant effect on vegetation change in northern China, whereas temperature and precipitation played a more important role in southern China. Our results are a potentially useful reference for assessing future vegetation dynamics under global warming scenarios.

AB  - Evaporation rate is one of the key parameters in determining the ecological conditions and it has an irrefutable role in the proper management of water resources. In this paper, the efficiency of some data-driven techniques including support vector regression (SVR) and artificial neural networks (ANN) and combination of them with wavelet transforms (WSVR and WANN) were investigated for predicting evaporation rates at Tabriz (Iran) and Antalya (Turkey) stations. For evaluating the performances of studied techniques, four different statistical indicators were utilized namely the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), the correlation coefficient (R), and Nash-Sutcliffe ef?ciency (NSE). Additionally, Taylor diagrams were implemented to test the similarity among the observed and predicted data. Outcomes showed that at Tabriz station, the ANN3 (third input combination that are air temperatures and solar radiation used by ANN) with RMSE of 0.701, MAE of 0.525, R of 0.990 and NSE of 0.977 had better performances in comparison with WANN, SVR and WSVR. So, the wavelet transforms did not have positive effects in increasing the precision of ANN and SVR predictions at Tabriz station. Also, approximately the same trend was seen at Antalya station. In other words, ANN5 (fifth input combination that are air temperatures, relative humidity and solar radiation used by ANN) with RMSE of 0.923, MAE of 0.697, R of 0.962 and NSE of 0.898 had a more accurate predictions among others. Conversely, wavelet transform reduced the prediction errors of SVR at Antalya station. So, the WSVR5 with RMSE of 1.027, MAE of 0.728, R of 0.950 and NSE of 0.870 predicted evaporation rates of Antalya station more precisely than other SVR models. As a conclusion, results from the current study proved that ANN provided reasonable trends for evaporation modeling at both Tabriz and Antalya stations.

AB  - Mechanized harvesting of shrub formations as part of sustainable forest management not only helps reduce the risk of forest fires in Mediterranean environments but also provides economic benefit from the extracted biomass, contributing to the development of the bioeconomy. However, these mechanized operations require an environmental impact assessment to identify the short-term impacts, both positive and negative. This is especially important in the Mediterranean basin given the specific climatic conditions which exist. In this study, the environmental impact of mechanized shrub harvesting is analyzed in relation to (i) changes in biodiversity and in the presence and growth of species; (ii) physical and chemical properties of the soil; and (iii) changes in forest fire risk. For this purpose, a pre-harvest inventory was conducted and post-harvest monitoring schedules of 1- and 2-year durations were established in three characteristic Mediterranean shrubland formations located in the northern-central area of the Iberian Peninsula. Our results reveal that the recovery rates in biodiversity indices after harvesting were very high, with values ranging from 30 to 70% depending on the site. Two years after harvesting, the species coverage was similar to the pre-harvest scenario in some locations, although not with regards to height, the ericaceous species being those with the greatest sprouting capacity. Significant changes in the physical and chemical properties of soils were also observed. In this regard, negative impacts such as soil compaction or slight acidification were identified at some sites. However, positive effects were also found such as an increment in carbon and nitrogen content after harvesting, along with increased litter quantity a year from the clearing operation due to biomass residue left on the ground after harvesting. Furthermore, mechanical harvesting effectively modified fire behavior in all the shrub formations 2 years after clearing, with a notable reduction in fire risk at all the studied sites.

AB  - Nitrite (NO2-) contamination of water can severely impact the health of aquatic life and is a major concern for commercial aquaculture. In order to study the effect of nitrite on Aristichthys nobilis, we investigated the oxygen-carrying capacity, NF-kappa B/HIF-1 alpha pathway, and the gill tissue structure under nitrite stress. In the current study, bighead carp (initial weight 180.05 +/- 0.092 g) were exposed to nitrite (48.634 mg/L) for 96 h and then for 96 h recovery test. After nitrite exposure for 6 h, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) mRNA expression increased significantly in the gill of bighead carp (P < 0.05). After nitrite exposure for 12 h, hemoglobin (Hb) and methemoglobin reductase (MHBR) content in blood decreased significantly (P < 0.05); TLR4 mRNA expression increased significantly (P < 0.05). After nitrite exposure for 24 h, methemoglobin (MetHb) content increased significantly (P < 0.05). After recovery test, all the indicators except TLR4 mRNA expression level recovered to initial level. In conclusion, nitrite exposure can affect hemoglobin dynamics, as oxidization of nitrite by hemoglobin results in the reduction of Hb to MetHb leading to hypoxia and nitrite exposure can also result into gill tissue damage. In the face of nitrite exposure, NF-kappa B and HIF-1 alpha mRNA expression level increased immediately to protect the body from oxidative damage and eased hypoxic condition caused by nitrite. It was also observed that nitrite damage is recoverable in Aristichthys nobilis, but it may be need more than 96 h.

AB  - Biosolids are an important potential source of plant-available nutrients and also contain valuable quantities of stable organic matter, which can provide long-term benefits to soil structure and fertility. In this study, the long-term impacts of biosolids recycling to agricultural land on soil quality and fertility were assessed using established experimental platforms at four sites in England with contrasting soil types and agroclimatic conditions. At each site, treatment plots that had received 20 annual additions of biosolids (i.e., three types of digested sludge cake) at rates of 2.9 to 3.4 t ha(-1) y(-1) since 1994 were used in comparison with an untreated control treatment (which had received inorganic fertilizers only) to quantify the effects of biosolids on soil physical, chemical, and biological properties. Significant increases (P < 0.05) in soil organic matter (SOM) of 10% to 17% and in "light fraction" SOM(up to 2.9 mg kg(-1) on the biosolids treatment compared with 1.8 mg kg(-1) on the untreated control), along with a significant (P < 0.01) increase of up to 10% in available water capacity and numerical increases in water infiltration rate and aggregate stability, were found in plots that received biosolids. These plots also had significant (P < 0.05) increases of up to 20%, 48%, and 30% in soil total nitrogen, extractable phosphorus, and total sulfur, respectively. Earthworm numbers and weights were approximately doubled relative to the untreated control (P < 0.05) where low-metal biosolids had been applied. These results indicate that applying biosolids to agricultural land is an important means of replenishing and maintaining SOM levels. Importantly, no adverse effects on crop quality were observed. The results from this study provided valuable evidence toward maintaining a sustainable agricultural landbank for biosolids recycling in the United Kingdom.

AB  - Bats act as important bioindicators of environmental changes, including climate disruptions. In the Rocky Mountain West, that includes western Colorado, the pace of climate warming outpaces other areas of North America. Using data on bats captured between 1996 and 2015 we found significant trends towards male-bias (R-2 = 0.38) over the 20-year period for both adults and juveniles. Capture data for juveniles showed markedly less females captured than males after 2000, hitting all-time lows in 2000, 2002, and 2007 (R-2 = 0.12). When juvenile captures were plotted against an index of annual monthly temperatures for the June, July, and August, divided by annual precipitation for the same months (T/P index) we found that sex ratios favored males at the extreme ends of the spectrum (cooler/wetter and hotter/drier), however, male-biased outcomes were much more prevalent in hotter/drier years. We found that nearly 1:1 sex ratios occurred within an optimal range of temperature and precipitation that peaked at 28.7 degrees C with 7.5 cm precipitation. To explore the possible impacts of future climate conditions on sex ratios, we used juvenile capture data to build a predictive logistic regression model and projected it through year 2090 using four carbon emission scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5). All scenarios showed overall declining proportions of females in future years. Thus, mitigation of climate change on bat populations must take into account not only reproductive declines in some species, but also shifting sex ratio outcomes towards increasing male abundances in populations.

AB  - Human disturbance is widespread across landscapes in the form of roads that alter wildlife populations. Knowing which road features are responsible for the species response and their relevance in comparison with environmental variables will provide useful information for effective conservation measures. We sampled relative abundance of European rabbits, a very widespread species, in motorway verges at regional scale, in an area with large variability in environmental and infrastructure conditions. Environmental variables included vegetation structure, plant productivity, distance to water sources, and altitude. Infrastructure characteristics were the type of vegetation in verges, verge width, traffic volume, and the presence of embankments. We performed a variance partitioning analysis to determine the relative importance of two sets of variables on rabbit abundance. Additionally, we identified the most important variables and their effects model averaging after model selection by AICc on hypothesis-based models. As a group, infrastructure features explained four times more variability in rabbit abundance than environmental variables, being the effects of the former critical in motorway stretches located in altered landscapes with no available habitat for rabbits, such as agricultural fields. Model selection and Akaike weights showed that verge width and traffic volume are the most important variables explaining rabbit abundance index, with positive and negative effects, respectively. In the light of these results, the response of species to the infrastructure can be modulated through the modification of motorway features, being some of them manageable in the design phase. The identification of such features leads to suggestions for improvement through low-cost corrective measures and conservation plans. As a general indication, keeping motorway verges less than 10m wide will prevent high densities of rabbits and avoid the unwanted effects that rabbit populations can generate in some areas.

AB  - Genomic prediction was evaluated in German winter barley breeding lines. In this material, prediction ability is strongly influenced by population structure and main determinant of prediction ability is the close genetic relatedness of the breeding material.
   To ensure breeding progress under changing environmental conditions the implementation and evaluation of new breeding methods is of crucial importance. Modern breeding approaches like genomic selection may significantly accelerate breeding progress. We assessed the potential of genomic prediction in a training population of 750 genotypes, consisting of multiple six-rowed winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) elite material families and old cultivars, which reflect the breeding history of barley in Germany. Crosses of parents selected from the training set were used to create a set of double-haploid families consisting of 750 genotypes. Those were used to confirm prediction ability estimates based on a cross-validation with the training set material using 11 different genomic prediction models. Population structure was inferred with dimensionality reduction methods like discriminant analysis of principle components and the influence of population structure on prediction ability was investigated. In addition to the size of the training set, marker density is of crucial importance for genomic prediction. We used genome-wide linkage disequilibrium and persistence of linkage phase as indicators to estimate that 11,203 evenly spaced markers are required to capture all QTL effects. Although a 9k SNP array does not contain a sufficient number of polymorphic markers for long-term genomic selection, we obtained fairly high prediction accuracies ranging from 0.31 to 0.71 for the traits earing, hectoliter weight, spikes per square meter, thousand kernel weight and yield and show that they result from the close genetic relatedness of the material. Our work contributes to designing long-term genetic prediction programs for barley breeding.

AB  - The purpose of the article lies in the reconstruction of the process of leisure founding and forming as cultural phenomena by Homer's works ("Iliad", "Odyssey") and Hesiod" s works ("Teogoniya," "Works and Day"). Methodology. The research methodology lies in applying of the set of comparative, historical and systemic methods that allows to determine the preconditions of leisure founding and forming as cultural phenomena; to justify its social significance in the daily life of the Greeks in the archaic period. The scientific novelty of the research lies in that at first of study of culture was implemented the comparative analysis of Homer' and Hesiod's works in the context of its presenting of process of leisure founding and forming in the Ancient Greece of archaic period; was justified the social significance of leisure and work and leisure correlation in daily life of free Greek; was characterized the specificity of "ideal" leisure; was revealed the meaningful content of "leisure life". Conclusion. It was proved that Homer's works present the leisure as the important indicator of social status, which differ free Greek from the slave; the leisure is useful, full of hunting, different competitions and athletic games, the leisure that caused damnation was reduced to feasts, idleness, and mischief. It was emphasized that "Works and Day" Hesiod's work is the first which present the questions of work and leisure correlation in daily life of peasant and small landowner; was revealed the "leisure life" as that is characterized by favorable living conditions, joyful and carefree labor, material wealth and entertainment, natural death like sleep. It was argued the preconditions of leisure founding as cultural phenomena in Ancient Greece among them are: the religious character of society; Greek culture competition with its cults of fame and victory; personal art activity; understanding of freedom as the absence of oppression of man and total regulation its behavior.

AB  - The main policies of China have promoted the development of the urbanization and the industrialization. The rise of infrastructure energy consumption shows the process of modernization in our country; however, despite there are a lot of researches about the energy consumption in the field of construction, transportation and other infrastructure, in academia, there are less statistics about energy consumption for the infrastructure as a whole, and its proportion in total energy consumption in the whole country. Thus, this paper tries to characterize infrastructures of China, which include construction, transportation, energy, water supply and drainage, post and telecommunication system by establishing an estimation model of infrastructure system CO2 emissions through national official macro-level statistical data. We employ the simplified LCCO(2)A method to analyze the activities in each stage and calculate associated CO2 emissions throughout infrastructures' whole life cycle in China from 1993 to 2012. The results show that CO2 emissions from the infrastructure have rapidly grown over the past decades. The total emissions of the standard coal were 888.16 million tons in 1993, up to about 7.76 billion tons in 2012. The operation stage emissions dominate over the infrastructure emissions, accounting for 80-90 % of the impact. In this paper, on the one hand, from the perspective of the overall environmental benefits, we provide a more comprehensive environmental assessment analysis method for the policy makers. On the other hand, the infrastructure construction of China has periodic characteristic. We analyze the specific features of the infrastructure CO2 emissions in different stages, and put forward emission-reduction measures in consideration of the current conditions, which reflects that the key of balancing the relationship between modernization and environment is adjusting emission reduction policy according to different stages to adapt to the "new normal". In addition, the method development is also important for future quantifications of CO2 emissions of other sectors in China and beyond.

AB  - AimEnvironmental impact assessments (EIAs) often involve establishing whether a species of concern is present at the site considered for development. When surveys falsely conclude that sites are unoccupied, species prevalence in the region is cumulatively reduced. We argue that setting an acceptable level of induced decline in species occurrence provides a defensible strategy to determine minimum survey effort requirements. We investigate methods for setting such requirements.
   LocationEastern Australia, although we demonstrate methods applicable wherever species detection data are available to inform survey design.
   MethodsWe use probability theory to investigate required survey effort when aiming to limit decline in species occurrence. We use optimization tools to provide a method that, in addition, minimizes overall survey costs. We demonstrate the methods using data for an Australian gliding marsupial.
   ResultsA method based on ensuring a constant probability of occupied site misclassification directly links with a prescribed acceptable decline in occurrence. Optimization results indicate that, under particular conditions, a cost-efficient survey effort allocation can be achieved by setting a constant posterior probability of occupancy at sites where the species is not detected, provided the target level is set in accordance with the acceptable decline in occurrence. Our results provide a critical examination of the approach recently proposed by Wintle etal. (2012) for determining minimum survey effort requirements.
   Main conclusionsEIA survey effort requirements should explicitly link uncertainty in establishing species absence with the broader consequences of failing to detect species presence in places subject to proposed impacts. A direct method, which involves keeping a constant probability of occupied site misclassification, only requires information about species detectability. Alternatively, a method that minimizes overall survey costs can be used. This approach also requires occupancy probability estimates so its performance relies on availability of an informative species distribution model.

AB  - Background: Many minerotrophic fens in Central Europe have undergone similar sequences of land-use transformation. Drained and used as meadows or pastures for decades in the twentieth century, they were abandoned in the 1990s due to changes in agricultural economics. This sequence of land-use change has a severe impact on vegetation and is likely to initiate secondary succession and is possibly leading to an impoverishment in species diversity and to taxonomic homogenisation.
   Aims: We assess the impact of agricultural use and subsequent abandonment on vegetation composition in a percolation fen in north Germany and characterise successional changes and changes in abiotic site conditions.
   Methods: In 2010, we resampled 77 plots of a phytosociological survey from 1967-1970 in a lowland percolation mire complex in the lower Recknitz valley, north-east Germany. These included three characteristic vegetation types of percolation fens. To investigate and quantify vegetation changes we used dissimilarity measures, diversity metrics and ecological species indicator values.
   Results: Overall species richness declined only slightly while there was a more pronounced decrease in species richness at the plot level in all recorded vegetation types, resulting in increased beta diversity. Generalist and nitrophilous species increased in abundance, indicating ongoing succession.
   Conclusions: Drainage for agricultural use and subsequent abandonment has long-lasting effects. Altered hydrological and nutrient status of the fen soil has initiated secondary succession. There is indication of an extinction debt that in the future may lead to an impoverishment of species diversity in the area. Conservation of open mesotrophic fen species may thus only be achieved if moderate use is continued and hydrologic conservation measures are applied on wide contiguous areas.

AB  - The depth of myometrial infiltration by endometrial cancer is an important prognostic factor. The examination of the depth of infiltration classifies the, patients in the low- and high-risk groups, which influences the therapeutic approach. Transvaginal ultrasonography represents a first-choice diagnostic test for the assessment of the depth of myometrial infiltration as the time consumption and financial demands of magnetic resonance imaging need to be taken into account. In comparison with the M RI, the diagnostic accuracy of the transvaginal ultrasound depends more on the individual experience and professional potential of the examining physician. This fact can contribute to the heterogeneity of published results of transvaginal ultrasound on the determination of infiltration depth. Having in mind the aim to verify these indicators in our local conditions and environment, we decided to prospectively study 150 endometrial cancer patients who were examined with the transvaginal ultrasound in the period 1/2009 - 10/2011. Correlated firstly with the preoperative and then secondly with the definitive histopathological examination was the depth-of-infiltration-related data that had been taken from the ultrasound findings. The output being monitored was the exclusion or confirmation of the invasion exceeding half the thickness of myometrium. In our study, the diagnostic accuracy of the method reached 82.67%, while the other indicators were as follows: sensitivity 92.31 %, specificity 79.28 %, positive predictive value (PPV) 61.02 %, negative predictive value (NPV) 96.7 %, the likelihood ratio of a positive test 4.455 and the likelihood ratio of a negative test 0.097. The results of the depth of myometrial infiltration examination and their comparison with the data from similarly oriented clinical studies entitle us to include this examination in the set of standard preoperative methods used for the examination of patients with endometrial cancer (Tab. 3, Fig. 5, Ref. 20).

AB  - Geochemical tools, including the analysis of stable isotopes from fossil mammals, are often used to infer regional climatic and environmental differences. We have further developed an oxygen isotope aridity index and used oxygen (delta O-18) isotope values and carbon (delta C-13) isotope values to assess regional climatic differences between the southeastern and southwestern United States during the Pleistocene. Using data collected from previously published studies, we assigned taxa to evaporation-sensitivity categories by quantifying the frequency and magnitude of aridity index values (i.e., an average taxon delta O-18 value minus a site specific proboscidean delta O-18 value). Antilocapridae, Camelidae, Equidae, and Cervidae were identified as evaporation-sensitive families, meaning that a majority of their water comes from the food they eat, thus indicating that they are more likely to capture changing climatic conditions. Bovidae, Tayassuidae, and Tapiridae were identified as less sensitive families, possibly because of increased or more variable drinking behavior. While it is difficult to tease out individual influences on delta O-18 values in tooth enamel, the use of an aridity index will provide a more in-depth look at relative aridity in the fossil record. Greater aridity index values in the Southwest suggest a drier climate than in the Southeast during the Pleistocene, and delta C-13 values suggest that diet does not determine evaporation sensitivity. The combination of more-positive delta C-13 values and the lack of forest indicator taxa in the Southwest suggest that landscapes were more open than in the Southeast. Inferred higher aridity in the Southwest may indicate that aridity or seasonal aridity/precipitation, not temperature or pCO(2), was a greater driver of C-4 abundance during the Pleistocene. Collectively, these data suggest that regional climatic and environmental interpretations can be improved by using an aridity index and a more detailed understanding of mammalian paleobiology.

AB  - Nine small (2.2-2.9 ha) and four large (70-135 ha) watersheds in East Texas, USA, were instrumented to compare herbicide runoff under different silvicultural systems with best management practices (BMPs). Two treatments were evaluated: conventional, with clearcutting, aerial herbicide site preparation, and hand-applied banded herbaceous release; and intensive, in which subsoiling, aerial fertilization, and a 2nd-year aerial herbicide application were added. Herbicides were applied as operational tank mixes. The highest imazapyr concentration found in stream water was 39 mu g L-1 during the first storm after application (23 days after treatment [DAT]) and in-stream concentrations during runoff events dropped to <1 mu g L-1 in all streams by 150 DAT. The highest hexazinone concentration was 8 mu g L-1 for the banded application and 35 mu g L-1 for the broadcast application the following year and fell to <1 mu g L-1 in all streams by 140 DAT. The highest sulfometuron methyl concentration found during a runoff event was 4 mu g L-1 and fell to <1 mu g L-1 in all streams by 80 DAT. Approximately 1-2% of applied imazapyr and <1% of hexazinone and sulfometuron methyl were measured in storm runoff. Herbicide was found in streams during storm events only (all herbicides were <1 mu g L-1 in all true baseflow samples), and peak concentrations during runoff events persisted for relatively short times (<24 h). These results suggest that silvicultural herbicide applications implemented with contemporary BMPs are unlikely to result in chronic exposure of aquatic biota; therefore, herbicide use under these conditions is unlikely to degrade surface waters.

AB  - Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) is considered an important habitat for juvenile and small forage fish species, but many long-term recruitment surveys do not effectively monitor fish communities in SAV. To better understand the impact of recent large increases of SAV on the fish community in tidal freshwater reaches of the Potomac River, we compared traditional seine sampling from shore with drop ring sampling of SAV beds (primarily Hydrilla) in a shallow water (depths, < 1.5 m) embayment, Gunston Cove. To accomplish this, we developed species-specific catch efficiency values for the seine gear and calculated area-based density in both shoreline and SAV habitats in late summer of three different years (2007, 2008, and 2009). For the dominant species (Fundulus diaphanus, Lepomis macrochirus, Etheostoma olmstedi, Morone americana, Lepomis gibbosus, and Fundulus heteroclitus), density was nearly always higher in SAV, but overall, species richness was highest in shoreline habitats sampled with seines. Although historical monitoring of fish in Gunston Cove (and throughout Chesapeake Bay) is based upon seine sampling (and trawl sampling in deeper areas), the high densities of fish and larger areal extent of SAV indicated that complementary sampling of SAV habitats would produce more accurate trends in abundances of common species. Because drop ring samples cover much less area than seines and may miss rare species, a combination of methods that includes seine sampling is needed for biodiversity assessment. The resurgence of SAV in tidal freshwater signifies improving water quality, and methods we evaluated here support improved inferences about population trends and fish community structure as indicators of ecosystem condition.

AB  - Walking speed is a fundamental indicator for human well-being. In a clinical setting, walking speed is typically measured by means of walking tests using different protocols. However, walking speed obtained in this way is unlikely to be representative of the conditions in a free-living environment. Recently, mobile accelerometry has opened up the possibility to extract walking speed from long-time observations in free-living individuals, but the validity of these measurements needs to be determined. In this investigation, we have developed algorithms for walking speed prediction based on 3D accelerometry data (actibelt (R)) and created a framework using a standardized data set with gold standard annotations to facilitate the validation and comparison of these algorithms. For this purpose 17 healthy subjects operated a newly developed mobile gold standard while walking/running on an indoor track. Subsequently, the validity of 12 candidate algorithms for walking speed prediction ranging from well-known simple approaches like combining step length with frequency to more sophisticated algorithms such as linear and non-linear models was assessed using statistical measures. As a result, a novel algorithm employing support vector regression was found to perform best with a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.93 (95% CI 0.92-0.94) and a coverage probability CP1 of 0.46 (95% CI 0.12-0.70) for a deviation of 0.1 m/s (CP2 0.78, CP3 0.94) when compared to the mobile gold standard while walking indoors. A smaller outdoor experiment confirmed those results with even better coverage probability. We conclude that walking speed thus obtained has the potential to help establish walking speed in free-living environments as a patient-oriented outcome measure.

KW  - HYDROLOGY
AB  - The aim of this study is to produce future scenarios on the river inputs of water and nutrients (nitrate and phosphate) into the Mediterranean and Black Sea. They are based on the four contrasting scenarios that were developed by the Millenium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) for the years 2030 and 2050 and implemented in a spatially explicit manner into the IMAGE model. We first identified the major drivers of the river fluxes by regression analyses, then tested the retained models against the past evolutions between 1970 and 2000, and finally applied the models to the MEA scenarios. For nutrients, the considered river data mainly refer to the large rivers for which long-term time series exist (Rhone, Po, Ebro, and Danube). Here, recent trends were principally driven by fertilizer spreads (NO3, PO4), together with urban wastewater releases (PO4). Future trends remain in the envelope of the observed variability during the last 40 years, both for the large rivers and, when extrapolated to the basin scales, also for the entire Mediterranean and Black Sea. At regional scales, however, the budgets considerably change. In the northern parts of the Mediterranean drainage basin, they uniformly tend to decrease, but they may strongly increase in the south and east. Water discharge is examined on a basis of 37 rivers, showing that this parameter is clearly linked to the evolution of climate. Because of the ongoing evolution toward dryer and warmer conditions, we predict a significant trend of decreasing freshwater fluxes for the future, which already started in the past. Regional hot spots for this decrease are the drainage basin of the Alboran Sea and, when also considering the inhabitant specific water fluxes, the basins of the Aegean and north Levantine seas.

AB  - Based on the Pressure-State-Response (P-S-R) approach, an index system for landscape ecological security (LES) was suggested using three dimensions, six factors, and three weights. The indicators in the system were divided into two groups: spatial interpolation (acquired by the remote sensing data) and non-spatial interpolation (acquired by consultation with experts). According to data of 2003 and 2006, coupled with current tendencies, the early warning method was classified into four categories: security and degradation, sub-security and slow degradation, sub-security and rapid degradation, and insecurity. Our research with early warning method finds three interesting phenomena: (1) mean value of LES in 2003 was 0.586, indicating medium security; while in 2006 it was 0.650, an upper medium security. The LES level within each districts of Xiamen in 2006 was better than the level in 2003. In terms of LES, the comprehensive condition within each district of Xiamen in 2006 was enhanced compared with 2003. Overall, there was improvement in 80.5% of areas from 2003 to 2006, showing promising signs of positive development. (2) The LES of Xiang'an District and Jimei District were in stages of high early warning given that the percentage of land in these districts that showed symptoms of insecurity and degradation was 41.03 and 34.89%, respectively. (3) On the whole, the areas that showed notable signs of insecurity and rapid landscape, and which can already be identified as early warning areas requiring immediate attention, correspond closely with the distribution of coastal industrial parks in these regions. In conclusion, the consequences of rapid industrialization and urbanization are far reaching and affect local and regional ecological security. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Extensive observations were made during the late Southwest Monsoon of 2004 over the Indian and Omani shelves, and along a transect that extended from the southern coast of Oman to the central west coast of India, tracking the southern leg of the US JGOFS expedition (1994-1995) in the west. The data are used, in conjunction with satellite-derived data, to investigate long-term trends in chlorophyll and sea surface temperature, indicators of upwelling intensity, and to understand factors that control primary production (PP) in the Arabian Sea, focussing on the role of iron. Our results do not support an intensification of upwelling in the western Arabian Sea, reported to have been caused by the decline in the winter/spring Eurasian snow cover since 1997. We also noticed, for the first time, an unexpected development of high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll condition off the southern Omani coast. This feature, coupled with other characteristics of the system, such as a narrow shelf and relatively low iron concentrations in surface waters, suggest a close similarity between the Omani upwelling system and the Peruvian and California upwelling systems, where PP is limited by iron. Iron limitation of PP may complicate simple relationship between upwelling and PP assumed by previous workers, and contribute to the anomalous offshore occurrence of the most severe oxygen (O-2) depletion in the region. Over the much wider Indian shelf, which experiences large-scale bottom water O-2-depletion in summer, adequate iron supply from reducing bottom-waters and sediments seems to support moderately high PP; however, such production is restricted to the thin, oxygenated surface layer, probably because of the unsuitability of the O-2-depleted environment for the growth of oxygenic photosynthesizers.

AB  - Context. Assessing the viability of animal populations in the wild is difficult or impossible, primarily because of limited data. However, there is an urgent need to develop methods for estimating population sizes and improving the viability of target species.
   Aims. To define suitable habitat for sambar (Cervus unicolor), banteng (Bos javanicus), gaur (Bos gaurus), Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) and tiger (Panthera tigris) in the Western Forest Complex, Thailand, and to assess their current status as well as estimate how the landscape needs to be managed to maintain viable populations.
   Methods. The present paper demonstrates a method for combining a rapid ecological assessment, landscape indices, GIS-based wildlife-habitat models, and knowledge of minimum viable population sizes to guide landscape-management decisions and improve conservation outcomes through habitat restoration.
   Key results. The current viabilities for gaur and elephant are fair, whereas they are poor for tiger and banteng. However, landscape quality outside the current distributions was relatively intact for all species, ranging from moderate to high levels of connectivity. In addition, the population viability for sambar is very good under the current and desired conditions.
   Conclusions. If managers in this complex wish to upgrade the viabilities of gaur, elephant, tiger and banteng within the next 10 years, park rangers and stakeholders should aim to increase the amount of usable habitat by similar to 2170 km(2) or 17% of existing suitable habitats. The key strategies are to reduce human pressures, enhance ungulate habitats and increase connectivity of suitable habitats outside the current distributions.
   Implications. The present paper provides a particularly useful method for managers and forest-policy planners for assessing and managing habitat suitability for target wildlife and their population viability in protected-area networks where knowledge of the demographic attributes (e.g. birth and death rates) of wildlife populations are too limited to perform population viability analysis.

AB  - Major changes to the extent and quality of farmland habitats, brought by the intensification of agricultural practice, are thought to be the main factors driving declines in a suite of farmland bird species in Europe. Recent changes in agricultural techniques have also contributed to widespread soil degradation, arising from increased soil exposure to erosion forces, declining soil organic content and increasing soil compaction. Although soils have a fundamental influence on ecosystem properties, the implications of soil degradation for farmland biodiversity have received little attention. In this study, we measure the influence of soil conditions on the distribution of a declining insectivorous farmland bird, the yellow wagtail Motacilla flava, relative to other habitat features in arable fields. Soil penetrability was found to have a significant influence on the abundance of territorial yellow wagtails at the field scale, together with crop type. Other measured habitat features had little effect on territory abundance, including soil organic content, crop height (within preferred crop types), field boundary habitats and availability of bare ground. Monitoring of invertebrate abundance across 20 cereal fields revealed a significant influence of both soil penetrability and soil organic content on aerial invertebrate capture rates. This relationship was strongest during the latter part of the breeding season, implying that settling yellow wagtails could use soil penetrability as a predictive indicator of prey abundance during the chick-rearing period. The strong relationship between yellow wagtails and soil penetrability suggests a potential causative link between soil degradation and population decline. The role of soils in determining abundance patterns and population declines of other farmland species may have been overlooked in previous studies. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) pools are important in maintaining soil productivity and influencing the CO2 loading into the atmosphere. An attempt is made here to investigate into the dynamics of pools of SOC viz., total organic carbon (C (tot)), oxidisable organic carbon (C (oc)) and its four different fractions such as very labile (C (frac 1)), labile (C (frac 2)), less labile (C (frac 3)) and non-labile (C (frac 4)), microbial biomass carbon (C (mic)), mineralizable carbon (C (min)), and particulate organic carbon (C (p)) in relation to crop productivity using a 34 year old rice (Oryza sativa L)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L)-jute (Corchorus olitorius L) cropping system with different management strategies (no fertilization, only N, NP, NPK and NPK+FYM) in the hot humid, subtropics of India. A fallow treatment was also included to compare the impact of cultivation vis-a-vis no cultivation. Cultivation over the years caused a net decrease, while balanced fertilization with NPK maintained the SOC pools at par with the fallow. Only 22% of the C applied as FYM was stabilized into SOC, while the rest got lost. Of the analysed pools, C (frac 1), C (mic), C (p) and C (min) were influenced most by the treatments imposed. Most of the labile pools were significantly correlated with each other and with the yield and sustainable yield index (SYI) of the studied system. Of them, C (frac1), C (min), C (mic) and C (p) explained higher per cent variability in the SYI and yield of the crops. Results suggest that because of low cost and ease of estimation and also for upkeeping environmental conditions, C (frac1) may be used as a good indicator for assessment of soil as to its crop productivity.

AB  - Low soil fertility is one of the greatest biophysical constraints to agricultural production in sub-Saharan Africa. "Improved fallow," an agroforestry-based soil fertility replenishment technology was developed in response to the depletion of soil fertility and increasing difficulty of small-scale farmers to afford mineral fertilizers. The biophysical performance of the technology to improve soil fertility and increase crop yield has been well demonstrated and efforts are being made to enhance the adoption its adoption by farmers. There is relatively little information and systematic feedback regarding farmers' perception and knowledge of the technology. Using data collected from a stratified sample of 302 farmers in Zambia, this study analyzed farmers' knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of soil fertility and food Security problems, highlighting implications for user acceptability and the development of sustainable soil fertility management technologies. Results show that farmers have good understanding of soil fertility issues, its linkage to food security and household welfare indicators. They appreciate improved fallow because it responds to the critical problems of low soil fertility and provides additional benefits to the household. However, there are some challenges to the widespread uptake of the technology including land constraints, property rights availability of seeds, and knowledge-intensive nature of the technology. Farmer acceptability and improved adoption of the technology will be influenced by the extent to which efforts are taken to meet these challenaes. Farmers' response on knowledge, attitude, and perception provides valuable inputs for further development and modification of the technology. Beyond technology development, an understanding of farmers' preference and other contextual issues-within which the technology is expected to be adopted-will enable researchers to develop appropriate sustainable technologies and enhance user acceptability of the same. The study shows that technical characteristics are important but not exclusive conditions for farmers' acceptability and adoption of good agricultural technologies by farmers.

AB  - Seabirds have often been proposed as environmental indicators. Beached bird data may provide an additional data source and such data is efficacious because it can reliably be collected by volunteers. In addition to anthropogenic factors, such as oil spills, changes in the ocean-atmosphere can affect carcass beaching rate in 3 non-exclusive ways: (1) direct mortality following storms, (2) mortality via bottom-up food web processes, and (3) increase in carcass delivery due to shifts in surface water movement. We used data from 3 volunteer-based beached bird data sets collected within the California Current System (CCS) to (1) examine the level of response to anomalous ocean conditions in 2005 and (2) explore the degree to which long-term beaching patterns could be explained by one or more of our proposed mechanisms. In 2005, anomalous die-offs of Cassin's auklet Ptychorhamphus aleuticus and the rhinoceros auklet Cerorhinca monocerata occurred in the winter in Monterey. By spring, anomalous die-offs of Brandt's cormorant Phalacrocorax pencillatus and the common murre Uria aalge occurred throughout the CCS. Over the longer term, increases in beaching were associated with changes in the timing and intensity of upwelling and, secondarily, with zonal winds aloft-a potential proxy of shifts in pelagic community composition. These results suggest that a bottom-up food web mechanism best explains seabird beaching, at least in the spring. Correlations of local measures of storminess to seabird beaching rates were weak to non-existent. Correlations were much stronger at the California site (8 yr) and weaker to non-existent at the Oregon site (26 yr). Collectively, these data suggest that relationships between ocean physics and beached bird response may be site specific and/or may reflect choices live birds make vis-a-vis non-breeding distribution.

AB  - Palaeobotanical analysis and radiocarbon dating of lake sediments from Bachalpsee (2265 m a.s.l.), a small lake above the present-day timber-line in the northern Swiss Alps reveals that the region was already deglaciated during the Younger Dryas. The sediment record is dominated by long-distance transported pollen that originates from lowland vegetation but the plant macrofossils give evidence of the local vegetation development. Comparison with palaeobotanical results from three sites along an altitudinal transect permits the reconstruction of the regional timber-line history. Throughout the entire Holocene the catchment of Bachalpsee consisted of a mosaic of open meadows and dwarf shrubs (Salix, Vaccinium, Rhododendron). Chironomid and cladoceran assemblages suggest that the early to mid-Holocene was the warmest interval at Bachalpsee. Comparison of the palaeobotanical results with those from the mire "Feld" (2130 m a.s.l.) in the vicinity of Bachalpsee showed that during the mid-Holocene the timber-line was formed by Pinus cembra and Picea abies with some scattered Abies alba trees and was situated close to Bachalpsee but never reached its catchment. The maximum timber-line in the Northern Alps was reached between 6000 and 3000 cal B.P. which is several millennia later than in the Central Alps. The species composition of the tree-line (Abies alba, Pinus cembra and the absence of Larix decidua) points to less continental and moister climatic conditions compared with the central Alps during the early to mid-Holocene. From 3000 cal B.P. onwards the timber-line was lowered by human deforestation with the most intense pulses of human impact occurring since the Middle Ages. The catchment of Bachalpsee has been used as alpine pasture since the Bronze Age.

AB  - Soil screening could be a process of identifying and defining areas, contaminants, and condition at the sites that warrant further attention for developing ecological risk assessments. In present work, a total of 41 surface soil samples from Tianjin, China were sampled and the soil organic extracts were evaluated using a battery of in vitro cell bioassays. The battery included ethoxyresorfin O-deethylase (EROD) with H4IIE rat hepatoma cells bioassay for Aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor (Ah-agonists) effects, the SOS/umu bioassay for genotoxic effects, and human estrogen receptor recombinant yeast bioassay for estrogenic effects. The results have showed that total estrogenic effects in these soil samples was measured to be between 0.1 and 14.2 ng EEQ kg(-1) soil (d.w.); Ah-agonists effects assayed by EROD bioassay varied from 2.8 ng TEQ kg(-1) soil (d.w.) to 42.6 ng TEQ kg(-1) soil (d.w.), and the amounts of soil weight required for the extracts to lead positive result (IR 2.0) in the SOS/umu bioassay were between 3.9 and 31.3 mg (d.w.) per well. In addition, the geographic distributions of Ah-agonists effects and genotoxic effects in Tianjin area exhibited a strong positive correlation with each other. However, the distribution of estrogenic effects with high levels in northwest Tianjin was markedly different from that of Ah-agonists effects, where the high levels were distributed in the urban of Tianjin, as well as coastal towns. It has been concluded that the toxicity assessment of surface soil using a battery of in vitro cell bioassays could provided meaningful information regarding characterization procedure in ecological risk assessment.

AB  - Phomopsis stem canker (Diaporthe helianthi Munt.-Cvet. et al.) causes drastic reductions in yield and oil content in the sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) crop. The use of disease-tolerant genotypes and fungicides is the basis of current disease control. Both for economic and environmental reasons, control by means of cultural practices should be promoted more. From 1992 to 2002, INRA and Cetiom collaborated to study the effects of sunflower crop management on the frequency and severity of Phomopsis attacks. As plant density and nitrogen rate significantly affect the development of sunflower leaf area, use of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation intercepted by the canopy (fPARi) was suggested as a synthetic indicator of canopy management. In 1994, an exponential relation was observed between the proportion of sunflower stems bearing a Phomopsis lesion in mid-August and the fPARi by the canopy at anthesis in early July. This relation was successfully tested for a range of unprotected situations (1994-2000) corresponding to moderate infection pressure and various combinations of plant density and N fertilization. Such a reference curve was used to analyse the response of sunflower to stem canker infection in a range of cultural conditions: (1) high inoculum; (2) drought during head development or soon after leaf infection; (3) application of a fungicide at the early stages of flower bud development; (4) late sowing (May); (5) use of very susceptible or resistant Genotypes. This simple model could help to interpret the origin of genotypic susceptibility to stem canker (crop architecture and/ or physiology) and also to predict the potential risk of disease development for a given management scenario.

AB  - Cumulative effects (CEs) result from the combined effect of multiple activities over space or time. This implies a persistence through time and often a transmittal mechanism through space. Environmental legislation often requires a broader CE assessment in addition to the more direct. project-specific impacts. Current efforts to evaluate and manage CEs are hampered by the conceptual problems of defining the key issues. specifying the appropriate spatial and temporal scales, and determining the numerous interactions and indirect effects. These problems can be greatly alleviated by following an explicit process. The process proposed in this paper includes a scoping phase, an analysis phase, and a planning and management phase, with each phase consisting of two to five discrete but interrelated tasks.
   Numerous approaches have been developed to assess CEs, and these range from simple checklists to complex, physically based models. The utility of each approach depends on the resource of concern, relative risk to those resources, information available, and time frame for the evaluation. in nearly all cases the assessment and regulation of CEs is severely hampered by the variability in site conditions and management effects, inability to predict secondary or indirect effects, lack of data on recovery rates, difficulty of validating predictive models, and uncertainty of future events.
   Since any proposed activity could contribute to a wide range of potential CEs at different spatial and temporal scales, a tiered or nested approach should be followed to assess CEs. The difficulty of assessing and predicting CEs also suggests that in many cases the most efficient approach is to focus on minimizing on-site impacts. Under some circumstances adaptive management can also be a viable alternative to detailed CE assessments. Regular monitoring and feedback is critical to the successful management and regulation of CEs.

AB  - Surface contamination with radioactive caesium introduced into the environment after the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear plant was high enough in the Crimean Mountains to allow using radiocaesium as an indicator of penetration of radioactive contamination into a karst system. Caesium concentrations have been studied in soils above Marble Cave, Tchatyrdag Plateau, in percolation waters and in sediments transported by percolation waters within the cave. Contamination of the daylight surface with Cs-137 is about 30 kqB m(-2) which is approximately 13 times higher than the density of global fallouts. Besides Cs-137, almost al samples showed presence of Cs-134 With the Cs-137/Cs-134 ratio close to that of Chernobyl contaminations.
   Concentrations of Cs-137 range from 9 to 15 mBq l(-1) in the present percolation waters in the cave. In sediments related to percolation waters Cs-134 is detected in some samples besides Cs-137, although the effect of Ac-228 is not ruled out. Surprisingly, the highest concentrations of radiocaesium were measured in ''old'' sediments in the cave's lower series. These sediments are not associated with modern percolation and are represented by a clay/moonmilk alternating sequence deposited in an old dried cave lake. Moonmilk layers have higher caesium content than clay. It is assumed that Chernobyl caesium was transported into the cave with aerosols which were then deposited mainly in areas where condensation occurs. The sampling site is located just in the boundary between two microclimatic zones with a temperature gradient of 0.5 degrees C. Active condensation processes occur in this area. Caesium was not detected in another similar sampling site (old lake deposits) located within homogeneous microclimatic conditions. If the above interpretation is correct, these results show the geochemical significance of the aerosol-condensation mechanism of mass transport and localisation.

AB  - The transport sector has evolved globally with a revolution that has brought innovation and comfort to peoples lives. The modern-day commute has become relatively easier and the standard of living has relatively improved. The revolution in the modern era has increased transportation that, on one hand, proves to be good for the general population, but on the other hand, it is resulting in heavy traffic, environmental pollution, and health problems. Furthermore, the utilization of fossil fuels is resulting in resource depletion. A developing country such as Pakistan is currently facing the same situation and thus requires a solution to this problem. To do so, a proper sustainable mode of transportation is deemed necessary, and for this purpose, this research evaluated five different alternatives based on nine distinct criteria. Such a complex decision-making scenario was addressed via a multi-criteria decision-making technique, i.e., Fuzzy-VIKOR. The analysis concluded cycling as the most sustainable mode of transportation for Pakistan. The analysis evaluated cycling to be the most cost-effective and environmentally sustainable alternative for Pakistan's transport sector, especially for shorter distances. The findings of the study suggest that policymakers must work on implementing cycling dedicated lanes across the country and create awareness by setting examples. The contribution of the study focuses on recommending the government of Pakistan to solve its ever-growing environmental issues by implementing taxes on lavish and non-environment-friendly vehicles. Based on such steps, Pakistan can solve its current issue of smog in different parts of the country and also contribute to better health, and social and economic conditions for its citizens. Furthermore, the implementation of a novel technique proves to be another contribution of the study in the case of such an application.

AB  - According to the data collected in the second half of summer for the period from 1954 to 2016 in the plain and mountainous parts of Western Siberia, the distribution and number of the narrow-headed vole in the zonal and provincial aspects were analyzed. Based on cluster analysis of the matrix of similarity coefficients of abundance indicators obtained by averaging the initial data by years and groups of geobotanical maps units, classification of habitats according to the degree of favorable environmental conditions for the vole is made. The averaged samples are divided into five types of favorability: from the optimal type, where the abundance of the species is highest in the whole area studied, to the extreme type, where it is not found. In the southern part of the West Siberian Plain, the narrow-headed vole prefers steppes, and in the subarctic tundra, it prefers communities of river valleys. In the Altai and Kuznetsk-Salair mountain regions, it is most common in the subalpine light forests, tundra, and tundra-steppes of northwestern and southeastern Altai. On average, this vole prefers open habitats in Western Siberia. According to the classification and the structural graph, the dependence of the vole abundance on a number of factors and their inseparable combinations (environmental and anthropogenic regimes) was revealed. The greatest relationship with its distribution in the habitats of Western Siberia is traced to heat and water availability. On the plain, the number of this vole increases from the middle taiga, where it was found only once, to the subzone of the subarctic tundra in the north and to the forest-steppe and steppe zones in the south. In the mountains it is most abundant in Southeastern Altai, where there is a relatively high proportion of the habitats that are most favorable for the narrow-headed vole.

AB  - The starting point for the research discussed in this study was the assumption that sewage sludge generated by wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) should be treated as a valuable raw material in the Circular Economy. Hence, the results of the research are part of the search for the best technological solutions aimed at achieving the maximum possible efficiency of sludge management in WWTP. The research was carried out on the example of a sewage treatment plant in Minsk (the capital of Belarus), where the dominant technology is still the storage of sewage sludge, and annually more than 5 million tons of sludge accumulates, which represents a significant hazard to the environment. The research takes into account the real economic, environmental, economic and social conditions in this country. As an alternative to the current technology, which is no longer recommended in EU countries, the effectiveness of three technological solutions was analyzed: (1) thermophilic digestion option with the production of biogas and subsequent combustion of the fermented sludge in the territory of treatment facilities, (2) high-temperature drying followed by the use of sludge in cement production and (3) production of fertilizers (soil-improving additives). A comparative analysis of these technologies was performed by the ranking method using weighting indicators (significance factors). The methodology takes into account technical, economic, environmental and social criteria. As a result of the evaluation, it was found that the most effective technology for the management of sewage sludge of the WWTP in Minsk is the technology of drying and then using the sludge as an alternative fuel in cement production. This technology provides, among others waste-free utilization of the entire volume of sewage sludge generated in Minsk, and also gives opportunities to create new jobs in the area of production of alternative fuel from sewage sludge.

AB  - With the transition toward densely populated and urbanized market-based cultures over the past 200 years, young people's development has been conditioned by the ascendancy of highly competitive skills-based labor markets that demand new forms of embodied capital (e.g., education) for young people to succeed. Life-history analysis reveals parental shifts toward greater investment in fewer children so parents can invest more in their children's embodied capital for them to compete successfully. Concomitantly, the evolution of market-based capitalism has been associated with the rise of extrinsic values such as individualism, materialism and status-seeking, which have intensified over the last 40-50 years in consumer economies. The dominance of extrinsic values is consequential: when young people show disproportionate extrinsic relative to intrinsic values there is increased risk for mental health problems and poorer well-being. This paper hypothesizes that, concomitant with the macro-cultural promotion of extrinsic values, young people in advanced capitalism (AC) are obliged to develop an identity that is market-driven and embedded in self-narratives of success, status, and enhanced self-image. The prominence of extrinsic values in AC are synergistic with neuro-maturational and stage-salient developments of adolescence and embodied in prominent market-driven criterion such as physical attractiveness, displays of wealth and material success, and high (educational and extra-curricular) achievements. Cultural transmission of market-driven criterion is facilitated by evolutionary tendencies in young people to learn from older, successful and prestigious individuals (prestige bias) and to copy their peers. The paper concludes with an integrated socio-ecological evolutionary account of market-driven identities in young people, while highlighting methodological challenges that arise when attempting to bridge macro-cultural and individual development.

AB  - The impact of natural intra-deposit heating on the delta C-13 signature, organic geochemistry, and petrology of coal and coal-bearing rocks characterised by various degrees of coalification and palaeoenvironments in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin, Poland, is elaborated. Reconstruction of palaeofire performed by heating experiments up to 400 degrees C in open and semi-closed systems with different heating regimes confirms the crucial significance of temperature and oxygen access. In open-system heating, released C-13-depleted gases enrich residue coke in C-13 compared to raw coal. Petrological examinations did not show the impact of palaeofires on the maceral properties of coal. However, the carried-out experiment caused the formation of devolatilisation pores, rounded edges, cracks, pale rims, as well as higher reflectance and paler colour that was what was expected. Extractable compounds become highly depleted, and low-weight organic compounds nearly absent. Relatively high contents of combustion-formed PAHs are an indicator of open-system heating. In semi-closed systems, the final total isotopic composition was almost unchanged as no components are carried away though changes in petrography and geochemistry occur. Increased extract yields reflect the release of bitumen from closed pores and partial pyrolysis of organic matter. Depletion of lighter pi-alkane compounds, total carbon TC and volatiles decrease, and variable values of various alkyl aromatic hydrocarbon ratios are also indicative of semi-closed heating. Coal seams suspected of intra-deposit heating show geochemical and isotopic features similar to semi-closed- rather than open-system heating, and their delta C-13 signatures and organic geochemistry did not respond strongly during laboratory re-heating.

AB  - The loss and transformation of habitats due to human impact are commonly regarded as major factors decreasing the diversity of pollinators. However, there is also some evidence that industrial infrastructure can play a positive role in shaping the composition of many animal communities. Still, little is known about how artificial linear structures, such as roads, railways, and electric power lines, affect the abundance and diversity of wild bees in urban ecosystems. Thus, we attempted to verify which of the habitats mentioned above is crucial for the occurrence of bee species of various functional groups. We conducted field research in woodlands of the city of Bydgoszcz (northern Poland). Site conditions were evaluated on the basis of phytoindicators (plant indicator species). In the study area, we recorded 32 % of all bee species reported from Poland. In respect of species richness and abundance, the habitats along railway lines were the most attractive to bees. Besides, in respect to bee species richness, these sites were the most similar to roadsides. The habitats located under power lines were the poorest in species. About 20 % of bee species were recorded only along railways and 3 % only along roads, while no bee species was recorded exclusively under power lines. Bee species richness and abundance increased with growing cover of the sites by bee food plants and an increasing proportion of bare soil. Moreover, bee abundance increased with an increasing share of plant indicator species of very dry or dry soils and of alkaline soils. Bee abundance declined with an increasing share of plant indicator species of sandy soils. The presented results indicate that roads, railway lines, and power lines, in structurally simplified and floristically poor pine forests, are important for wild bees in urban ecosystems.

AB  - The effective functioning of the body's physiological systems is determined by the presence of essential substances, including macro- and trace elements, whose deficiency leads to various homeostasis disorders. In this regard, the development of new daily consumed foods with targeted corrective action on the human body's nutritional status is an essential and urgent task. Fortification of curd products with biologically active substances of plant origin makes it possible to obtain economically widely available bio corrective food systems. The study objects were curd products with a 5% fat mass fraction without adding and with adding 20% plant composition based on flours made of walnut, sesame, and pumpkin seeds. The storage duration was 90 days at minus 20 +/- 2 degrees C. Qualities and quantities of individual groups of high volatile compounds (HVC) in the equilibrium gas phase (EGP) over the samples of curd products were assessed using an odor analyzer "MAG-8" with the electronic nose (e-nose) methodology. It was found that samples No. 1 and 2 are identical by more than 85% in quality of the EGP. The data obtained demonstrate the prevalence of common to curd products organoleptic characteristics, which are in line with traditional ones expected by the consumer. The composition and content of HVC in air samples over the test samples during the entire period of storage, determining the degree of rancidity of the fat fraction and being indicators of shelf life, were assessed. Based on the test data obtained, an information system for modeling and predicting the shelf life of curd food systems was developed. It includes input parameters - type of packaging, storage conditions (temperature and relative humidity of ambient air), and the plant component content. The output parameter is the area of the "visual imprint" of the maximum sensor signals in the EGP of the study sample assessing the total intensity of odor proportional to the concentration of HVC.

AB  - The regulation of aquaculture production in Norway considers the potential impact of salmon lice on wild fish. However, most attention has been focused on impacts on wild Atlantic salmon, despite the fact that anadromous brown trout spend the majority of their marine phase in coastal waters, where salmon lice have the highest impact. In the present study, we first suggest changes in marine living area and marine feeding time as sustainability indicators for first-time migrant sea trout, as high salmon lice densities may exclude sea trout from otherwise usable habitat and force them to return early to freshwater. Further, a method based on a bio-hydrodynamic model was developed to serve as a proxy for these indicators. The method accounted for the size, migration timing and spatial extent of sea trout and was demonstrated in 2 Norwegian salmon aquaculture production areas, Hardangerfjord (PO3) and Romsdalsfjord (PO5), and 2 focal rivers from within each fjord. Based on these comparisons, we exemplify how the change in marine living area and marine feeding time differed between PO3 and PO5 and within the areas. Sea trout migrating to sea late (June 5) were always more affected by lice than those migrating early (April 24) or at intermediate dates (May 15). Our estimates revealed dramatic potential impacts of salmon lice on sea trout populations, which were greatly influenced by spatial and temporal aspects. Considering the negative impacts of salmon lice on sea trout, a holistic view of environmental interactions between aquaculture and wild species that depend on habitats exploited for production is necessary.

AB  - The Zagros sedimentary basin in Iran is one of the most significant basins worldwide due to its potential for petroleum generation. This study assessed the hydrocarbon generation potential of the Gurpi and Pabdeh Formations as potential source rocks. For this purpose, ten samples were taken from the Pabdeh and Gurpi Formations and analyzed using Rock-Eval (R) 6 Turbo. The Rock-Eval data indicated that the Pabdeh and Gurpi Formations had hydrocarbon generation potential. Two of the samples from the Pabdeh and Gurpi Formations showed fair and high potential for hydrocarbon generation, respectively. Organic matter in the Gurpi Formation showed a type II kerogen, while types II and III kerogens of oil and gas prone hydrocarbons were determined in the Pebdeh Formation, respectively. Samples of the both formations were in the thermally immature stage. In addition, the determination of organic facies indicated that the sedimentary facies of the Pabdeh Formation were deposited with rapid sedimentation rates in deep marine environments due to adjoining orogenic points. Moreover, the sedimentary facies of the Gurpi Formation were an indicator of the rate of relatively reductive marine environment conditions to relatively oxidative environments with average sedimentation. The maximum and minimum organic matter content was 2.5 and 0.26 for the Pabdeh Formation and 0.88 and 0.54 for the Gurpi Formation, respectively. Moreover, the dead organic carbon content was 0.1682 wt% for the Gurpi Formation and 0.6734 wt% for the Pabdeh Formation. The determination of hydrocarbon uptake (absorption) using the rock matrix suggested that the uptake rate was higher in the samples of the Gurpi Formation than in those of the Pabdeh Formation. This indicated that the rock matrix had more clay minerals in the Gurpi Formation than in the Pabdeh Formation.

AB  - Since 2009, the Canadian and Alberta governments have been developing monitoring plans for surface water quality and quantity of the lower Athabasca River and its tributaries (2010-2013). The objectives of the present study to the fish monitoring program were to 1) assess the current status of fish in a tributary of the lower Athabasca River, 2) identify existing differences between upstream reference and within the oil sands deposit exposure sites, and 3) identify trends/changes in fish performance indicators relative to historical studies. The present study examines the fish performance indicators in slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) in the Steepbank River, Alberta, in terms of growth, gonad size, condition, and hepatic 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity as an indicator of exposure to oil-sands-related compounds. The sampling program followed historical sampling methods (1999-2000) to provide comparable data over time with an additional upstream site (n = 2) added as development progressed. Consistent changes were documented in sculpin collected from downstream sections of the Steepbank River within the oil sands deposit (n = 2) in 2010 through 2013. Sculpin demonstrated increased liver size with corresponding induction of EROD activity consistent with historical data and reductions in energy investment relative to reproductive development and gonadal steroid production capacity. There was no consistent evidence of changes in fish performance indicators with increased surface mining development, particularly adjacent to the Steepbank River Mid site. Although physical development in the Steepbank watershed has increased over the last 15 yr, these results are consistent with historical data suggesting that the magnitude of the response in the aquatic environment adjacent to the development has not changed.

AB  - The search for rational areas of industrial use of rubber seed oil for the countries of Southeast Asia, South America and Africa, where Hevea brasiliensis grows in vast areas, is of great practical and scientific interest, both from ecological, economic and technical points of view. In this regard, the studies of the preparation and the use of epoxidized rubber seed oil are important. Due to the presence of double bonds, this vegetable oil is relatively easily functionalized. The epoxidation of rubber seed oil was carried out by us with hydrogen peroxide under the conditions of interphase catalysis in the presence of tungsten-containing catalysts. Epoxidized vegetable oils are of great interest as reactive modifiers for epoxy-diane polymers. For comparison with ERSO, industrial epoxidized soybean oil was investigated. Modification by both epoxidized rubber seed oil and epoxidized soybean oil of epoxy compositions cured with amines of different chemical structure, causes a significant increase in their hardness, wear resistance and improved antifriction indicators. The content of the gel fraction is reduced, that is, the density of the cross-linked structure of epoxy coatings formed in the presence of epoxidized rubber seed oil and soybean oil, which are partially included in the structure, and partially perform the functions of plasticizing agents, decreases. A similar effect was found when epoxy polymers modifying with epoxidized palm trees oil. The decrease cross-linked density of epoxy polymers modified with epoxidized vegetable oils causes an increase in the mobility of the elements of the structure, due to the presence of flexible fragments in the modifiers. This greatly make easier the relaxation processes in the composition, which helps to reduce internal stresses and improve properties. Moreover, epoxidized soybean oil to a greater extent reduces wear and friction coefficient of epoxy coatings, compared with epoxidized rubber seed oil.

AB  - When aluminum is obtained by electrolysis of cryolite-alumina melts when the baths are sent for capital repairs, a solid technogenic product is formed - waste lining of electrolytic cells (WLEC). The volume of formation of WLEC is 30-50 kg per 1 ton of aluminum. Currently, it is mainly stored at landfills near industrial enterprises, causing harm to the environment. However, this technogenic raw material contains valuable components (fluorine, aluminum, sodium) that can be extracted to produce fluoride salts, which are in demand during the electrolytic production of aluminum. The objects of research were samples of the coal part of the waste lining of dismantled S-8BM (E) type electrolytic cells of "RUSAL Krasnoyarsk" JSC (Krasnoyarsk) of RUSAL company. According to the X-ray experiment diffraction analysis (using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer) of the phase composition of the samples, it was found that the main fluorine-containing compounds are cryolite, chiolite, sodium and calcium fluorides. The total fluorine content in the studied samples averaged 13.1 %. We conducted studies on the leaching of fluorine from WLEC with a solution of caustic alkali (NaOH concentration - 17.5 g/dm(3)). The process was carried out in a mechanically agitated reactor using a BIOSAN MM-1000 top drive laboratory stirrer with a two-blade nozzle. By the method of mathematical planning of a three-factor experiment, the mutual influence of three leaching conditions on the optimization parameter was established - the extraction of fluorine in solution (in percent). The maximum recovery of fluorine from WLEC to the leach solution averaged 86.4 % and was achieved with the following indicators: process temperature - 95 degrees C, the ratio of liquid to solid phase - 9:1, duration - 210 min.

AB  - In this study, we tested the hypothesis that individual differences in behavioural profiles correlate to differences in stress-related behaviours and hormonal levels in captive brown capuchin monkeys (Sapajus libidinosus). Based on a sample of 25 animals, 143 h of behavioural data collection and 518 faecal samples, principal component analyses indicated the existence of four components that characterize the individuals' Genus Normative Behaviour (GNB) (KMO = 0.531, X-2 = 127.672, p < 0.001): 'Feeding', 'Sociability', 'Exploration', and 'Activity'. Other four components are related to stress coping styles (based on Behaviour Potentially Indicative of Stress - BPIS) (KMO = 0.550, X-2 = 329.303, p < 0.001): 'Self-directed'; 'Restless', 'Ingestion/Self-Scratching', and 'Stereotyped'. More active individuals exhibit rapid stress-related behaviours (r = 0.443; p = 0.044) while less active individuals exhibit more stationary stress-related behaviours (r = -0.519; p = 0.013). Akaike information criteria indicated that the best linear regression model to predict the physiological profile (Faecal Glucocorticoid Metabolites - FGM) included three GNB and three BPIS components. 'Sociability' (p < 0.05), 'Exploration' (p < 0.05), and 'Ingestion/Self-scratching' (p < 0.05) predicted lower FGM levels. 'Activity' (p < 0.05), 'Self-directed' (p < 0.05), and 'Stereotyped' (p < 0.05) predicted higher FGM levels. 'Feeding' and 'Restless' factors were not included in the models. Our results support previous studies indicating that animals within the same population differ in the way they behave and react to stressful conditions, and these are correlated to different physiological profiles. Mapping inter-individual differences in stress coping strategies may help clarify the long-term reported incongruity between behavioural and physiological indicators of welfare in captive animals, supporting better management practices and assisting translational models of the development of psychopathologies.

AB  - Oysters (Crassostrea virginica) were an important food resource for native peoples of the northern Gulf of Mexico, who deposited waste shells in middens. Nitrogen (N) stable isotopes (delta N-15) in bivalve shells have been used as modern proxies for estuarine N sources because they approximate delta N-15 in suspended particulate matter. We tested the use of midden shell delta N-15 as a proxy for ancient estuarine N sources. We hypothesized that isotopic signatures in ancient shells from coastal Mississippi would differ from modern shells due to increased anthropogenic N sources, such as wastewater, through time. We decalcified shells using an acidification technique previously developed for modern bivalves, but modified to determine delta N-15, delta C-13, %N, and % organic C of these low-N, high-C specimens. The modified method resulted in the greatest percentage of usable data from midden shells. Our results showed that oyster shell delta N-15 did not significantly differ between ancient (500-2100 years old) and modern oysters from the same locations where the sites had undergone relatively little land-use change. delta N-15 values in modern shells, however, were positively correlated with water column nitrate concentrations associated with urbanization. When N content and total shell mass were combined, we estimated that middens sequestered 410-39,000 kg of relic N, buried at a rate of up to 5 kg N m(-2) yr(-1). This study provides a relatively simple technique to assess baseline conditions in ecosystems over long time scales by demonstrating that midden shells can be an indicator of pre-historic N source to estuaries and are a potentially significant but previously uncharacterized estuarine N sink.

AB  - The application of molybdenum(Mo) enrichment to sediments can potentially provide unique constraints on the methane seepage dynamics at continental margins. We report herein elemental and isotopic measurements for authigenic carbonates and sediment samples in drill cores (similar to 95mlong; Site GMGS2-08 at similar to 800mwater depth) from gas hydrate-bearing sediments in the northern South China Sea. Five intervals that were impacted by methane seepages in the sediment profile were identified by the presence of strongly C-13-depleted carbonates (delta C-13 values as low as-56.8%). The carbonates often cement chemosynthetic bivalve shell fragments and have anomalous delta O-18 positive values. These observations suggest that methane seepage was intense during those time intervals and that carbonate precipitation occurred in the uppermost sediments, probably due to gas hydrate dissociation. Interestingly, the five intervals were all characterized by strong Mo enrichments. We thus hypothesize that the presence of strong Mo enrichments is a good indicator of past episodes of methane seepage. Such an environment results in sulfidic conditions that occur in a narrow zone in proximity to seawater close to the seafloor, leading to resultant Mo enrichments in associated sediments. In contrast, environments with low methane flux would lead to the distribution of Mo throughout a wide sulfidic zone and, consequently, an absence of Mo enrichment in the sediments. The insights into the environment for Mo enrichments at seeps have significant implications for tracing past methane seepages, their intensities, and even possible occurrences of gas hydrate dissociation.

AB  - In New Zealand during the early 2000s, an emerging disquiet about social inequalities in health led to calls for better information for public health monitoring. Health needs assessments (HNA) had been built into the planning cycles of the country's newly formed District Health Boards (DHBs), which were tasked with "improving, promoting and protecting" the health of their populations. In child and youth health, a lack of data was seen as a significant barrier to effective DHB planning, with the needs of this age group often being lost amongst the concerns of an ageing adult community. This led to calls for a single national entity to select, collate and disseminate accurate information on the health of children and young people. This paper describes the origins of the NZ Child and Youth Epidemiology Service (NZCYES) and its 10 year journey to build a monitoring infrastructure to inform health service prioritisation and planning. Central to this work has been a theoretical framework, which arranges indicators into four hierarchical domains, reflecting key steps in the causal pathways linking the political, economic and social environment with child and youth health outcomes. These are cross-cut by a horizontal lifecourse dimension. Ten years on, while the available information has improved considerably, child and youth health inequalities remain high. The early hopes that HNA would show the links between socioeconomic conditions and health inequalities and that prioritisation, planning and policy would respond accordingly, have failed to materialise. Government agencies have not fully utilised the scientific evidence; and even when they have wanted to, a range of other factors (political, institutional, budgetary, inertia) have aligned to crowd out the changes that could make a real difference. Overcoming these barriers remains the challenge for the health sector over the next 10 years.

AB  - Premise of research. Climatically favorable conditions correspond with fossil evidence for dramatic Ordovician marine biodiversification, but coeval terrestrial biodiversity is less well understood. Although diverse Middle and Late Ordovician microfossils are interpreted as reproductive remains of early bryophyte-like land plants (consistent with molecular data indicating pre-Ordovician embryophyte origin), the vegetative structure of Ordovician plants remains mysterious, as do relationships to modern groups. Because distinctive fungal microfossils indicating land plant presence were previously reported from Ordovician carbonate deposits in Wisconsin, we examined another nearby outcrop for additional evidence of terrestrial biodiversification.
   Methodology. Replicate collections were made from well-understood 455-454 Ma Platteville Formation carbonates of relatively low porosity and hydraulic conductivity. We employed measures to avoid contamination, and organic remains extracted by acid maceration were characterized by light and scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy.
   Pivotal results. Multicellular organic fragments displayed distinctive cellular features shared with modern vegetative peat mosses but differed from modern materials, e.g., fossil presence of mineral coatings, absence of epibionts. Biometric features of mosslike microfossils isolated from carbonates collected and macerated 12 yr apart by separate investigators did not differ. Putative peat moss remains occurred with foraminifera similar in frequency and thermal maturity to types previously described from the same formation. No diatoms, pollen, or other indicators of post-Ordovician environments were observed.
   Conclusions. The peat moss-like fragments described here are the oldest-known vegetative remains of land plants and the oldest fossils having distinctive features linking them to a modern plant group. These findings are consistent with peat moss recalcitrance properties that foster fossilization and molecular evidence that the peat moss lineage is 460-607 Ma of age. The new findings suggest that moss-dominated peatlandsrecognized for globally significant roles in modern terrestrial biodiversity and C and N cycling-were present hundreds of millions of years earlier than previously thought.

AB  - Potato virus Y (PVY) strains have been defined based on genetic reactions in potato indicators expressing hypersensitive reaction (HR) response due to the presence of three different N genes, and also based on genomic information. Nine strains are known currently, with five PVY strains defined biologically, PVYO, PVYC, PVYZ, PVYN, and PVYE. The genetic background of the majority of North American potato cultivars has so far been poorly characterized for the presence of N genes inducing HR towards different PVY strains. Here, the HR response was studied in eight potato cultivars, elicited by five strains of PVY circulating in North America. These PVY isolates included representative isolates of PVYN-Wi, PVYNA-N, PVYO, PVYZ, and PVYN strains. Potato cultivars tested included Russet Burbank, Russet Norkotah, Shepody, Ranger Russet, Western Russet, Alturas, Rio Grande Russet, and Yukon Gem, grown in the U.S., and standard indicators Desiree and Maris Bard with the known genetic background. Three additional strains, PVYN:O, PVY-NE11, and PVYE, were tested on Yukon Gem. Virus-free potato plants were mechanically inoculated with PVY inoculum, and local and systemic foliar symptoms were observed for 8 weeks post-inoculation under different climate-controlled conditions. Virus status of the inoculated plants was tested starting at 3 weeks post-inoculation, by serotype-specific ELISA and RT-PCR, in order to monitor successful infections and confirm the identity of the inoculated PVY isolate. This systematic approach allowed us to identify Ny (tbr) and Nz (tbr) genes present in several North American cultivars. Two more new, putative N genes were postulated to be expressed in the cultivar Yukon Gem, and one additional putative N gene was postulated to be expressed in two cultivars, Yukon Gem and Rio Grande Russet. These N genes may represent valuable sources of resistance against multiple strains of PVY.

AB  - Drought is a complex natural hazard which can have negative effects on agriculture, economy, and human life. In this paper, the primary goal is to explore the application of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) gravity satellite data for the quantitative investigation of the recent drought dynamic over the arid land of northwestern China, a region with scarce hydrological and meteorological observation datasets. The spatiotemporal characteristics of terrestrial water storage changes (TWSC) were first evaluated based on the GRACE satellite data, and then validated against hydrological model simulations and precipitation data. A drought index, the total storage deficit index (TSDI), was derived on the basis of GRACE-recovered TWSC. The spatiotemporal distributions of drought events from 2003 to 2012 in the study region were obtained using the GRACE-derived TSDI. Results derived from TSDI time series indicated that, apart from four short-term (three months) drought events, the study region experienced a severe long-term drought from May 2008 to December 2009. As shown in the spatial distribution of TSDI-derived drought conditions, this long-term drought mainly concentrated in the northwestern area of the entire region, where the terrestrial water storage was in heavy deficit. These drought characteristics, which were detected by TSDI, were consistent with local news reports and other researchers' results. Furthermore, a comparison between TSDI and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) implied that GRACE TSDI was a more reliable integrated drought indicator (monitoring agricultural and hydrological drought) in terms of considering total terrestrial water storages for large regions. The GRACE-derived TSDI can therefore be used to characterize and monitor large-scale droughts in the arid regions, being of special value for areas with scarce observations.

AB  - Special Antarctic Blend (SAB) is a diesel fuel dominated by aliphatic hydrocarbons that is commonly used in Antarctic and subantarctic regions. The past and present use of SAB fuel at Australia's scientific research stations has resulted in multiple spills, contaminating soils in these pristine areas. Despite this, no soil quality guidelines or remediation targets have been developed for the region, primarily due to the lack of established indigenous test species and subsequent biological effects data. In this study, twelve plant species native to subantarctic regions were collected from Macquarie Island and evaluated to determine their suitably for use in laboratory-based toxicity testing, using germination success and seedling growth (shoot and root length) as endpoints. Two soil types (low and high organic carbon (OC)) were investigated to reflect the variable OC content found in soils on Macquarie Island. These soils were spiked with SAB fuel and aged for 14 days to generate a concentration series of SAB-contaminated soils. Exposure doses were quantified as the concentration of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH, nC9-nC18) on a soil dry mass basis. Seven species successfully germinated on control soils under laboratory conditions, and four of these species (Colobanthus muscoides Hook. f., Deschampsia chapmanii Petrie, Epilobium pendunculare A. Cunn. and Luzula crinita Hook. f.) showed a dose-dependent inhibition of germination when exposed to SAB-contaminated soils. Contaminated soils with low OC were generally more toxic to plants than high organic carbon soils. Increasing soil-TPH concentrations significantly inhibited shoot and root growth, and root length was identified as the most sensitive endpoint. Although the test species were tolerant to SAB-contaminated soils in germination assays, development of early life stages (up to 28 days) were generally more sensitive indicator of exposure effects, and may be more useful endpoints for future testing.

AB  - Sea bottom processes of the pelagic realm are still not completely understood and represent an intriguing subject. This paper focuses on the relationships between "normal" settling processes, redistribution of sediments and oceanographic parameters in a pelagic setting, during the Cenomanian. Five key Tethyian localities in the Cenomanian Umbria-Marche and Belluno Basins have been studied in order to understand the interplay among sea bottom processes that acted on the sea floor. The dataset consists of the mm-scale sedimentological description of the sections complemented by microfacies analysis on selected samples. Different sedimentological indications, such as presence of intraclasts, lined forams, pervasive plane-parallel lamination, suggest a continuous reworking under action of bottom-currents with varying intensity and direction. All the identified facies are here illustrated in detail and organized in a comprehensive schematic facies framework, the "facies matrix", that leads to recognize two depositional facies suites: the "settling dominated" and the "traction current dominated", under different oxygenation conditions. Our results suggest that settling of biogenic and inorganic particles represents the main source of pelagic sediments, but not the unique depositional process: under the action of sea-bottom currents of different intensity, sediments are continuously redistributed on the sea floor. All the collected evidences contribute to the proposal of a comprehensive depositional model for these reworked and redistributed fine-grained sediments, that represent true calcareous pelagic contourites. The model suggests that the identified traction-related facies can be used as a proxy for bottom current intensity and, indirectly, as an indicator of changing ventilation regimes at the sea floor through time.

AB  - The complex and diverse geometry of neuronal dendrites determines the different morphological types of neurons and influences the generation of complex and diverse discharge patterns at the cell output. The recent finding that each temporal pattern has its spatial signature in the form of a combination of high- and low-depolarization states of asymmetrical dendritic branches with active membrane properties raises the question of the nature of such characteristic spatial heterogeneity of electrical states. To answer this, we consider passive dendrites as a conventional reference case using the known current transfer functions, which we complete by corresponding parametric sensitivity functions. These functions for metrically asymmetrical bifurcations of different sizes, as the simplest elements constituting arborizations of arbitrary geometry, are analyzed under different membrane conductivity conditions related to the intensity of activation of ion channels. Characteristic relationships are obtained on the one hand among the size (branch lengths), metrical asymmetry (difference between sister branches in length and/or diameter), and membrane conductivity, and on the other hand, for the difference between the branches in their current transfer effectiveness as an indicator of their electrical asymmetry (heterogeneity). These relationships (i) allow the introduction of a biophysically based criterion for the electrical distinction between metrically asymmetrical branches, (ii) show how the difference first increases and then decreases with increasing membrane conductivity, and (iii) show that the greatest electrical heterogeneity occurs in a lower or higher range of conductivity, corresponding to larger or smaller bifurcation size. As a consequence, the characteristic low-, medium-, and high-conductance states are derived such that metrically asymmetrical parts of simple and complex trees are electrically distinct when the membrane conductivity lies in the size-related medium range, and indistinct otherwise.

AB  - Fossil pollen from Nam Co and modern pollen from altitudinal vegetation belts around the lake are investigated to reveal alpine vegetation succession in response to climate changes during the Holocene in the central Tibetan Plateau. The discriminant analysis on 37 topsoil samples shows that pollen samples from alpine steppe at lower elevations (<4800 m) and alpine meadow on upper slopes (4800-5200 m) can be distinguished by their pollen assemblages. Samples from alpine steppe contain more Artemisia (25.1%) and Poaceae pollen (11.5%), whereas those from alpine meadow are dominated by Cyperaceae pollen (>60%). Our result indicates that the pollen ratio of Artemisia to Cyperaceae (A/Cy) can be used as an indicator of the vertical shift of vegetation belts and temperature changes in the central Tibetan Plateau as suggested by previous studies. A history of the vertical shift of vegetation belts on the northern slope of Nyainqentanglha Mountains and climate changes since 8.4 kyr BP are thus recovered by 198 fossil pollen assemblages from a 332 cm core of Nam Co. Paleovegetation reconstructed from fossil pollen assemblages through discriminant analysis shows a general downward shift of altitudinal vegetation belts, suggesting a decline in the temperature trend since 8.4 kyr BP. This result is consistent with the reduction of A/Cy ratios. The fossil pollen record also reveals warm and wet climate during the early to mid Holocene, and cold and dry conditions during the late Holocene in the Nam Co area. A comparison of Holocene climatic reconstructions across the Plateau indicates that termination of maximum moisture at around 6-5.5 kyr BP in our record is associated with the southeastward retreat of the Southwest Monsoon.

AB  - Eutrophication processes and changes in coastal ecosystem are determined by the coastal/open sea interactions and rates of nutrient pollution. The Cilician Basin shelf waters are affected not only by intense industrial activities and increased population, but also by complex atmosphere-sea-land interactions. There is a recognizable difference between water qualities of Mersin bay coastal and the Cilician open waters depleted in nutrients. Eutrophic conditions have developed in the eastern bay shallow waters heavily polluted by land-based inputs during the last few decades. In the present study, basic chemical parameters measured seasonally in water column during the 8 field surveys, as a part of TUBITAK project, in the period of November 2005-September 2007, have been evaluated. Cilician coastal waters were always poor in reactive phosphate (0.02-0.05 mu M) throughout the year. However, there is a distinct decrease and seasonal changes in total phosphorus (TP) levels from the polluted inner bay (0.15-0.20 mu M) to the Cilician open waters (0.05-0.07 mu M). The surface TRIX index values, computed from % dissolved oxygen saturation, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, TP and chlorophyll-a concentrations, increase from <2 (oligotrophic property) in the Cilicial open water to levels of 3-6 in the pollutted coastal zone. In the shallow zone between Mersin Harbour and Seyhan delta, where large amounts of nutrients are discharged and TRIX values consistently >4 (showing tendency from mesotrophic to eutrophic propery), biomass level is high and the Secchi Disc depth varies between 1.5-3 meters.
   Iskenderun inner bay waters have low levels of organic pollution and TRIX<3, indicating mesotrpohic property and the presence of continuous interaction with the outer bay waters during the year.

AB  - Considering the economic importance of the tomato and its nutritional benefits for human health, we studied how different environmental factors [temperature, solar radiation and vapour-pressure deficit (VPD)] influenced the pectin solubilization and the calcium concentration in cherry tomato fruits (Solanum lycopersicum cv. Naomi) grown in two experimental greenhouses: improved parral type (low-technology) and multispan type (high-technology). For three years (2004, 2005 and 2006), three fruit samples were taken over the entire production period: at the beginning of harvest [ 16 weeks after transplanting (WAT)], at mid-harvest (26 WAT), and at the end of harvest (35 WAT). Values for temperature, solar radiation, and VPD peaked in the third sampling in both greenhouses during the three years, being higher in the parral greenhouse during the production cycle. No-market production and peroxidation indicators [measured as H2O2 and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations] significantly increased at the end of the productive period in both greenhouses, indicating the presence of oxidative stress caused by the rise in temperature, solar radiation, and VPD, which was more pronounced in the parral greenhouse. Water-soluble pectins, pectate, and protopectin contents were measured, revealing an increase in the former two and a reduction in the latter under environmental stress. This indicates a clear pectin solubilization in cherry tomato fruit. The enzymes pectolytic polyglacturonase (PG). pectin methylesterase (PME), and pectate lyase (PEL), altered their activities during the third sampling, while the calcium concentration fell drastically. Therefore, both the increase in pectin solubilization as well as the reduction in the Ca concentration during harshest environmental stress in the third sampling, especially in the parral greenhouse, could degenerate the textural properties of the cherry tomato, reducing its quality and consumer acceptance.

AB  - Understanding long-term changes in forest ecosystem carbon stocks under forest management practices such as timber harvesting is important for assessing the contribution of forests to the global carbon cycle. Harvesting effects are complicated by the amount, type, and condition of residue left on-site, the decomposition rate of this residue, the incorporation of residue into soil organic matter and the rate of new detritus input to the forest floor from regrowing vegetation. In an attempt to address these complexities, the forest succession model LINKAGES was used to assess the production of aboveground biomass, detritus, and soil carbon stocks in native Eucalyptus forests as influenced by five harvest management practices in New South Wales, Australia. The original decomposition sub-routines of LINKAGES were modified by adding components of the Rothamsted (RothC) soil organic matter turnover model. Simulation results using the new model were compared to data from long-term forest inventory plots. Good agreement was observed between simulated and measured above-ground biomass, but mixed results were obtained for basal area. Harvesting operations examined included removing trees for quota sawlogs (QSL, DBH >80 cm), integrated sawlogs (ISL, DBH >20 cm) and whole-tree harvesting in integrated sawlogs (WTH). We also examined the impact of different cutting cycles (20, 50 or 80 years) and intensities (removing 20, 50 or 80 m 3). Generally medium and high intensities of shorter cutting cycles in sawlog harvesting systems produced considerably higher soil carbon values compared to no harvesting. On average, soil carbon was 2-9% lower in whole-tree harvest simulations whereas in sawlog harvest simulations soil carbon was 5-17% higher than in no harvesting. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Prokaryotes are of high importance in the assessment of environmental pollution effects. Due to fast responsiveness of bacterial communities to environmental physicochemical factors, it is difficult to compare results of bacterial community investiations on the temporal and spatial scale. To reduce the effects of variable physicochemical environmental conditions on bacterial microbiota when investigating the specific impact of contaminants on bacterial communities, we investigated the bacterial community in the gut of terrestrial isopods (Porcellio scaber, Isopoda, Crustacea) from clean and metal-polluted environments. Animals were collected from a chronically mercury-polluted site, a chronically multiple metal-(Cd, Pb, Zn) polluted site, and two reference sites. In addition. animals from an unpolluted site were laboratory exposed to 5 mu g Hg/g food in order to compare the effect of acute and chronic Hg exposure. The bacterial gut microbiota was investigated by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (T`TGE) and clone library construction based on polymerase chain reaction amplified 16S rRNA genes. The major bacterial representatives of the emptied gut microbiota in the animals from the chronically polluted environments seemed not affected when analyzed by TTGE. The detailed bacterial community structure investigated by 16S rRNA clone library construction, however, showed that the community from the Hg-polluted site also was affected severely (242.4 operational taxonomic units [OTUI in the polluted and 650.6 OTU in the unpolluted environment). When animals were acutely exposed to mercury, changes of bacterial community structures already were seen on TTGE profiles and no additional analysis was needed. We suggest the use of P. scaber gut bacterial community structure as a measure of effects caused by both long- and short-term exposure to pollution.

AB  - The lipid geochemistry of lake sediments can provide information on past environmental change. Detailed interpretation is, however, often hampered by a limited understanding of the provenance of many compounds and the multiple factors influencing their distributions in modern lake sediments. We have quantified the solvent extractable lipid compositions of modem surface sediments from fifty four Spanish lakes covering a range of hydrochemical (fresh to hypersaline) and hydrological (shallow ephemeral to deep permanent) conditions. Lipid compositions across the dataset are dominated by carboxylic acids (up to 86% total solvent extractable lipids), alkanols (up to 63%) and sterols (up to 58%), with smaller relative proportions of alkanes, alkenes, ketones (including long chain alkenones) and hopanols. Here we employ the distributions of these dominant compounds to explore relationships between lipid composition, source inputs and lake type. Source input is the major factor influencing the lipid composition, but there are also some indicators of early stages of lipid diagenesis in these surface sediments. Multivariate data analysis (non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination and cluster analysis) of normalised lipid concentrations shows a distinction between compounds originating primarily from algal, bacterial, macrophyte or terrestrial plant sources. This statistical technique enables sites to be grouped according to their dominant lipid compositional characteristics as well as enabling us to identify broad trends in groups of sites in terms of their environmental features (e.g. shallow or deep lakes). This modern training set study provides insight into patterns of contemporary lipid distributions and lipid source and site relationships across diverse lacustrine environments, which can then be useful in environmental monitoring and palaeoenvironmental studies using sediment cores.

AB  - We present a reconstruction of the vegetation history of the last glacial-interglacial cycle (ca. 75 k cal. yr BP-present) at Redhead Lagoon, an enclosed lake basin in coastal, eastern New South Wales, Australia. The sequence of vegetation change at the site is broadly comparable with the pattern of climatically induced changes observed in many other pollen records in southeast Australia. Open woodland-herbland and woodland-forest communities correspond with glacial and interglacial periods respectively, with an additional change towards a more open understorey vegetation assemblage over the last 40 000 yr. The driest conditions appear to have occurred during the, height of the last glacial (some time between 30 and 20.k cal. yr BP). This is consistent with other records from southeast Australia, and provides support for a poleward shift in the subtropical anticyclone belt and, less certainly, for the thesis that the Southern Hemisphere westerlies intensified during this period. In marked contrast to most sites in southeast Australia, Casuarinaceae dominates the pollen record through the height of the last glacial period and into the Holocene. The postglacial climatic amelioration is accompanied by the general reappearance of tree pollen in the record, by the disappearance of several open and disturbed environment indicator taxa, by increases in organic sediment deposition and pollen taxon diversity, and by higher water balances. While climate appears to have been the major control on patterns of vegetation change at this site throughout most of the last glacial-interglacial cycle, changes in depositional environment and hydrology have also played a role. Significantly, substantial increases in the rate and magnitude of many indicators of environmental disturbance since European settlement suggest that humans are now the most important mechanism for environmental change.

AB  - The marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi is a potential indicator organism for evaluating marine environmental pollution. The DnaK - DnaJ - GrpE chaperone machinery of V. harveyi has been studied as a model of response to stress conditions and compared to the Escherichia coli DnaK system. The genes encoding DnaK, DnaJ and GrpE of V. harveyi were cloned into expression vectors and grpE was sequenced. It was found that V. harveyi possesses a unique organization of the hsp gene cluster ( grpE - gltP - dnaK dnaJ), which is present exclusively in marine Vibrio species. In vivo experiments showed that suppression of the E. coli dnaK mutation by V. harveyi DnaK protein was weak or absent, while suppression of the dnaJ and grpE mutations by V. harveyi DnaJ and GrpE proteins was efficient. These results suggest higher species-specificity of the DnaK chaperone than the GrpE and DnaJ cochaperones. Proteins of the DnaK chaperone machinery of V. harveyi were purified to homogeneity and their efficient cooperation with the E. coli chaperones in the luciferase refolding reaction and in stimulation of DnaK ATPase activity was demonstrated. Compared to the E. coli system, the purified DnaK DnaJ - GrpE system of V. harveyi exhibited about 20% lower chaperoning activity in the luciferase reactivation assay. ATPase activity of V. harveyi DnaK protein was at least twofold higher than that of the E. coli model DnaK but its stimulation by the cochaperones DnaJ and GrpE was significantly ( 10 times) weaker. These results indicate that, despite their high structural identity ( approximately 80%) and similar mechanisms of action, the DnaK chaperones of closely related V. harveyi and E. coli bacteria differ functionally.

AB  - Muller cells express a variety of neurotransmitter receptors that permit them to "sense" the extracellular environment within the retina. We have used a battery of agonists and antagonists to characterize the purinergic receptor subtypes expressed on isolated tiger salamander Muller cells. Changes in intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca2+](i)) in Muller cells were measured using the Ca2+ indicator dye Fura-2 and digital imaging microscopy. ATP, 2-methylthio-ATP, 2-methylthio-ADP, ADP, UTP, UDP, deoxyATP, and 3'-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl ATP evoked increases in [Ca2+](i) in both the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+. Therefore, the increases we observed were likely due to intracellular Ca2+ release mediated by G-protein-coupled P2Y receptor activation, rather than Ca2+ influx via P2X receptor channels. The P2Y(1) receptor agonists 2-methylthio-ATP, 2-methylthio-ADP, and ADP evoked increases in [Ca2+](i) that were inhibited by the P2Y, receptor antagonists adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulfate and 2'-deoxy-N-6-methyleneadenosine-3',5'-bisphosphate. Responses to ADP were not completely inhibited by the P2Y(1) receptor antagonists. The residual response to ADP could be mediated by P2Y(13) receptors. UTP evoked an increase in [Ca2+](i) that was partially inhibited by suramin, suggesting that Muller cells express P2Y(2) and P2Y(4) receptors. The P2Y(6) receptor agonist UDP, and the P2Y(11) receptor agonists deoxyATP, and 3'-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl ATP, evoked increases in [Ca2+](i) in Muller cells. We conclude that isolated tiger salamander Muller cells express P2Y(1), P2Y(2), P2Y(6), P2Y(11), and possibly P2Y(4) and P2Y(13) receptors. Therefore, the physiological release of ATP, ADP, UTP, and UDP and/or their accumulation in the retina under pathological conditions could stimulate increases in [Ca2+](i) in Muller cells.

AB  - The Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model is an important support tool for environmental management. Previous tests of the model have determined that it is suitable for long-term yield estimation, but it is less precise in assessing annual yield variability. To determine the reasons for the discrepancies between estimated and measured yields, we tested the ability of EPIC version 5300 to predict soil water and soil nitrogen dynamics, using data from a long-term spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation experiment in the semiarid prairie region of Canada. Potential evapotranspiration (PET) estimates varied among methods tested: Priestley-Taylor and Penman-Monteith methods resulted in PET means that were about twice those obtained with the Hargreaves and Baier-Robertson methods. The higher PET means were associated with an excessive estimation of net radiation. We used the Baier-Robertson method to generate the other estimates reported herein. EPIC generally overestimated total soil water, but it still allowed clear differentiation among rotation phases and times of the year, and provided adequate estimates of water during the critical shot-blade stage. Water estimates by soil layer were also generally overpredicted, especially at depths from 0.15 to 0.60 m, but we were able to differentiate among rotation phases and times of the year. Precision of these latter estimates was generally low, accounting at most for 27% of the variability, and varied by soil layer, rotation phase and time of the year. Nitrate-N estimates. tended to be lower than measured values, especially at depths below 0.3 m and during vegetative growth phases. However, the estimates also allowed us to distinguish among the rotation phases and times of the year. Total N and organic C were satisfactorily estimated by EPIC. In general, EPIC provided adequate long-term estimates of the environmental quality indicators tested.

AB  - Progressively, more dredged sediments are being reused for engineering projects. For example, the Marker Wadden is a new wetland constructed in lake Markermeer, the Netherlands, with dredged cohesive sediments originating from the bed of the lake. Such dredged sediments are often dominated by cohesive sediment particles with varying amounts of sand and organic matter. In addition, during and after the construction process, the material consolidates and is often compressed from a very loose state into a significantly denser condition. To assess the mechanical behavior of this material, the compressibility of the Markermeer dredged sediment samples with various sand and organic matter contents was analyzed with incremental loading oedometer tests, whereas the undrained shear strength was studied using the fall cone test. The behavior was theoretically analyzed assuming a fractal structure of the sediment and applying power law constitutive equations for effective stress, hydraulic conductivity, and undrained shear strength. These constitutive equations, usually used at low initial sediment densities, worked well at the relatively high initial densities studied and proved to be a useful tool to identify the transition fines content TFC. The constitutive equations were put in context with indicators traditionally used in soil mechanics. Samples, each with an identical composition of the fines fraction (particles< 63 mu m), but with a sand content varying from 9 to 40%, showed the same compressibility and undrained shear strength behavior when considering the sand a filler material. For a natural sand content of 70%, the behavior was dominated by sand. The organic matter oxidation was observed to drastically decrease the compressibility and the shear strength, and even to decrease the amount of sand needed to exhibit sand-dominated behavior, showing the importance of the reactivity or state of organic matter on the TFC.

AB  - Reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is an important indicator for hydrometeorological change, which integrates atmospheric and surface conditions, and its downward trends have been reported in many regions over the past several decades. Cold regions constitute an important ecological barrier in China; however, few studies focus on change in ET0 in cold regions. Especially in the cold region of northeast China (CRNEC), as one of the national strategic grain bases, understanding spatial-temporal variations of ET0 is important for agriculture water management and ecological protection. This study selected the observations at 113 national meteorological stations located in CRNEC and evaluated the trends of ET0 and their driving factors from 1961 to 2017. Results indicate that annual ET0 increases from the northeast to the southwest of CRNEC and has an insignificant decreasing trend in the whole study period, in which 33 stations (29.2%) show significant decreasing trends and only 19 stations (16.8%) show significant increasing trends at the 95% confidence level. An abrupt change in ET0 data is detected from 1994. Reasons for this abrupt change in ET0 vary largely over the study areas. Analysis shows that wind speed and minimum air temperature are the two major factors that control the change of ET0 before 1994. It also shows that wind speed and actual vapor pressure are the two major controlling factors after 1994. We also found that ET0 shows a certain correlation with Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Western Pacific Index, but there is a significant correlation between meteorological factors and teleconnection factors related to ET0. These findings will promote agricultural water management and improve water ecological protection in the CRNEC.

AB  - Coarse woody debris (CWD) addition is a restoration technique that has been used to reduce effects of landscape disturbance on instream habitat. However, efficacy of this technique for improving ecosystem condition is not well established, in part because monitoring designed to evaluate long-term efficacy is rare. We assessed the effectiveness of CWD additions in disturbed Coastal Plain streams at Fort Benning Military Installation, Georgia, USA, 14 y after initial restoration. In October 2003, 4 disturbed streams received CWD additions (restored streams), and 4 streams were left as unrestored controls. Pre-restoration (2001-2003) and post-restoration (2003-2006) monitoring of nutrient uptake, stream metabolism, and water-quality variables revealed 1) minimal change in water-quality variables, 2) increased stream metabolism and nutrient-uptake rates immediately following restoration, and 3) decreased metabolism and uptake over the remainder of the 3-y post-restoration period. We returned to these streams in 2017 and 2018, measured the same variables, and found minimal long-term effects of restoration on water quality, nutrient uptake, and whole-stream metabolism indicators; however, streamwater pH decreased in all streams 14 y after restoration, and there was a weak treatment x period interaction, indicating that CWD additions may decrease pH in the long term. Further, we found few relationships between watershed disturbance and water-quality variables and ecosystem function metrics, although some relationships were apparent during certain seasons and years. Our study is one of the few that have assessed the long-term effects of CWD additions, or any other stream-restoration technique, on ecosystem function. These long-term assessments may be necessary to determine if restorations are a good use of limited resources.</p>

AB  - The Yeba ductile shear zone is located on the southern margin of the middle Gangdese magmatic belt and southeast of Lhasa, China. In this paper, we systematically investigate the structural deformation history in the Yeba Group and provide the kinematics, strain pattern, mean vorticity number and temperature environment of the Yeba ductile shear zone. Three tectonic events are identified in the Yeba Group of the study area. The Yeba shear zone represents the late stage of the northward subduction of the Neo-Tethys Ocean (D-1 stage, 94-85 Ma). Since the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates, principal compressive stress (al) in the north-south direction was generated in the Yeba Group and formed composite folds (D-2 stage, similar to 50 Ma). The D-3 -stage structural deformation event of the Yeba Group in the study area is represented by the Woka ductile shear zone (22.38-14.6 Ma). Electron backscattering diffraction and chlorite geothermometry demonstrate that upper greenschist facies (213-295 degrees C) and lower greenschist facies (400-550 degrees C) conditions developed in the Yeba shear zone. Finite strain measurements of the Yeba ductile shear zone indicate that almost all deformed rocks exhibit an oblate ellipsoid consistent with near-flattening strain. Kinematic vorticity analysis of the Yeba shear zone yielded values (Wm) of 0.49-0.78, indicating a bulk general shear deformation regime with a combination of 58% pure shear and 42% simple shear. The kinematic vorticity number (58% pure shear), flattening strain pattern, and presence of opposite indicators in the same mylonitic foliation support the occurrence of a transpressive structure.

AB  - Astroglial networks constitute a non-neuronal communication system in the brain and are acknowledged modulators of synaptic plasticity. A sophisticated set of transmitter receptors in combination with distinct secretion mechanisms enables astrocytes to sense and modulate synaptic transmission. This integrative function evolved around intracellular Ca2+ signals, by and large considered as the main indicator of astrocyte activity. Regular brain physiology meticulously relies on the constant reciprocity of excitation and inhibition (E/I). Astrocytes are metabolically, physically, and functionally associated to the E/I convergence. Metabolically, astrocytes provide glutamine, the precursor of both major neurotransmitters governing E/I in the central nervous system (CNS): glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Perisynaptic astroglial processes are structurally and functionally associated with the respective circuits throughout the CNS. Astonishingly, in astrocytes, glutamatergic as well as GABAergic inputs elicit similar rises in intracellular Ca2+ that in turn can trigger the release of glutamate and GABA as well. Paradoxically, as gliotransmitters, these two molecules can thus strengthen, weaken or even reverse the input signal. Therefore, the net impact on neuronal network function is often convoluted and cannot be simply predicted by the nature of the stimulus itself. In this review, we highlight the ambiguity of astrocytes on discriminating and affecting synaptic activity in physiological and pathological state. Indeed, aberrant astroglial Ca2+ signaling is a key aspect of pathological conditions exhibiting compromised network excitability, such as epilepsy. Here, we gather recent evidence on the complexity of astroglial Ca2+ signals in health and disease, challenging the traditional, neuro-centric concept of segregating E/I, in favor of a non-binary, mutually dependent perspective on glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission.

AB  - Background: Various types of computational technologies can be used to access, store and wirelessly share private and sensitive user-related information. The 'big data' provided by these technologies may enable researchers and clinicians to better identify behavioral patterns and to provide a more personalized approach to care. The information collected, however, can be misused or potentially abused, and therefore could be detrimental to the very people who provided their medical data with the hope of improving care. This article focuses on the use of emerging mobile technologies that allow the collection of data about patients experiencing schizophrenia spectrum and related disorders. Schizophrenia has been recognized by the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations for its burden on our health care system and society [1]. Our analysis provides an overview of the range of available mobile technologies for people with schizophrenia and related conditions along with the technology's reported capabilities and limitations, and efficacy of mHealth interventions based on the data from articles. Thus, the focus of this review is first and foremost to update the scope of existing technologies as previous systematic reviews such as the ones by Alvarez-Jimenez et al. and by Firth and Torous are outdated [2, 3]. Although we also examine the ethical issues arising from the use of these technologies, for an in-depth analysis of the ethical implications of mobile Health technologies (mHealth), we refer the readers to our follow-up article. In terms of the ubiquitous availability of technology on the internet, our article summarizes significant information for mental health specialists and apprises the reader about the existence of these technologies. Objectives: In terms of the ubiquitous availability of technology on the internet, our article summarizes significant information for mental health specialists and apprises the reader about the existence of these technologies.

AB  - Bauxite residue, a byproduct of alumina manufacture, is a serious environmental pollutant due to its high leaching contents of metals and caustic compounds. Four typical anions of CO32-, HCO3-, Al(OH)(4)(-) and OH- (represented caustic compounds) and metal ions (As, B, Mo and V) were selected to assess their leaching behavior under dealkalization process with different conditions including liquid/solid ratio (L/S ratio), temperature and leaching time. The results revealed that washing process could remove the soluble composition in bauxite residue effectively. The leaching concentrations of typical anions in bauxite residue decreased as follows: c(CO32-) > c(HCO3-) > c[Al(OH)(4)(-)] > c(OH-). L/S ratio had a more significant effect on leaching behavior of OH-, whilst the leaching concentration of Al(OH)(4)(-) varied larger underleaching temperature and time treatment. Under the optimal leaching, the total alkaline, soluble Na concentrations, exchangeable Ca concentrations were 79.52, 68.93, and 136.0 mmol/L, respectively, whilst the soluble and exchangeable content of As, B, Mo and V in bauxite residue changed slightly. However, it should be noted that water leaching has released metal ions such as As, B, Mo and V in bauxite residue to the surrounding environment. The semiquantitative analysis of XRD revealed that water leaching increased the content of gismondine from 2.4% to 6.4%. The SEM images demonstrated the dissolution of caustic compounds on bauxite residue surface. The correlation analysis indicated that CO32- and HCO3- could effectively reflect the alkalinity of bauxite residue, and may be regarded as critical dealkalization indicators to evaluate alkalinity removal in bauxite residue.

AB  - Mesozoic rocks are extensively and excellently preserved in the western Indian shield in several basins. The Kachchh Mainland Basin (KMB), comprising six small sub-basins, is the main repository of these sediments. Habo Dome Basin, situated in the easternmost part of KMB and largest among the six basins, hosts clastics of the Chari Formation of Jurassic age. The fluctuating transgressive-regressive facies cycle, developed during the Callovian and Late Early Oxfordian in the Habo Dome Basin, was mainly controlled by local tectonics and not by global eustatic fluctuations. Near magmatic relationships are displayed by various elements of the clastic rocks of Habo Dome Basin. Two litho-chemical groups have been identified in Habo Dome Basin, which are cyclically repeated over entire lithostratigraphic sequence, indicating alternate pulses of sediment inputs from two different sources under palpitating tectonic conditions. Provenance indicator elements and their ratios coupled with source modeling indicate predominantly felsic source with basic and alkalic components. Integrated analysis of petrograhic and geochemical characteristics suggests two source terranes for these rocks: a granitoid source with significant basic volcanics (Banded Gneissic Complex) and a granite-gneissic source with minor alkaline volcanics (Nagarparkar Massif) lying to northeast and NNW respectively. The petrochemistry of Habo Dome clastics suggests their deposition in a fault controlled sink which was influenced by sea level changes. Drifting of the Indian plate resulted in the opening of series of rifted basins in the Kachchh Mainland during Late Triassic/Early Jurassic, which were closed later during collision of Indian plate with Eurasia at early Eocene. The Habo Dome Basin which opened up as a half graben in response to the initial stress regime, remained tectonically unstable until the cessation of pre and post collisional stress regimes.

AB  - The world's largest network of protected areas-Natura 2000 (N2000)-has been implemented to protect Europe's biodiversity. N2000 is built upon two cornerstones, the Birds Directive, which lists 691 bird species (plus one additional bird genus with no further classification) and the Habitats Directive, which lists next to a variety of species, 233 habitat types to be protected. There is evidence of the positive impact of the Directives on the EU 's biodiversity, although the overall improvement reported for species in favourable condition in the last assessment was low. However, most of the assessments are species focused, while habitats have received very little attention. Here we developed a generic workflow, which we exemplified for Germany, to assess the status of habitat coverage within the N2000 network combining information from publicly available data sources. Applying the workflow allows identification of gaps in habitat protection, followed by the prioritization of potential areas of high protection value using the conservation planning software Marxan. We found that, in Germany, N2000 covers all target habitats. However, common habitats were proportionally underrepresented relative to rare ones, which contrasts with studies focussing on the representation of species. Moreover, the German case study suggests that especially highly protected areas (i.e. covered by more than 90% with N2000 sites) build an excellent basis towards a cost-effective and efficient conservation network. Our workflow provides a generic approach to deal with the common problem of missing habitat distribution data outside of N2000 sites, information which is however crucial for managers to plan conservation actions appropriately across Europe. To avoid a biased representation of habitat types within N2000, our results underpin the importance of defining qualitative and quantitative conservation targets which will allow assesment of the trajectory of habitat protection in Europe as well as adjustment of the network accordingly-a future necessity in the light of climate change.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the potential environmental impacts associated with high rate algal ponds (HRAP) systems for wastewater treatment and resource recovery in small communities. To this aim, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was carried out evaluating two alternatives: i) a HRAP system forwastewater treatment wheremicroalgal biomass is valorized for energy recovery (biogas production); ii) aHRAP systemforwastewater treatment where microalgal biomass is reused for nutrients recovery (biofertilizer production). Additionally, both alternatives were compared to a typical small-sized activated sludge system. An economic assessment was also performed. The results showed that HRAP system coupled with biogas production appeared to be more environmentally friendly than HRAP system coupled with biofertilizer production in the climate change, ozone layer depletion, photochemical oxidant formation, and fossil depletion impact categories. Different climatic conditions have strongly influenced the results obtained in the eutrophication and metal depletion impact categories. In fact, the HRAP system located where warm temperatures and high solar radiation are predominant (HRAP system coupled with biofertilizer production) showed lower impact in those categories. Additionally, the characteristics (e.g. nutrients and heavy metals concentration) of microalgal biomass recovered from wastewater appeared to be crucial when assessing the potential environmental impacts in the terrestrial acidification, particulate matter formation and toxicity impact categories. In terms of costs, HRAP systems seemed to be more economically feasible when combined with biofertilizer production instead of biogas. On the whole, implementing HRAPs instead of activated sludge systems might increase sustainability and cost-effectiveness of wastewater treatment in small communities, especially if implemented in warm climate regions and coupled with biofertilizer production.

AB  - Maize (Zea mays L.) genotypes collected from different research institutes were evaluated against different standards associated with salinity tolerance/susceptibility under four variable saline treatment strengths S-0.8 dSm(-)1 (T-1; Control), S-4 dSm(-)1 (T-2), S-6 dSm(-)1 (T-3) and S-10 dSm(-)1 (T-4) to optimize treatment strengths for screening and to study genotype x environment interaction (GET) on the basis of shoot length (SL), root length (RL), shoot fresh weight (SFW), shoot dry weight (SDW), root fresh weight (RFW), root dry weight (RDW), sodium concentration in leaf sap (Na+), chloride concentration in leaf sap (Cl ), potassium concentration in leaf sap (K+), total proline contents in leaf sap (PRO) and sodium/potassium ratio (Na+/K+). Under S-10 dSm(-)1, genotype UAC-0020 performed relatively well based on Nat and Cl- whereas UAC-0036 performed well for K+ and Na+/K+. UAC-0024 was most stable for SFW. Under S-4 dsm(1), UAC-0028 was poor in performance for Na+, Na+/K+, SL, PRO and Cl-; similarly, UAC-0048 showed poor performance for SFW, RFW, SL and PRO; UAC-0041 and UAC-0033 posed least resistance for SL, SFW, RL and RFW, respectively. The rest of the genotypes interacted under all the variable stressful environments either positively or negatively. SL, SDW, RFW, Na+, Cl- and PRO were verified as very good indicators of salinity tolerance in maize plant. Biplot based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is reported as an effective technique to study GEI. S-4 dSm(-)1 was proved as best strength to sort out susceptible and S-10 dSm(-)1 to sort out most tolerant genotypes. The best performing genotypes could be considered for further breeding programs.

AB  - As a result of rapid industrialization and urbanization, China is experiencing severe air pollution problems. Understanding the spatiotemporal variation and trends of air pollution is a key element of an improved understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms and the implementation of the most effective risk assessment and environmental policy in the region. The motivation behind the present work is that the study region of southern Jiangsu province of China is one of the most populated and developed regions in China. The daily concentrations of particulate matter with particle diameter smaller than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) in southern Jiangsu province obtained during the year 2014 were used to derive the variogram model that provided a quantitative characterization of the spatiotemporal (ST) variation of PM2.5 concentrations in the study region. A spatiotemporal ordinary kriging (STOK) technique was subsequently employed to generate informative maps of the ST pollutant distribution in southern Jiangsu province. The results generated by STOK showed that during 2014 about 29.3% of the area was PM2.5 polluted (at various severity levels, according to the criteria established by the Chinese government), and that the number of days characterized as polluted varied from 59 to 164 at different parts of the study region. Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu province, was the place with the highest PM2.5 pollution (including 3 days of serious pollution). The PM2.5 pollution exhibited a decreasing spatial trend from the western to the eastern part of southern Jiangsu. A similar temporal PM2.5 pattern was found from the western to the eastern part of southern Jiangsu, which was characterized by 4 peaks and 3 troughs linked to different meteorological conditions and human factors.

AB  - Haematological parameters are valuable indicators of fish health status. This study is aimed to provide baseline data of the blood profile of two teleost fish species living in different environments and with divergent feeding behaviour, namely the flathead grey mullet Mugil cephalus Linnaeus, 1758, a marine herbivorous fish, and the goldfish Carassius auratus (Linnaeus, 1758), a freshwater omnivorous fish. Using an automated system coupled with flow cytometry and light microscopy, significant variations were found between M. cephalus and C. auratus blood parameters, except for haemoglobin concentration (Hgb). A significant increase in red blood cell count (RBC) and haematocrit (Hct) levels, associated with reduced mean corpuscular volume (MCV), was revealed in mullets in respect to goldfish. These data may be attributable to differences in fish species, or to their divergent physiological activeness as high RBC values are associated with fast movement and high activity with streamlined bodies, or to environmental factors such as water salinity, an increase in which may lead to erythropoiesis as an adaptive process in seawater fish. Additionally, lower values of white blood cell count (WBC) and thrombocyte count (TC) were recorded in mullets with respect to goldfish, and these changes may be due to divergent feeding habits of the two fish species, or to their different environments since increased salinity may inversely affect WBC. Overall, findings from this study provide a better understanding of the influences of divergent environmental conditions and feeding habits on fish blood parameters. The combined use of an automatic haematological count with flow cytometry was demonstrated to be effective for an early assessment of blood parameters in different fish species.

AB  - Immobilization and anesthesia of impala (Aepyceros melampus) has become a popular research theme. This demand is brought about by the increased need to immobilize and anesthetize impala and other medium-sized wild ungulates because of their increased value in game ranching and zoological collections. To improve our understanding of immobilization and general anesthesia in these species, it is paramount to be able to study them in a practical, safe research environment that does not cause harm or unnecessary stress to the animals. This study aimed to scrutinize our management and welfare practices and scientific methods of 15 wild-caught impala placed in captive confinement during a 16-wk intensive research project. The scientific methods of the project were scrutinized to identify procedures that attributed to morbidity and mortality. Indicators of impala welfare during captivity were monitored by documenting serial physical (body weight, coat condition), physiological (biochemistry and hematology), and psychologic (behavioral) aspects. Two impala suffered irreparable femoral fractures during darting and were humanly euthanized. One impala suffered cardiovascular collapse during immobilization and could not be resuscitated. The procedure of chemical capture had a morbidity and mortality rate of 14.8% and 4.4%, respectively. The impala maintained acceptable physical and physiologic parameters, including stable body weights, well-groomed coats, and values for total serum protein, serum creatinine, and hematologic parameters that were within reference ranges for the species. There were improvements in the impalas' psychological parameters, which included a decrease in the number of aggressive interactions (head butting and ramming) and an increase in the number of reciprocal allogrooming interactions. The monitored welfare indicators suggest adaptation to captivity. The study showed that impala could be successfully managed in captivity for 16 wk. However, scientific methods (namely darting) increased the risk of injury and caused fatalities.

AB  - Rock glaciers are valuable diagnostic landforms indicating permafrost creeping during their genesis and activity. Based on the analysis of high quality air-orthophoto and field work, a first polygon-based inventory of rock glaciers from the Southern Carpathians has been elaborated. In total, 306 rock glaciers were included in the inventory comprising 79 debris and 227 talus rock glaciers. Most of these landformi were classified as relict (258), while only 48, covering 2.81 km(2), were considered intact. The size of rock glaciers, considered as a proxy for past environmental conditions, and the relationships with the predictor variables (lithology, aspect, contributing area, geographic coordinates, elevation and slope range) were analysed using bivariate statistics, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and various post hoc tests. The statistical analysis revealed that the rock glaciers occurring in the highest mountain ranges in areas composed of granites and granodiorites are considerably larger than the others, because their duration of activity is greater. Strong dependences between rock glacier size and other topographic attributes (contributing area, aspect and slope range) were also confirmed. The rock glacier distribution in the Southern Carpathians is clearly controlled by topography, lithology and debris availability. The abundance of rock glaciers increases with altitude, but their size decreases slightly. In mountain units where granites and granodiorites predominate (Retezat and Paling Mountains), the density of rock glaciers and the mean specific area covered by these spectacular landforms are considerably higher than in other areas. The higher continentality effects of the Southern Carpathians enabled the formation of rock glaciers at substantially lower elevations than in the Alps. The mean altitude of intact rock glaciers front, which could be used as a morphological indicator of discontinuous permafrost, is located at 2088 m. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - 5-methylcytosine (5mC) is a key epigenetic mark which influences gene expression and phenotype. In vertebrates, this epigenetic mark is sensitive to Cd exposure, but there is no information linking such an event with changes in global 5mC levels in terrestrial gastropods despite their importance as excellentecotoxicological bioindicators of metal contamination. Therefore, we first evaluated total 5mC content in DNA of the hepatopancreas of adult Cantareus aspersus with the aim to determine whether this epigenetic mark is responsive to Cd exposure. The experiment was conducted under laboratory conditions and involved a continuous exposure, multiple dose-and time-point (14, 28, and 56 days) study design. Hepatopancreas cadmium levels were measured using Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry and the percentage of 5-mC in samples using an ELISA-based colorimetric assay. Snail death rates were also assessed. Our results, for the first time, reveal the presence of 5mC in C. aspersus and provide evidence for Cd-induced changes in global 5mC levels in DNA of gastropods and mollusks. Although less sensitive than tissue accumulation, DNA methylation levels responded in a dose-and time-dependent manner to dietary cadmium, with exposure dose having a much stronger effect than exposure duration. An obvious trend of increasing 5mC levels was observed starting at 28 days of exposure to the second highest dose and this trend persisted at the two highest treatments for close to one month, when the experiment was terminated after 56 days. Moreover, a strong association was identified between Cd concentrations in the hepatopancreas and DNA methylation levels in this organ. These data indicate an overall trend towards DNA hypermethylation with elevated Cd exposure. No consistent lethal effect was observed, irrespective of time point and Cd-dosage. Overall, our findings suggest that the total 5mC content in DNA of the hepatopancreas of land snails is responsive to sublethal Cd exposure and give new insights into invertebrate environmental epigenetics.

AB  - Background: Species-specific strategies for financing the costs of reproduction are well understood, forming a continuum ranging from high to low reliance on stored nutrients. Animals relying mostly on stored reserves are termed 'capital breeders', whereas 'income breeders' rely mostly on concurrent intake when financing the costs of reproduction. The role and adaptive value of individual variation in these strategies remain elusive. Life-history theory posits that capital breeding should be favoured when offspring reproductive value peaks, typically occurring early in the season, and that current income should increasingly be used with progressing season. Because resource limitation may hamper flexible resource allocation, a corollary prediction is that only good-condition individuals may show the expected seasonal shift in resource use. To test this prediction, we examined stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in blood and lipid-free egg yolk of breeding eider females (Somateria mollissima) from the Baltic Sea to assess the role of individual variation in the use of proteins from local diet vs. stored reserves.
   Results: We show for the first time that individuals from a single population differ in their utilization of stored reserves and concurrent intake to finance the costs of reproduction. Consistent with our prediction, heavy females predominantly used stored reserves for producing egg yolks early in the season, increasingly relying on local feeding with later onset of breeding, whereas light females showed no seasonal change in allocation strategy.
   Conclusions: Stable isotope profiling at the individual level is a powerful tool for monitoring relative changes in investment strategies through time, showing promise as an early warning indicator of ecological change in food webs.

AB  - 1. Selecting breeding habitats that ameliorate environmental limits on fitness and facilitate successful reproduction should benefit individual animals. This is particularly true in the temperate zone, where breeding early in a season presents a unique series of environmental challenges that can limit an individual's fitness. While many studies document links between habitat quality and reproductive success, few identify the cues used to assess habitat quality or the components of reproduction most influenced by occupying higher quality habitat, particularly during the early breeding season.
   2. We used detailed spatial maps and observations of all early season nesting attempts in an insular song sparrow (Melospiza melodia) population over 38 years to estimate the influence of nest-site preference on reproductive success and to test whether relative microclimate or food availability may act as cues for early season site selection.
   3. Female sparrows in preferred early season nest sites had earlier laying dates, exhibited more energetically efficient incubation behaviour and produced more offspring that recruited to the population than those nesting in less-preferred sites.
   4. Preference for potential nesting sites was positively related to leaf damage by Lepidopteran larvae, an indicator of food abundance, negatively related to early season microclimate, likely due to greater vegetation cover, and unrelated to site-specific plant phenology.
   5. Our findings show that breeding in preferred, high-quality habitat may offer females a fitness advantage by facilitating early laying and the production of offspring more likely to recruit to the population at a lower potential reproductive cost to the parent. We provide a clear demonstration of potential links between habitat preference and quality and their contributions to the ecology and life history of animals in seasonal environments.

AB  - Eggplant dip is an internationally popular appetizer, prepared in some instances under uncertain hygienic conditions with inconsistent refrigeration. This study examined the effects of citric acid on the survival of pathogenic microorganisms (Salmonella Typhimurium, Escherichia coil O157:H7 and Staphylococcus aureus) and naturally present organisms (lactic acid bacteria, LAB, aerobic bacteria, APC and yeast and mold, YM) in eggplant dip during storage. Eggplant dip with 0, 0.2,0.4, 0.6 or 0.8% citric acid was inoculated with S. Typhimurium, E. coil O157:H7 or S. aureus and stored at 4, 10 and 21 degrees C for <= 15 d. Throughout the study, the survival of the inoculated microorganisms was monitored, and LAB, APC, YM numbers and pH were determined. There was no significant (p > 0.05) effect of citric acid on inoculated S. Typhimurium and E. coil O157:H7. Salmonella and E. coli O157: H7 survived > 7 d with little reduction in viability. Reduction of S. aureus viability increased with citric add concentration and reached > 3.0 log(10) CFU/g by 15 d at 4 degrees C.
   Citric acid had no effect (p > 0.05) on the background YM during storage at 4, 10 and 21 degrees C or LAB stored at 4 and 10 degrees C, while at 21 degrees C, 0.6 and 0.8% citric acid significantly reduced LAB. Citric acid had no effect (p > 0.05) on the APC in samples stored at 4 degrees C but it had significant effects on samples stored at 10 and 21 degrees C. Work reported showed that the use of citric acid at 0.4-0.8% can inhibit the growth of S. aureus in eggplant dip, but adequate refrigeration is essential to minimize risk from this and other pathogens in this product.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) isotopic compositions of individual hydrolysable amino acids (delta N-15(AAs)) in N pools have been increasingly used for trophic position assessment and evaluation of sources and transformation processes of organic matter in marine environments. However, there are limited data about variability in delta N-15(AAs) patterns and how this variability influences marine bacteria, an important mediator of trophic transfer and organic matter transformation. We explored whether marine bacterial delta N-15(AAs) profiles change depending on the type and C: N ratio of the substrate. The delta N-15(AAs) profile of a marine bacterium, Vibrio harveyi, was examined using medium containing either glutamate, alanine or ammonium as the N source [substrate C:N ratios (range, 3 to 20) were adjusted with glucose]. The data were interpreted as a reflection of isotope fractionations associated with de novo synthesis of amino acids by bacteria. Principal component analysis (PCA) using the delta N-15 offset values normalized to glutamate + glutamine delta N-15 revealed that delta N-15(AAs) profiles differed depending on the N source and C:N ratio of the substrate. High variability in the delta N-15 offset of alanine and valine largely explained this bacterial delta N-15(AAs) profile variability. PCA was also conducted using bacterial and phytoplankton (cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae) delta N-15(AAs) profile data reported previously. The results revealed that bacterial delta N-15(AAs) patterns were distinct from those of phytoplankton. Therefore, the delta N-15(AAs) profile is a useful indicator of biochemical responses of bacteria to changes in substrate conditions, serving as a potentially useful method for identifying organic matter sources in marine environments.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which a suite of organic micropollutants (MPs) can be removed by biological filtration and the role of bioavailability and ammonia oxidizing microorganisms (AOMs) in the biodegradation process. During approximately one year, laboratory-scale columns with 8 min empty bed contact time (EBCT) and packed with anthracite as filter media were used for treating a tertiary effluent spiked with a broad range of MPs at a target concentration of 2 mu g L-1. In parallel columns, aerobic biomass growth was inhibited by using either the biocide sodium azide (500 mg L-1 NaN3) or allylthiourea (5 mg L-1 ATU), specifically inhibiting nitrifying bacteria. Once the biomass had colonized the media, around 15% of the dissolved organic carbon (DOG) contained in the untreated tertiary effluent was removed by non-inhibited columns. The removal of several MPs increased over time indicating the relevance of biological activity for the removal of MPs, while the negative control, the NaN3 inhibited column, showed no significant removal. Out of 33 MPs, 19 were recalcitrant (<25%) to biodegradation under aerobic conditions with the others exhibiting a diverse range of removal efficiency up to 95%. Through inhibition by ATU it was shown that nitrifying bacteria were clearly having a role in the degradation of several MPs, whereas the removal of other MPs was not affected by the presence of the nitrification inhibitor. A relationship between the qualitative assessment of sorption of MPs on granular activated carbon (GAC) and their removal efficiency by biodegradation on anthracite was observed. This result suggested that the affinity of the MPs for GAG media could be a useful indicator of the bioavailability of compounds during biofiltration on anthracite. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Ocean acidification, resulting from increasing anthropogenic CO2 emissions, is predicted to affect the physiological performance of many marine species. Recent studies have shown substantial reductions in aerobic performance in some teleost fish species, but no change or even enhanced performance in others. Notably lacking, however, are studies on the effects of near-future CO2 conditions on larger meso and apex predators, such as elasmobranchs. The epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) lives on shallow coral reef flats and in lagoons, where it may frequently encounter short-term periods of environmental hypoxia and elevated CO2, especially during nocturnal low tides. Indeed, H. ocellatum is remarkably tolerant to short periods (hours) of hypoxia, and possibly hypercapnia, but nothing is known about its response to prolonged exposure. We exposed H. ocellatum individuals to control (390 mu atm) or one of two near-future CO2 treatments (600 or 880 mu atm) for a minimum of 60 days and then measured key aspects of their respiratory physiology, namely the resting oxygen consumption rate, which is used to estimate resting metabolic rate, and critical oxygen tension, a proxy for hypoxia sensitivity. Neither of these respiratory attributes was affected by the long-term exposure to elevated CO2. Furthermore, there was no change in citrate synthase activity, a cellular indicator of aerobic energy production. Plasma bicarbonate concentrations were significantly elevated in sharks exposed to 600 and 880 mu atm CO2 treatments, indicating that acidosis was probably prevented by regulatory changes in acid-base relevant ions. Epaulette sharks may therefore possess adaptations that confer tolerance to CO2 levels projected to occur in the ocean by the end of this century. It remains uncertain whether other elasmobranchs, especially pelagic species that do not experience such diurnal fluctuations in their environment, will be equally tolerant.

AB  - We investigated the composition, distribution and abundance of zooplankton in the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean during the austral summer (December/January) of 2004/05, 2005/06, 2007/08 and 2008/09 using a Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR). CPR tows were conducted along two transects during voyages south of Cape Town to north of Syowa station and from north of the Mawson station area to south of Fremantle. High zooplankton abundance was recorded on each transect in the Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ) and the northern area of the Antarctic Zone (AZ). Community structure in these zones was dominated by common taxa including the ubiquitous Oithona similis and calanoid copepodites, accounting for >50% of total abundance, and Calanus simillimus, Ctenocalanus citer, Clausocalanus laticeps and Metridia lucens also occurred in high densities. Appendicularians of the genus Fritillaria were the most important component in the Cape Town to Syowa station area in 2008, with 36.9% of total abundance. The average chlorophyll a level at this time of year was the lowest (0.32 mg m(-3)) among all transects. Appendicularians are suited to oceanic oligotrophic waters; therefore, they are suited to low phytoplankton density. Foraminiferans were numerically dominant throughout the Mawson station area to Fremantle transect in 2005. Unlike Fritillaria spp., foraminiferans prefer high phytoplankton density. The elevated average chlorophyll a biomass in 2005 (0.64 mg m(-3)) provided favorable conditions for Foraminifera, which were dominant and widespread. CPR surveys provide information on the fine scale structure of the interannual distribution changes in micro-and meso-zooplankton assemblages, and the CPR is one of ideal method to monitor organisms that are indicators of environmental change.

AB  - Testate amoebae and stable isotopes have been used as surface-moisture proxies in peatlands. However, adequate modern calibration is critical to successful application and interpretation. Testate amoebae, delta C-13 of Sphagnum, and environmental conditions were examined at 126 sites within 12 peatlands of south-central and central Alaska to assess the potential of testate amoebae and delta C-13 as surface-moisture proxies. Results indicate that water-table depth and pH were both correlated with testate amoeba community composition. However, the relative importance of these two variables varied, with pH more important in wetter habitats and water-table depth more important in drier habitats. Cross-validation of transfer functions indicated that water-table depth and pH can be inferred from testate amoeba communities with mean errors of similar to 8 cm and similar to 0.4 pH units, respectively, an improvement over previous calibration work in the region. However, application of these transfer functions should consider potential temporal variability in the relative importance of pH and water-table depth, and we applied our calibration data set to a subfossil testate amoeba record to highlight how knowledge of changes in the relative importance of these environmental variables can inform interpretation. In contrast with testate amoebae, delta C-13 of Sphagnum was found to be a relatively weak indicator of water-table depth. Variable carbon sources for Sphagnum photosynthesis, such as CO2 released by methanotrophic bacteria, likely complicate the relationship between delta C-13 and moisture. Although more work is needed before delta C-13 of Sphagnum can be used as a proxy for water-table depth, testate amoebae should be useful in paleoenvironmental studies of peatlands in Alaska.

AB  - A major goal of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) is to recover historical (pre-drainage) wading bird rookeries and reverse marked decreases in wading bird nesting success in Everglades National Park. To assess efforts to restore wading birds, a trophic hypothesis was developed that proposes seasonal concentrations of small-fish and crustaceans (i.e., wading bird prey) were a key factor to historical wading bird success. Drainage of the Everglades has diminished these seasonal concentrations, leading to a decline in wading bird nesting and displacing them from their historical nesting locations. The trophic hypothesis predicts that restoring historical hydrological patterns to pre-drainage conditions will recover the timing and location of seasonally concentrated prey, ultimately restoring wading bird nesting and foraging to the southern Everglades. We identified a set of indicators using small-fish and crustaceans that can be predicted from hydrological targets and used to assess management success in regaining suitable wading bird foraging habitat. Small-fish and crustaceans are key components of the Everglades food web and are sensitive to hydrological management, track hydrological history with little time lag, and can be studied at the landscape scale. The seasonal hydrological variation of the Everglades that creates prey concentrations presents a challenge to interpreting monitoring data. To account for the variable hydrology of the Everglades in our assessment, we developed dynamic hydrological targets that respond to changes in prevailing regional rainfall. We also derived statistical relationships between density and hydrological drivers for species representing four different life-history responses to drought. Finally, we use these statistical relationships and hydrological targets to set restoration targets for prey density. We also describe a report-card methodology to communicate the results of model-based assessments for communication to a broad audience. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study presents the results of trend tests applied to high-flow and flood records from a network of catchments in the UK. These rivers have flow regimes which are relatively undisturbed by anthropogenic influences. enabling a characterization of natural, climate-driven trends. Trend tests were applied to indicators of flood magnitude and frequency, and also indicators of high-flow magnitude (10- and 30-day maxima) and duration (prevalence of high-flows). Significant positive trends over the 30-40 years leading up to 2003 were identified in all indicators. and these were primarily found in upland, maritime-influenced catchments in northern and western areas of the UK. The results suggest a trend towards more protracted high-flows and more spate conditions in northern and western areas. but trends in flood magnitude were less prevalent. Few compelling trends were found in the English lowlands, where significant high-flow trends Were influenced by a sequence of notable flood events through the exceptionally wet winter of 2000/1. The observed trends have parallels with some projections for extreme rainfall changes under climate change scenarios. However, high-flow indicators for many northern and western catchments were correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). so recent increases are probably caused by a shift towards a more prevalent positive NAO since the 1960s. Six longer (>55 years) hydrometric records were used to place recent trends in a historical context: there was little evidence for trend in the longer time series, but fluctuations in the records Suggest that recent trends may be influenced by multi-decadal variability, which has important consequences for trend detection as the majority of UK gauging, station records begin in a relatively quiescent period for high-flows.

AB  - We investigated the effects of transgenic maize (Zea mays) expressing Bacillus thuringienses toxin (Bt maize) on larval and adult Poecilus cupreus carabid beetles in laboratory studies. In no-choice trials, neonate P. cupreus larvae were fed exclusively with Spodoptera littoralis caterpillars, which had been raised on Bt maize. S. littoralis raised on conventional maize or "high quality" Calliphora sp. pupae were fed to the beetle larvae in two control treatments. Bt-maize-fed caterpillar prey increased mortality to 100% within 40 days. The experiment was repeated with 10-day-old beetle larvae. Bt treatment resulted in fewer pupae than in both controls, and in a higher mortality than in the Calliphora control. S. littoralis was suitable as exclusive prey in no-choice tests, at least for 40 days, although prey quality seemed to be low compared to Calliphora pupae. The observed effects are most likely indirect effects due to further reduced nutritional prey quality. However, direct effects cannot be excluded.
   In the second part of the study, exposure of P. cupreus to Bt intoxicated prey was examined in paired-choice tests. Adult beetles were offered a choice between different prey conditions (frozen and thawed, freshly killed or living), prey types (S. littoralis caterpillars, Calliphora sp. pupae, cereal aphids) and prey treatments (raised on Bt or conventional maize). Living prey was preferred to frozen and dead prey. Caterpillars were only preferred to fly pupae and aphids when living. Prey treatment seemed to be least important for prey selection. The tests showed that P. cupreus ingested caterpillars readily and there was no evidence of them avoiding Bt containing prey, which means exposure in the field could occur. The presented protocols are a first step towards ecological risk assessment for carabid beetles.

AB  - A program has been developed for monitoring the condition of unimproved walking tracks on a 1000-km track system in Western Tasmania, and it has been used as the basis of an eight-year study of track-impact development. The monitoring technique involves measuring track depth and two track-width indicators at permanently marked and widely dispersed sites, each site comprising ten transects located at 2-m intervals. Sites have been 'typed' on the basis of track slope, drainage and substrate characteristics, and the typing scheme has been tested and refined by assessing the relationship between type-usage groups and observed impacts. Analysis reveals that track depth and rates of erosion are strongly influenced by track type and to a lesser extent by usage, while track width is influenced mainly by usage and track bogginess.
   The time-invariant variable 'usage gradient' was introduced to compensate for the fact that usage levels on most walking tracks in Western Tasmania have varied over time. Data derived from multiple inspections at 2-3 year intervals since 1994 from over 250 sites have been used to derive impact/time curves for different type-'usage gradient' groups. Each of the impact variables can be approximated by the formula m = alphat(B), where in is the expected value of the impact variable, t is chronological time, and alpha and B are constants characteristic of the impact variable and type-'usage gradient' group in question. The typing scheme and impact-development model have the potential to be used for systematically describing and predicting impacts over extensive systems of 'typed' tracks. The implications of these findings for the ongoing monitoring, siting and management of walking tracks are discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wastewater disinfection is used in many countries for reducing fecal coliform levels in effluents. Disinfection is therefore frequently used to improve recreational bathing waters which do not comply with microbiological standards. It is unknown whether human enteric viruses (which are responsible for waterborne disease) are simultaneously inactivated alongside fecal coliforms. This laboratory study focused on the chlorination of primary treated effluent with three doses (8, 16, and 30 mg/liter) of free chlorine as sodium hypochlorite. Seeding experiments showed that inactivation (>5 log(10) units) of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis was rapid and complete but that there was poor inactivation (0.2 to 1.0 log(10) unit) of F+-specific RNA (FRNA) bacteriophage (MS2) (a potential virus indicator) at all three doses. However, seeded poliovirus was significantly more susceptible (2.8 log(10) units) to inactivation by chlorine than was the FRNA bacteriophage. To ensure that these results were not artifacts of the seeding process, comparisons were made between inactivation rates of laboratory-seeded organisms in sterilized sewage and inactivation rates of organisms occurring naturally in sewage. Multifactorial analysis of variance showed that there was no significant difference (P > 0.05) between the inactivation rates for seeded and naturally occurring FRNA bacteriophage. However, laboratory-grown poliovirus was inactivated much more rapidly than were naturally occurring, indigenous enteroviruses (P < 0.001). This may reflect differences in the way indigenous virus is presented to the disinfectant. Inactivation rates for indigenous enteroviruses were quite similar to those seen for FRNA bacteriophage at lower doses of chlorine. These results have significance for the effectiveness of chlorination as a sewage treatment process, particularly where virus contamination is of concern, and suggest that FRNA bacteriophage would be an appropriate indicator of such viral inactivation under field conditions.

AB  - The establishment of three spacies of trees as living fences was studied using three planting methods under a 3 x 3 split plot design with 4 replications. Erythrina sp, Gliricidia septum and Bursera simaruba were the species in the main plot and the planting methods were: normally cut stem, the stem with decortication and stem with an injury were the sub-plots. Trees were planted in the waning of July and the secondary growth (stem diameter), the number of branches/plant and survival were measured. Results, at 180 days after planting showed that there was no interaction between species and the planting methods For secondary growth (stem diameter) ranging between 0.22 and 0.42 cm. There was a significant (P < 0.05) interaction for the number of regrowths per plant and survival. Planting with the decorticated stem in G. sepium and Erythrina species shelved the highest values for the number of branches/plant (15 and 13, respectively); B. simaruba planted with the decorticated stem (4) and G. sepium planted with an injured stem (2) showed the lowest number of regrowths per plant. G. sepium planted with an injured stem had a significantly lower survival percentage (83%). It is concluded that normal planting with the cut stem and with the injured steric are mainly recommended for B. simaruba and For Erythrina sp, the decorticated stem is recommended. For G. sepium none of the treatments excelled. Regrowth distribution is an important indicator for the establishment of trees as living fences in grazing areas. It is recommended to continue studies on the establishment of living fences under different agroecological conditions. Also, Further studies on the biological and agronomical characteristics of the species for this purpose, as well as the effect of animals when they are planted in grazing areas, are necessary.

AB  - Two species of amphipods, Rhepoxynius abronius Barnard (Phoxacephalidae) and Eohaustorius estuarius Bosworth (Haustoriidae) commonly used in sediment bioassays were used :to assess the effects of laboratory holding on their sensitivity to the toxicants tributyltin (TBT) and cadmium (Cd). In all tests, the LC,, decreased 2 to 3-fold for animals herd for several weeks in the laboratory versus those recently collected from the field. Additionally, the LD(50) for both toxicants was also 2 to 3 times lower for both species of laboratory-maintained animals. For both species, whole-body lipids declined by a factor of 2 to 3 during the holding period and when the LD(50) for each toxicant was lipid normalized, the critical body burdens became nearly the same. Because TBT is a lipophilic compound, it is expected to partition according to organismal body lipid, however, Cd is known to not partition preferentially to lipid. It is possible that declining lipid concentrations may be the mechanistic process by which body burdens of TBT are Controlled, but for Cd, another mechanism may be more important. It was concluded from these results that decreasing whole-body lipid content may be an indicator of declining animal health (and increased sensitivity to toxicants) but the actual mechanistic control over the toxicity response remains to be elucidated. It is assumed that the standard 10-day test, conducted with recently caught animals, probably has no impact on organism health, but that caution should be used when interpreting bioassay results from long-term studies that use animals which are not maintained in optimum condition. This study also suggests that variability in response to toxicants may occur over the natural, seasonal cycle of physiological variation that occurs in populations.

TI  - DISCONTINUITY SURFACES IN THE LOWER CRETACEOUS OF THE HIGH ANDES (MENDOZA, ARGENTINA) - TRACE FOSSILS AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
LA  - English
AB  - The paleoecologic and paleoenvironmental significance of trace fossils related to discontinuity surfaces in the Lower Cretaceous marine deposits of the Aconcagua area are analysed here.  Carbonate-evaporite shoaling-upward cycles, developed by high organic production in a shallow hypersaline restricted environment, make up the section.  Two types of cycles are defined, being mainly distinguished by their subtidal unit.  Cycle I begins with a highly dolomitized lower subtidal unit (Facies A), followed upward by an intensely bioturbated upper subtidal unit (Facies B).  The nodular packstone facies (B1) is capped by a discontinuity surface (firmground or hardground) and occasionally overlain by an oystreid bed (Facies C).  Cycle II is characterized by a pelletoidal subtidal unit (Facies B2) with an abnormal salinity improverished fauna.  Both cycles end with intertidal to supratidal evaporite deposits (Facies D and E, respectively).  Attention is particularly focused on cycle I due to its ichologic content.
   The mode of preservation and the distribution of trace fossils in nodular packstone facies are controlled by original substrate consolidation.  Thalassinoides paradoxicus (pre-omission suite) represents colonization in a soft bottom, while Thalassinoides suevicus (omission suite pre-lithification) is apparently restricted to firm substrates.  When consolidation processes are interrupted early, only an embryonic hard-ground that represents a minor halt in sedimentation was developed.  Sometimes, consolidation processes continued leading to an intraformational hardground.  Colonization by Trypanites solitarius (omission suite post-lithification) and Exogyra-like oystreids possibly characterizes hard substrate stage.  When two discontinuity surfaces follow closely, a post-omission suite may be defined in relation to the lower cemented surface.
   As trace fossils are so closely related to changes in the degree of bottom lithification, they prove to be very useful as indicators of substrate evolution.  The presence of discontinuity surfaces, evidenced by trace fossil association, suggests changes of sedimentary rate and environmental conditions that should be taken into account in future studies seeking to erect depositional models for these Cretaceous deposits.

AB  - Hydroponic systems are an attractive form of urban agriculture due to their low weight load, inert substrate conditions, and overall better control of plant nutrition and growth. However, gaining urban food sovereignty cannot be at the cost of increasing environmental impacts, such as eutrophication and nonrenewable resource depletion, associated with phosphorus fertilizer use. Struvite, a wastewater byproduct, is a potential slowreleasing P source that can serve as a substitute for mineral P fertilizer. In this study, we explored the adequacy struvite in hydroponic systems, testing different quantities (5 g, 10 g and 20 g per plant) compared with monopotassium phosphate for pepper and lettuce hydroponic production. The results show competitive productions for both crops with the use of struvite, especially during the first lettuce harvest (225.5 g, 249.9 g, 272.6 g, and 250 g for 5 g, 10 g, 20 g and control, respectively) where a greater struvite dissolution was seen. Although all struvite treatments in pepper show low phosphorous content in the biomass, yields do not deviate greatly from the control (3.6 kg, 4.3 kg, 7.5 kg and 5.3 kg for 5 g, 10 g, 20 g and control, respectively). The environmental performance of all lettuce treatments showed a reduction in all impact categories, especially freshwater eutrophication and mineral resource scarcity, except for marine eutrophication. All impact categories were reduced for all pepper treatments with 10 g and 20 g of struvite. When the results are extrapolated to a full year of production, we find that the slow dissolution of struvite can sustain competitive production with an initial 20 g, with less impact in all categories except marine eutrophication

AB  - The Neogene coals of the Hotamis Formation in the Konya-Karapinar basin were examined, and the organic matter type, thermal maturity, paleodepositional environment, and Rock-Eval pyrolysis characteristic of coal samples obtained from boreholes. The total organic carbon (TOC) values of coal vary between 15.2 wt% and 47.0 wt% and the yield of extractable organic matter (EOM) values varies between 0.5% and 1.0% indicating a limited hydrocarbon production potential. Bitumen index (BI) and Quality index (QI) values were calculated for coal samples and vary from 1 to 13 mg HC/g TOC and from 75 to 260 mg HC/g TOC, respectively. Due to BI and QI values, coal samples have limited gas generation potential. The type of organic matter was determined as Type III kerogen according to Rock-Eval data. The coal samples have Tmax values between 414 and 443.C, and huminite reflectance values with 0.20%-0.41% Ro indicating that they are in the immature-early mature stage. This is supported by biomarker maturity parameters 20S/(20S + 20R) (C-29) sterane (0-0.59), beta beta/(alpha alpha + beta beta) (C-29) sterane (0-0.58), MPI-1 (0.18, 0.31) and MPI-1* (0.21, 0.37). The relative abundance of C-27-C-28-C-29 normal steranes and aromatic steroids and the abundance of partially low carbon number tricyclic terpanes of the KonyaKarapinar coals showed that the organic matter consisted of terrestrial higher plants with a small contribution of algae and microorganisms. Homohopane distributions, V/(V + Ni), V/Sc ratios show that organic matter accumulated in an environment that varies between oxic-anoxic conditions and that medium-high gammacerane index, C-27-C-28-C-29 sterane distributions, and low DBT/P ratios are compatible with the weak brackish waterfresh water depositional environment of organic matter.

AB  - The stable, economically optimal, and environmental-friendly operation of blast furnaces is still a challenge. Blast furnaces consume huge amounts of energy and are among the biggest sources of CO2 in the metal industry. The operation of industrial blast furnaces is challenging because of their sheer size, multi-phase and multi-scale physics and chemistry, slow dynamics with response times of 8 hours and more, and the lack of direct measurements of most of the important inner variables. Model-based schemes are prime candidates for providing the missing information and improving the operation. However, only recently, such schemes have been applied successfully, and there is still a lot of room for improvements. The spatial extension, the lack of precise mechanistic knowledge about the chemical and physical phenomena, and the presence of unmeasured disturbances make the application of first-principle models to process operations extremely challenging. In this work, a hybrid dynamic model is developed for the prediction of the hot metal silicon content and the slag basicity in the blast furnace process. These two variables are the key indicators of the internal process conditions, and the ultimate goal of our work is to control them by a model-based scheme. The core relationships between the process variables are imposed by a first-principles-based steady-state model, and a parallel data-based model represents the process dynamics and compensates for the deficiencies of the mechanistic model. Validation results for real plant measurements of a world-scale blast furnace show that the hybrid model is more accurate than the rigorous model and a stand-alone data-based model in long-term predictions of the dynamic behavior of the process.

AB  - Multi-Area Multi-Fuel Economic Dispatch (MAMFED) aims to allocate the best generation schedule in each area and to offer the best power transfers between different areas by minimizing the objective functions among the available fuel alternatives for each unit while satisfying various constraints in power systems. In this paper, a Fuzzified Squirrel Search Algorithm (FSSA) algorithm is proposed to solve the single-area multi-fuel economic dispatch (SAMFED) and MAMFED problems. Squirrel Search Algorithm (SSA) mimics the foraging behavior of squirrels based on the dynamic jumping and gliding strategies. In the SSA approach, predator presence behavior and a seasonal monitoring condition are employed to increase the search ability of the algorithm, and to balance the exploitation and exploration. The suggested approach considers the line losses, valve point loading impacts, multi-fuel alternatives, and tie-line limits of the power system. Because of the contradicting nature of fuel cost and pollutant emission objectives, weighted sum approach and price penalty factor are used to transfer the bi-objective function into a single objective function. Furthermore, a fuzzy decision strategy is introduced to find one of the Pareto optimal fronts as the best compromised solution. The feasibility of the FSSA is tested on a three-area test system for both the SAMFED and MAMFED problems. The results of FSSA approach are compared with other heuristic approaches in the literature. Multi-objective performance indicators such as generational distance, spacing metric and ratio of non-dominated individuals are evaluated to validate the effectiveness of FSSA. The results divulge that the FSSA is a promising approach to solve the SAMFED and MAMFED problems while providing a better compromise solution in comparison with other heuristic approaches.

AB  - Denitrifying phosphorus removal is a cost and energy efficient treatment technology that relies on polyphosphate accumulating organisms (DPAOs) utilizing nitrate or nitrite as terminal electron acceptor. Denitrification is a multistep process, but many organisms do not possess the complete pathway, leading to the accumulation of intermediates such as nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas and ozone depleting substance. Candidatus Accumulibacter organisms are prevalent in denitrifying phosphorus removal processes and, according to genomic analyses, appear to vary in their denitrification abilities based on their lineage. Denitrification kinetics and nitrous oxide accumulation in the absence of inhibition from free nitrous acid is a strong indicator of denitrification capabilities of Accumulibacter exposed long-term to nitrate or nitrite as electron acceptor. Thus, we investigated the preferential use of the nitrogen oxides involved in denitrification and nitrous oxide accumulation in two enrichments of Accumulibacter and a competitor - the glycogen accumulating organism Candidatus Competibacter. We modified a metabolic model to predict phosphorus removal and denitrification rates when nitrate, nitrite or N2O were added as electron acceptors in different combinations. Unlike previous studies, no N2O accumulation was observed for Accumulibacter in the presence of multiple electron acceptors. Electron competition did not limit denitrification kinetics or lead to N2O accumulation in Accumulibacter or Competibacter. Despite the presence of sufficient internal storage polymers (polyhydroxyalkanoates, or PHA) as energy source for each denitrification step, the extent of denitrification observed was dependent on the dominant organism in the enrichment. Accumulibacter showed complete denitrification, whereas Competibacter denitrification was limited to reduction of nitrate to nitrite.

AB  - The aim of the study was to study the effect of feeding an active carbon feed additive (ACFS) on the biological fish-breeding indicators of young fish raised in closed reservoirs. The experiment was conducted in the conditions of the sturgeon farm "SOUTHERN CENTER of STURGEON BREEDING Latitude 46.686527, longitude 38.292442, Krasnodar Territory, Yeisk. The object of the study was the juvenile sturgeon of the ship. In the experiments, the traditional technology of keeping and feeding sturgeon fish with combined starter feeds in closed-loop installations was used. Analyzed the physico-chemical properties of water and the maintenance of chemical and toxic substances in feed sturgeon; the influence of the application of the feed ACF on biological indicators of fish, growth rate, survival rate, feed consumption, nutrient-dense foods and the coefficient of fatness of young sturgeon; the influence of application of active coal feed additives on the development of muscle tissue, chemical body composition of juvenile fish and the content of heavy metals. It is established that in the course of the experiment, all indicators of water in a closed water supply system was stable and consistent with existing requirements. It was found that the use of ACF in feeding young sturgeon fish contributes to an increase in their weight by 5.3-10.2%, the fatness coefficient-by 1.7-7.5% and a reduction in feed costs for products-by 5.0-8.9 %. The use of ACFS has a positive effect on the development of muscle tissue, increasing the content of protein in it by 0.41 - 0.42 %, fat-by 0.16-0.32 %, and also reduces the content of heavy metals in the body of a young sturgeon by 1.5-2.0 times.

AB  - The environmental history of the source region of the Yellow River (SRYR) is vital for understanding its hydrological response to climate processes in the alpine northeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP). In this study, we present the first sediment core record from Lake Gyaring, one of the largest fresh lakes in SRYR, using proxies of total organic carbon, total nitrogen, C/N ratio, delta C-13(org), chlorophyll a, and grain size, to discuss the environmental variations over past 10 kyr. The results show that sedimentary organic matter mainly originated from the aquatic macrophytes and phytoplankton, the relative abundance of which can serve as a qualitative indicator of lake level changes of Lake Gyaring. From 10 to 6.2 cal kyr B.P., the notable expansion of macrophytes was favored by the warm conditions and an enlarged littoral zone due to lake-level decline. The abrupt cooling between 8.9 and 8 cal kyr B.P. led to temporal lake-level rises that significantly reduced macrophyte primary production. After 6.2 cal kyr B.P., the lake turned to be phytoplankton-dominated following the cooling trend and stepwise increase in lake level. The inferred climate pattern in the lake catchment with an overall dry early to mid Holocene and moister mid to late Holocene disagrees with the Asian monsoon variations. This phenomenon is well recognized by the lake-level records from most of the northeastern TP lakes, implying that strong evaporation in semi-arid lake catchments could have outweighed the increased regional precipitation during early to mid Holocene and vice versa for mid to late Holocene.

AB  - Ca2+ is an essential signaling messenger in all eukariotic cells, playing a pivotal role in many cellular functions as cell growth control (differentiation, fertilization and apoptosis), secretion, gene expression, enzyme regulation, among many others. This basic premise includes trypanosomatids as Trypanosoma cruzi and various species of Leishmania, the causative agents of Chagas disease and leishmaniasis respectively, where intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](i)) has been demonstrated to be finely regulated. Nevertheless [Ca2+] i has been difficult to measure because of its very low cytoplasmic concentration (typically around 50-100 nM), when compared to the large concentration in the outside milieu (around 2 mM in blood). The development of intracellular fluorescent Ca2+-sensitive indicators has been of paramount importance to achieve this goal. The success was based on the synthesis of acetoximethylated derivative precursors, which allow the fluorescent molecules typically composed of many hydrophilic carboxyl groups responsible for its high affinity Ca2+-binding (and therefore very hydrophilic), to easily cross the plasma membrane. Once in the cell interior, unspecific esterases split the hydrophobic moiety from the fluorescent backbone structure, releasing the carboxyl groups, transforming it in turn to the acid form of the molecule, which remain trapped in the cytoplasm and regain its ability to fluoresce in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Among them, Fura-2 is by far the most used, because it is a ratiometric (two different wavelength excitation and one emission) Ca2+ indicator with a Ca2+ affinity compatible with the [Ca2+](i). This protocol essentially consists in loading exponential phase parasites with Fura-2 and recording changes in [Ca2+](i) by mean of a double wavelength spectrofluorometer. This technique allows the acquisition of valuable information about [Ca2+](i) changes in real time, as a consequence of diverse stimuli or changes in conditions, as addition of drugs or different natural modulators.

AB  - Coastal districts of Bangladesh are increasingly suffering from climatic hazards (e.g., cyclone, flood, saltwater intrusion). Tropical cyclones and floods particularly affect millions of people almost every year. Massive property damages and life losses are a common scenario when these disasters hit the coastal belt. Moreover, due to climate change impact, saltwater intrusion is increasing significantly in the coastal districts, especially during dry seasons impacting crop production and drinking water sources. The amount of asset and population exposed to natural hazards have increased significantly in the coastal belt, which has exacerbated the risk of natural hazards. Previous studies on the disaster risk of coastal districts of Bangladesh did not explicitly account for the key vulnerability and lack of coping capacity parameters that are crucial for a comprehensive risk assessment. This study assesses the disaster risk of 19 coastal districts of Bangladesh using the Index for Risk Management (INFORM) model. The multi-layered INFORM framework particularly assesses the risk of coastal communities considering socioeconomic vulnerabilities and vulnerable groups as well as institutional and infrastructural coping capacity under multiple hazards. Forty-five core risk indicators are used to evaluate the final risk score of the communities. The outcome of the study shows that 11 districts are facing moderate to very high level of risk in the coastal belt. The island district, Bhola, has the highest level of risk among the coastal districts, whereas Cox's Bazar, Chandpur, and Feni districts fall into the lowest risk region. In addition to hazard susceptibility, poverty & development, vulnerable health condition and access to the health care system are key vulnerable factors that potentially increase the overall risk. The outcome of this study is expected to be useful for preparing an effective disaster risk mitigation plan by decision-makers.

AB  - Background Extraction of environmental fate parameters for pesticides by inverse modeling in laboratory experiments has evolved to become a common practice in higher tier exposure modeling. This study focuses on flooded paddy soil conditions using a simple container test system. Four active ingredients of paddy herbicide were tested. The results were parameterized and transferred to analyze the effect of formulation types on the outdoor experimental data via inverse analyses of two structurally-compatible mathematical models, namely: pesticide concentration in paddy field for laboratory (PCPF-LR) and PCPF for outdoors (PCPF-1R(v1.1)).
   Results After in-laboratory calibration, the PCPF-LR model revealed statistically acceptable or ideal simulations of pesticide concentrations in both the aqueous and soil phases (e.g. Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency > 0.7), in addition to determining the apparent sorption from the laboratory data. The extracted persistence indicators (degradation half-life, DegT(50)) in the aqueous phase were 1.4-38.7 times higher than those of the dissipation (DT50) due to the exclusion of partitioning and phase transfer processes (diffusion and sorption). In the outdoor experiment, 72% of the outdoor-calibrated simulations of the PCPF-1R(v1.1) model, showed statistically acceptable representations of the concentrations in paddy water. Furthermore, the DegT(50) as 'bulk' degradation in paddy water was statistically insignificant between the formulation types; however, the DT50 demonstrated statistically different results.
   Conclusion The laboratory/outdoor data interconnections using proposed modeling approach facilitate the data-specific model calibration and analysis. These can be useful in the exposure modeling of paddy pesticide by manipulating the parameter uncertainties associated with the experimental constraints.

AB  - It has been previously shown that the diffraction quality of protein crystals strongly depends on mass transport during their growth. In fact, several studies support the idea that the higher the contribution of the diffusion during mass transport, the better the diffraction quality of the crystals. In this work, we have compared the crystal quality of two model (thaumatin and insulin) and two target (HBII and HBII-III) proteins grown by two different methods to reduce/eliminate convective mass transport: crystal growth in agarose gels and crystal growth in solution under microgravity. In both cases, we used identical counterdiffusion crystallization setups and the same data collection protocols. Additionally, critical parameters such as reactor geometry, stock batches of proteins and other chemicals, temperature, and duration of the experiments were carefully monitored. The diffraction datasets have been analyzed using a principal component analysis (PCA) to determine possible trends in quality indicators. The relevant indicators show that, for the purpose of structural crystallography, there are no obvious differences between crystals grown under reduced convective flow in space and convection-free conditions in agarose gel, indicating that the key factor contributing to crystal quality is the reduced convection environment and not how this reduced convection is achieved. This means that the possible detrimental effect on crystal quality due to the incorporation of gel fibers into the protein crystals is insignificant compared to the positive impact of an optimal convection-free environment provided by gels. Moreover, our results confirm that the counterdiffusion technique optimizes protein crystal quality and validates both environments in order to deliver high quality protein crystals, although other considerations, such as protein/gel interactions, must be considered when defining the optimal crystallization setup.

AB  - A possible impact of sample preparation on the chemical fractionation results is generally underestimated in studies of forms of occurrence of heavy metals in river sediments. Our analysis of the recently published results of sequential extraction of chromium has revealed the effect of sample grinding on the result of determination of mobile chromium fractions in river sediments. This observation has been experimentally verified along with the analysation of potential effect of river sediment drying conditions on chromium distribution pattern. The studies were carried out on river sediments polluted with tannery effluents (Cr, 29.2-233 mg/kg). The determined content of chromium bound to carbonates in powdered samples was 2 to 7 times higher than those in raw river sediment samples. It was shown that the main reason was the different kinetic characteristics of chromium leaching in these sediments. Using the shrinking core model, it was found that diffusion through the "ash layer" was the rate-controlling step during the extraction of the carbonate fraction of chromium. It has been additionally confirmed that common air drying of sediment samples does not affect the results of chemical fractionation of chromium. The results of our studies are also vital for the assessment of environmental risk posed by river sediments polluted with heavy metals. In the case of sediment samples used in this study, powdering changed the risk category (RAC) from low risk to high risk. Hence, in order to achieve a realistic assessment of chromium mobility and environmental risk, it is advisable to use raw samples, despite their poorer homogeneity, and thus, lower precision of chemical fractionation results.

AB  - Autonomous vehicles are gaining increased attention but surveys have shown that a large percentage of people are wary of adopting the new technology. One possible explanation for the hesitancy is that the occupant would not be comfortable with the driving style as a result of the control models and their parameters as set by the manufacture. Comfort level is subjective in nature and therefore varies between individuals. To combat this issue, autonomous vehicles must be able to adapt to the driving style preference of the user. If we assume drivers are more comfortable with their own driving style, we can choose to have the vehicle learn and incorporate the driver's style into the control models. However, there is still no widely accepted "best" model. One modelmay prove to better represent a particular driver than other models though a driver may choose unsafe driving conditions, the replication of which should not take precedence over the safety of the occupant. In this paper, we propose a multimodel approach to find the best driver model for describing an individual's longitudinal driving style on highway. A method for extracting the indicators of an individual's driving style is proposed first. Then, a multimodel-based evaluation method is described in detail. Chandler, Herman,& Montroll, General Motors Nonlinear, Tampere, Addison & Low, Optimal Velocity Model, and Neural Network models are trained and compared in this paper. The model with the best performance in replicating driving style is further coupled with a model predictive controller to include safety constraints for safer driving. Finally, the proposed multimodel approach is tested with driving data collected from five different drivers. The test results show that our multimodel-based approach is showing advantage over a single model approach in imitating an individual's longitudinal driving style.

AB  - Leaf phenology is one of the most reliable bioindicators of ongoing global warming in temperate and boreal zones because it is highly sensitive to temperature variation. A large number of studies have reported advanced spring leaf-out due to global warming, yet the temperature sensitivity of leaf-out has significantly decreased in temperate deciduous tree species over the past three decades. One of the possible mechanisms is that photoperiod is limiting further advance to protect the leaves against potential damaging frosts. However, the "photoperiod limitation" hypothesis remains poorly investigated and experimentally tested. Here, we conducted a photoperiod- and temperature-manipulation experiment in climate chambers on two common deciduous species in Europe: Fagus sylvatica (European beech, a typically late flushing species) and Aesculus hippocastanum (horse chestnut, a typically early flushing species). In agreement with previous studies, we found that the warming significantly advanced the leaf-out dates by 4.3 and 3.7 days/degrees C for beech and horse chestnut saplings, respectively. However, shorter photoperiod significantly reduced the temperature sensitivity of beech only (3.0 days/degrees C) by substantially increasing the heat requirement to avoid leafing-out too early. Interestingly, the photoperiod limitation only occurs below a certain daylength (photoperiod threshold) when the warming increased above 4 degrees C for beech trees. In contrast, for chestnut, no photoperiod threshold was found even when the ambient air temperature was warmed by 5 degrees C. Given the species-specific photoperiod effect on leaf phenology, the sequence of the leaf-out timing among forest tree species may change under future climate warming conditions. Nonphotoperiodic species may benefit from warmer springs by starting the growing season earlier than photoperiodic sensitive species, modifying forest ecosystem structure and functions, but this photoperiod limitation needs to be further investigated experimentally in numerous species.

AB  - AimsThe mean biomass ATP concentration in aerobic soils is around 10-11mol ATP g(-1) biomass C, within a fairly narrow range. It is much lower in short-term incubated laboratory waterlogged soils. However, the biomass ATP concentration in waterlogged paddy soils under field conditions remains unknown. This is investigated.MethodsSoil microbial biomass C (biomass C), ATP, biomass ATP and heavy metal (Cd, Zn, and Cu) concentrations in soil and rice were measured in a Chinese paddy soil growing rice. Soils and plants were analyzed at day 0, 30, 75 and 90, over the 90day growing period with inputs of inorganic fertilizer, or biochar and manure singly or in combination.ResultsBoth biomass C and ATP concentrations increased, range from 14.9-30.5% for microbial biomass C and 115.8-160.1% for ATP, from initial values until the end of the experiment following manure or biochar addition. An important result was that the biomass ATP concentration increased throughout the growth period. There were also significant negative correlations (p<0.05) between total and available Cd and these three microbial parameters, despite the low levels of Cd. Over the same period, total plant Cd concentrations increased, and soil Cd decreased. This suggests that the rice acted as a bioaccumulator. The microbial biomass was then in a continually decreasingly toxic environment and responded rapidly by increasing its size.ConclusionsThese results demonstrate clear differences in microbial energy dynamics between aerobic and anaerobic microbial populations. Both ATP and biomass C are useful bioindicators of the effects of cadmium contamination on microbial processes in waterlogged soil.

AB  - Many human activities lead to soil contamination by heavy metals and polluted areas must undergo the remediation process. Among various techniques, immobilisation with organic amendments is gaining popularity, as it reduces the bioavailability of heavy metal. The main aim of this study has been to evaluate the applicability of compost as stabilisation material to reduce metal bioavailability. Another goal has been to determine practical applicability of developed factors as a reliable and helpful indicator of metal-soil-plant interactions. The transfer of metals in environment was described by the bioconcentration factors (BCET BCFA) and the contamination level coefficient (CCL). Bioconcentration factors were calculated on the basis of total and bioavailable amounts of heavy metals. The investigations were carried out under greenhouse conditions with two soils (light and medium) with and without biowaste compost amendment and two test plants (winter barley and white mustard) at a simulated contamination with Cu (doses of 25 and 50 mg kg(-1)) and Zn (doses of 100 and 200 mg kg(-1)). It was demonstrated that the proposed BCFT BCFA and CCL are reliable and helpful indicators of phytotoxicity. Regardless of the experimental factors, BCF T ranged from 0.1 to 1.5. BCFA from 0.5 to 8.8 and CCL from 1.0 to 4.0. Additionally, the presented threshold of toxicity, determined on the basis of the above indicators, facilitates the interpretation of metal-soil-plant interactions. The results proved that compost is a valuable organic amendment, which can significantly reduce metal bioavailability. Moreover, the proposed bioconcentration factor (BCFT BCFA) and the contamination level coefficient (CCL) seem to be useful tools to assess soil contamination in relation to environment phytotoxicity. The two-sided F-Snedecor test and Student's t-test were applied as statistical tools for calculation and interpretation of the results. The visualisation of data was achieved via violin plots.

AB  - In recent decades, the conservation of biodiversity has become one of the main areas under consideration in managing forests in an ecologically sustainable way. Forest management practices are primary drivers of diversity and may enhance or decrease forest biodiversity, according to the measures applied (thinning options). We have focused on three beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forests across a latitudinal gradient in Italy, characterised by different structures resulting from dissimilar management. We tested the short-term effects of differently-based silvicultural intervention vs. stands where no silvicultural practices were applied on biodiversity indicators and related proxies: deadwood amounts, microhabitat density, floristic richness and life form abundance. In each study area, the occurrence of the above indicators and proxies was evaluated before and after the implementation of crop tree thinning (CTT) and thinning from below (LT) methods, comparing them with control areas where no interventions were performed. After two years, the management options resulted in different responses of the investigated parameters. The CTT increased deadwood amounts in comparison with the LT ones, while stumps increased significantly after the LT thinning. Microhabitats increased significantly where intervention was not undertaken. On the contrary, they remained unaltered after the LT treatments. CTT thinning created favourable conditions for the development of microhabitats and their proliferation in the long term. Two years after the application of the CTT thinning treatment, all forest stands demonstrated a significant increase in their floristic richness and herb layer cover. Significant differences were also found in both the frequency and cover of life forms in relation to silvicultural treatment. These findings provide a better understanding of short-term effects of silvicultural treatment useful for maintaining biodiversity in mountain beech forests.

AB  - Objective To study the association between neighbourhood socioeconomic status and diabetes prevalence, incidence, and control in the entire population of northeastern Madrid, Spain.
   Setting Electronic health records of the primary-care system in four districts of Madrid (Spain).
   Participants 269942 people aged 40 or older, followed from 2013 to 2014.
   Exposure Neighbourhoodsocioeconomic status (NSES), measured using a composite index of seven indicators from four domains of education, wealth, occupation and living conditions.
   Primary outcome measures Diagnosis of diabetes based on ICPC-2 codes and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c %).
   Results In regression analyses adjusted by age and sex and compared with individuals living in low NSES neighbourhoods, men living in medium and high NSES neighbourhoods had 10% (95% CI: 6% to 15%) and 29% (95% CI: 25% to 32%) lower prevalence of diabetes, while women had 27% (95% CI: 23% to 30%) and 50% (95% CI: 47% to 52%) lower prevalence of diabetes. Moreover, the hazard of diabetes in men living in medium and high NSES neighbourhoods was 13% (95% CI: 1% to 23%) and 20% (95% CI: 9% to 29%) lower, while the hazard of diabetes in women living in medium and high NSES neighbourhoods was 17% (95% CI: 3% to 29%) and 31% (95% CI: 20% to 41%) lower. Individuals living in medium and high SES neighbourhoods had 8% (95% CI: 2% to 15%) and 15% (95% CI: 9% to 21%) lower prevalence of lack of diabetes control, and a decrease in average HbA1c % of 0.05 (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.10) and 0.11 (95% CI: 0.06 to 0.15).
   Conclusions Diabetes prevalence, incidence and lack of control increased with decreasing NSES in a southern European city. Future studies should provide mechanistic insights and targets for intervention to address this health inequity.

AB  - Water distribution pipelines installed underground has possible risks of pipe failure due to corrosion as it ages while urban soils have been noted to have highly elevated concentration of heavy metals due to various human activities. The study aimed to assess the degree of external corrosion of distribution pipe networks and identify probable sources of heavy metals in the surrounding aggressive soil environments. Soil samples were collected with the aid of soil auger at a depth of about 1.0 m while the analyzed soil properties and metals content were done using the standard procedures in the laboratory. The soil quality properties of interest are: soil pH, moisture content, soil temperature, soil resistivity, porosity, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), chloride ions, sulphate ions, total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), and microbial counts with heavy metals of Cu, Fe, Zn and Mn. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify major soil quality indicators affecting soil corrosivity while multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and cluster analysis (CA) were used to evaluate the spatial variability among the sampling locations, interrelationship between variables and source of heavy metals in soils, respectively. A total consideration of all the analyzed variables on the degree of external corrosion on buried pipelines indicates severely corrosive to mildly corrosive state. PCA identified chemical, moisture content, microbial influenced corrosion (MIC), and heavy metal as four principal factors accounting for 89.4% of total variation in soil quality properties. The results of multivariate statistical analyses identified two sources of metals as from soil parent materials and anthropogenic activities while MANOVA showed that the physio-chemical properties varied significantly different at among the sampling locations.

AB  - Agri-environment schemes (AES) are the main policy mechanism available for reversing the widespread declines of European farmland biodiversity. We assessed the impact of AES land management on the abundance of bird species whose populations have declined as a consequence of agricultural intensification. The AES involved the deployment of a whole-farm package of wildlife-friendly land management options covering an average of 7% of the farmed area. The study was conducted across three English regions and focused on species of conservation concern and on a wider suite of farmland birds comprising the UK Government's Farmland Bird Indicator (FBI). Changes in avian abundance on AES farms were compared with those measured across the wider farmed landscape as part of a national bird monitoring scheme. Twelve out of 17 priority species, and the FBI, showed more positive changes in abundance on AES farms in at least one region. Eight species exhibited sustained responses to AES management in at least one region, and eight species exhibited a temporary enhancement in abundance in at least one region. Temporary responses to AES management followed a large scale failure of key AES options to establish during successive wet and cold summers, and involved species known to depend on the habitats provided by these options. In order to offset ongoing declines of FBI species in the wider farmed countryside of 2.3-4.1% per annum, we estimate 26-33% of FBI populations would need to be subject to AES-type management. This study demonstrates the potential for AES land management to substantially enhance the abundance of priority farmland birds and highlights the need for option packages that are resilient to the impacts of variable weather conditions.

   Results. Groups differed statistically significantly according to the left ventricular ejection fraction: 56 (48 divided by 64) - in the group of comparison, 61 (59 divided by 65) - in the group of patients receiving therapy with Cerebrolysin (p < 0.05). In the group of patients receiving Cerebrolysin, an increase in score according to MMSE (p < 0.01) was noted from 25 (24 divided by 27) to 26.2 (24-28) points, and in the group without brain neuroprotection in the preoperative period a decrease in score according the Mini-Mental State Examination was revealed to be from 25.5 (25 divided by 27) to 25 (23 divided by 27) (p < 0.01). Clinical value of the level of protein S100 beta as a biological indicator of postoperative cognitive dysfunction after cardiac surgery was ambiguous and required additional research.
   Conclusion. Brain neuroprotection with use of Cerebrolysin (authors' schema) promoted not only maintenance but also improvement of cognitive functions and decreased the likelihood of complications in mental activity after coronary artery bypass graft surgery under conditions of artificial circulation and cold cardioplegia, particularly in patients with a high risk for their development.

AB  - Assessing photosynthesis rates with remote sensing is important for tracking the physiological state of plants. The photochemical reflectance index (PRI) is a good estimator of short-term light-use efficiency (LUE) at the leaf scale but its responses to environmental factors are poorly understood. In this study, we assessed changes in the responses of the PRI to ozone exposure and to an increase in atmospheric drought (separately and combined) in oak (Quercus robur) and holm oak (Quercus ilex) that were planted in climatic cells under controlled conditions. The aim was to evaluate the ability of the PRI as a relevant indicator to assess the impact of abiotic factors on photosynthesis. Leaf-scale measurements of biochemical, physiological and spectral properties, including the PRI in dim light on dark-adapted leaves (PRI0), kinetics of PRI responses to PAR variations (photosynthetically active radiation), and leaf chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were performed. The results show that PRI0 is a good proxy of the leaf chlorophyll content, and is correlated to chlorophyll fluorescence parameters on dark adapted leaves (F-o, F-m). The correction of the PRI from the leaf chlorophyll content variations (PRIc) significantly improves correlations between the PRI and NPQ (non-photochemical quenching). The variability of PAR(sat) (estimated PAR value at PRI saturation using PRI vs. PAR relationships) depends on ozone exposure and on the increase in atmospheric vapor pressure deficit. For Quercus robur, results highlight that PAR(sat) is linked to abiotic stress indicating that the PRI may be used as a relevant indicator of abiotic factors limiting the photosynthesis. Quercus ilex did not show significant variability in PRI0 and PAR(sat), which suggest that it is a more drought resistant species than Q. robur.

AB  - Water shortage in the arid-semiarid regions of China seriously hampers ecosystem construction. Therefore, elucidation of the mechanisms by which vegetation in that area responds to drought stress may enable us to improve utilization of limited water resources and thus contend with the problem of drought and water shortage. We studied Bothriochloa ischaemum, a native grass species, conducted potting control tests to compare several indicators of B. ischaemum grown under three different moisture conditions (80%, 60%, 40% Field capacity represent sufficient water supply, mild water stress, and serious water stress, respectively). Plant response parameters measured included biomass accumulation, root morphology, transient water use efficiency (WUE), stable carbon isotope ratio (delta C-13), and stable carbon isotope discrimination (Delta C-13) of various plant organs and their interrelationships. B. ischaemum had the greatest WUE under mild drought stress. However, serious drought stress resulted in considerable decline in overall biomass but substantial increase in root-to-shoot ratio and fine-root biomass. Coarse-root biomass dropped appreciably, indicating that serious drought stress leads to allocation non-uniformity of the carbon "sink." delta C-13 and Delta C-13 of stem correlated considerably with root morphology, suggesting the feasibility of characterizing WUE, biomass, and root morphology of B. ischaemum via the stable carbon isotope approach. Our evaluation of 21 drought resistance indicators of B. ischaemum showed that under a given moisture treatment gradient one can isolate an optimal indicator to express growth, morphology, and physiology, to improve the accuracy of depicting plant drought resistance and simplify the drought resistance indicator system. This study elucidates the response mechanism of B. ischaemum to drought stress and provides theoretical support to screening of drought-resistant plants across the arid-semiarid regions of China.

AB  - Artificial flow fluctuations due to the operation of hydropower plants, frequently described as hydropeaking, result in a constant decrease of biomass of specific macrozoobenthos (MZB) taxa. For the presented case study, we assessed three reaches in the Ziller River catchment. At each sampling reach we performed the Multi-Habitat-Sampling (MHS) method with a Water Framework Directive (WFD) compliant AQEM/MHS net according to the Austrian guideline. Additionally, a hydraulic-specific sampling was conducted with a modified Box (Surber) sampler. As a basis for predictive habitat modelling of the MZB fauna, we measured abiotic parameters like mean (v(40)) and bottom-near (v(bottom)) flow rate or water depth respectively, for each box sample. In addition, the choriotope type, representing grain size classes, was determined. One of the main results is, that the national status assessment was not capable to reflect the impact of pulse release at the investigated river stretches on the basis of status classes. Moreover, we figured out that 1) habitats of stagnophilic macroinvertebrate taxa are minimized in channelized stretches affected by hydropeaking, leading to heavy quantitative losses for populations, becoming apparent in significant decreases in total individual numbers and biomass for many taxa. 2) The minor respond of the ecological status class in affected stretches by applying the WFD compliant national assessment method for macroinvertebrates owes to the tolerance of rheobiont or rheophilic taxa commonly classified as indicators for good conditions regarding saprobity or degradation score. 3) A development of a stressor-specific sampling design is required as the MHS method largely ignores vulnerable habitats. 4) The habitat suitability of selected species provides efficient expertise for impact assessment and mitigation measure design in terms of predictive habitat modelling.

AB  - Environmental exposure assessments (EEA) and epidemiological studies require urban air pollution models with appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions. Uncertain available data and inflexible models can limit air pollution modeling techniques, particularly in under developing countries. This paper develops a hierarchical fuzzy inference system (HFIS) to model air pollution under different land use, transportation, and meteorological conditions. To improve performance, the system treats the issue as a large-scale and high-dimensional problem and develops the proposed model using a three-step approach. In the first step, a geospatial information system (GIS) and probabilistic methods are used to preprocess the data. In the second step, a hierarchical structure is generated based on the problem. In the third step, the accuracy and complexity of the model are simultaneously optimized with a multiple objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm. We examine the capabilities of the proposed model for predicting daily and annual mean PM2.5 and NO2 and compare the accuracy of the results with representative models from existing literature. The benefits provided by the model features, including probabilistic preprocessing, multi-objective optimization, and hierarchical structure, are precisely evaluated by comparing five different consecutive models in terms of accuracy and complexity criteria. Fivefold cross validation is used to assess the performance of the generated models. The respective average RMSEs and coefficients of determination (R-2) for the test datasets using proposed model are as follows: daily PM2.5 = (8.13, 0.78), annual mean PM2.5 = (4.96, 0.80), daily NO2 = (5.63, 0.79), and annual mean NO2 = (2.89, 0.83). The obtained results demonstrate that the developed hierarchical fuzzy inference system can be utilized for modeling air pollution in EEA and epidemiological studies.

AB  - High growth rate is one of the criteria used for the selection of species to be used in metal phytoextraction programs. This study was carried out to characterize the growth characteristics of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), castor bean (Ricinus communis L.), corn (Zea mays L), and vetiver [Vetiveria zizanioides (L.) Nash] grown on a soil contaminated with lead (Pb), with and without pH correction, to improve agronomic practices regarding phytoremediation programs. The experiment was designed as a randomized block with four replications; treatments were arranged in a split-plot arrangement, with the main plot representing the species (sunflower, castor bean, corn, and vetiver), with or without pH correction and soil fertilization, and the split-plot representing harvest periods (60, 90, and 120 days after planting). After variance analysis and mean comparison analysis of the data by the Tukey test (p <= 0.05), a significant effect was observed from soil pH correction for vetiver in all of the growth variables evaluated, except for the leaf area index at 120 days after planting (DAP). Castor bean and sunflower plants in soil with high acidity conditions, without pH correction (pH(<) 4.0), were affected by soil Pb levels. Corn plants benefited from soil pH correction and had improved results for the plant height, diameter, and leaf area variables at 60 and 90 DAP, as well as leaf area index at 60 DAP. There was no increase in these variables between the harvest periods evaluated. Regarding phytoextraction potential, corn and vetiver had the highest Pb translocation to the plant shoots at 90 DAP and were therefore considered the most suitable species for phytoremediation of the area under study. Overall, liming was essential for improving species biomass production for all the species studied in soils with high Pb availability in solution.

AB  - Rio Grande do Sul (RS) State edaphoclimatic conditions are suitable only to produce ethanol in small scale. However, small scale ethanol production (SSEP) was not proven to be feasible because of its lower process efficiency compared to large scale, and its environmental impacts were not assessed. The objective of this study is to evaluate SSEP through life cycle assessment (LCA) and energy efficiency analysis (EEA), showing potential scenarios of improvement in SSEP efficiency. Eco-Indicator 99 and CML 2 Baseline 2000 were the assessment methods, and the results demonstrated that nitrogen- and phosphorus-rich fertilizers, along with herbicides and limestone, were responsible for the highest environmental impacts in the agricultural sector, while the use of equipment and electricity had the highest impacts in the industrial sector. In the overall analysis, the industrial sector showed the highest environmental impacts. The SSEP global warming potential is 0.128 kg CO2eq/MJ(ethanol), almost 20 times higher than in large scale ethanol production, demonstrating the negative impact of lower SSEP efficiency. The EEA results were given in terms of net energy balance (NEB) and net energy ratio (NER) considering four scenarios (Cases 1 to 4). The agricultural sector showed high NER (19.59), while the industrial stage showed an NER of 0.20 and 2.08 for the baseline scenario (Case 1) and for the improved scenario (Case 4), respectively. The overall process showed a NER of 0.69 for Case 1, in which the bagasse was not considered as coproduct. When bagasse energy was taken into account, the NER rose to 4.82 (Case 4), showing the importance of coproducts in the process energy efficiency. The higher environmental impact of the industrial stage is an incentive to develop and use more efficient technologies in SSEP.

AB  - In the pine forests of Central Europe, a wide and quick spread of Prunus serotina was observed. However, the impact on invaded phytocenoses is still unclear. In selected Scots pine forests with black cherry (SW Poland), the vertical forest structure and floristic composition of the herb and moss layers were studied by sampling permanent relev,s in 2003 and 2013. To investigate the understorey vegetation changes, the plant cover and the alpha and beta diversities were used. Habitat features were expressed using Ellenberg's indicator values (light, soil moisture, soil reaction and nitrogen availability). It has been shown that as a result of the expansion of black cherry, there have been changes in the vertical structure of the forests that are associated with the creation of a highly developed layer under the canopy of pine trees. This layer showed a strong negative correlation with the number of understorey species. Based on redundancy analysis, it was found that P. serotina cover in the canopy layer explained 11 % of the total variation in the species composition. It has been demonstrated that there has been a retreat of typical pine forest taxa, especially the terrestrial mosses (e.g. Dicranum scoparium and Pleurozium schreberi). In addition, the presence of P. serotina favoured understorey colonisation by synanthropic species (e.g. Taraxacum officinale, Calamagrostis epigejos and Impatiens parviflora). The reported changes in indirectly estimated environmental factors in the test interval were related to increased nitrogen availability and a decreased light index. The influence of black cherry on shading the forest floor, litter production, nitrogen enrichment of the habitat and decline of terricolous bryophytes is discussed.

AB  - The sensitivity of the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) to leaf pigmentation and its impacts on its potential as a proxy for light-use efficiency (LUE) have recently been shown to be problematic at the leaf scale. Most leaf-to-leaf and seasonal variability can be explained by such a confounding effect. This study relies on the analysis of PRI light curves that were generated at the canopy scale under natural conditions to derive a precise deconvolution of pigment-related and physiologically related variability in the PRI. These sources of variability were explained by measured or estimated physiologically relevant variables, such as soil water content, that can be used as indicators of water availability and canopy chlorophyll content. The PRI mainly reflected the variability in the pigment content of the canopy. However, the corrected PRI, which was obtained by subtracting the pigment-related seasonal variability from the PRI measurement, was highly correlated with the upscaled LUE measurements. Moreover, the sensitivity of the PRI to the leaf pigment content may mask the PRI versus LUE relationship or result in an artificial relationship that reflects the relationship of chlorophyll versus LUE, depending on the species phenology.
   In this study, a new method to analyze PRI variability at canopy scale is shown. Two components of PRI variability were successfully identified, and explained. While the first component (explaining most of PRI daily variability) allowed the retrieval of canopy-scale light use efficiency, the second component (explaining most of PRI seasonal variability) was shown to interfere with the use of the PRI as a proxy of LUE. The relevance of these findings to the direct use of PRI as a proxy of the LUE in remote sensing is discussed in details, and potential solutions are proposed.

AB  - The essential difference in the formation of conjugate shear zones in brittle and ductile deformation is that the intersection angle between brittle conjugate faults in the contractional quadrants is acute (usually approximate to 60 degrees) whereas the angle between conjugate ductile shear zones is obtuse (usually 110 degrees). The Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion, an experimentally validated empirical relationship, is commonly applied for interpreting the stress directions based on the orientation of the brittle shear fractures. However, the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion fails to explain the formation of the low-angle normal fault, high-angle reverse fault, and the conjugate strike-slip fault with an obtuse angle in the sigma(1) direction. Although it is ten years since the Maximum-Effective-Moment (MEM) criterion was first proposed, and increasingly solid evidence in support of it has been obtained from both observed examples in nature and laboratory experiments, it is not yet a commonly accepted model to use to interpret these anti-Mohr-Coulomb features that are widely observed in the natural world. The deformational behavior of rock depends on its intrinsic mechanical properties and external factors such as applied stresses, strain rates, and temperature conditions related to crustal depths. The occurrence of conjugate shear features with obtuse angles of approximate to 110 degrees in the contractional direction on different scales and at different crustal levels are consistent with the prediction of the MEM criterion, therefore approximate to 110 degrees is a reliable indicator for deformation localization that occurred at medium-low strain rates at any crustal levels. Since the strain-rate is variable through time in nature, brittle, ductile, and plastic features may appear within the same rock.

AB  - Accurate representations of mean climate conditions, especially in areas of complex terrain, are an important part of environmental monitoring systems. As high-resolution satellite monitoring information accumulates with the passage of time, it can be increasingly useful in efforts to better characterize the earth's mean climatology. Current state-of-the-science products rely on complex and sometimes unreliable relationships between elevation and station-based precipitation records, which can result in poor performance in food and water insecure regions with sparse observation networks. These vulnerable areas (like Ethiopia, Afghanistan, or Haiti) are often the critical regions for humanitarian drought monitoring. Here, we show that long period of record geo-synchronous and polar-orbiting satellite observations provide a unique new resource for producing high-resolution (0.05 degrees) global precipitation climatologies that perform reasonably well in data-sparse regions.
   Traditionally, global climatologies have been produced by combining station observations and physiographic predictors like latitude, longitude, elevation, and slope. While such approaches can work well, especially in areas with reasonably dense observation networks, the fundamental relationship between physiographic variables and the target climate variables can often be indirect and spatially complex. Infrared and microwave satellite observations, on the other hand, directly monitor the earth's energy emissions. These emissions often correspond physically with the location and intensity of precipitation. We show that these relationships provide a good basis for building global climatologies. We also introduce a new geospatial modeling approach based on moving window regressions and inverse distance weighting interpolation. This approach combines satellite fields, gridded physiographic indicators, and in situ climate normals. The resulting global 0.05 degrees monthly precipitation climatology, the Climate Hazards Group's Precipitation Climatology version 1 (CHPclim v.1.0, doi:10.15780/G2159X), is shown to compare favorably with similar global climatology products, especially in areas with complex terrain and low station densities.

AB  - In Arctic areas where benthic primary production does not occur or is not sufficient, the benthos depends on episodic events of food inputs from overlying waters, in particular spring ice algal and phytoplankton blooms. Climate change is expected to lead to earlier ice melts and subsequently to earlier spring blooms and food inputs to the benthos. The goal of the present study was to characterize benthic community structure and activities during the polar night in Rijpfjorden, a high Arctic fjord from Svalbard, and to assess experimentally how earlier climate-induced food inputs can impact these benthic activities. Two concentrations of freeze-dried phytoplankton were added to intact sediment cores, while additional control cores did not receive food addition. Sediment oxygen demand (SOD), nutrient fluxes, bioturbation coefficients (as indicator of benthic activities) and contents of organic matter and pigments in sediments were measured at the beginning of the experiment and 9 days after the addition. In the initial polar night conditions, SOD was similar to 4.2 mmol O-2 m(-2) d(-1), bioturbation coefficients were null for biodiffusion and 1.08 y(-1) for bioadvection, and benthic biomass was 1.36 g 0.1 m(-2). In the cores with food addition, the phytoplankton added was quickly consumed, and after 9 days, SOD and bioturbation were higher in the food treatments compared with the control cores, both being higher with higher food concentration. This study documented a clear and quick response in benthic activities following the food input, suggesting that in winter/early spring, Arctic benthos may depend on early food inputs for its activities. Climate-induced changes in food supply to the seafloor could have drastic consequences for the benthic ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) compositions of suspended particulate matter in the water columns of two anoxic marine settings, the Black Sea and Cariaco Basin, were analyzed to better define the sources of GDGTs in marine environments. In deep anoxic waters the enhanced abundance of the conventional branched GDGTs (B-GDGTs) and recently introduced overly- and sparsely branched GDGTs (OB- and SB-GDGTs, respectively) indicated their in situ production by presently unidentified planktonic microorganisms favoring anoxic environment. The elevated concentrations of these branched GDGTs in anoxic waters were accompanied by an increase in their degree of methylation. Such a change in lipid composition may reflect either a microbial community shift or a physiological response of the source organism(s) to redox conditions, but nonetheless, confirms the in situ production of branched GDGTs in anoxic marine settings. In contrast to the B-GDGTs, which have originally been assumed to be of terrestrial origin, OB- and SB-GDGTs in marine sediments are more likely of anoxic marine origin. This notion is supported by a shelf-to-basin transect of surface sediments in the Black Sea, in which OB- and SB-GDGTs were restricted to distal sediments in the central anoxic basin. Even though the OB-, B- and SB-GDGTs are presumed to have related molecular structures, B-GDGTs were the only group that contained cyclopentane rings. The distribution of cycloalkylated vs. non-cycloalkylated B-GDGTs in the water columns of both the Black Sea and Cariaco Basin and surface sediments of the Black Sea suggests a primarily terrestrial origin for the cycloalkylated B-GDGTs but a mixed contribution from both terrestrial and marine sources for non-cycloalkylated B-GDGTs.

AB  - Five cultivars of camelina species (Camelina sativa L.) were grown in the field at two levels of nitrogen (N) under the climate conditions of Hokkaido Island, Japan. N nutrition as well as the genetic difference between cultivars influenced biomass and grain production. Three cultivars responded positively to N application, but not the other two. Increase in grain yield was associated more with grain number than grain size. The plants accommodated the extra grains by increasing pod number. Irrespective of the N level in the soil, a linolenic acid concentration of the grain was very high at 31% of the total fatty acids. In cultivar Calena, lower leaves on the main stem were excised to find the effect of reduced source area on yield. Defoliation of lower leaves did not affect grain yield, indicating that these leaves do not contribute to source capacity of the plant during grain filling. However, removal of all leaves decreased grain yield to 70% relative to the control plant. In contrast to defoliation, shading of the whole panicle consisting of the pod shell and rachis was more effective in reducing grain yield. Shading of the panicle prior to the grain filling period at the levels of 33 and 6% irradiance relative to control decreased grain yield to 39 and 26%, respectively. These results suggested that the pod shell and rachis are more important source organs for photosynthetic carbon supply to grains than the upper leaves, and they can sustain grain filling in exigency. The presence of attributes like extended source area for grain filling and high alpha-linolenic acid content of leaves is an indicator for successful adaptation of Camelina in the stress-prone environment of Hokkaido Island.

AB  - Little information exists on the co-occurrence of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), bacterial pathogens, and organic wastewater-associated chemicals (OWCs) within Great Lakes tributaries. Fifteen watershed sites and one beach site adjacent to the Little Calumet River-Portage Burns Waterway (LCRPBW) on Lake Michigan were tested on four dates for pH, dissolved oxygen, specific conductance, chloride, color, ammonia- and nitrate-nitrogen, soluble phosphorus, sulfate, turbidity, and atrazine; for concentrations of FIB; and for genes indicating the presence of human-pathogenic enterococci (ENT) and of Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli (EC) from various animal sources. Nineteen samples were also tested for 60 OWCs. Half of the watershed samples met EC recreational water quality standards; none met ENT standards. Human-wastewater-associated OWC detections were correlated with human-influence indicators such as population/km(2), chloride concentrations, and the presence of WWTP effluents, but EC and ENT concentrations were not. Bacterial pathogen genes indicated rural human and several potential animal sources. OWCs of human or ecosystem health concern (musk fragrances AHTN and HHCB, alkylphenols, carbamazepine) and 3 bacterial pathogen genes were detected at the mouth of the LCRPBW, but no such OWCs and only 1 pathogen gene were detected at the beach. The LCRPBW has significant potential to deliver FIB, potential bacterial pathogens, and OWCs of human or ecosystem health concern to the nearshore of Lake Michigan, under conditions enhancing nearshore transport of the river plume. Nearshore mixing of lake and river water, and the lack of relationship between OWCs and FIB or pathogen genes, pose numerous challenges for watershed and nearshore assessment and remediation.

AB  - This study investigates faecal indicator bacteria (FIB), multiple antibiotic resistant (MAR), and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), of sediment profiles from different parts of Lake Geneva (Switzerland) over the last decades. MARs consist to expose culturable Escherichia coli (EC) and Enterococcus (ENT) to mixed five antibiotics including Ampicillin, Tetracycline, Amoxicillin, Chloramphenicol and Erythromycin. Culture-independent is performed to assess the distribution of ARGs responsible for, beta-lactams (blaTEM; Amoxicillin/Ampicillin), Streptomycin/Spectinomycin (aadA), Tetracycline (tet) Chloramphenicol (cmlA) and Vancomycin (van). Bacterial cultures reveal that in the sediments deposited following eutrophication of Lake Geneva in the 1970s, the percentage of MARS to five antibiotics varied from 0.12% to 4.6% and 0.016% to 11.6% of total culturable EC and ENT, respectively. In these organic-rich bacteria-contaminated sediments, the blaTEM resistant of FIB varied from 22% to 48% and 16% to 37% for EC and ENT respectively, whereas the positive PCR assays responsible for tested ARGs were observed for EC, ENT, and total DNA from all samples. The aadA resistance gene was amplified for all the sediment samples, including those not influenced by WWTP effluent water. Our results demonstrate that bacteria MARs and ARGs highly increased in the sediments contaminated with WWTP effluent following the cultural eutrophication of Lake Geneva. Hence, the human-induced changing limnological conditions highly enhanced the sediment microbial activity, and therein the spreading of antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes in this aquatic environment used to supply drinking water in a highly populated area. Furthermore, the presence of the antibiotic resistance gene aadA in all the studied samples points out a regional dissemination of this emerging contaminant in freshwater sediments since at least the late nineteenth century.

AB  - The pollution of the environment with veterinary therapeutic agents and their metabolites increases due to the rising doses of applied pharmaceuticals caused by emergence of resistant microorganisms. This phenomenon also results in implementation of new drugs and higher doses of pharmaceuticals in veterinary medicine. Moreover, industrial, multi-stand animal farms are responsible for occurrence of places with locally high concentrations of drugs. The sensitivity of indicator plants to environmental contamination is often used to estimate the degree of environmental degradation. Plants respond to many kinds of toxic substances in different manners. The phytotoxic effect is a result of interaction between compound and plant under given environmental conditions.
   The aim of the study was to the evaluate phytotoxicity of sulfonamides (sulfamethazine and sulfacetamide) to seedlings of yellow lupin and lentil. The sulfonamide residue content was determined in the seedlings. All the seeds, irrespective of the concentration of sulfonamides, germinated with a frequency between 83% (lentil) and 100% (lupin). With increasing sulfonamide levels, an inhibition of root elongation was observed in the tested plants. No-observed-effect-concentration (NOEC) for germinated seeds was 17.4 mM. The effective concentrations causing a 50% response (EC50) for lentil and yellow lupin root elongation were 0.25 and 0.23 mM, respectively. Bacillus stearothermophilus var. calidolactis was used to test sulfonamide presence in germinating seeds. A change in the color (purple-violet) of bacteria indicated the presence of sulfonamides in the plant extract. This method detects presence of sulfonamide in plant tissues if the drug is applied in concentrations equal to, or higher than 0.1 mM. Cyclitol content in roots and shoots was analyzed by gas chromatography. The maximum myo-inositol content was associated with the highest sulfonamide concentration. The highest content was found in yellow lupin roots, and the lowest in lentil shoots.

AB  - Extra-pair copulations (EPC) are the rule rather than an exception in socially monogamous birds, but despite widespread occurrences, the benefits of female infidelity remain elusive. Most attention has been paid to the possibility that females gain genetic benefits from EPC, and fitness comparisons between maternal half-siblings are considered to be a defining test of this hypothesis. Recently, it was shown that these comparisons may be confounded by within-brood maternal effects where one such effect may be the distribution of half-siblings in the laying order. However, this possibility is difficult to study as it would be necessary to detect the egg from which each chick hatched. In this study, we used a new approach for egg-chick assignment and cross-fostered eggs on an individual basis among a set of nests of the collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis. After hatching, chicks were ascribed to mothers and therefore to individual eggs by molecular genetic methods. Extra-pair young predominated early in the laying order. Under natural conditions, this should give them a competitive advantage over their half-siblings, mediated by hatching asynchrony. However, we experimentally synchronized hatching, and after this treatment, extra-pair young did not outperform within-pair young in any studied trait including survival up to recruitment and several indicators of reproductive success and attractiveness. We obtained only modest sample sizes for the last two traits and did not test for extra-pair success of male offspring. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility of advantages of extra-pair young during the adult phase of life. However, our data tentatively suggest that the more likely reason for females EPCs is the insurance against the infertility of a social mate.

AB  - Mitochondria play an essential role in reactive oxygen species (ROS) signal transduction in plants. Redox regulation is an essential feature of mitochondrial function, with thioredoxin (Trx), involved in disulphide/dithiol interchange, playing a prominent role. To explore the participation of mitochondrial PsTrxo1, Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), peroxiredoxin (PsPrxII F), and alternative oxidase (AOX) under salt stress, their transcriptional and protein levels were analysed in pea plants growing under 150 mM NaCl for a short and a long period. The activities of mitochondrial Mn-SOD and Trx together with the in vivo activities of the alternative pathway (AP) and the cytochrome pathway (CP) were also determined, combined with the characterization of the plant physiological status as well as the mitochondrial oxidative indicators. The analysis of protein and mRNA levels and activities revealed the importance of the post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation of these proteins in the response to salt stress. Increases in AOX protein amount correlated with increases in AP capacity, whereas in vivo AP activity was maintained under salt stress. Similarly, Mn-SOD activity was also maintained. Under all the stress treatments, photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and CP activity were decreased although the oxidative stress in leaves was only moderate. However, an increase in lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation was found in mitochondria isolated from leaves under the short-term salinity conditions. In addition, an increase in mitochondrial Trx activity was produced in response to the long-term NaCl treatment. The results support a role for PsTrxo1 as a component of the defence system induced by NaCl in pea mitochondria, providing the cell with a mechanism by which it can respond to changing environment protecting mitochondria from oxidative stress together with Mn-SOD, AOX, and PrxII F.

AB  - The aim of the study was to assess bacteriolytic activity of lysozyme and serum amyloid A (SAA) level in sheep affected with zearalenone mycotoxicosis. Bacteriolytic activity of lysozyme, and serum amyloid A (SAA) level are both the elements of innate humoral immunity. Lysozyme bacteriolytic activity in serum was determined by diffusion-plate method with reference to Micrococcus luteus. SAA concentration was determined by the use of commercial ELISA kit (Phase Serum Amyloid A Assai TP802). The highest lysozyme bacteriolytic activity was observed in sheep with total rectal and intestinal mucosal membrane prolapse. Lysozyme concentration values in animals with partial rectal prolapse were significantly lower. In the control group, lysozyme concentration was low and within the range considered as physiologically normal. The highest levels of SAA, which ranged from 38.5 to 172 mu g/mL, were detected in sheep in which the highest lysozyme bacteriolytic activity was noted. From the data obtained, it is undoubtful that changes in SAA level in affected sheep and control sheep are reliable indicators of zearalenone mycotoxicosis progress and termination. The highest levels of SAA were noted in animals, which had the total rectal and intestinal prolapse in course of zearalenone mycotoxicosis, and after returning the rectum to the normal position, mucosal membrane necrosis occurred, which resulted in perforation and peritoneum inflammation. The observed differences in SAA level forming range in particular animals from infected group are conditioned by the character of inflammation process and intensity in organs altered by the disease, which are principal factors inducing changes in its concentration. The level of this protein in serum reflects activation state of immunological system and could be one of the criterions in sheep health assessment.

AB  - During spring 2001 in the Southern Plains, a recurring, hitherto undocumented reflectivity signature that the authors have called the "Owl Horn" signature (because the radar reflectivity pattern resembles the profile of the Great Horned Owl) was observed on a mobile, X-band radar display. The reflectivity signature was always located at the rear side of a developing supercell, spanned the entire rear side of the storm, and was always seen on low-level plan position indicator (PPI) scans. It lasted on the order of only 5-10 min and was not an artifact of the radar.
   A study of the Owl Horn signature was undertaken using the Tracking Radar Echoes by Correlation technique (TREC) to estimate the wind field. TREC has previously been applied to clear-air and hurricane environments, and to the internal motions of severe storms, but not to their evolution. The characteristics of the signature are presented, and then, through the application of TREC to the radar reflectivity data (Doppler wind data were not available in 2001) collected during May and June 2001, the horizontal wind field was estimated around and in the Owl Horn signature.
   Instances of the Owl Horn in numerical model storm simulations were investigated. The numerical simulations were used to identify conditions under which the signature occurs, the process by which it is created is discussed, and its dependence upon the environmental wind shear is examined. Results indicate that the hodograph shape and magnitude influence the production of the Owl Horn signature. Supercell-magnitude shear is required, and some curvature-particularly low-level curvature-is essential to the production of the feature. The Owl Horn signature is formed when horizontal vorticity is tilted into the vertical by expanding outflow through a positive feedback mechanism with the outflow.

AB  - An understanding of agroecosystems is the key to estimate the influence of agricultural production methods on the environment, including soil, water and air quality. The present study aimed to contribute to the insufficient knowledge of functional and structural soil microbial properties influenced by organic and inorganic fertilisation and climatic conditions at two European long-term field experiments. Soil microbial biomass, activities of alkaline phosphatases, beta-glucosidases and proteases, and phospholipid fatty acid profiles were evaluated in soils from three different fertiliser treatments (inorganic, NPK; farmyard manure, FYM; without, CON) at two sites (Bad Lauchstadt, Germany and Keszthely, Hungary). The results showed that C-org and N-t concentrations were significantly higher in the FYM plots compared to the NPK amendments or CON. Furthermore, increases were observed in the C-mic and the enzyme activities of FYM-fertilised treatments in the soil at Bad Lauchstadt. NPK fertilisation significantly decreased C-mic in the soil at Keszthely, whereas FYM increased the activity of beta-glucosidases. Ecophysiological parameters (C-mic-to-C-org and qCO(2)) revealed a clear climatic influence on edaphic properties. The profiles of 28 phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) were used to assess whether observed changes in functional microbial parameters were accompanied by changes in the composition of the microbial communities after FYM and NPK amendments. The results of principal component analyses indicate that the communities of the autochthonous microflora differed between the two sites and three treatments. Bacteria, particularly Gram-negative bacteria and eukaryotes were responsible for these differences. The results support the hypothesis that fertilisation in general and its forms (organic versus inorganic) affect important functional and structural soil microbial properties. PLFA analysis proved to be a more sensitive indicator than functional parameters. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The use of annually sown pastures to provide winter forage is common in dairy farming in many regions of the world. Loss of organic matter and soil structural stability due to annual tillage under this management may be contributing to soil degradation. The comparative effects of annual ryegrass pastures (conventionally tilled and resown each year), permanent kikuyu pastures and undisturbed native vegetation on soil organic matter content, microbial size and activity, and aggregate stability were investigated on commercial dairy farms in the Tsitsikamma region of the Eastern Cape, South Africa. In comparison with soils under sparse, native grassy vegetation, those under both annual ryegrass and permanent kikuyu pasture had higher soil organic matter content on the very sandy soils of the eastern end of the region. By contrast, in the higher rainfall, western side, where the native vegetation was coastal forest, there was a loss of organic matter under both types of pasture. Nonetheless, soil organic C, K2SO4-extractable C, microbial biomass C, basal respiration, arginine ammonification and fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis rates and aggregate stability were less under annual than permanent pastures at all the sites. These results reflect the degrading effect of annual tillage on soil organic matter and the positive effect of grazed permanent pasture on soil microbial activity and aggregation. Soil organic C, microbial biomass C, K2SO4-extractable C, basal respiration and aggregate stability were significantly correlated with each other. The metabolic quotient and percentage of organic C present as microbial biomass C were generally poorly correlated with other measured properties but negatively correlated with one another. It was concluded that annual pasture involving conventional tillage results in a substantial loss of soil organic matter, soil microbial activity and soil physical condition under dairy pastures and that a system that avoids tillage needs to be developed.

AB  - The magnitude of current nutrient losses from agriculture to ground and surface water calls for effective environmental policy, including the use of regulation. Nutrient loss is experienced in many countries despite differences in the organisation and intensity of agricultural production. However, at present there is no internationally agreed practice to assess the effectiveness of different kinds of regulatory practice and compliance level, or to make effective comparisons. There is a wide variety of indicators available for this purpose, ranging from livestock density and input-output balances to nutrient concentrations in soil and water. This paper explores the effectiveness and efficiency of the different indicators, both in terms of achieving a single objective and a comprehensive set of objectives and evaluates how responsive and attributable these indicators are to changes in farm management.
   Each indicator appears to have its own pros and cons. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be a single indicator that is effective, comprehensive, efficient, responsive and attributable at the same time. Scientifically, there are valid reasons to develop indicators that account for specific regional conditions and to accept the use of varying threshold values within them. Administratively complex indicators and/or strict threshold values appear inevitable wherever intensive production is the dominant form of land use amidst vulnerable local environments. However, at both a national and international level this differentiation of indicators and thresholds may conflict with the desire to treat individual farmers equally and to minimise their administrative burden. The paper concludes with a review of the issues raised in international harmonisation of nutrient loss indicators and threshold values. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effects of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) such as naphthalene (NAP)-an environmental contaminant-and beta-naphthoflavone (BNF)-a model substance (PAH-like compound -were investigated in European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) over 3-, 6-, and 9-day exposure (0.1-2.7 muM). Both xenobiotics revealed to be strong biotransformation (phase I) inducers. After 3-day exposure, liver ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity was significantly increased by all NAP and BNF tested concentrations. At 6 and 9 days, liver EROD activity was significantly induced mainly by the highest NAP and BNF concentrations. Liver cytochrome P450 content was significantly induced after 3-day exposure to 0.9 and 2.7 muM BNF and 9-day exposure to 0.1, 0.3 and 0.9 muM NAP. Liver alanine transaminase (ALT) activity was measured as an indicator of hepatic health condition, revealing a significant decrease after 6-day exposure to 0.9 muM BNF. Genotoxicity measured as erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA) was detected in all BNF treated fish on day 6, whereas on day 9, ENA frequencies returned to control levels, significantly decreasing at 0.9 muM BNF exposure. Immature erythrocytes (IE) frequency demonstrated a decreasing tendency along the BNF experiment and concomitantly with the above ENA response. The present experimental results elect EROD activity in A. anguilla as a useful short- to medium-term biomarker of exposure to both PAH and PAH-like compounds. However, some problems can emerge in the presence of high xenobiotic concentrations. Concerning genotoxicity, it is hypothesized that ENA response depends on different factors such as the exhaustion of the detoxification process, the balance erythropoiesis/erythrocytic catabolism and the DNA repairing capacity.

AB  - The combined effect of feeding time and meal size on the growth performance and feeding rhythms were studied in European sea bass maintained under natural summer-autumn conditions. Three feeding strategies were compared: a modulated automatic-feeding (MF), a fixed automatic-feeding (FF) and a free access to self-feeders (SF). Under MF, feed was supplied in meals of different size, three times a day (morning, afternoon and evening, 33.33:16.67:50% of daily feed ration, respectively) during the first (31 days) and second (35 days) period of the experiment, and twice a day (morning and evening, 33.33:66.67% of daily feed ration, respectively) during the third period (27 days). In FF feed was supplied in equally-sized meals, three times a day (morning, afternoon and evening, 33.33:33.33:33.33% of daily feed ration) in all three periods of the experiment. Under SF, fish showed a diurnal self-feeding pattern, with the greatest percentage of self-feeding activity concentrated in the evening. In MF and FF, although feed was delivered automatically, the trigger was left in the tank to register activations as an indicator of feeding activity. The trigger activation of both treatments MF and FF was associated with the time of feed delivery. Feeding strategies affected biomass increase, specific growth rate (SGR) and feed conversion ratio (FCR), the greatest biomass increase and highest SGR being obtained with MF and the poorest FCR with FF. The results demonstrate that automatic-feeding systems, in which the quantity of feed supplied is modulated in accordance with the natural feeding rhythms of sea bass, may improve growth and feed efficiency.

AB  - Embryos, larvae, and early juvenile stages of the commercial scallop Pecten fumatus Reeve, were held at temperatures ranging from 13 to 27 degrees C. An incubation temperature of 18 degrees C produced the greatest percent development of D-veligers from eggs. The growth rate of larvae increased from 2.5 mu m/day at 15 degrees C to a peak of 6.5 mu m/day at 24 degrees C but decreased with a further increase in temperature to 27 degrees C. Age-specific larval survival decreased significantly with increasing temperature in the range 15-27 degrees C. However, size-specific survival, which is a more meaningful measure of optimal rearing temperature, exhibited a pronounced peak value at an intermediate temperature of 21 degrees C. On the basis of these results, the maintenance of larval rearing temperatures between 18 and 21 degrees C is likely to provide the maximum yield of pediveligers. The growth of 3-wk-old spat (mean shell height, 1.04 +/- 0.26 mm), held in the hatchery, increased from a negligible rate at 13 degrees C to a maximum rare at 24 degrees C. During the fifth and final week of the trial, a constraint to continued exponential growth became evident at all temperatures tested except 13 degrees C. Survival and byssus attachment of spat were highest at temperatures supporting the highest growth rates. The use of byssus attachment as an indicator of favorable spat-growing conditions is discussed. Possible ecological implications of ontologic change in temperature optima are discussed in relation to variability in annual fisheries' catches. Occasions on which optimal temperature regimens for embryo development and larval and spat growth occur are rare in Jervis Bay, NSW. Aspects of El Nino Southern Oscillation events and the oceanography of southeastern Australia are discussed as a possible mechanism by which such regimens might occur.

AB  - Calcium (Ca) is an essential secondary macronutrient which necessary plant mineral frequently added to fertilizers to promote plant development and resistance to abiotic and biotic stressors. Applying Ca to soils suffices to meet crops' Ca requirements. Regrettably, its function is obscure. Thus, it is critical to maintain enough nutrient availability through fertilizers or alter the soil environment for oil palm seedlings to grow and thrive. This study investigates the effects of different Ca sources on vegetative growth in oil palm seedlings. This experiment was carried out for nursery evaluation using 5-months old of oil palm seedlings with varying sources of Ca (Cl-calcium chloride, CaCl2; C2-calcium sulfate, CaSO4; C3-calcium nitrate, CaNO3; C4-calcium carbonate, CaCO3; C5-calcium oxide, CaO, C6-calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)(2); and C7-water leach purification and neutralization undcrflow, NUF-WLP) and grown in a polybag containing beach ridges interspersed with swales (BRIS) soil within six months in Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) nursery, Seksyen 15, Bandar Baru Bangi. Five concentration levels of Ca (T1-200 ppm, T2-250 ppm, T3-300 ppm, T4-1,000 ppm, and T5-1,500 ppm) were used in a completely randomized design (CRD) with ten replications for each. Based on the total biomass of oil palm seedlings at 24 weeks after treatment with various sources of Ca, the result confirmed that C2 oil palm seedlings were more significant in size and denser at the root than other Ca types. The result is an essential indicator that C2 effectively increased the total biomass of oil palm seedlings at 1,000 ppm of Ca (T4); hence it was the best Ca source to improve the growth and development of oil palm seedlings throughout the experimental period at p <= 0.05.

AB  - Under the Paris Agreement, parties should undertake a global stocktake of progress toward meeting the goals of the agreement and tackling climate change. The first global stocktake will be undertaken in 2023, and an assessment of loss and damage from climate change is an important part of the process. Loss and damage refer to the impacts of climate change felt when mitigation and adaptation efforts are inadequate or absent. Much data, including metrics and indicators relevant for loss and damage, are held in existing global databases, but these are disparate and cannot easily be combined and compared to support the global stocktake. We combine relevant primary data sources to provide a harmonized country-level global dataset containing relevant indicators of recorded losses and damages from climate-related events; exposure to climate-related events; country vulnerability and adaptation readiness; scientific studies of climate change attribution; financial support for climate adaptation; and contextual governance conditions. The indicators are standardized against country population and GDP where relevant. We describe original data sources, processing steps, and an overview of key indicators in the dataset. We also compare the assembled data to existing global risk databases; namely, the INFORM risk index and the World Risk Index. This comparison, provided in the Supporting Information, shows a large amount of redundancy among vulnerability and governance indicators, and we suggest that creators of new databases and risk indices be clear about data limitations and the gaps that specific indices attempt to fill in the global data landscape. We recommend the standard use of ISO codes in future databases of this nature, as well as clear metadata regarding how overseas territories are treated relative to their sovereign state, and information on dissolution and creation of states over time.

AB  - This paper presents the abundances of heavy metals in the sediments of terraces and riverbeds of the Mambahe catchment area, an area with high potential for gold mineralisation in the Central Region of Cameroon. These sediments have been studied to establish the geochemical baseline conditions prior to any mining activities. The data can be used as an analogy for similar metallogenic provinces in regions with a humid tropical climate. The sediments of the river beds and terraces of the Mambahe basin, which drains the gold deposits that have begun to be exploited in other basins, are influenced by the rapid chemical alteration of the surrounding rocks and present high contents of Al (23,241-254,516 mg/kg), Fe (20,003-125,021 mg/kg) and Cr (15-1390 mg/kg), compared to the geochemical background (upper continental crust), generally used for environmental studies. However, other elements have lower values than these geochemical backgrounds. The range of average concentrations measured for these metals is as follows: Mn (258.24-2324.16 mg/kg), V (30.9-159.3 mg/kg), Ni (3.6-38.71 mg/kg), Zn (13-71.1 mg/kg), Cu (4.1-40.6 mg/kg), Co (2.39-21.69 mg/kg), Pb (2.22-12.09 mg/kg), Cd (0.018-0.153 mg/kg) and Mo (0.2-1.64 mg/kg). Considering the factors governing sediment accumulation such as geology, climate and anthropogenic activities as well as the correlation with commonly used environmental geochemical backgrounds, it is proposed that the data from this study can be considered as a baseline of environmental contamination in this area of planned major mining developments in the region. The results may assist mine planners in setting realistic targets for monitoring and remediation programs.

AB  - Pod shattering is one of the major soybean constraints in the soybean production centers, particularly in the tropics. The screening for pod shattering resistance of 16 genotypes was carried out using detached and undetached pod methods on the three different pod positions on the stem. The field research was arranged in a randomized block design, during the dry season in Banyuwangi, Indonesia. The shattering evaluation was conducted in the laboratory using the oven-dry method. The screening methods to investigate the pod shattering resistance of each genotype consisted of the detached pod (DP), undetached pod (UDP), and undetached whole-stem method (UWS). The result showed that the detached pod method (DP) resulted in a higher average pod-shattering percentage (15%) than the undetached pod methods (UDP and UWS, 13% and 11%, respectively). Nevertheless, the detached pod and undetached pod methods provide a consistent result for the evaluation of pod shattering resistance, showed by their correlation coefficients (DP and UDP, r = 0.98**; DP and UWS, r = 0.98**, UDP and UWS, r = 0.99**). The detached pod with the oven-dry method was suggested to be used for screening of pod shattering resistance. This method enables to screen genotypes in greater numbers, provides a homogeneous selection pressure and environmental condition. Pods at the upper part of the stem were more resistant to shattering than those pods in the middle part and lower part. The pod length, seed length, seed weight, pod wall weight to the pod weight ratio, and weight of 25 seeds appeared to be the significant indicators for pod shattering resistance. The shattering evaluation resulted in five soybean genotypes (Anj/G100H-28, Anj/G100H-44, Anj/Rjbs-304, Anj/Rjbs-30, and Detap 1) with consistent resistance to pod shattering based on the three methods. These genotypes can be used as donor parents in the breeding program for pod shattering resistance.

AB  - The purpose of the research was the recognition of edge effects regarding similarities and differences of vascular flora in undergrowth layers in the urban forest ecotones. Four types of urban forest neighborhoods were analyzed: ecotones adjacent to the manor park, the agriculture field, housing estates and the road. The plant compositions in the forest ecotones were compared with the plant compositions in the urban forest interior and the forest nature reserve. The phytosociological type of studied forests was a subcontinental oak-hornbeam one (Tilio-Carpinetum). Diagnostic plant species (e.g., characteristic) for forests from the non-diagnostic ones were identified. Forest consistent plant species dominated in the ecotone adjacent to the manor park and in the interior of urban forests too, but the best conditions for these plants were inside the forest nature reserve, where native consistent forest plants showed the highest dominance when comparing all studied areas. A higher anthropogenic pressure from the adjacent areas results in supporting the growth of inconsistent plant species in the forests, and these plants are mostly represented by plants belonging to grass and synanthropic communities. Another conclusion drawn from our research is that the protected forest, represented by a nature reserve in the city, provides better "shelter " for native forest plants than the urban forest without any protection. Ultimately, a permanent challenge is to achieve and maintain the balance between nature and the impact of anthropogenic activities on urban forests in the city. The high quality of green areas, biodiversity, including forests, implicates possibilities of sustainable development in cities. The research results will be useful for local urban planners and ecologists during their work on strategies of city development, including shaping of green infrastructure.

AB  - To understand the thermal evolution of lacustrine sedimentary n-alkane hydrogen isotopic composition (delta D), especially bacterially derived n-alkanes, anhydrous thermal simulation experiments were performed with sediments from Lake Gahai (Gannan, China). We analyzed the original and pyrolysis-generated n-alkanes and their delta D values. The results showed that thermal maturity and n-alkane origins significantly affected the distribution of pyrolysis-generated n-alkanes. In immature to post-mature sediments, the bacterial-derived medium-chain n-alkanes generally had depleted delta D values. The maximum difference in average delta D values between the bacterial-and herbaceous plant-derived medium-chain n-alkanes was 32 parts per thousand, and the maximum difference in delta D values among individual n-alkanes was 59 parts per thousand. We found that the average delta D value of pyrolysis-generated n-alkanes from different latitude was significantly different in immature to highly mature sediments, but similar in post-mature ssediments. The hydrogen isotopes of sedimentary n-alkanes can be used as indicators for paleoclimate/paleo-environment conditions only when sediments are immature to highly mature. During thermal evolution, the delta D value of generated individual n-alkanes and the average delta D value increased with thermal maturity, indicating that hydrogen isotopes of sedimentary n-alkanes can be used as an index of organic matter maturity. We established mathematical models of average delta D values of generated n-alkanes from immature to post-mature sediments using nC(21)(--)/nC(21)(+) and average chain lengths. These results improve our understanding of the distribution and delta D value of sedimentary n-alkanes derived from herbaceous plants in mid-latitude plateau cold regions.

AB  - One of the most important issues during UCG process is wastewater production and treatment. Condensed gasification wastewater is contaminated by many hazardous compounds. The composition of the generated UCG-derived wastewater may vary depending on the type of gasified coal and conditions of the gasification process. The main purpose of this study was a qualitative and quantitative characterization of the UCG wastewater produced during four different UCG experiments. Experiments were conducted using semi-anthracite and bituminous coal samples at two distinct pressures, i.e., 20 and 40 bar. The conducted studies revealed significant relationships between the physicochemical composition of the wastewater and the coal properties as well as the gasification pressure. The strongest impact is noticeable in the case of organic pollutants, especially phenols, BTEX and PAH's. The most abundant group of pollutants were phenols. Conducted studies showed significantly higher concentration levels for bituminous coal: 29.25-49.5 mg/L whereas for semi-anthracite effluents these concentrations were in much lower range 2.1-29.7 mg/L. The opposite situation occurs for BTEX, higher concentrations were in wastewater from semi-anthracite gasification: 5483.1-1496.7 mu g/L, while in samples from bituminous coal gasification average BTEX concentrations were: 2514.3-1354.4 mu g/L. A similar relationship occurs for the PAH's concentrations. The higher values were in case of wastewater from semi-anthracite coal experiments and were in range 362-1658 mu g/L while from bituminous coal gasification PAH's values are in lower ranges 407-1090 mu g/L. The studies conducted have shown that concentrations of phenols, BTEX and PAH's decrease with increasing pressure. Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to enhance the interpretation of the obtained experimental data and showed a very strong relationship between three parameters: phenols, volatile phenols and CODcr.</p>

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the use of thermal imaging obtained by infrared thermography (IRT) to detect cases of subclinical mastitis in dairy cows under commercial conditions of compost barn systems in a region of Brazil with a semiarid climate. Twenty-eight crossbred cows were evaluated twice a day for one week using IRT. Three thermal images were obtained for each cow, referring to the anatomical regions of the right and left fore udder and rear udder. A computer program was used to analyze the images and obtain the right fore udder temperature (RFUT, degrees C), left fore udder temperature (LFUT, degrees C), rear udder temperature (RUT, degrees C), and average udder temperature (AUT, degrees C). In addition, samples of milk from each quarter of the udder were collected for somatic cell count (SCC) to correlate the diseases observed on the thermal image with any infection in the udder region. The results obtained using IRT were subjected to regression and correlation analyses. It was observed that LFUT, RAQT, RUT, and AUT were adjusted in quadratic polynomial models with good prediction of SCC (i.e., infection) with R-2 = 0.92, 0.97, 0.86, and 0.94, respectively. The region of the anterior quarters of the udder was the most promising for imaging, stronger correlations were obtained between LFUT and RFUT with SCC (r = 0.87 and 0.88, respectively). The IRT is a practical technology capable of detecting cases of mastitis in dairy cows with good precision, especially with thermal images from the anatomical region of the front quarters of the udder. However, more detailed studies are needed to make thermal imaging processing a more useful method for routine activities on farms in compost barn systems.

AB  - Recovery of soil quality after wildfire is essential for soil functioning such as nutrient cycling, resistance to biochemical degradation and sustainable plant growth. Post-fire soil quality is crucial for the maintenance of ecosystem sustainability. The objective of this study was to develop a soil quality index (SQI) for assessing post-fire soil quality in upland rangeland ecosystems of a semi-arid region in Central Iran. Soil samples were collected from burnt and unburnt plots at six rangeland sites two years after a wildfire event and analyzed for 22 soil properties. The soil microbial and biochemical properties indicated a greater magnitude of post-fire changes than soil chemical properties. The contribution of microbial respiration to soil quality, obtained using factor analysis, was the highest (36%) followed by particulate organic carbon (22%), microbial biomass carbon (15%), available phosphorus (15%) and alkaline phosphomonoesterase activity (12%). This indicates that microbial properties, labile carbon and phosphorus availability are the most important soil quality indicators to detect the wildfire effects in the study rangelands. The SQI value was, on average, 28% lower in burnt rangelands (0.39-0.55) than unburnt rangelands (0.56-0.75); indicating disturbance by wildfire would be accompanied by the loss of soil functioning. This illustrates that fire decreased soil quality, which did not recover two years after fire, probably due to the high grazing pressure and climatic conditions (i.e., longer drought periods and water limitation). Apparently, a longer period of time would be required for the complete recovery of soil quality in these semi-arid rangelands. In this study, we demonstrate that an integrated SQI would be more useful to assess post-fire soil functions than single soil properties in fire-affected rangelands of semi-arid climates.

AB  - Past climate reconstructions from palaeoecological records require an understanding of relationships between modern vegetation and climate. Phytoliths are being used widely to reconstruct variations in C3/C4 grasses in the past vegetation and corresponding climate. However, little understanding is available on their relationships with the climate driver(s). Even though, the driver(s) regulating C3/C4 grass distributions vary regionally, while reconstructing the past distributions, a grass phytolith-based climatic index (Ic) has often been found to be used globally without assessing its regional consistency. In the Himalaya, the working potential of Ic has proven to be unsatisfactory when compared to other regions of the globe. To improve the efficacy of Ic, we have identified the redundant grass phytolith morphs and revised it by including four exclusive C3-grass indicator morphotypes (bilobate trapezoidal, bilobate scooped, saddle tall and saddle plateaued) to the existing Ic calculation. Thus, a newclimatic index, revised Ic (rIc) is proposed in this article. We have compared the rIc with modern climate variables and a relationship with mean annual temperature (MAT) is established with statistical validation. To assess the working potential of the proposed calibration function in the past temperature reconstructions, we have estimated the late Holocene MAT variations in the Himalaya using rIc. We infer that in the mountainous regions like the Himalaya, even with irregular precipitation distribution, variability in C3/C4 grass distributions and their phytolith spectra seem to be a primary function of temperature. Further, we recommend that rIc can be satisfactorily used to reconstruct past temperature variations in the Himalaya and similar mountainous regions where soil water availability is not a limiting factor.

AB  - The rare earth element (REE) group is widely used for geochemical prospection and the hydrochemical differentiation of waters. Most of the currently applied methods use normalized REE patterns to determine enrichments or depletions of certain REE in comparison to standard materials, which are caused by specific environmental conditions. Contrast agents containing Gadolinium (Gd), which are used for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have been emitted into surface waters since the 1980s. Patients excrete these contrast agents shortly after ambulant medication in hospitals or at home. Sewage treatment is currently unable to hold back Gd from this anthropogenic source. Therefore, the Gd concentration in the receiving channel increases significantly and creates a Gd peak in the REE pattern. This anthropogenic peak propagates into adjacent groundwater bodies. In a karst aquifer showing a connection between a river/ponor (input) and three springs (output), such an anthropogenic Gd anomaly has been traced, the local Gd background quantified, and surface water groundwater interaction evaluated. In two sampling campaigns, water samples were taken every day at the input and output side during one week in February and three weeks in May. Sampling of springs and brooks in the vicinity of the karst aquifer proved excessive Gd from anthropogenic sources. The evaluation of concentration, mass flow and total mass of Gd show that Gd can be an environmental tracer to monitor surface water-groundwater interaction as well as the anthropogenic influence on water bodies. Further anthropogenic pollutants diclofenac, carbamazepine, galaxolide, caffeine, and acesulfame-K representing different classes of common organic substances were tested as co-indicators to Gd. However, out of these only acesulfame-K was detected and is related with the Gd-anomaly. Our results indicate that Gd is a more powerful indicator of surface watergroundwater interaction than most organic pollutants.

AB  - As a result of their intrinsic compl5exity and their severe consequences, the study of hybrid mixture explosions requires the consideration of several additional factors and parameters than the study of gas-only and dust-only explosions. The main objective of this work is to perform an exhaustive analysis of the explosion severity of wheat starch/pyrolysis gases hybrid mixtures in the context of the 20-L Sphere Test and to determine how severe hybrid mixture explosions can be when compared to one phase explosions. Several experimental tests were performed at different concentrations of both phases and at fixed operating conditions of ignition delay time (t(v)) and nozzle geometry. CFD simulations from a previously-validated model were run alongside in order to complement the experimental findings and expand the understanding of the hybrid system as a whole, especially in terms of the development and interaction of the phases' chemical reactions. The experimental and CFD data were analysed using severity maps and adapted stoichiometric parameters proposed in the literature. It was found that the explosion regimes proposed in the literature are not universally-applicable to all types of hybrid mixtures, given that, for wheat starch/pyrolysis gases hybrid mixtures, each regime could not be uniquely characterized and differences in the explosion behaviour were observed within the same regime. In contrast, it was found that analysing the data in terms of parameters that take into account the nature of the chemical reactions of the phases is a superior methodology given that it provides a more rigorous comparative basis for assessing the explosion severity of different types of combustible materials, including hybrid mixtures.

AB  - Open lots are commonly used to provide outdoor free ranging spaces for dairy cows in many countries such as China and the USA. For this type of operation, the manure characteristics, floor types and environmental conditions, which potentially affect gaseous emissions from manure, are quite different from those of indoor systems. The estimation of NH3 emissions from manure depends greatly on the mass transfer coefficient, an empirical constant determined by environmental factors in the process-based emission model. Using a scale model, this study measured ammonia emissions to be expected from dairy open lots, based on different combinations of different surface air velocities (0.6 -2.2 m s(-1)), air temperatures (15-35 degrees C) and relative humidity values (20-60%). Based on the two-film theory, the overall mass transfer coefficient (K-OL) of NH3 was calculated from directly measured NH3 emission rates and the ammonium nitrogen content, temperature, and pH of manure. As an indicator of the driving potential of gaseous volatilisation, the vapour pressure deficit (VPD) was estimated using air temperature and relative humidity. As the VPD and surface air velocity increased, the measured NH3 emission rates ranged from 1.35 to 19.18 mg kg(-1) h(-1), and the estimated K-OL of NH3 from dairy open lots was within the range of 1.48 x 10(-6) - 7.86 x 10(-6) m s(-1). Using the air velocity and VPD as variables, a non-linear empirical model was developed to estimate the K-OL for NH3 emissions from manure on dairy open lots (R-2 = 0.69). The normalised mean error of the model was approximately 19.4%. (C) 2019 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Enterolithic structures are stratigraphically localized folds in gypsum beds found in certain saline evaporitic sedimentary units in a wide variety of basins. Different models of formation have been proposed, all related to inorganic processes. These models include: diagenetic transformation of gypsum beds producing either displacive growth of crystals or volume changes; mechanical folding caused by compressional stress; and folding produced by slumping. The analysis of three Cenozoic evaporite sequences in Spain reveals that none of the previous models explains their origin and existence. In these outcrops, gypsum enterolithic structures occur in horizontal beds with parallel troughs and crests of the folds. They appear in shoreline facies of lacustrine environments and did not undergo major diagenetic transformations after the primary lithification of the original sediment. Based on these observations, together with the study of a modern analogue in Minorca, Spain, a new model is proposed for the genesis of enterolithic structures. This new model is based on the existence of a microbial mat exposed to brine concentration-dilution cycles and strong wind events. The high wind flow events enhanced folding of the microbial mat that became subaerially exposed and lithified due to subsequent evaporation. Therefore, the presence of enterolithic structures could be used as an indicator of shallow water environmental conditions subject to variations in brine concentration in areas with strong wind flow events. Previous studies of some evaporitic successions should be revisited, taking into account the proposed model, which would imply new depositional environment interpretations. At the same time, the proposed model could explain the existence of Kinneyia-type structures, also known as wrinkle structures, formed beneath microbial mats in peritidal zones. Moreover, considering enterolithic structures as microbially induced sedimentary structures could be useful as evidence of microbial life in the ancient geological record and on other planets such as Mars.

AB  - High-resolution seismic data reveal an unexpected Pleistocene topography underneath the Cat Cay shoal complex along the western margin of Great Bahama Bank, illustrating how Pleistocene topography focuses tidal flow to create different types of grainstone shoals. The 1-3 km wide and 35 km long shoal complex is composed of the Cat Cay ooid shoal that is a laterally continuous 8 m thick ooid shoal and a sequence of 300-600 m wide and less than 6 m thick skeletal-dominated tidal deltas south of Ocean Cay. The skeletal tidal deltas overlie an irregular Pleistocene surface, while the Cat Cay ooid shoal is situated on a flat Pleistocene surface east of a Pleistocene rock ridge. This finding challenges the assumption that an antecedent high is needed for ooid shoal initiation. The base of the Cat Cay ooid shoal is an up to 4 m thick skeletal-peloidal unit that is similar in composition to the skeletal tidal deltas south of Ocean Cay but their deposition was followed by an up to 4 m thick accumulation of ooids. The Pleistocene ridge west of the Cat Cay ooid shoal allowed accumulation of mud and peloids (the nucleus source), while to the south, muddy sediment was winnowed away and no ooids formed. The evolution of the two shoal types is ultimately the result of the presence and absence of antecedent topography adjacent to the shoal system, resulting in variations of mud accumulations and the formation of the nucleus in the ooid shoal. The coeval occurrence of ooid and skeletal shoals in the same complex implies that in the rock record, a vertical succession from oolitic to skeletal shoals does not indicate an environmental change such as climate or an anoxic event but rather a change in flow conditions created by antecedent topography.

AB  - A key strategy towards sustainable urban development is designing cities for increased circular metabolism. The transformation of areas underused, such as urban rooftops, into productive spaces is being increasingly implemented as a result of associated multiple benefits. Rooftop greenhouses (RTGs) are an interesting option for exploiting urban rooftops with direct exposure to sunlight, reducing food miles and creating new agricultural spaces, while building-applied solar photovoltaic (BAPV) panels provide clean energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, a proper assessment of environmental costs and benefits related to both systems is vital for a successful implementation. By means of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method, modelled in the professional software SimaPro, this paper aims at comparing the environmental performance of different productive uses of rooftops under Mediterranean climatic conditions. The results showed that both systems are favourable and contribute to decreasing the environmental impacts thanks to the production of resources on-site. BAPV system shows the highest avoided burdens in comparison with RTG: for instance, the impacts generated by BAPV on climate change and fossil depletion categories, corresponding to - 430 kg CO2 eq/m(2) and - 110 kg oil eq/m(2) respectively (versus - 22 kg CO2 eq/m(2) and - 4.7 kg oil eq/m(2) in the RTG system), are around 20 times lower than RTG. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was performed through different scenarios, based on reductions or substitution of the most sensitive input flows, thus providing some useful tools for improved environmental performances. Attention to additional energy and material efficiency, in favour of the more environmentally sustainable choice, should remain a main point of investigation.

AB  - The paper presents the assumptions of the portfolio theory and the possibilities of its application in the forestry to diversify the species composition of the stand. The decision problem concerns the rationalization of the species share, ensuring the optimal ratio of annual production value from 1 ha in the stand (financial effect) to the expected level of risk. The adopted measure of the assessment of the value of production and the risk of its achievement is the Sharpe index, which is an approximate measure of the correlation between the income of one investment and its market, and therefore a measure of systematic risk. The paper presents the theoretical foundations of the mentioned optimization problem and examples of research results of American and European scientists regarding applications of portfolio theory in the forestry. The research results indicate that the portfolio theory in forestry focuses on making investment decisions in conditions of high uncertainty. The main criteria for selecting these decisions are income and risk. Diversification of the share of various investments is the source of the so-called risk diversification effects, e.g. the share of particular species in the composition of the stand, the assortment structure and other natural and economic factors that cause a reduction in the total risk with the same income or an increase in the total income with the same risk. The paper indicate that in forest management it is possible and justified to use the simplified Sharpe model, in the form of a univariate indicator, to analyze and make decisions rational from the point of view of natural and economic investment. This solution was applied to various portfolios, including the diversification of the species composition of tree stands. The key indicator when assessing the size of risk and related (predicted) income is the so-called the beta coefficient, determined using the modified Sharpe formula.

AB  - Urban impervious surfaces (UIS) influence the structure and function of urban systems, and are widely considered a key indicator of urban environmental conditions. However, the amount and pattern of UIS both change with spatial scale, which complicates the computation and interpretation of UIS as an indicator. A better understanding of the spatial scaling relations of UIS is needed to resolve this predicament. Thus, the main objective of this study was to explore how UIS would change with increasing spatial extent and population size across urban hierarchical levels, using data from the three largest urban agglomerations in China. In addition, a comparative analysis of six world metropolitan regions was conducted to test the generality of the UIS scaling relations. Scalograms and standardized major axis regression were used to investigate the scaling relations with respect to spatial extent and city size, respectively. Our major findings include: (1) the total amount of UIS increased, whereas the percentage of UIS decreased, in a staircase-like fashion when the spatial extent of analysis expanded from within a local city to the entire urban agglomeration; (2) the spatial scaling of UIS followed a rather consistent and tight power law function within a local city, but became less consistent and less tight beyond a local city; (3) the scaling relations of the total amount of UIS were more consistent than those of the percentage of UIS, and the total amount of UIS scaled more tightly with urban area than with urban population size. These findings shed new light on the scale dependence of UIS, suggesting that a multiscale approach should be adopted for quantifying UIS and for using it as an urban environmental indicator.

AB  - According to railroad managers, displacement of railroad bridges under service loads is an important parameter in the condition assessment and performance evaluation. However, measuring bridge responses in the field is often costly and labor-intensive. This paper proposes a low-cost, efficient wireless intelligent sensor (LEWIS) platform that can compute in real-time the dynamic transverse displacements of railroad bridges under service loads. This sensing platform drives on an open-source Arduino ecosystem and combines low-cost microcontrollers with affordable accelerometers and wireless transmission modules. The proposed LEWIS system is designed to reconstruct dynamic displacements from acceleration measurements onboard, eliminating the need for offline post processing, and to transmit the data in real-time to a base station where the inspector at the bridge can see the displacements while the train is crossing, or to a remote office if so desired by intemet. Researchers validated the effectiveness of the new LEWIS by conducting a series of laboratory experiments. A shake table setup simulated transverse bridge displacements measured on the field and excited the proposed platform, a commercially available wired expensive accelerometer, and reference LVDT displacement sensor. The responses obtained from the wireless system were compared to the displacements reconstructed from commercial accelerometer readings and the reference LVDT. The results of the laboratory experiments demonstrate that the proposed system is capable of reconstructing transverse displacements of railroad bridges under revenue service traffic accurately and transmitting the data in real-time wirelessly. In conclusion, the platform presented in this paper can be used in the performance assessment of railroad bridge network cost-effectively and accurately. Future work includes collecting real-time reference free displacements of one railroad bridge in Colorado under train crossings to further prove LEWIS' suitability for engineering applications.

AB  - Pulmonary capillary endothelium-bound (PCEB) angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity is a direct and quantifiable index of pulmonary endothelial function that decreases early in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and correlates with its severity. Endothelial dysfunction is a major pathophysiology that underlies sepsis-related ARDS. Recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC), now withdrawn from the market, has been used in the recent past as an endothelial-protective treatment in patients with septic organ dysfunction.
   We investigated the effect of rhAPC on pulmonary endothelial function in 19 septic patients suffering from ARDS. Applying indicator-dilution type techniques, we measured single-pass transpulmonary percent metabolism (%M) and hydrolysis (v) of the synthetic, biologically inactive, and highly specific for ACE substrate, H-3-benzoyl-Phe-Ala-Pro (BPAP), under first-order reaction conditions, and calculated lung functional capillary surface area before and after treatment with rhAPC.
   Pulmonary endothelium ACE activity was severely impaired in septic patients with ARDS, and was not affected by rhAPC treatment. Additionally, poor outcome was related to a more profound decrease in PCEB-ACE activity. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-substrate utilization was statistically significantly lower in non-survivors as compared to survivors, with no changes over time within each group: BPAP %M: 32.7 +/- 3.4% at baseline to 25.6 +/- 2.9% at day 7 in survivors versus 20.8 +/- 2.8 to 15.5 +/- 5%, respectively, in non-survivors (p = 0.044), while hydrolysis (v): 0.41 +/- 0.06 at baseline to 0.30 +/- 0.04 at day 7 in survivors compared to 0.24 +/- 0.04 to 0.18 +/- 0.06, respectively, in non-survivors (p = 0.049).
   rhAPC administration in septic patients with ARDS did not improve PCEB-ACE activity indices. However, these indices might be useful in the early recognition of septic patients with ARDS at high risk of mortality.

AB  - Deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) is an important physiological indicator and diagnostic biomarker, but traditional methods for assessing its activity are time-consuming, laborious, and usually radioactive. Herein, by effectively combining the special functions of DNase I and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), a simple, green, cost-effective, label-free and ultrasensitive assay for DNase I activity has been constructed based on superlong poly(thymine)-hosted copper nanoparticles (poly T-CuNPs). In this strategy, a 3'-phosphorylated DNA primer is designed to block TdT polymerization. After addition of DNase I, the primer could be digested to release 3'-hydroxylated fragments, which could further be tailed by TdT in dITP pool with superlong poly T ssDNA for CuNPs formation. Fluorescence measurements and gel electrophoresis demonstrated its feasibility for DNase I analysis. The results indicated that with a size of 3-4 nm, the CuNPs templated by TdT-polymerized superlong poly T (> 500 mer) had several advantages such as short synthetic time (< 5 min), large Stokes shift (similar to 275 nm) and intense red fluorescence emission. Under the optimal conditions, quantitative detection of DNase I was realized, showing a good linear correlation between 0.02 and 2.0 U/mL (R-2=0.9928) and a detection limit of 0.02 U/mL. By selecting six other nucleases or proteins as controls, an excellent specificity was also verified. Then, the strategy was successfully applied to detect DNase I in diluted serum with a standard addition method, thus implying its reliability and practicability for biological samples. The proposed strategy might be promising as a sensing platform for related molecular biology and disease studies.

AB  - Key message Recent growth changes (1980-2007) in Western European forests strongly vary across tree species, and range from + 42% in mountain contexts to - 17% in Mediterranean contexts. These changes reveal recent climate warming footprint and are structured by species' temperature (-) and precipitation (+) growing conditions.
   Context Unprecedented climate warming impacts forests extensively, questioning the respective roles of climatic habitats and tree species in forest growth responses. National forest inventories ensure a repeated and spatially systematic monitoring of forests and form a unique contributing data source.
   Aims A primary aim of this paper was to estimate recent growth changes in eight major European tree species, in natural contexts ranging from mountain to Mediterranean. A second aimwas to explore their association with species' climatic habitat and contemporary climate change.
   Methods Using > 315,000 tree increments measured in > 25,000 NFI plots, temporal changes in stand basal area increment (BAI) were modelled. Indicators of climate normals and of recent climatic change were correlated to species BAI changes.
   Results BAI changes spanned from -17 to +42% over 1980-2007 across species. BAI strongly increased for mountain species, showed moderate/ no increase for generalist and temperate lowland species and declined for Mediterranean species. BAI changes were greater in colder/ wetter contexts than in warmer/drier ones where declines were observed. This suggested a role for climate warming, further found more intense in colder contexts and strongly correlated with species BAI changes.&
   Conclusion The predominant role of climate warming and species climatic habitat in recent growth changes is highlighted in Western Europe. Concern is raised for Mediterranean species, showing growth decreases in a warmer climate with stable precipitation.

AB  - Pedoclimatic conditions affect grape and wine quality. In particular, the relationship between soil and grape quality is at the core of the terroir definition. The study focuses on cv. Aleatico, an aromatic and autochthonous grapevine cultivar grown in the northern part of the Latium region (central Italy) in a heterogeneous environment (Protected Denomination of Origin Aleatico di Gradoli). Five subareas were selected to represent the environmental variability. The grape-ripening parameters, along with volatile and phenolic compounds in wines derived from the grapes from these growing areas, were analyzed to assess the relationship between soil traits and biochemical grape and wine parameters. Pedoclimatic analysis was carried out following official protocols for determination of soil texture and calculation of bioclimatic Thermal Index of Winkler. Solid-phase microextraction with gas-chromatographic and standard methods were used to measure volatile and phenolic compounds, respectively. Data were evaluated using descriptive statistical methods (analysis of variance and Pearson's coefficient) and multivariate statistical analyses (principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis). The results showed a significant 'soil effect' on the biochemical composition of the grapes and wines. The soil had a significant effect on grape-ripening parameters, as the soil sand content (%) was highly correlated with concentration of total soluble solids and phenols. Soils with a sandy-loam texture and moderate skeleton content yielded the best wine performance in terms of aroma and phenolic content. The study highlighted the importance of microzonation, even in small winegrape growing areas, for more diverse and competitive wine production. The study enhances knowledge about the relationship between soil and grapevine aromatic varieties. Data indicated that identifying biochemical parameters may be indicators of enological potential according to geographic origin.

AB  - A new model was developed for the paleogeographic distribution of dinoflagellate cysts across the Cretaceous/ Paleogene (K/Pg) boundary. Four sections in the Eastern Alps were studied. The Knappengraben and Gamsbach sections are located in the Gosau Basin of Gams, Austria. They are continuous across the boundary and represent a bathyal environment. The Waidach section north of Salzburg (Austria) contains neritic deposits of the Helvetic unit but shows a hiatus at the boundary. The Goppling section between Teisendorf and Oberteisendorf (Bavaria, Germany) belongs to a turbidite-rich, deep-water system (Ultrahelvetic unit), and is considered to be continuous across the boundary.
   The occurrence and distribution of dinoflagellate cysts in these sections suggests that Trabeculidinium, Adnatosphaeridium, Spiniferites, Pterodinium, Impagidinium, Achomosphaera and Codoniella are restricted to bathyal environments, whereas Areoligera, Manumiella and Trithyrodinium are restricted to the neritic environment. The abundance of Manumiella and Trithyrodinium indicate a high nutrient supply. Hystrichosphaeridium -dominated assemblages have been recorded in both neritic and bathyal environments. Two Manumiella spikes were recorded only at Waidach and interpreted to reflect slight coolings of oceanic surface waters. In the Danian, acme of Spongodinium delitiense are recorded similar to 1 m above the K/Pg boundary in the neritic and bathyal environments. These acmes could reflect a slight cooling of surface waters in the earliest Danian.
   The palynofacies analysis in the Gams Basin reveals a high abundance of amorphous organic matter in the Maastrichtian, and black phytoclasts in the Danian, which indicates intensified terrigenous run-off in the Danian with higher sea-floor oxygenation. In the Waidach section, palynomorphs are much more abundant, indicating a shelf to basin transitional area with dysoxic-anoxic conditions at the sea-floor.

AB  - The aim of this research is to evaluate the environmental conditions in the Jaboatdo River estuarine system (8 degrees 14'S/34 degrees 55'W), by studying sedimentary organic matter, which may provide information about anthropogenic influence in this tropical mesotidal estuary. The catchment area is 442 km(2) with a population estimated at 500,000 inhabitants, and is characterized as an urban coastal plain estuarine system. Thirty surface sediment samples were collected in November-2010 (dry season) and May-2011 (rainy season). Results indicated that the adjacent sediments from continental shelf are sandy, moderately sorted and bioclastic (74.8%CaCO3), differing from estuarine sediments, which although sandy (silty-sand) are lithoclastic (17.4%CaCO3) and poorly sorted. The predominance of sand observed in both seasons is due to the small length of the river (75km) and to the low supply of mud sediments, since its drainage basin is located mostly on sandy coastal plain. Carbon and nitrogen contents indicates a sensitive seasonal variation with large ranges, varying from 0.03-8.51% and from 0.00-0.54%, respectively, with higher contents prevailing in the inner portions of the estuary and gradually decreasing towards the shelf. The organic matter origin, according to the C/N ratios and delta C-13 values reflected the occurrence of marine organic matter in shelf samples (C/N<7.0/delta C-13>-20.0 parts per thousand PDB). However, the estuary terrigenous organic matter proportion increases upward (C/N>15.0). The delta C-13 values are typical of C-4 higher plants (-27.0 parts per thousand PDB) and domestic sewage mix (-26.7 parts per thousand PDB), ranging from -28.0 to -25.9 parts per thousand PDB and indicating evidences of urban pollution in Jaboatao estuarine sediments.

AB  - The various physiological alterations caused by copper (Cu) exposure in fish have attracted great interests toward neuronal strategies against Cu toxicity. Here, neurobehavioral activities (including anxiety-like behaviors) and transcriptional levels of heat shock protein (Hsp)90 and hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) were evaluated in the crucian carp (Carassius carassius) treated with nominal sub-lethal higher (1.45 mg/L) and lower (0.30 mg/L) concentrations of CuCl2. Both concentrations accounted for diminished swimming speed and food intake plus a strong preference for the dark side of the light/dark apparatus together with a reduction of crossings between the two compartments with respect to controls. Contextually, Hsp90 and HIF-1 alpha transcripts were largely down- and up-regulated, respectively, in some brain areas such as in the medial part of the dorsal telencephalon (Dm, -52%) and in the ventral part of the ventral telencephalon (Vv, +68%). When carps were transferred to CuCl2-free water, some behaviors were rescued especially for fish previously exposed to 0.30 mg/L concentration. In this same condition, Hsp90 mRNA levels were recuperated (-94%) in the medial preglomerular nucleus (NPGm) with respect to exposed fish while HIF-1 alpha mRNA was mostly down-regulated in telencephalic stations. Moreover, recovery capacities of this extraordinary resistant fish was exhibited by evident reductions (-80%) of the dark argyrophilic granules such as in the ventral telencephalon (VTel). Overall, our results point to interesting responses against Cu toxicity involving Hsp90 and HIF-1 alpha transcripts that may constitute early indicators of environmental stressors leading to the repair of metal-induced damages in fish with notable brain plasticity properties.

AB  - Risk management for wastewater treatment and reuse have led to growing interest in understanding and optimising pathogen reduction during biological treatment processes. However, modelling pathogen reduction is often limited by poor characterization of the relationships between variables and incomplete knowledge of removal mechanisms. The aim of this paper was to assess the applicability of Bayesian belief network models to represent associations between pathogen reduction, and operating conditions and monitoring parameters and predict AS performance. Naive Bayes and semi-naive Bayes networks were constructed from an activated sludge dataset including operating and monitoring parameters, and removal efficiencies for two pathogens (native Giardia lamblia and seeded Cryptosporidium parvum) and five native microbial indicators (F-RNA bacteriophage, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, coliforms and enterococci). First we defined the Bayesian network structures for the two pathogen log(10) reduction values (LRVs) class nodes discretized into two states (< and >= 1 LRV) using two different learning algorithms. Eight metrics, such as Prediction Accuracy (PA) and Area Under the receiver operating Curve (AUC), provided a comparison of model prediction performance, certainty and goodness of fit. This comparison was used to select the optimum models. The optimum Tree Augmented naive models predicted removal efficiency with high AUC when all system parameters were used simultaneously (AUCs for C. parvum and G. lamblia LRVs of 0.95 and 0.87 respectively). However, metrics for individual system parameters showed only the C. parvum model was reliable. By contrast individual parameters for G. lamblia LRV prediction typically obtained low AUC scores (AUC < 0.81). Useful predictors for C. parvum LRV included solids retention time, turbidity and total coliform LRV. The methodology developed appears applicable for predicting pathogen removal efficiency in water treatment systems generally. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Behavior is increasingly reported as a sensitive and early indicator of toxicant stress in aquatic organisms. However, the systematic understanding of behavioral effects and comparisons between effect profiles is hampered because the available studies are limited to few chemicals and differ in the exposure conditions and effect parameters examined. The aims of the present study were 1) to explore behavioral responses of Daphnia magna exposed to different toxicants, 2) to compare behavioral effect profiles with regard to chemical modes of action, and 3) to determine the sensitivity and response time of behavioral parameters in a new multi-cell exposure system named Multi-DaphTrack compared with currently utilized tests. Twelve compounds covering different modes of toxic action were selected to sample a wide range of potential effect profiles. Acute standard immobilization tests and 48h of behavioral tracking were performed in the customized Multi-DaphTrack system and a single-cell commercialized biological early warning system. Contrasting behavioral profiles were observed for average speed (i.e., intensity, time of effect onset, effect duration), but no distinct behavioral profiles could be drawn from the chemical mode of action. Most compounds tested in the Multi-DaphTrack system induced an early and significant average speed increase at concentrations near or below the 10% effective concentration (48h) of the acute immobilization test, demonstrating that the Multi-DaphTrack system is fast and sensitive. To conclude, behavior endpoints could be used as an alternative or complement to the current acute standard test or chemical analysis for the predictive evaluation of ecotoxic effects of effluents or water bodies.

AB  - Impervious surfaces (IS) are a key indicator of environmental quality, and mapping of urban IS is important for a wide range of applications including hydrological modelling, water management, urban and environmental planning and urban climate studies. This paper addresses the accuracy and applicability of vegetation indices (VI), from Landsat imagery, to estimate IS fractions for European cities. The accuracy of three different measures of vegetation cover is examined for eight urban areas at different locations in Europe. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) are converted to IS fractions using a regression modelling approach. Also, NDVI is used to estimate fractional vegetation cover (FR), and consequently IS fractions. All three indices provide fairly accurate estimates (MAEs approximate to 10%, MBE's < 2%) of sub-pixel imperviousness, and are found to be applicable for cities with dissimilar climatic and vegetative conditions. The VI/IS relationship across cities is examined by quantifying the MAEs and MBEs between all combinations of models and urban areas. Also, regional regression models are developed by compiling data from multiple cities to examine the potential for developing and applying a single regression model to estimate IS fractions for numerous urban areas without reducing the accuracy considerably. Our findings indicate that the models can be applied broadly for multiple urban areas, and that the accuracy is reduced only marginally by applying the regional models. SAVI is identified as a superior index for the development of regional quantification models. The findings of this study highlight that IS fractions, and spatiotemporal changes herein, can be mapped by use of simple regression models based on VIs from remote sensors, and that the method presented enables simple, accurate and resource efficient quantification of IS.

AB  - Four typical organic micro-pollutants in effluent sewage were subjected to the various treatments using three ozone-based oxidation processes, i.e. individual ozonation (O-3), ultrasonic ozonation (US/O-3) and photocatalytic ozonation (PC/O-3) under different experimental conditions involving supplied ozone dose, pH value and humic acid (HA) concentration of the effluent, ultrasonic radiation power, and photocatalyst dose. The target compounds, i.e. clofibric acid (CFA), nonylphenol (NP), 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and carbamazepine (CBZ), were selected from 11 organic pollutants frequently detected in the aquatic environment through a developed screening system. The increase on the supplied ozone doses would improve the performances of ozonation of the target compounds. Besides, the removal rates of the compounds during the three ozone-based oxidation processes increased with the rise on pH value in the set range (3.7-9.5) of this study. However, the removal rates on the whole reduced with the increasing HA addition, especially during the US/O-3 combined process. Compared with the individual O-3, the two combined processes enhanced considerably the removal rates, by 13.9% or above for CFA, 12.6% or above for NP, over 13.3% for EEZ, and no less than 14.8% for CBZ. The optimal removal of the target compounds was obtained at the ultrasonic power 240 W for the ultrasonic ozonation treatment. For the PC/O-3 combined process, the enhanced removal of the targets was mainly due to the larger amount of oxidizing species generated through the enhancement effects of photocatalysis as the adsorption of the targets to the photocatalyst was far less.

AB  - Carbonate faults commonly contain small amounts of phyllosilicate in their slip zones, due to pressure solution and/or clay smear. To assess the effect of phyllosilicate content on earthquake propagation in carbonate faults, friction experiments were performed at 1.3m/s on end-members and mixtures of calcite, illite-smectite, and smectite gouge. Experiments were performed at 9MPa normal load, under room humidity and water-saturated conditions. All dry gouges show initial friction values ((i)) of 0.51-0.58, followed by slip hardening to peak values of 0.61-0.76. Slip weakening then ensues, with friction decreasing to steady state values ((ss)) of 0.19-0.33 within 0.17-0.58m of slip. Contrastingly, wet gouges containing 10-50wt% phyllosilicate exhibit(i) values between 0.07 and 0.52 followed by negligible or no slip hardening; rather, steady state sliding ((ss)<<0.2) is attained almost immediately. Microstructurally, dry gouges show intense cataclasis and wear within localized principal slip zones, plus evidence for thermal decomposition of calcite. Wet gouges exhibit distributed deformation, less intense cataclasis, and no evidence of thermal decomposition. It is proposed that in wet gouges, slip is distributed across a network of weak phyllosilicate formed during axial loading compaction prior to shear. This explains the (1) subdued cataclasis and associated lack of slip hardening, (2) distributed nature of deformation, and (3) lack of evidence for thermal decomposition, due to low friction and lack of slip localization. These findings imply that just 10% phyllosilicate in the slip zone of fluid-saturated carbonate faults can (1) dramatically change their frictional behavior, facilitating rupture propagation to the surface, and (2) significantly lower frictional heating, preventing development of microscale seismic markers.

AB  - Research on modern pollen assemblages of human-induced vegetation is conducive to extracting human impact information, and provides basis for determining human impact intensity. The use of 189 surface soil pollen samples from human-induced and natural vegetation shows that there were significant discrepancies of indicator pollen taxa and human impact intensity between different vegetation types in Northern China. The results demonstrate that forest and grassland pollen assemblages are dominated by natural vegetation pollen taxa, which show little effect from human impact. Farmlands are dominated by Cereal Poaceae pollen. Cultivation methods, climate conditions and human impact intensity are the main reasons that cause discrepancy in different regions. Uncultivated lands could be effectively distinguished based on common human-companion plant pollen types and certain amount of crop pollen, which display the first step of secondary succession from human-induced to natural vegetation. Indicator species analysis shows that Cereal Poaceae, Trilete spore, Humulus and Brassicaceae indicate farmlands; weeds Poaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Ranunculaceae and Selaginella sinensis indicate uncultivated lands; grasslands have the largest number of indicator pollen taxa, in which Convolvulaceae, Artemisia, Asteraceae, Liliaceae, Polygonaceae, and Nitraria pollen have the highest indicator values; in forests, Betula, Larix and Quercus have the highest indicator values with statistical significance. Meanwhile, Human Influence Index (HII) values can be used to differentiate human-induced and natural vegetation. The calibration model of pollen-HII based on the weighted averaging plus partial least squares (WA-PLS) method exhibits a good statistical performance (R-2=0.69), and the HII values have the same trend of change with Cereal Poaceae percentage. Our results confirm that pollen from human-induced vegetation can provide reliable estimates of HII, which provides a good reference for restoring human impact intensity in fossil pollen assemblage.

AB  - Reconstructing past ocean salinity is important for assessing paleoceanographic change and therefore past climatic dynamics. Commonly, sea water salinity reconstruction is based on planktonic foraminifera oxygen isotope values combined with sea surface temperature reconstruction. However, the approach relies on multiple proxies, resulting in rather large uncertainty and, consequently, relatively low accuracy of salinity estimates. An alternative tool for past ocean salinity reconstruction is the hydrogen isotope composition of long chain (C-37) alkenones (delta D-alkenone). Here, we have applied delta D-alkenone to a 39 ka sedimentary record from the Eastern South African continental shelf in the Mozambique Channel, close to the Zambezi River mouth. Despite changes in global seawater delta D related to glacial - interglacial ice volume effects, no clear changes were observed in the delta D-alkenone record throughout the entire 39 ka. The BIT index record from the same core, which provides information on relative contributions of soil organic matter (OM) vs. marine input, indicates high soil OM input during the glacial and low input during the Holocene. This suggests a more pronounced freshwater influence at the core location during the glacial, resulting in alkenones depleted in D during that time, thereby explaining the lack of a clear glacial-interglacial alkenone delta D shift. The correlation between the BIT index and delta D-alkenone during the glacial period suggests that increased continental runoff potentially changed the growth conditions of the alkenone-producing haptophytes, promoting coastal haptophyte species with generally more enriched delta D-alkenone values. We therefore suggest that the application of delta D-alkenone for reconstructing past salinity in coastal settings may be complicated by changes in the alkenone-producing haptophyte community.

AB  - This review presents and discusses the data from 47 peer-reviewed journal articles on the occurrence of 137 pharmaceutical compounds in the effluent from various types of constructed wetlands treating urban wastewater. We analyse the observed removal efficiencies of the investigated compounds in order to identify the type of constructed wetland that best removes those most frequently detected. The literature reviewed details experimental investigations carried out on 136 treatment plants, including free water surface systems, as well as horizontal and vertical subsurface flow beds (pilot or full-scale) acting as primary, secondary or tertiary treatments. The occurrence of selected pharmaceuticals in sediments and gravel and their uptake by common macrophytes are also presented and discussed. We analyse the main removal mechanisms for the selected compounds and investigate the influence of the main design parameters, as well as operational and environmental conditions of the treatment systems on removal efficiency. We also report on previous attempts to correlate observed removal values with the chemical structure and chemical-physical properties (mainly pK(a) and LogK(ow)) of pharmaceutical compounds. We then use the literature data to calculate the average pharmaceutical mass loadings in the effluent from constructed wetlands, comparing the ability of such systems to remove selected pharmaceuticals with the corresponding conventional secondary and tertiary treatments. Finally, the environmental risk posed by pharmaceutical residues in effluents from constructed wetlands acting as secondary and tertiary treatment steps is calculated in the form of the risk quotient ratio. This approach enabled us to provide a ranking of the most critical compounds for the two scenarios, to discuss the ramifications of the adoption of constructed wetlands for removing such persistent organic compounds, and to propose avenues of future research.

AB  - The use of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (bGDGTs) in loess-palaeosol sequences (LPSs) has shown promises in continental palaeotemperature reconstructions. Thus far, however, little is known about the effect of soil moisture on their distributions in the water-limited Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). In this study, the relationships between environmental variables and the cyclization of branched tetraethers (CBT) were investigated in arid-subhumid China using 97 surface soils in the CLP and its vicinity, as well as 78 soils with pH >7 which have been previously published. We find that CBT correlates best with soil water content (SWC) or mean annual precipitation (MAP) for the overall data set. This indicates that CBT is mainly controlled by soil moisture instead of soil pH in alkaline soils from arid-subhumid regions, where water availability is a limiting factor for the producers of bGDGTs. Therefore, we suggest that CBT can potentially be used as a palaeorainfall proxy on the alkaline CLP. According to the preliminary CBT-MAP relationship for modern CLP soils (CBT = -0.0021 x MAP + 1.7, n = 37, r = -0.93), palaeorainfall history was reconstructed from three LPSs (Yuanbao, Lantian, and Mangshan) with published bGDGT data spanning the past 70 ka. The CBT-derived MAP records of the three sites consistently show precession-driven variation resembling the monsoon record based on speleothem delta O-18, supporting CBT as a reasonable proxy for palaeorainfall reconstruction in LPS. The direct application of CBT as a palaeorainfall proxy in corroboration with the bGDGT-based temperature proxy may enable us to further assess the temperature/hydrological association for palaeoclimate studies on the CLP.

AB  - Question: Can predictors derived from air- and space-borne high-resolution remote sensing data improve models of species richness commonly built using coarser-scaled environmental variables?
   Location: Switzerland, covering 41244km(2) of Central Europe.
   Methods: We applied linear regressions to model species richness of woody species, herbs, edaphic bryophytes and epiphytic lichens in Swiss forests. We included high-resolution predictors derived from digital height models and from satellite spectral images. Coarser-scaled predictors characterizing climatic and topographic conditions were also included, as were soil properties and geology. We applied hierarchical partitioning to regression models to investigate the independent contribution of each predictor set to species richness models.
   Results: Predictors derived from high-resolution remote sensing data substantially improved the species richness models (increase 14-55% of R-2). However, coarse-scaled climatic and topographic predictors still explained a high proportion of the variance in the species richness data in all models, independently of other predictors commonly used. The importance of the remotely sensed variables was strongly dependent on the biogeographic region considered. The species richness models of smaller organisms of the forest floor (herbs and edaphic bryophytes) benefited greatly from adding high-resolution topographic predictors, indicating the importance of microtopographic heterogeneity for these groups. Both epiphytic lichens and herbs responded strongly to indicators of structural properties of the forest stand.
   Conclusions: High-resolution remote sensing data is a proxy for micro-environmental structures and variation in these structures. Our results show that predictors derived from such data can improve species richness models considerably, especially in regions with low climatic and/or topographic variation. High-resolution remote sensing variables excellently complement coarser-scaled predictors, as they are available over large areas at low cost.

AB  - Objective: To examine associations between DSM-IV psychiatric disorders and other- and self-directed violence in the general population.
   Methods: Data were obtained from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) Waves 1 & 2 (n = 34,653). Four violence categories were derived from a latent class analysis (LCA) of 5 other-directed and 4 self-directed violent behavior indicators. Multinomial logistic regression examined class associations for gender, race ethnicity, age and DSM-IV substance use, mood, anxiety, and personality disorders.
   Results: Approximately 16% of adults reported some form of violent behavior distributed as follows: other-directed only, 4.6%; self-directed only, 9.3%; combined self- and other-directed, 2.0%; and no violence, 84.1%. The majority of the DSM-IV disorders included in this study were significantly and independently related to each form of violence. Generally, other-directed violence was more strongly associated with any substance use disorders (81%) and any personality disorders (42%), while self-directed violence was more strongly associated with mood (41%) and anxiety disorders (57%). Compared with these two forms of violence, the smaller group with combined self- and other-directed violence was more strongly associated with any substance use disorders (88%), mood disorders (63%), and personality disorders (76%).
   Conclusion: Findings from this study are consistent with recent conceptualizations of disorders as reflecting externalizing disorders and internalizing disorders. The identification of the small category with combined forms of violence further extends numerous clinical studies which established associations between self- and other-directed violent behaviors. The extent to which the combined violence category represents a meaningful and reliable category of violence requires further detailed studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We investigated terpenoid biomarkers in muds from lignite seams, clays from porcelain clay beds that slightly contain lignite, and from a conifer cone macrofossil from the Miocene Tokiguchi Porcelain Clay Formation of the Tokai Group in central Japan, as well as extant cones. The n-alkanes, n-alkanols (suberin origin), diterpenoids (conifer origin), hopanoids (bacteria origin) and steroids were mainly present in the lignite-containing muds and clays. On the other hand, the diterpenoids, triterpenoids (angiosperm origin), hopanoids and steroids were detected as major component in the conifer cone macrofossil. In addition, the diterpenoids were mainly detected in the extant conifer cones. The low hopane isomer ratios and the detection of biosterols are confirmed to be immature in the lignite, sediment and macrofossil in the formation. The stanol/sterol ratio values of the lignite-containing muds and clays are much higher than that of the macrofossil. The higher ratios in lignite-containing muds and clays are possibly attributed to enhanced microbial reduction of organic matter under reduced condition in the swampy environments. A large amount of angiosperm-derived triterpenoids detected in the conifer cone macrofossil are considered as contaminants in the sample from sedimentary organic particles originated from detrital waxes of angiosperms. Such contamination might occur by migration of organic compounds within sediment after deposition. The angiosperm-derived polar terpenoids may be hardly affected by contamination by migration of organic matter from the adjacent sediments because these are less abundant in the conifer macrofossil. Thus, it is suggested that the polar terpenoid biomarkers are more reliable as paleochemotaxonomic and paleovegetation indicators. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study we apply the model ERGOM to simulate the consequences of Climate Change as well as the combination of Climate Change with nutrient load reductions according to the Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP) on the Baltic Sea ecosystem.
   According to the simulations, Climate Change will cause an increase of the water temperature up to 3 K and a salinity decrease of 1.5 PSU until 2100. However, the implementation of the BSAP will have much stronger effects on the ecosystem. The model suggests that the western Baltic Sea will shift from a nitrogen (N) towards a phosphorus (P) limited system. As a consequence, N-fixation will strongly decrease. The same applies to nutrient-concentrations in winter, denitrification as well as detritus and chlorophyll concentrations in summer. The availability of N in summer, the Secchi depth and the oxygen saturation will increase. Our simulations suggest that the full implementation of the BSAP will cause imbalances in the Baltic Sea over decades before a new system state will be reached. Our results indicate that the Secchi depth alone is not a suitable indicator for the state of eutrophication. Concerning the Water Framework Directive (WFD), Climate Change might alter gradients and concentrations, e.g. of salinity, and in return this might require a re-definition of the WFD typology or a spatial shift of the surface water types, e.g. in Germany. The western Baltic Sea is strongly controlled by regional nutrient loads. Climate Change has only a limited effect on loads in the western Baltic. A re-definition of reference conditions and a good status because of Climate Change seems not necessary. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A growing number of low and middle income nations (LMCs) have adopted some sort of system for environmental impact assessment (EIA). However, generally many of these EIA systems are characterised by a low performance in terms of timely information dissemination, monitoring and enforcement after licencing. Donor actors (such as the World Bank) have attempted to contribute to a higher performance of EIA systems in LMCs by intervening at two levels: the project level (e.g. by providing scoping advice or EIS quality review) and the system level (e.g. by advising on EIA legislation or by capacity building). The aims of these interventions are environmental protection in concrete cases and enforcing the institutionalisation of environmental protection, respectively. Learning by actors involved is an important condition for realising these aims. A relatively underexplored form of learning concerns learning at EIA system-level via project level donor interventions. This 'indirect' learning potentially results in system changes that better fit the specific context(s) and hence contribute to higher performances. Our exploratory research in Ghana and the Maldives shows that thus far, 'indirect' learning only occurs incidentally and that donors play a modest role in promoting it. Barriers to indirect learning are related to the institutional context rather than to individual characteristics. Moreover, 'indirect' learning seems to flourish best in large projects where donors achieved a position of influence that they can use to evoke reflection upon system malfunctions. In order to enhance learning at all levels donors should thereby present the outcomes of the intervention elaborately (i.e. discuss the outcomes with a large audience), include practical suggestions about post-EIS activities such as monitoring procedures and enforcement options and stimulate the use of their advisory reports to generate organisational memory and ensure a better information dissemination.

AB  - Effective use of coping strategies by people with chronic pain conditions is associated with better functioning and adjustment to chronic disease. Although the effects of coping on pain have been well studied, less is known about how specific coping strategies relate to actual physical activity patterns in daily life. The purpose of this study was to evaluate how different coping strategies relate to symptoms and physical activity patterns in a sample of adults with knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA; N=44). Physical activity was assessed by wrist-worn accelerometry; coping strategy use was assessed by the Chronic Pain Coping Inventory. We hypothesized that the use of coping strategies that reflect approach behaviors (e.g., Task Persistence), would be associated with higher average levels of physical activity, whereas avoidance coping behaviors (e.g., Resting, Asking for Assistance, Guarding) and Pacing would be associated with lower average levels of physical activity. We also evaluated whether coping strategies moderated the association between momentary symptoms (pain and fatigue) and activity. We hypothesized that higher levels of approach coping would be associated with a weaker association between symptoms and activity compared to lower levels of this type of coping. Multilevel modeling was used to analyze the momentary association between coping and physical activity. We found that higher body mass index, fatigue, and the use of Guarding were significantly related to lower activity levels, whereas Asking for Assistance was significantly related to higher activity levels. Only Resting moderated the association between pain and activity. Guarding, Resting, Task Persistence, and Pacing moderated the association between fatigue and activity. This study provides an initial understanding of how people with OA cope with symptoms as they engage in daily life activities using ecological momentary assessment and objective physical activity measurement.

AB  - An integrated stratigraphic study of a Neogene lacustrine succession on the Pag Island (Croatia), combining quantitative pollen analysis, magnetostratigraphy, cyclostratigraphy, biostratigraphy and gamma-ray measurements, provides new insights into orbitally controlled variations in palaeo-vegetation and depositional patterns in the Dinaride Lake System. The quantitative palynological record shows a cyclical pattern of vegetation changes that closely corresponds to sedimentological patterns. The intervals with a high abundance of thermophilous and xeric indicators, suggesting a warm and dry climate, generally coincide with intervals of frequent lignite deposition and shallow lake facies. This suggests that both records are dominantly controlled by variations in past climatic conditions and lake level. Our data show two large-scale warming and shallowing-upward cycles, which are interpreted to be forced by the similar to 100 kyr eccentricity cycle of the Earth's orbit. Magnetostratigraphic data of the examined section reveal a long (113 m) reversed polarity interval, followed by a 7 m thick interval of normal polarity at the top. The inferred depositional rate of similar to 0.3 mm/yr, combined with biostratigraphic constraints by mollusks, suggests that the most logical correlation of the reversed interval is to chron C5Cr. This indicates that the Pag succession was deposited between 17.1 and 16.7 Ma and that it corresponds to the Burdigalian Stage of the Early Miocene, and the regional Karpatian Stage of the Central Paratethys. The high relative percentage of thermophilous pollen taxa, Engelhardia and Taxodium-type being the most prominent, generally indicates a subtropical humid climate for the SW Croatian part of the Dinaride Lake System. The observed warming trend is possibly related to the onset of the Miocene Climatic Optimum. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (CAMPFIRE) is a long-term programmatic approach to rural development that uses wildlife and other natural resources as a mechanism for promoting devolved rural institutions and improved governance and livelihoods. The cornerstone of CAMPFIRE is the right to manage, use, dispose of, and benefit from these resources. Between 1989 and 2006, CAMPFIRE income, mostly from high valued safari hunting, totalled nearly USD$ 30 million, of which 52% was allocated to sub-district wards and villages for community projects and household benefits. Whilst a number of assumptions underlying the success of CAMPFIRE as an innovative model for CBNRM have yet to be met, CAMPFIRE confirms the concept that devolving responsibility and accountability for natural resource management can be highly effective for the collective and participatory management of such resources. Elephant numbers in CAMPFIRE areas have increased and buffalo numbers are either stable or decreased slightly during the life of the programme. However, offtake quotas for these two species have increased with a concomitant decline in trophy quality. Although the amount of wildlife habitat diminished after 1980, following the commencement of CAMPFIRE the rate of habitat loss slowed down and in some specific instances was even reversed. More recently there has been increased pressure on habitats and other natural resources as a consequence of deteriorating socio-economic conditions in the country. Where devolution has been successful, promising results have been achieved and the recent acceptance and implementation of direct payments to communities is probably the most significant development since 2000. That this has happened can be attributed to CAMPFIRE enabling communities to maximize their roles within the existing set of rules, and by so doing, allowing these rules to be challenged. Donor (73%) and government (27%) investments into the programme amounted to $35 million during the period 1989 to 2003. Since 2003 however, donor funding has been reduced <$600,000 over the past 5 years.

AB  - The woods of yellow stringybark (Eucalyptus muelleriana) and silvertop ash (E. sieberi) are both used for the manufacture of flooring, but yellow stringybark is the preferred species because it contains fewer natural defects and dries faster and with less degrade than silvertop ash. Sometimes companies manufacturing flooring from yellow stringybark find that the wood they process contains higher levels of natural defects than expected, possibly due to the presence of silvertop ash in the wood that they receive from sawmills. It is difficult to prove this, however, because timber from both species looks similar in the rough-sawn condition and is similar anatomically. Hence, a reliable method of identifying the two species is needed. This study used canonical variate analysis to analyse linear combinations of quantitative indicators of ray anatomy in an attempt to clearly separate the wood of the two species. Canonical variate analysis scores derived from the analysis of ray height and cell number, frequency of biseriate rays and frequency of rays per square millimetre were able to completely separate 13 authentic samples of each species. This approach to separating the two species was validated using a further 16 reference specimens provided by industry (eight of each species) and 16 unknown specimens. Analysis of the reference specimens identified one specimen labelled silvertop ash that was clearly yellow stringybark, and one sample of yellow stringybark was identified as silvertop ash. Overall, however, canonical variate analysis of linear combinations of ray features produced fewer misclassifications of the two species than the use of ray parameters on their own. Canonical variate analysis shows promise as a means of more clearly separating yellow stringybark from silvertop ash and may also prove useful in separating those eucalypt wood species whose final identification in taxonomic keys depends on their ray anatomy.

AB  - Cluster analyses (R- and Q-mode) were applied to upper Quaternary coccolith assemblages in a sediment core (MD972132) collected in the Gulf of Carpentaria, northern Australia. This shallow gulf is influenced by the Australian monsoon, is tectonally stable and represents an important link between marine and terrestrial palaeoenvironments. The Gulf of Carpentaria is linked to the Pacific Ocean to the east by Torres Strait (12 m water depth) and to the Indian Ocean to the west by the Arafura Sill (53 m water depth), and therefore has been separated from both oceans during sea-level low-stands, resulting in the formation of Lake Carpentaria. Coccolith assemblages in the gulf are similar to modem assemblages in the region, and correspond to typical assemblages in marginal seas. The cluster analysis defines six species assemblages (R-mode), and six groups of samples (i.e., defined by depth in core depth; Q-mode), some with sub-groups, which were deposited under similar environmental conditions. We thus recognised, four major environmental facies over the past 125 ka, corresponding to closed Lake Carpentaria stages, the transitional periods while active channels sporadically connected Lake Carpentaria to the Indian Ocean, and the opening of the Gulf of Carpentaria to the ocean over either one, or both of the sills. Lake Carpentaria was isolated from both oceans through Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 5d, MIS 4 and MIS 2, and the Gulf of Carpentaria was connected to both oceans during MIS 5c and MIS 1. Torres Strait was emergent during MIS 5b, was flooded again during MIS 5a and persisted as land bridge from MIS 4 to MIS 1. The Arafura Sill was opened from MIS 5c to MIS 5a and episodically connected the Gulf to the Indian Ocean during MIS 3. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess spider diversity among habitats that are typically used for afforestation in Ireland, and to identify habitat parameters which could potentially be used as indicators of their biodiversity value. Ground-dwelling spiders were surveyed in 24 sites across Ireland, with eight sites of each of the following habitat types: improved grassland, wet grassland and peatland. The spiders were sampled using pitfall traps which were located within the major vegetation types present in each site as well as within supplementary habitat features which may add to biodiversity value of the whole site such as hedgerows, flushes and the edges of ditches and streams.
   Each habitat supported distinct spider assemblages that reflect major differences in both environmental conditions and management regime. The improved grasslands had low spider species richness and low variation in assemblage structure which is probably related to the intensive management of this habitat. In this case hedgerows maybe an important aspect of the spider diversity within agricultural landscapes. The peatlands, and to a lesser extent wet grasslands, supported a diverse and specialist spider fauna, including a number of rare species; this may be due to differences in soil moisture and plant architecture. Indicators of biodiversity value identified included wet flushes in the peatlands and low grazing pressure in the wet grasslands. This study suggests that in terms of biodiversity value improved grassland is the preferable habitat for afforestation, because of the poor baseline spider diversity. However, it may be unrealistic to expect land owners to afforest their most productive agricultural land, so the management and habitat indicators identified in this study may be of use for assessing habitat quality among the wet grassland and peatlands to allow sites with lower biodiversity value to be identified.

AB  - As part of a wider project on European climate change over the past 4500 years, a 4.5-m peat core was taken from a lawn microform on Mannikjarve bog, Estonia. Several methods were used to yield proxy-climate data: (i) a quadrat and leaf-count method for plant macrofossil data, (ii) testate amoebae analysis, and (iii) colorimetric determination of peat humification. These data are provided with an exceptionally high resolution and precise chronology. Changes in bog surface wetness were inferred using Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) and zonation of macrofossil data, particularly concerning the occurrence of Sphagnum balticum, and a transfer function for water-table depth for testate amoebae data. Based on the results, periods of high bog surface wetness appear to have occurred at c. 3100, 3010-2990, 2300, 1750-1610, 1510, 14 10, 1110, 540 and 3 10 cal. yr BP, during four longer periods between c. 3170 and 2850 cal. yr BP, 2450 and 2000 cal. yr BP, 1770 and 1530 cal. yr BP and in the period from 880 cal. yr BP until the present. In the period between 1770 and 1530 cal. yr BP. the extension or initiation of a hollow microtope occurred, which corresponds with other research results from Mannikjarve bog. This and other changes towards increasing bog surface wetness may be the responses to colder temperatures and the predominance of a more continental climate in the region, which favoured the development of bog microdepressions and a complex bog microtopography. Located in the border zone of oceanic and continental climatic sectors, in an area almost without land uplift, this study site may provide valuable information about changes in palaeohydrological and palaeoclimatological conditions in the northern parts of the eastern Baltic Sea region.

AB  - For osmotic adjustment to be used as a selection criterion for adaptation to drought there is a need to demonstrate its segregation and association with seed yield in a population. This study examined osmotic adjustment and seed yield in F3 lines derived from crosses between Brassica napus (cvv. Karoo, Monty) and B. juncea (line JN25). A clear separation of the level of osmotic adjustment was observed among 20 F3 lines of Karoo x JN25 (7 high and 13 low) and 20 F3 lines of Monty x JN25 (8 high and 12 low) under glasshouse conditions. When the 3 parents and 8 selected F3 lines were grown in a low-rainfall environment in the field, the segregation of osmotic adjustment was largely similar to that observed in the glasshouse. Yield reduction, with irrigated plots as controls, was up to 30% for genotypes with low osmotic adjustment but only 10% for those with high osmotic adjustment. Osmotic adjustment was closely correlated with the accumulation of K+ (r = 0.91), soluble sugars (r = 0.90) and proline (r = 0.96), whereas other solutes (Na+, NH4+, Cl-, NO3-, Mg-2(+) and Ca-2(+)) made little or no contribution to osmotic adjustment. Proline concentrations were very low in well-watered plants but sharply increased by 5- to 15-fold in plants subjected to water deficit, and net proline accumulation showed a higher association with total seed number (r = 0.86) and yield (r = 0.89) than did the concentrations of K+ (r = 0.75 to 0.82) or soluble sugars (r = 0.68 to 0.72). The study suggests that leaf proline concentration could be a good indicator of osmotic adjustment in Brassica oilseeds.

AB  - Palaeoenvironmental data, in the form of 113 counts of pollen, fungal spores and charcoal abundances, 121 counts of phytoliths and 15 AMS C-14 dates (11 macrofossil and 4 bulk sediment samples), have provided a means of reconstructing the late-Holocene environmental history of Munsa archaeological site, Uganda. The data were extracted from sediment cores from what is today a papyrus swamp, located h indicate within an area described by an outermost ring of earthworks at Munsa. Sediment core data general presence of forested conditions to C. AD 1100, although there is evidence for the local presence of food plants prior to this date. Deforestation from C. AD 1100 is marked in both the pollen and phytolith records, while fungal spores indicate the presence of increased numbers of herbivores post-deforestation. Indicators of deforestation and increased herbivore numbers broadly accord with the archaeological evidence for substantial occupation of the site at Munsa and the establishment of a mixed economy based on crops, cattle and iron working. Evidence for forest recovery and reduced herbivore numbers locally from C AD 1780 could reflect abandonment of permanent settlement at the site, possibly during or following a period of drought and/or political upheaval in the region. Fungal spores and phytoliths provide evidence of agricultural activities at Munsa that have not left an imprint on pollen records, thus supporting the case for the use of multiproxies in palaeoenvironmental research, while intercore differences between the three sediment cores analysed, although relatively minor, confirm the benefits of a multicore approach. Tentative evidence for the very early presence of Musa (cultivated edible banana) is provided and warrants further study.

AB  - The heterogeneity of oribatid communities is important factor influencing the usage of oribatids as bioindicators of environmental quality. There are indices that oribatid communities differ in the range of one locality. The aim of this study was to describe the differences and correlate them to vegetation cover on seminatural meadow near Ricany (Central Bohemia). The oribatid were sampled on seven different vegetation patches. These patches hosted 42 oribatid species and members of genus Phthiracarus, Brachychochthonius and family Oppiidae, altogether in 5505 specimens. Different vegetation patches inhabited by partly different oribatid communities can be distinguish in the condition of one seminatural meadow, though it seems to be a homogeneous biotope. The main difference showed the disturbed parts of meadow characterized by Tectocepheus velatus (Michael 1880) and Liebstadia similis (Michael 1888) and marginal zones characterized by forest inhabitant Chamobates voigtsi (Oudemans 1902), meadow inhabitant Minuthozetes semirufus (C.L. Koch 1841) and non-specific (in biotope preference) Oppia spp. The most similar were the plots in the middle of meadow with following dominant species: Scheloribates laevigatus (C.L. Koch 1836), Scheloribates latipes (C.L. Koch 1844), Ceratozetes mediocris Berlese 1908, they differ in dominace of Minuthozetes semirufus (C.L. Koch 1841). Redundancy analysis estimating effect of plant species composition on composition of mite communities was marginally significant. Given the small sample size here, this result should be taken indication that the relationship between plant and mite species community composition is really strong. The cluster of meadow species was associated to grass Festuca rubra and Poa trivialis, while Minuthozetes semirufus and Tectocepheus velatus were not. The interaction with vegetation cover confirmed previously published observation, but does not explain all variability. The rest of heterogeneity in oribatid communities should be explained by different moisture and the effect of immigration in the marginal zones.

AB  - A substantial proportion of horticultural crops is harvested and sold during the harvest season, a second portion is stored in refrigerators, when possible in controlled or modified atmosphere, to ensure a prolonged conservation, while a third portion is processed to produce peeled, chopped and packaged ready-to-eat products. To ensure food quality at the moment of marketing, agro-food researchers are looking for reliable parameters to monitor quality loss during post-harvest periods. Among the conventional indicators of quality, sugars can be conveniently analyzed by several physico-chemical or biochemical methods. Vitamins represent important nutritional quality factors in horticultural crops and the detection of ascorbate and/or beta-carotene is valuable in predicting vegetable shelf-life. The activity of enzymes, such as ascorbate oxidase, polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase also represent sensitive parameters for quality control, since protein expression strictly depends on environmental conditions. Metabolic intermediates and flavour precursors have also been studied and correlations between their modification and loss of agro-food quality have been demonstrated. Also, methods involving the evaluation of total phenolics in combination with their antioxidant capacity have been employed; alternatively, a single phenolic molecule, typical of the vegetable under study, can be detected with HPLC techniques and applied to the monitoring of refrigerated or processed vegetables. The parameters are sometimes detected in different tissues of the vegetable, rather than using the vegetable as a whole. This procedure reveals that there are consistent differences in composition regarding phenolics or sugars in different tissues of the same vegetable and that one tissue may be more prone than others to variations in the concentration of marker compounds. Continuos studies in the search for these parameters have provided useful tools for industries for the timely detection of vegetable deterioration ensuring the supply of fresh vegetables to the consumer.

AB  - 1. The nature of the signal that terminates the release of Ca2+ from the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum has remained elusive. This study was intended to examine whether FK506-binding protein (FKBP), which is tightly associated to the ryanodine receptor (RyR)/Ca2+ release channel, plays a role in the termination of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) in heart.
   2. Confocal microscopy and the Ca2+ indicator fluo-3 were used to visualize the elementary release events, i.e. 'Ca2+ sparks' in rat ventricular myocytes under resting or voltage-clamped conditions. additionally, electrophysiological single-channel recordings, at constant [Ca2+] or during [Ca2+] steps produced by photorelease of caged Ca2+, were obtained from rat cardiac RyRs incorporated in planar lipid bilayers.
   3. Inhibition of FKBP by the immunosuppressants FK506 or rapamycin increased the duration of spontaneous or depolarization-evoked Ca2+ sparks 6- to 7-fold. In addition, Ca2+ sparks were seen with two-level amplitudes, corresponding to full and half normal spark amplitude.
   4. FK506 potentiated and prolonged electrically stimulated [Ca2+](i) transients and contractions, but did not affect the amplitude and kinetics of the L-type Ca2+ channel current.
   5. In planar lipid bilayers, FK506 (15 mu M) prolonged similar to 7-fold the mean open lifetime of reconstituted single RyRs, induced the appearance of long-lasting subconductance states, and markedly slowed the spontaneous decay of RyR activity elicited by fast and sustained Ca2+ stimuli. The time constant of the spontaneous decay of activity increased from 1.8 s in control to greater than or equal to 20 s in the presence of FK506.
   6. We conclude that FKBP may afford an intrinsic mechanism to terminate RyR openings and it may thus exert a negative feedback on CICR in heart cells.

AB  - Several soils subject to different cultivation and management practices were examined by analysis of fatty acid profiles derived from phospholipids and lipopolysaccharides, using an improved sequential method which is capable of measuring ester-linked and non-ester-linked phospholipid fatty acids (EL-PLFA, NEL-PLFA, respectively) and the hydroxy fatty acids in lipopolysaccharides. A good correlation was obtained (r>0.90) between the soil biomass and total EL-PLFA in the soils investigated, which ranged from forest soils to a variety of agricultural soils. Elucidation of the composition of the community structure was an additional task. Eukaryotes can be differentiated from bacteria by the presence of polyunsaturated and omega-hydroxy fatty acids, both of which were much more abundant in the OF layer of the forest soil than in the remaining samples. A relatively low proportion of monomethyl branched-chain saturated fatty acids was obtained in the forest OF horizon, these being indicators for Gram-positive bacteria and actinomycetes. Various subclasses of proteobacteria produce beta and mid-chain hydroxy fatty acids, which occur primarily in agricultural soils. The ratios between monounsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids seem to be very useful parameters of soil environmental conditions. In addition, on the basis of the differences in composition of the NEL-PLFA and hydroxy fatty acids of lipopolysaccharides, clear indications for the community structure of various soils were obtained. In the forest soils much more abundant anaerobic micro-organisms and relatively less abundant proteobacteria were present than in the other soils. In the cultivated soils, however, the proportion of Gram-negative bacteria was considerably higher. Furthermore, eukaryotes appeared to be pre-dominant in the soils once used for a manure deposit site.

AB  - Malting barley requires sensitive methods for N status estimation during the vegetation period, as inadequate N nutrition can significantly limit yield formation, while overfertilization often leads to an increase in grain protein content above the limit for malting barley and also to excessive lodging. We hypothesized that the use of N nutrition index and N uptake combined with red-edge or green reflectance would provide extended linearity and higher accuracy in estimating N status across different years, genotypes, and densities, and the accuracy of N status estimation will be further improved by using artificial neural network based on multiple spectral reflectance wavelengths. Multifactorial field experiments on interactive effects of N nutrition, sowing density, and genotype were conducted in 2011-2013 to develop methods for estimation of N status and to reduce dependency on changing environmental conditions, genotype, or barley management. N nutrition index (NNI) and total N uptake were used to correct the effect of biomass accumulation and N dilution during plant development. We employed an artificial neural network to integrate data from multiple reflectance wavelengths and thereby eliminate the effects of such interfering factors as genotype, sowing density, and year. NNI and N uptake significantly reduced the interannual variation in relationships to vegetation indices documented for N content. The vegetation indices showing the best performance across years were mainly based on red-edge and carotenoid absorption bands. The use of an artificial neural network also significantly improved the estimation of all N status indicators, including N content. The critical reflectance wavelengths for neural network training were in spectral bands 400-490, 530-570, and 710-720 nm. In summary, combining NNI or N uptake and neural network increased the accuracy of N status estimation to up 94%, compared to less than 60% for N concentration.

TI  - Prevention of Water Inrushes in Deep Coal Mining over the Ordovician Aquifer: A Case Study in the Wutongzhuang Coal Mine of China
T2  - GEOFLUIDS
LA  - English
KW  - NUMERICAL-SIMULATION
KW  - FLOOR
AB  - Through field observation and theoretical study, we found that the Hanxing mining area has a typical ternary structure in coal mining under high water pressure of the aquifer. This ternary structure is the Ordovician limestone aquifer-aquiclude including thin limestones-coal seam. Although the aquiclude is considerably thick, there is still a great risk of water burst during mining under water pressure in the deep burial environment. Multidimensional characteristics of floor water inrush in deep mining are summarized in the paper, including water migration upwardly driven by the Ordovician confined water, the planar dispersion of the water inrush channel, the stepped increase of the water inrush intensity, the hysteretic effluent of the water inrush time and the exchange, and adsorption of the water quality. The water inrush mechanism is clarified that the permeability, dilatancy, fracturing, and ascending of the water from the Ordovician limestone aquifer form a planar and divergent flow through the transfer, storage, and transportation of thin limestone aquifers. The corresponding water inrush risk evaluation equation is also proposed. Based on the thickness of the aquiclude, the thickness of the failure zones, and the water inrush coefficient, the floor aquiclude is classified into five categories. While water inrush cannot be completely controlled by the traditional underground floor reinforcement with ultra-thick aquiclude or even zonal grouting, a comprehensive prevention and control concept of the four-dimensional floor water hazard in full time-space domain are proposed. A tridimensional prevention and control model of three-dimensional reticulated exploration, treatment, verification, and supplementation is presented. A full time domain technological quality control process of condition assessment, exploration, remediation, inspection, evaluation, monitoring, and reassurance is formed, and a water disaster prevention method with full time-space tridimensional network in deep coal mining is established. Case study in the Hanxing mining area demonstrates that the proposed methods are highly effective.

AB  - The crude oils and their source rocks from Niger Delta basin, Nigeria were investigated by optical microscopy for the maceral compositions and by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for the composition, distribution and abundances of saturated and aromatic biomarkers. The data obtained showed that the rock samples and crude oils were formed from the mixed input of terrestrial and marine organic matter, and deposited under oxic to sub-oxic conditions in a lacustrine-fluvial/deltaic environment. The aliphatic maturity parameters calculated for the source rocks and oil samples showed that they have immature to early mature; and early oil window maturity respectively, whereas aromatic maturity ratios indicated that they were within immature to peak of oil generation and beyond; and peak to late oil generative window, respectively. The crude oils and source rocks were characterized by the dominance of C-2-fluorenes over other alkylated homologues. The predominance of C-2 fluorenes over other alkylated homologues might have been influenced by source facies and depositional environments. The relative percentages of fluorenes (FLs %), dibenzofurans (DBFs %) and dibenzothiophenes (DBTs %) values for the rock samples range from 9.36 to 38.04 %, 35.82-71.60 % and 10.02-42.52 %, respectively, while the crude oils have ranges of values from 18.91 to 56.38 %, 24.90-72.34 % and 5.99-19.02 %, respectively. These values showed that the crude oils and source rocks originated from the mixture of organic matter (terrestrial and marine) with higher contribution from terrestrial organic matter and deposited in a marine/brackish-saline lacustrine/swampy environments. The abundance and distribution of fluorenes and its derivatives were found to be effective in determining the origin and depositional environments of crude oils and source rocks in the Niger Delta Basin, Nigeria.

AB  - In the present study, a novel integrated energy system comprising a multi-effect desalination unit (MED) and a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) integrated with a gas turbine (GT) is presented for power and freshwater production. Thus , SOFC fuel cell?s waste heat is exploited by a novel design of the steam generator unit to run a triple pressure steam cycle. Using MATLAB software, the performance of the proposed system is investigated from energy, exergy, economic, and environmental aspects. A parametric study is conducted to assess the influence of key parameters. Moreover, dual-and tri-objective optimizations are performed to determine the best-operating conditions considering exergy efficiency, levelized cost of energy, and normalized emission as objectives. The results indicate that the proposed integrated system can enhance the system power generation, the exergy efficiency, and the normalized emission by 6.5%, 8.42%, and 5.8%, compared to the solid oxide fuel cell integrated with a gas turbine standalone. The results also show that the proposed integration leads to daily freshwater production of 1141 m(3) at a constant value of levelized cost of energy. According to the exergy analysis, solid oxide fuel cells influence the system's overall enhancement considerably because of the highest exergy destruction value. By employing two-objective optimization, results showed that the exergy efficiency and levelized cost of energy can improve by 18.8% and 11% compared to the base case. Although normalized emission was not considered as an objective function, 16.5% improvement was observed. 3D Pareto front of three-objective optimization revealed a linear correlation between the exergy efficiency and normalized emission.

AB  - Question Which species are successful colonisers of disturbed sites; species adapted to seed dispersal, resistance to abiotic stress, or competition ability? Are successful adaptations for colonisation shared by phylogenetically related species? Location Czech Republic, Central Europe. Methods We used two indices of plant species' colonisation ability (developed from an extensive dataset of dated successional series for 1,531 plant species of the Czech Republic): index of colonisation potential (ICP), which is corrected for mass effect (species' frequency in the landscape acquired from Czech National Phytosociological Database, accounting for more common colonisation events of frequent species), and index of colonisation success (ICS), which is solely based on actual species frequencies in disturbed habitats. We also used preferences for successional age (median of age of sites that species had colonised). We correlated these indices with plant functional traits for three functional groups (woody species, non-woody perennial polycarpic, and non-woody monocarpic species) either considering the phylogenetic history of a species or not. Results Woody species were the best colonisers and had the highest preferences for late-successional stages. Non-woody monocarpic species had a higher ICP than polycarpic species while their ICS were comparable. The best predictor of colonisation ability of both monocarpic and polycarpic non-woody species was canopy height, indicating importance of competition. Other successful colonisers were species with seed traits promoting dispersal (low seed mass or low seed terminal velocity). We did not find traits suitable for adverse biotic conditions (high specific leaf area, SLA), low canopy height) to be important. Successional age preference of species was indicated mainly by seed traits (seed mass, seed longevity), which highly corresponded with species' phylogenetic history. Conclusions Colonisation of disturbed sites is limited by seed dispersal and competitive interactions rather than an adverse abiotic environment.

AB  - The neonicotinoid imidacloprid (IMI) is one of the most extensively applied neuro-active insecticides worldwide and continues to enter surface waters in many countries despite a recent ban for outdoor use in the EU. Yet little is known about ecotoxicological effects on non-target benthic freshwater species exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of IMI and its marketed products. The aim of the present study was to narrow this gap by assessing effects of pure IMI and its commercial formulation Confidor (R) on the aquatic oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus, a key species in freshwater sediments. To this end, we determined dose-response relationships in 24 h toxicity tests, bioconcentration during 24 h and 5 d of exposure to 0.1, 1 and 10 mu g IMI L-1, and physiological stress responses by measuring glutathione S-transferase, glutathione reductase and catalase activity in the same conditions. Maximum neonicotinoid concentrations reported from the field were lethal to L. variegatus within 24 h (LC50 of 65 and 88 mu g IMI L-1 in pure form and as active ingredient of Confidor (R), respectively). At sub-lethal exposure concentrations, tissue content of IMI significantly increased with exposure time. The observed bioconcentration factors (BCFs) were far above the water octanol coefficient (K-OW), indicating a potentially large underestimation of IMI bioaccumulation when based on K-OW. Activities of biotransformation and antioxidant enzymes indicated attempts of L. variegatus to counter xenobiotic-triggered oxidative stress to very low IMI and Confidor (R) concentrations. Together, our data add significantly to growing evidence that the continued proliferation of neonicotinoids require increased efforts in environmental risk assessment, especially in view of species-specific differences in sensitivities to the insecticide and possibly to additives of commercial formulations.

AB  - Posttranslational modifications of protein cysteine thiols play a significant role in redox regulation and the pathogenesis of human diseases. Herein, we report the characterization of the cellular redox landscape in terms of quantitative, site-specific occupancies of both S-glutathionylation (SSG) and total reversible thiol oxidation (total oxidation) in RAW 264.7 macrophage cells under basal conditions. The occupancies of thiol modifications for similar to 4000 cysteine sites were quantified, revealing a mean site occupancy of 4.0% for SSG and 11.9% for total oxidation, respectively. Correlations between site occupancies and structural features such as pKa, relative residue surface accessibility, and hydrophobicity were observed. Proteome-wide site occupancy analysis revealed that the average occupancies of SSG and total oxidation in specific cellular compartments correlate well with the expected redox potentials of respective organelles in macrophages, consistent with the notion of redox compartmentalization. The lowest average occupancies were observed in more reducing organelles such as the mitochondria (non-membrane) and nucleus, while the highest average occupancies were found in more oxidizing organelles such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lysosome. Furthermore, a pattern of subcellular susceptibility to redox changes was observed under oxidative stress induced by exposure to engineered metal oxide nanoparticles. Peroxisome, ER, and mitochondria (membrane) are the organelles which exhibit the most significant redox changes; while mitochondria (non-membrane) and Golgi were observed as the organelles being most resistant to oxidative stress. Finally, it was observed that Cys residues at enzymatic active sites generally had a higher level of occupancy compared to non-active Cys residues within the same proteins, suggesting site occupancy as a potential indicator of protein functional sites. The raw data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD019913.

AB  - Rill network development not only potentially affects hillslope and drainage network evolution, but also causes severe soil degradation. However, the studies on rill network development remain inconclusive. This study aimed to investigate the temporal and spatial development of hillslope rill networks and their characteristics based on rainfall simulations and field observations. A soil pan (10.0m long x 3.0m wide x 0.5m deep) on a 20 degrees slope was applied three successive simulated rains at two intensities of 50 and 100mmh(-1). The field observations were performed on two bare hillslope runoff plots (10.0m long x 3.0m wide) at 20 degrees. Three typical erosive natural rainfall events were observed in the field, and rills were measured in detail, similar to the laboratory rainfall simulation. The results indicated that with increases in rainfall events, the rill network morphology varied from incipient formation to the maximum drainage network density. Four rill network development indicators (rill distribution density, distance between rills, rill bifurcation number, and confluence point number) exhibited different changes over time and space. Among the four indicators, the rill bifurcation number was the best indicator for describing rill network development. Rill flow energy increased and decreased cyclically on a slope ranging between similar to 3 and 4m. Moreover, rill networks on loessial hillslopes generally evolved into dendritic rather than parallel forms. The development characteristics of the rill network were relatively similar between the laboratory simulation and natural field conditions. Over time, rill erosion control measures become increasingly difficult to implement as the rill network develops. The morphology of eroding rills evolved over time and space, which led to corresponding rill network development. Further study should quantify the impacts of rill network development on soil degradation and land development. (C) 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The study of psychological types' characteristics of the Arctic region inhabitants is a task of social, economic, managerial, and general cultural importance. The life and activity of such people takes place in the conditions of "impoverished living environment", the concept developed by the authors. According to it, people living in such environment differ in a number of features that define the characteristics of their psychological type, professional orientations, social needs and motivation. These features are fully reflected in the basic (archetypal) components of the personality, intuitiveness among them. As a hypothesis of the study, we adopted the position that the content of the psychological type has qualitative features that determine adaptive, socio-cultural, activity and professional characteristics of the Arctic region inhabitants. The implementation of such features is largely determined at the subconscious intuitive level.
   The purpose of the article is to identify special features of the personality psychological type in young people inhabiting the Arctic region, to determine the status values of intuitiveness in the individual, to determine the connection of intuitiveness with psychological features of their personality.
   The article presents data from experimental researches of various indicators. The authors studied the personality psychological type of young people in the Arctic region of RussiaKhanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug-Yugra, obtained using methods for assessing the level of intuitiveness of the personality by Naumenko E. A, social and psychological adaptation (SPA in the modification by A. K. Osnitsky). The quantitative analysis was performed using the SPSS Statistics 19.0 program.
   The topic of the intuitional potential of the Arctic region inhabitants has not been studied before. High indicators of intuitiveness in the subjects' personality were statistically significantly associated with indicators of adaptability, internal control and indicators of the statement. Negative intuitiveness connections are determined in indicators of emotional comfort and dominance. In the structure of the Arctic youth psychological type, the values of intuitiveness are presented as a positive trend.

AB  - The present study compared different approaches to assessing the environmental cost-effectiveness of energy policy scenarios. As a case study, the megacity of Tehran in Iran was studied. A key policy challenge in this city is to curb high concentrations of PM2.5 and mitigate the associated adverse impacts. The results demonstrated that in the business as usual case, the spatially averaged primary and secondary PM2.5 concentration in Tehran will increase by 30% in the 2010-2030 period. Adopting certain planned policy scenarios and the corresponding pollutant concentration reductions in Tehran shows that although most of the emission comes from industrial activities around the city, the distribution of the transportation emission sources may play the most effective role in decreasing pollution levels in transport-related energy policies. Next, based on environmental damage costs and abatement costs in different pollution mitigation scenarios, the best (most environmentally costeffective) scenarios were evaluated. The eco-efficiencies of the energy policies were assessed based on two proxies of environmental impacts: the reduced damage cost as a function of the reduced emission rates of the pollutants and the decreased number of polluted days in the year. In a sample area in which the simulated concentrations were verified by local measurements, the most efficient mitigation scenario would decrease the average concentration of PM2.5 by 35% in 2030 and the number of polluted days by 20%. These findings indicate how far the linear functionality of the damage cost from emission levels may mislead environmental impact assessments. This is due to neglecting the source distribution effects and geographical conditions of the environment. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The article gives an overview of modern opinions about the ways of possible contamination of milk and dairy products by mycotoxyn. The key indicator of the presence of mycotoxins in milk and dairy products is the level to which micromycetes affect productive livestock's feed. Yet, mycromycetes and mycotoxines do not always occur together: some test samples can contain certain micromycetes, but no mycotoxines. Mycotoxines are synthesised by micromycetes only under certain favourable conditions. The multi-chambered stomach ecosystem of lactating cows utilises most mycotoxins occurring in food. Only a small amount of those is excreted in milk. However, some mycotoxins can bind to milk caseins. In this case, cheese and other dairy products can contain far higher amounts of mycotoxins than at the initial stage of milk production. The paper compares the maximum permissible levels of mycotoxins in milk and in dairy products according to the regulations of Ukraine and the EU. It presents the mycotoxins isolated from secretions of mammary glands of humans and productive animals, and describes their effect on the body's physiology. It also provides a structural diagram of how mycotoxins contaminate milk and dairy products following the path "Animal feed - dairy products." We suggest four-stage assessment of the risks of mycotoxin contamination of milk and dairy products: Stage I - identifying the producer of mycotoxin (molecule, metabolites in feed, milk, and dairy products). Anamnesis; Stage II - constructing a sequence diagram. Inspecting all production stages to identify the main ways and periods of contamination, determining and describing the symptoms of contamination; Stage III - assessing how the intensity and duration of exposure to a mycotoxin and its metabolites are likely to effect on the body. Modelling the influence of mycotoxins on the body; Stage IV - assessing the risk and determining measures to eliminate or minimise it. Risk scenario forecast.

AB  - Elephants experience a number of health issues that can contribute to their well-being and survival. In managed populations, housing conditions and management practices can influence individual health, so potential risk factors associated with morbidity or mortality should be identified to ensure the best possible standards of care. The goal of this study was to determine if the number of clinical events experienced could be a useful welfare indicator in zoo elephants, and to determine factors associated with key pathologies. We used an epidemiological approach to investigate how intrinsic (species, sex, age) and extrinsic (housing, management) factors were associated with both the total number of clinical events, and each of the four most prevalent pathology types (gastrointestinal issues, skin lesions, lameness, foot lesions), over a 12-month period. The study included 220 (127 African; 93 Asian) elephants housed at 61 facilities across North America. More than 1100 clinical events were identified. Species and sex differences were apparent in the types of pathology encountered, and unsurprisingly, the number of clinical events was positively correlated with age. Factors relating to housing (percent time with indoor/outdoor choice, space experience inside, number of unique environments an elephant was housed in, percent time on soft substrate) and management (enrichment diversity, spread of feeding opportunities) were also related to the number of clinical events. However, relationships were often counter to our initial hypotheses, highlighting caution in assuming cause and effect from correlational analyses such as these. Other welfare indicators such as serum and fecal glucocorticoids and serum prolactin were also associated with health status, being higher or more variable in individuals with a greater number of events. This approach provides insight into housing and management factors related to the health of these species in zoos, and in some cases, may reflect management changes that have already been made to mitigate existing or anticipated health concerns.

AB  - A healthy community is a community resilient to disaster. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction considers disaster impacts on health and encourages the implementation of disaster medicine and access to mental health services. Life expectancy (LE) is a basic statistic that indicates public health achievements and social development, including the health system, infrastructure, and accurate vital statistics. Thus, we hypothesized that LE corelates with disaster risk and strategies to achieve long LE can help achieving disaster risk reduction. We compared the disaster risk obtained from Index for Risk Management (INFORM) with the LE of both genders at birth to identify which component of INFORM risk correlates with LE. A correlation analysis revealed that overall INFORM risk negatively correlated with LE. The natural hazard category did not correlate with LE, but the human hazard category, vulnerability, and lack of coping capacity negatively correlated with LE. In the vulnerability dimension, indicators of socioeconomic vulnerability, health conditions, and children U5 negatively correlated with LE. In the lack of coping capacity dimension, indicators of communication, physical infrastructure, and access to health care negatively correlated with LE. Japan has achieved the longest LE and a low INFORM risk because of its lower vulnerability and reduced lack of coping capacity, including healthrelated indicators. In a cluster analysis of LE and INFORM categories of risk, we divided countries into four clusters and found categories that could be improved. Comparedwith another global disaster risk index, the Word Risk Index (WRI), the INFORM risk index seems to represent the overall disaster risk better, though they have different aspects of risk evaluation. The WRI is also negatively correlated with LE, supporting our hypothesis. In conclusion, LE is an important indicator of disaster risk and strategies to achieve long LE can be effective and important strategies in disaster risk reduction.

KW  - MATTER
AB  - The search for oil and gas in the Nigerian inland basins and efficacy of the unconventional oil shale in hydrocarbon generation have necessitated the palynofacies characterization, thermal maturation and source rock evaluation of the Imo Formation, updip Niger Delta basin to determine its palynofacies constituents and oil shale potential. The standard acid maceration technique, palynofacies description as well as palynomorph colour index chart systematically compared to thermal alteration index and vitrinite reflectance index values were utilized for the study.
   The palynofacies components of the Imo Formation is dominant of yellow and brown amorphous organic matter, marine taxa, opaque particles, with few dark brown structured phytoclasts and terrestrial microflora. The source rock content is interpreted as Kerogen Type II - oil prone with abundant marine palynomorphs, amorphous organic matter and few terrestrial microfossils. The spore/pollen colour of the strata is light brown signifying mature and oil generation zone. This correlates to thermal alteration index (TAI) 2+ to 3 and vitrinite reflectance index (%R-0) values of 0.5% to 1.0%.
   The abundance of the amorphous organic matter of marine origin suggests good source rock which indicates good oil shale prospects. The oil shale prospects of the Imo Formation in the study area are hindered by the low abundance of the palynofacies associations. Field evidence indicate that the grey to slightly light grey shales in hand specimen, as against black carbonaceous shales rich in organic matter suggests that the environmental conditions affected the quality of the organic kerogen. The oil yields may be compensated by the great volume of marine shale deposited in the formation and the abundance of amorphous organic matter of marine origin which is known to be an excellent indicator of oil. The palynofacies model enhances the understanding of palynofacies events and oil shale quality which can be tied to the development of unconventional oil shale, oil fields and subsequent exploration drive in the area.

AB  - The change in temperature regimes during the beef cattle rearing has a complex effect on the body, including the morphological and biochemical composition of blood, serving as indicators of the general physiological status of animal. The aim of the research was the adaptive flexibility assessment based on the seasonal variability of haemotological parameters in Kalmyk bulls of different zonal types. Studies of morphological and biochemical composition of blood were carried out in different temperature seasons (autumn, winter, spring) in Kalmyk bulls of 2 zonal types: "Aita" (Republic of Kalmykia) and "Voznesenovsky" (Stavropol Territory). The heredity of young animals have not a significant impact on the variability of blood parameters. The seasonal changing of temperature regime significantly (P<0.05) determined the variability of erythrocytes, haemoglobin and leucocytes. The maximum content of red and white blood cells were observed in the cold period of the year (winter). The effect of rearing season had no significant effect (P>0.05) on the variability of the total protein in blood serum. The content of albumin fraction was more determined by the seasonal changing of the year (P<0.05). In winter, there was a minimum concentration of albumin in blood serum. The variability of globulin fraction was inversely directed in comparison with albumin content. A significant effect (P<0.01) of the season was established in aspartate aminotransferase activity in the blood serum of bull-calves. The highest level was observed in spring period, the minimum was recorded in winter. The activity of alanine aminotransferase is poorlydetermined by both genotype and environmental conditions. All changes in composition of blood were within physiological ranges for cattle. The results indicate a good adaptive flexibility of Kalmyk bulls of different genotypes.

AB  - Bio-based and bio-degradable plastics such as polybutylene succinate (PBS) have the potential to become sustainable alternatives to petrochemical-based plastics. Polybutylene succinate can be produced from bio-based succinic acid and 1,4-butanediol using first-generation (1G) or second-generation (2G) sugars. A cradle-to-grave environmental assessment was performed for PBS products in Europe to investigate the non-renewable energy use (NREU) and greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts. The products investigated are single-use trays and agricultural film, with incineration, industrial composting and degradation on agricultural land as end-of-life scenarios. Both end products manufactured from fully bio-based PBS and from partly bio-based PBS (made from bio-based succinic acid and fossil fuel-based 1,4 butanediol) were analysed. We examine corn (1G) as well as corn stover, wheat straw, miscanthus and hardwood as 2G feedstocks. For the cradle-to-grave system, 1G fully bio-based PBS plastic products were found to have environmental impacts comparable with their petrochemical incumbents, while 2G fully bio-based PBS plastic products allow to reduce NREU and GHG by around one third under the condition of avoidance of concentration of sugars and energy integration of the pretreatment process with monomer production. Without energy integration and with concentration of sugars (i.e., separate production), the impacts of 2G fully bio-based PBS products are approximately 15-20% lower than those of 1G fully bio-based PBS products.

AB  - The fluctuation of temperature affects many physiological responses in ectothermic organisms, including feed intake, growth, reproduction, and behavior. Changes in environmental temperatures affect the acquisition of energy, whereas hepatic glycogen plays a central role in energy supply for the homeostasis of the entire body. Glycogen phosphorylase (GP), which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in glycogenolysis, is also an indicator of environmental stress. Here, we examined the effects of salinity on glycogen metabolism in milkfish livers under cold stress. A reduction of feed intake was observed in both freshwater (FW) and seawater (SW) milkfish under cold adaptation. At normal temperature (28 degrees C), compared to the FW milkfish, the SW milkfish exhibited greater mRNA abundance of the liver isoform of GP (Ccpygl), higher GP activity, and less glycogen content in the livers. Upon hypothermal (18 degrees C) stress, hepatic Ccpygl mRNA expression of FW milkfish surged at 3 h, declined at 6 and 12 h, increased again at 24 h, and increased significantly after 96 h. Increases in GP protein, GP activity, and the phosphorylation state and the breakdown of glycogen were also found in FW milkfish livers after 12 h of exposure at 18 degrees C .Conversely, the Ccpygl transcript levels in SW milkfish were downregulated after 1 h of exposure at 18 degrees C, whereas the protein abundance of GP, GP activity, and glycogen content were not significantly altered. Taken together, under 18 degrees C cold stress, FW milkfish exhibited an acute response with the breakdown of hepatic glycogen for maintaining energy homeostasis of the entire body, whereas no change was observed in the hepatic glycogen content and GP activity of SW milkfish because of their greater tolerance to cold conditions.

AB  - Environmental pollution by heavy metals is a major problem worldwide. Domesticated animals such as cattle and camel share the same environmental conditions like human and they are exposed to heavy metals via different sources. Therefore, these animals are considered as ideal bio-indicators for human exposure to heavy metals. Heavy metals accumulate in the different tissues of the animals. Estimation of toxic metal residues such as arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) in the animal edible tissues had been extensively studied. However, estimation of such toxicants in the non-edible animal byproducts had received little attention. Additionally, non-edible animal byproducts are frequently used in many industries such as animal feed additives and leather fabrication. Therefore, this study was undertaken to estimate the residual concentrations of As, Hg, Pb and Cd in the hair, hides and bones of cattle and camel slaughtered at Zagazig, Abo-Hammad and Belbies cities, Sharkia Governorate, Egypt. Metal-metal correlations were additionally calculated. The achieved results indicated exposure of cattle and camel to high levels of heavy metals, particularly lead and arsenic. Camel had higher concentrations (mg/kg ww) of arsenic compared with cattle particularly in hair (38.57 +/- 8.77 and 22.48 +/- 1.91 in camel and cattle, respectively). Bone had the highest load of the measured metals among examined samples. For instances, in camel, elemental concentrations (mg/kg ww) in bone were 34.53 +/- 6.16 (As), 3.41 +/- 0.56 (Hg), 2.76 +/- 0.36 (Pb) and 0.11 +/- 0.01 (Cd). Samples collected from Zagazig city were highly contaminated compared with other locations. Significant positive correlations were observed between lead - mercury, lead - cadmium and arsenic- mercury (r < 0.0001 in each). Contaminated non-edible animal byproducts should be hygienically disposed and avoid its introduction to downstream industries. It is highly recommended to control environmental pollution with heavy metals in Egypt.

AB  - The lower part of the Han River, which flows through Seoul, Korea, experienced excessive toxic cyanobac-terial growth in 2015. Modeling of algal bloom occurrence patterns in the lower part of this river was performed using the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC) to understand algal dynamics and thus better develop management alternatives. For a 71 km long river section, 1175 horizontal 2-D grid elements were developed. This grid system was determined adequate, as the maximum values of the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition and orthogonality deviation were 0.5 and 20.1, respectively. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) was chosen as the primary indicator for the likelihood of algal blooms. Calibration and verification of EFDC were performed by comparing the model results to three years of field data collected from 2013 to 2015. Calibration accuracy was verified not only for physical variables, including the mean water level and temperature, but also for other water quality variables in various locations of the study area. To improve the prediction accuracy of Chl-a, three dominant groups of algae were considered: diatoms, green algae, and cyanobacteria. The optimum growth temperature ranges were selected based on field data for the study area. It was found necessary to apply different maximum growth rates for algal groups for the upstream and downstream regions of the study area to appropriately reflect field observations. This result indicates that more than three algal groups need to be included to improve Chl-a calibration accuracy for the study area, yet the current EFDC model can consider only up to three phy-toplankton groups. Although this problem could be overcome by assigning different maximum growth rates for different regions, it may be necessary to improve EFDC so that it can include more phytoplankton groups.

AB  - Coastal areas are exposed to many hazardous events often exacerbeted by the sea-level rise with its related effects. The knowledge of vulnerability make possible to plan the actions aimed at reducing the risk and promoting the development of a resilient community. In this frame, the evaluation of potential vulnerability of coastal area only due to the human presence is the topic of the geo-spatial model proposed in this work. At this aim, a dataset of urban areas and population of last 200 years was used to assess the trend of these two factors and four vulnerability indices: urban density, population density, occupied buildings density and buildings surplus. The urban density and population density indices communicate the human pressure due to the presence of men while occupied buildings density and buildings surplus indices identify the zones where accommodation measures, as land use changes, could be applied to improve the coastal system adaptive capacity. This model was implemented at both municipality and censual administrative unit scales and it is well transferable to other areas exposed to hazard, allowing a comparison among regions. The method was applied to the case study of Volturno coastal plain (VCP), located in the north-western zone of Campania Plain (Southern Italy): indeed, the exposure to many natural hazards (coastal erosion, marine inundation, subsidence, salt water intrusion) coupled with the intense urbanization make the VCP a good test area to validate the methodology here proposed. The model evidenced a low constant value of population growth and the achievement of a sill for the urban development after the nineties, moreover the greatest part of censual districts close to the VCP shoreline have a high percentage of total unoccupied buildings. These conditions make concrete the possibility to change the land use from urban to natural land for wide coastal sectors.

AB  - Study region: The Guarani Aquifer System (GAS), Sao Paulo State, Brazil, an important freshwater resource regionally and part of a giant, transboundary system.
   Study focus: Groundwaters have been sampled along a transect. Based on environmental tracers (REEs, Br, B, delta B-11, Sr, Sr-87/Sr-86) aquifer vulnerability and sustainability issues are identified.
   New hydrological insights for the region: For sites near to aquifer outcrop, REE and Sr signatures (and relatively light delta C-13) trace possible vertical recharge from flood basalts directly overlying the GAS. This highlights aquifer vulnerability where confined by fewer basalts and/or having cross-cutting fractures. C-14 activities for these waters, however, suggest the impact of this recharge is significantly delayed in reaching the GAS. Anthropogenic sources for boron are not currently encountered; delta B-11 highlights feldspar dissolution, isotopically lighter signatures in the deepest sampled GAS waters resulting from pH/hydrochemical speciation changes down-gradient. Br/Cl signatures (and heavier delta O-18, delta H-2) in these latter samples appear to reflect a past climatic signature emplaced under more arid conditions; carbon isotope systematics (delta C-13, C-14) support that these represent fossil waters, and care must be taken in their water resources management in regard to sustainability of abstraction. delta O-18, delta S-34 (sulfate) signatures confirm hydrological arguments that waters leak out of the base of the GAS aquifer in this locality rather than underlying formations with poorer water quality potentially mixing in, although other deep GAS waters in the region do show this inter-aquifer mixing.

AB  - Due to the intensive management of the scimitar-horned oryx, Oryx dammah, involving both captivity and reintroductions, understanding the stress associated with environmental situations this endangered species might experience would be particularly helpful. Fecal cortisol levels were measured across seasons, between captive management programs, and among varying reproductive states in animals held at Fossil Rim Wildlife Center (FRWC) and Kansas City Zoo (KCZ). A total of 72 samples were collected from FRWC and 69 samples were collected from KCZ. The herd size and sex ratio changed for both locations in the middle of sampling due to translocations and birth. The herd sizes ranged from 25 to 28 individuals at FRWC and 22 to 24 individuals at KCZ. An ELISA was optimized and utilized to investigate fecal cortisol variances across seasons, captive management programs, and among varying reproductive states. Fecal cortisol levels ranged from 68.9 to 668.7 pg/g throughout this study, but key differences were found in response to reproductive status, environmental conditions, and social status. The highest level of fecal cortisol measured (668.7 pg/g) was in a pregnant female 9 days prior to parturition. During winter months, an increase in fecal cortisol levels occurred in both herds (FRWC 160.3 pg/g to 335.1 pg/g and KCZ 118.8 pg/g to 505.0 pg/g). In addition, when intact males were held together in an enclosure, the dominant males had lower fecal cortisol levels compared with submissive males during three of the four sampling periods. Understanding how these data relate to the physiologic stress response will require further study, but these results can be utilized to help establish expected fecal cortisol ranges in multiple environments and can aid current captive scimitar-horned oryx management programs, as well as future reintroduction efforts.

AB  - Knowledge of the moisture variation is essential for water resources management and policy making, especially for the arid regions, where the water resources can hardly meet the demand of the human being and the ecosystem. Hexi Corridor in northwest China is in a typical arid area with little precipitation and high evaporation. A lot of tree-ring studies were conducted in this area; however, no long-term and large-scale moisture history research had been conducted in this region until now, due to the lack of long-time tree-ring records in eastern and western Qilian Mountains. Here, we synthesized the moisture evolution of nearly one millennium (AD 1161-2006) in this region by using four published moisture- sensitive tree-ring records, including two recently published millennium reconstructions in eastern and western Hexi Corridor. The comparisons of tree-ring records from the eastern, central and western part of Qilian Mountains show that all the reconstructions are statistically similar to each other. The principal component analysis was applied to extract the common signal recorded by these series. The first principal component (PC1), which expressed 61.1% of the total variance, was used as an indicator of regional moisture variations. The PC1 suggests that the Hexi Corridor has alternated between contrasting climatic conditions, with dry periods at AD1161-1216, 1260-1349, 1409-1417, 1443-1510, 1617-1737, 1759-1838 and 1929-1948, wet periods at AD1217-1259, 1350-1408, 1418-1442, 1511-1616, 1738-1758, 1839-1928 and 1949-2006. The droughts and pluvial periods identified in the Hexi Corridor are generally consistent with those in nearby regions recorded by tree-ring and other proxies. We also find that droughts periods in the Hexi Corridor trend to coincide with the solar minimum, highlighting the importance of solar variability on forcing regional moisture variability.

AB  - Structural health monitoring (SHM) technique is increasingly used in civil engineering structures, with which the authentic environmental and structural response data can be obtained directly. To get accurate structural condition assessment and damage detection, it is important to make sure the monitoring system is robust and the sensors are functioning properly. When sensor fault occurs, data cannot be correctly acquired at the faulty sensor(s). In such situations, approaches are needed to help reconstruct the missing data. This paper presents an investigation on wind pressure monitoring of a super-tall structure of 600 m high during a strong typhoon, aiming to compare the performance of data reconstruction using two different neural network (NN) techniques: back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN). The early stopping technique and the Bayesian regularization technique are introduced to enhance the generalization capability of the BPNN. The field monitoring data of wind pressure collected during the typhoon are used to formulate the models. In the verification, wind pressure time series at faulty sensor location are reconstructed by using the monitoring data acquired at the adjacent sensor locations. It is found that the NN models perform satisfactorily in reconstructing the missing data, among which the BPNN model adopting Bayesian regularization (BR-BPNN) performs best. The reconstructed wind pressure dataset has maximum root mean square error about 23.4 Pa and minimum correlation coefficient about 0.81 in reference to the field monitoring data. It is also shown that the reconstruction capability of the NN models decreases as the faulty sensor location moves from center to corner of the sensor array. While the BR-BPNN model performs best in reconstructing the missing data, it takes the longest computational time in model formulation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Brazil plans to construct many new hydroelectric dams in the Amazon region. The new conditions of flooding promoted by reservoirs can alter photosynthetic processes, and the study of physiological responses of trees can be used for selected suitable species to reforest these altered areas. The present study analyzed changes in pigment content and photosynthetic performance in flood-tolerant and flood-intolerant species that are common in the floodplains along the Uatum (a) over tilde River and on islands in the reservoir of the Balbina Hydroelectric Dam. Their photosynthetic responses were tested using chloroplast pigment content and chlorophyll a fluorescence. Flooding caused a significant reduction in pigment content in all of the three flood-intolerant species and in one of the seven flood-tolerant species studied. Flood-tolerant species were unaffected and neither a change in their chlorophyll contents nor a decrease in the efficiency of energy use in the photosynthetic process was observed. From chlorophyll a fluorescence transients (OJIP transients) was calculated the performance index (PIABS), a parameter derived from the OJIP transient by means of the JIP-test (translation of original fluorescence measurements into biophysical expressions quantifying the stepwise flow of energy through photosystem II). This parameter was a very sensitive indicator of the physiological status of trees under field and was shown to be a particularly sensitive indicator of stress tolerance in flood-intolerant species during inundation, whereas flood-tolerant species had only minor reductions in their photosynthetic performance. We suggest that tree species selection for reforestation around reservoirs can benefit from species-specific measurements of photosynthetic response using the JIP-test.

AB  - Mid-water pair trawling (PTM) targeting small pelagic resources represents a key fishing activity in the Adriatic Sea. This fishery is experiencing a long period of crisis due to resource depletion and the lack of appropriate market strategies, and vessels spend most of the time searching for fishing schools. The searching strategy largely depends on the interaction between vessels: the captains of the PTM units take their decision also checking the position and the fishing status of other vessels. Understanding this strategy represents a key step towards a more effective resource management, since strategies directly determine the pattern of fishing effort. A Conditional Logit model has been devised to analyze fishermen's strategy as a non-cooperative game. This category of games is characterized by the existence of (at least) one equilibrium point - a Nash Equilibrium - in which each player plays his strategy, that is a Best Response to the strategies of the other players. This equilibrium point was estimated for the different scenarios defined by environmental (sea surface temperature and atmospheric pressure) and economic (fuel and fish prices at market) variables. Vessel Monitoring System data were used to capture fleet activity, while different datasets were collected to reconstruct environmental and economic drivers. Results indicate a good predictive power of the model, and suggest that the equilibrium strategy that guides units' behaviour is invariant with respect to environmental conditions, whereas it is largely influenced by economic factors. These latter, via strategies, may determine important consequences on the resources in terms of exploited areas and the impact of fishing activity. In particular, a low fuel price when fish price is high leads to higher values of CPUE, and then to a more efficient but also impacting fishing activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Defining the balance between socio-economical and bio-physical aspects in order to promote sustainable development in agriculture is a fundamental challenge for researchers. The aim of this study is to assist in constructing a science of sustainability in agriculture and to assess sustainability in various types of agroecosystem managements characterized by different agricultural and rural developments. This study evaluates sustainability on Terceira Island (Portugal) and in the Province of Viterbo (Italy) by using selected agroecosystem sustainability indicators capable of achieving an energetic and monetary input/output analysis. Overall, results showed two rural and agricultural realities that outline two different responses to world market demand, which are partly due to specific rural histories. In terms of energy supply, Terceira and Viterbo dairy farms use the same amount of input but in monetary terms the level of input is more than double in Viterbo ((sic)1651 ha(-1) versus (sic)616ha(-1)) which is due to the lower cost of direct energy (e. g., fuel) on the island. The use of direct energy input (fuel, electricity and lubricants) on the farms in Viterbo decreases in mixed farm systems and is at its minimum on dairy farms. On the other hand, the use of indirect energy input (fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, seeds and feedstuffs) is greater on Terceira farms compared with those in Viterbo (0.76 versus 0.60, respectively). Generally speaking, the crops grown on Terceira are not diversified and this has caused environmental issues on the island due to the milk production that is mainly exported. In Europe, more intellectual and financial resources for measuring and monitoring sustainability conditions in agriculture are necessary, in order to appropriately inform decision makers at both institutional and individual level.

AB  - The Miocene-Pliocene Manzanilla Formation of northern Trinidad marks the arrival of the east-west flowing Orinoco River. Foraminifera were examined quantitatively in samples obtained at similar to 5 m intervals from the lowest member of the formation, the San Jose Calcareous Silt Member, where exposed at eastern Manzanilla Bay and Point Noir. Recovery of Globorotalia merotumida indicates an age within the Globorotalia acostaensis Zone through Globorotalia margaritae evoluta Subzone, (N16-N19). Values of the information function (H) and the percentage of the total assemblage as planktonic foraminifera (%P), both traditionally used as palaeodepth indicators, were uncorrelated. The low values of H are indicative of freshwater influence. Cluster analysis revealed two major biofacies dominated by Pseudononion atlanticum and Hanzawaia carstensi respectively, for which similar values of mean H and mean %P suggest similar, inner to middle neritic palaeodepths, the P. atlanticum Biofacies indicating times of hypoxia. Entrained within these were rarer samples from a biofacies indicative of shallowing and increased freshwater input (Ammonia parkinsonia gr. Biofacies). An Amphistegina gibbosa Biofacies marked an interval in which water because sufficiently clear to support foraminifera symbiotic with algae, while a sample containing only Haplophragmoides wilberti was indicative of intertidal conditions. Some samples containing reddened foraminifera showed that deposition occasionally became very slow, but these were not limited to any one biofacies. The range of palaeodepths in which the San Jose Calcareous Silt Member was deposited is far less than in the underlying Brasso Formation, indicating that tectonic induction of transgressive-regressive cycles was slighter during San Jose times.

AB  - An interdisciplinary study (cartographic and historical records, geomorphological, geological and bathymetric survey, water analysis, sediment coring and analysis and AMS radiocarbon dating) of two small and previously unreported lakes (Iezer and Bolatau) in Obcina Feredeului Mountains, northeastern Romania, provides new data into the environmental history and possible human impacts over the last millennium in this region. The first recorded historical reference to Iezer Lake dates to 1594 AD, and to Bolatau Lake to 1806 AD. Two sediment cores (420 cm for Iezer and 540 cm for Bolatau) of finely banded lake sediments and a radiocarbon age estimate at Iezer Lake suggest that this lake may represent the oldest landslide lake in Romania. The geomorphological, geological, and morphometric surveys indicate that these lakes' origins relate to landslide activity. Coarse grained, lighter sediment bands are generally characterized by higher values in magnetic susceptibility, Saturation Isothermal Remanent Magnetisation (SIRM), as well in geochemical indicators such as Ti and Zr, and low organic content, possibly indicating periods of increased runoff. Conversely, finer-grained, dark sediment bands show lower values in magnetic susceptibility, SIRM, Ti and Zr and higher organic content, and are likely to suggest quieter deposition periods. However, there are two significant episodes of markedly increased surface erosion. The oldest occurs between 100 and 110 cm, and might be coincident with the terminal part of Little Ice Age (LIA), whereas the youngest in the top 30 cm coincides with recent land use. These lakes hold significant potential in providing an important perspective on the environmental conditions over the last millennium and, more specifically, to supply new information about the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) and LIA signals in the NE Romanian Carpathians. These two landslide-dammed lakes should be defined as scientific reserves to ensure their protection and to enhance their use as a scientific and educational resource.

AB  - The genetically modified (GM) maize MON 88017 facilitates weed management owing to its tolerance to glyphosate, and resists western corn rootworm (WCR), Diabrotica virgifera virgifera, owing to the expression of Cry3Bb1 toxin. MON 88017 could therefore contribute to the solution of two major problems of European agriculture: continuous WCR spreading and high use of herbicides. To assess possible unwanted environmental impacts of MON 88017, we compared communities of spiders in plots planted in three successive years with this maize, its near isogenic non-GM cultivar treated or not treated with an insecticide and two unrelated maize cultivars. Each of the five treatments was applied on five 0.5 ha plots in a 14 ha field. Spiders were collected in five pitfall traps per plot five times per year. Upon reaching the waxy ripening stage, all plants of first-year cultivation were shredded to small pieces and ploughed into the soil in the respective plot, whereas in the 2nd and 3rd year the harvest was used for biogas production and only digestate was returned to the field. Out of 79 spider species, Pardosa agrestis, Pachygnatha degeeri and Oedothorax apicatus made up 28%, 25% and 23% of the total spider count in the 1st year of study; 2%, 8% and 84% in the 2nd; and 40%, 8% and 35% in the 3rd year. Statistical analysis did not reveal any influence of GM maize on the spider abundance and biodiversity. The abundance, and in two years also the species diversity, was insignificantly higher on the plots with GM maize than on plots with the insecticide-treated non-GM maize. The composition and size of spider community varied year to year, probably reflecting weather conditions and differences in field fertilization with organic matter.

AB  - The safety assessment of structures subjected to near-field blast-induced ground excitations has been performed by using Operational Modal Analysis. A reinforced concrete building, a masonry building, a reinforced concrete highway bridge, and a masonry arch bridge have selected for the safety evaluation. The study consists of five phases: measurement of vibration characteristics of blasting, analytical modal analysis of inspected structures, determining experimental dynamic characteristics using Operational Modal Analyses, finite element model updating, and nonlinear dynamic analysis. The vibration characteristics and ground excitations of blasting have been measured around the inspected building on hard soil using geophone set. The initial analytical model of the structures has been constituted according to the project data and in-situ investigations on structures. Analytical frequencies and mode shapes have been attained using ANSYS finite element program. Operational Modal Analysis Method has been used to determine the dynamic characteristics experimentally and blast vibrations are taken into account as environmental vibrations. The dynamic characteristics have been extracted from the collected signals using Enhanced Frequency Domain Decomposition (EFDD) technique. The analytical and experimental results have been compared with each other and finite element models of the structures have been updated using some uncertain parameters (such as material properties and boundary conditions) to reduce the differences. Nonlinear dynamic analyses of structures under near-field blast-induced ground excitations have been carried out using the updated finite element models. The Drucker-Prager criterion has been considered in the nonlinear analyses. It can be said that the Operational Modal Analyses method can be safely used to determine experimental dynamic characteristics of structures under near-field blast-induced ground excitations. Also, it is recommended that finite element model updating procedure must be considered for the damage assessment of the engineering structures. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Changes in the near-surface soil freeze-thaw cycle on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) were detected using daily soil freeze/thaw states derived from Special Sensor Microwave/Imager data from 1988 to 2007. Linear trends in freeze and thaw dates, the number of total frozen days of each pixel, and the numbers of monthly and yearly frozen days averaged over the whole QTP were analyzed. Principal component analysis was used to investigate the spatial variation in the freeze-thaw cycle. The results show that on the QTP there was a trend toward earlier onset date of soil thaw by approximately 14 days, and later onset date of soil freeze by approximately 10 days over the period 1988-2007. The number of frozen days has decreased over the QTP by 16.8 days per decade. This decrease in the number of frozen days has occurred mainly from April to September, with a more pronounced trend in warmer months. The most significant changes were in the northeastern and southwestern QTP, where discontinuous permafrost, island permafrost, and seasonally frozen ground are presented. The northwestern QTP had almost no change, where permafrost is cold and stable. The trend in the near-surface soil freeze-thaw cycle is positively related with climate warming on the QTP. Much warmer winters may account for significantly earlier thawing, later freezing, and a substantial reduction in the number of frozen days on the QTP. These changes in the near-surface soil freeze-thaw cycle can be used both as an effective indicator of the permafrost change and for mapping of permafrost stability.

AB  - MALACOLOGICAL SUCCESSIONS FROM GLACIAL/INTERGLACIAL TRANSITIONS: THE LATE:GLACIAL-EARLY HOLOCENE MODEL COMPARED TO PLEISTOCENE CLIMATIC SWITCHES The study of Quaternary malacological successions in Northern France has been mainly undertaken on alluvial deposits (silt sequences and calcareous tufas). Thanks to this morphostratigraphical homogeneity, data appear consistent and allow comparisons through time and space avoiding possible discrepancies due to local variations. Recently malacological records from thick Pleistocene sequences have provided information on the development of this bioindicator during transitional phases from glacial to interglacial climatic conditions. Comparing these data to Lateglacial- Early Holocene malacological successions allows detailed interpretation of Pleistocene environmental and climatic contexts. During transitional climatic phases, the steps of malacological recolonisation show common features between different Quaternary periods that are related to the occurrence of taxa as well as to biotope successions. Specific malacological characteristics are correlated with climatic phases and vegetation evolution. The Caours sequence which covers the MIS 6 to MIS 5 transition yields a malacological succession very close to assemblages recovered from Younger Dryas and Boreal deposits. The malacological succession highlights a gap in sediment accumulation corresponding to environments of early Interglacial phases such as registered during the Preborcal period. Conversely, at La Celle dated from MIS 11, malacofaunas report a progressive environmental development from open ground areas to forest biotopcs. In the Lateglacial-Early Holocene model this succession can be ascribed to a Bolling/Preboreal/Boreal environmental series which suggests a regular development of the vegetation cover without any noteworthy interruption. The successive occurrence of Discus ruderaius and Discus rotundatus is observed at both Caours and La Celle. This is compared to the appearance of these species within Early Holocene sequences and allows us to accurately identify the replacement of pioneer open forest by deciduous forest within both Pleistocene tufas.

AB  - Adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), a mitochondria( protein that facilitates the exchange of ADP and ATP across the mitochondrial inner membrane, plays an essential role in cellular energy metabolism. Human ANT presents four isoforms (ANT1-4), each with a specific expression depending on the nature of the tissue, cell type, developmental stage and status of cell proliferation. Thus, ANTI is specific to muscle and brain tissues; ANT2 occurs mainly in proliferative, undifferentiated cells; ANT3 is ubiquitous; and ANT4 is found in germ cells. ANT1 and ANT3 export the ATP produced by oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) from the mitochondria into the cytosol while importing ADP. In contrast, the expression of ANT2, which is linked to the rate of glycolytic metabolism, is an important indicator of carcinogenesis. In fact, cancers are characterized by major metabolic changes that switch cells from the normally dual oxidative and glycolytic metabolisms to an almost exclusively glycolytic metabolism. When OxPhos activity is impaired, ANT2 imports glycolytically produced ATP into the mitochondria. In the mitochondrial matrix, the F1F0-ATPase complex hydrolyzes the ATP, pumping out a proton into the intermembrane space. The reverse operations of ANT2 and F1F0-ATPase under glycolytic conditions contribute to maintaining the mitochondrial membrane potential, ensuring cell survival and proliferation. Unlike the ANTI and ANT3 isoforms, ANT2 is not pro-apoptotic and may therefore contribute to carcinogenesis. Since the expression of ANT2 is closely linked to the mitochondrial bioenergetics of tumors, it should be taken into account for individualizing cancer treatments and for the development of anticancer strategies.

AB  - During the Miocene numerous sedimentary basins formed on the territory of Bulgaria as a result of the extensional tectonic settings related to the post-orogenic development of the late Alpine orogen. In this study, we review the petrographic composition and biomarker assemblage of two adjacent basins in western Bulgaria, i.e. Beli Breg and Staniantsi basins. Both contain lignite formed during late Miocene (c. 6 Ma). Despite similar tectonic settings and depositional environments, the lignite seams possess different petrographic and organic geochemical characteristics, reflecting differences in the peat forming palaeo-communities and fades variations. The peat-forming vegetation in Bell Breg Basin was dominated by decay resistant coniferous plants, as indicated by abundant fossil wood remains, very good tissue preservation and a biomarker assemblage dominated by diterpenoids. In contrast, Staniantsi lignite is poor in fossil wood and contains a significant amount of triterpenoid biomarkers, suggesting the predominance of angiosperm plants in the swamp.
   The results of the biomarker analyses are consistent with palaeobotanical and palynological data from the literature. The lignite seams in both basins formed under frequently changing Eh conditions, as indicated by the severe degradation of the non-gymnosperm tissues, the low gelification index values and the variations in pristane/phytane ratio, probably as a result of seasonal drying of the swamps and changes of the ground water table. Hopanoid contents in Bell Breg lignite are very low and are consistent with the abundance of decay-resistant vegetation. In contrast, bacterial activity was obviously higher in the Staniantsi swamp, however, resulting only in slightly enhanced gelification of plant tissues. The geochemical data suggest that the diagenetic changes of the organic matter were mainly governed by thermal degradation, rather than bacterial activity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Pera-Lakkos coal located on top of bauxite deposits in the Ghiona mining district (Central Greece), is the only known Mesozoic (Late Cretaceous) coal in the country. It was derived from herbaceous plants and algae growing in mildly brackish mires that formed behind a barrier system during a regression of the sea, on a karstified limestone partly filled in with bauxitic detritus. Petrological, mineralogical and geochemical data point to the predominance of reducing conditions and intense organic matter degradation in the palaeomires. O/C vs. H/C and OI vs. HI plots, based on elemental analysis and Rock-Eval data, characterize kerogen types I/II. This reflects the relatively high liptinite content of the coal. Besides kerogen composition, O/C vs. H/C plot for the Pera-Lakkos coals is in accordance with a catagenesis stage of maturation in contrast with vitrinite reflectance and T-max from Rock-Eval pyrolysis, which indicate the onset of oil window maturation stage. Suppression of vitrinite reflectance should be considered and the high liptinite content corroborates this hypothesis. Despite some favourable aspects for petroleum generation presented by the Pera-Lakkos coal, its maximum thickness (up to 50 cm) points to a restricted potential for petroleum generation. Coal oxidation took place either during the late stage of peat formation, due to wave action accompanying the subsequent marine transgression, or epigenetically after the emergence of the whole sequence due to percolation of drainage waters. Both options are also supported by the REE shale-normalized profiles, which demonstrate an upwards depletion in the coal layer. Oxidation also affected pyrite included in the coal; this led to the formation of acidic (sulfate-rich) solutions, which percolated downwards resulting in bleaching of the upper part of the underlying bauxite.

AB  - The tissue distribution and ontogeny of Na+/K+-ATPase has been examined as an indicator for ion-regulatory epithelia in whole animal sections of embryos and hatchlings of two cephalopod species: the squid Loligo vulgaris and the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis. This is the first report of the immunohistochemical localization of cephalopod Na+/K+-ATPase with the polyclonal antibody alpha (H-300) raised against the human alpha 1-subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase. Na+/K+-ATPase immunoreactivity was observed in several tissues (gills, pancreatic appendages, nerves), exclusively located in baso-lateral membranes lining blood sinuses. Furthermore, large single cells in the gill of adult L. vulgaris specimens closely resembled Na+/K+-ATPase-rich cells described in fish. Immunohistochemical observations indicated that the amount and distribution of Na+/K+-ATPase in late cuttlefish embryos was similar to that found in juvenile and adult stages. The ion-regulatory epithelia (e.g., gills, excretory organs) of the squid embryos and paralarvae exhibited less differentiation than adults. Na+/K+-ATPase activities for whole animals were higher in hatchlings of S. officinalis (157.0 +/- 32.4 A mu mol g (FM) (-1) h(-1)) than in those of L. vulgaris (31.8 A +/- 3.3 A mu mol g (FM) (-1) h(-1)). S. officinalis gills and pancreatic appendages achieved activities of 94.8 A +/- 18.5 and 421.8 A +/- 102.3 A mu mol(ATP) g (FM) (-1) h(-1), respectively. High concentrations of Na+/K+-ATPase in late cephalopod embryos might be important in coping with the challenging abiotic conditions (low pH, high pCO(2)) that these organisms encounter inside their eggs. Our results also suggest a higher sensitivity of squid vs. cuttlefish embryos to environmental acid-base disturbances.

AB  - 1. Blood oxygen saturation (SaO) is a potential indicator trait for resistance to ascites in chickens.
   2. The objective of the study was to investigate the genetic architecture of SaO in a meat-type chicken line reared in commercial conditions.
   3. Data were collected over 15 generations of selection and were divided into two data sets on the basis of a change in recording age from 6 to 5 weeks of age, approximately halfway through the period. The resulting pedigrees comprised in excess of 90 000 birds each and, on average, 12% of these birds had SaO records.
   4. Segregation analyses of SaO were carried out assuming a mixed inheritance model that included a major locus segregating in a polygenic background.
   5. The analyses suggest that a major gene is involved in the genetic control of SaO in this line. The putative gene acts in a dominant fashion and has an additive effect of around 0.90 sigma(p), equivalent to a predicted difference in SaO between the two homozygous classes of more than 10%. The frequency of the allele that increases SaO changed from 0.53 to 0.65 from the first to the second set of data, consistent with selection on SaO scores.
   6. Using estimated genotype probabilities at the putative major locus, we inferred that it acts in an overdominant fashion on body weight and fleshing score. If the low SaO allele leads to susceptibility to ascites, its combined effects are consistent with it being maintained in the population by a balance of natural selection on fitness and artificial selection on growth and carcase traits.
   7. Even with selection on both SaO and growth traits, the combined genotypic effects would make it difficult to remove the unfavourable low-SaO allele by means of traditional selection without the use of genetic markers.

AB  - Although the impact of vegetation and other environmental factors on the distribution of terrestrial invertebrates has been known since the 1950s, basic knowledge about their interaction with micro-landscape elements is lacking. In experimental model systems, the impact of varying local spatial resistance ( LSR) on the distribution of Tenebrio molitor individuals was analysed in the laboratory. In the setups, LSR led to a reduction of the average distance covered ( move step length) and a reduction of the velocity ( the maximum speed ranging from 36.1 in the control groups to 20.4 [ mm*step(-1)] in areas with a maximum LSR). Also, the covered distances per individual varied among three groups, from 2.97 m in the control to 1.11 m in areas with medium LSR to 0.88 m in areas with maximum LSR. Thus, in areas with LSR, animals were forced by their habitats to perform shorter move steps on average and covered less distance. The distance covered ( i.e., dispersal performances) were not correlated with such factors as sex, weight and length of the Tenebrio individuals from other studies. Analysis of the data for net squared displacement indicated that the dispersal of the beetles did not follow a diffusion process. The move step directions of the dispersal data showed pronounced autocorrelation, which means that in contrast to other findings, the individuals were not performing a random walk. This effect was strongly dependent on the temporal resolution ( i.e. grain), and was also influenced by the experimental conditions. The entire array of data showed high variability among the sub-groups ( as well as many outliers), revealing non-parametric characteristics. The results showed that the specific physical configuration of suitable habitat for Tenebrio is one of the key indicators of landscape connectivity on the micro-scale.

AB  - Maintenance and enhancement of soil productivity is central to the long-term success of intensive forest management. A simple technique is required for monitoring the effects of different management practices on soils as an aid in developing codes of practice that foster maintenance and enhancement of soil productivity. The objective of our work was to determine if management impacts on soil productivity could be assessed using the soil-quality concepts developed in agriculture. A soil-quality index (SQI) model, that measures the effects of management practices on five key growth-determining attributes of forest soils. namely (1) promote root growth, (2) store, supply and cycle nutrients, (3) accept, hold, and supply water, (4) promote gas exchange, and (5) promote biological activity, was developed and rested as part of a controlled study in intensively-managed pine plantations on the Lower Coastal Plain of South Carolina. Three 20-ha, 20-year-old loblolly pine plantations were harvested under wet and dry conditions to create a broad gradient in soil disturbance. Within each harvested plantation, a subset of 3-ha plots were site prepared by either bedding or mole-plowing plus bedding, then all sites were established as third-rotation pine plantations. Field data were collected spatially for soil bulk density, net N mineralization, water table depth, soil aeration, and soil moisture. Literature-based sufficiency values were determined for each property and substituted into the SQI model as surrogate indicators for the five key attributes, thus obtaining spatial SQI predictions within each harvesting and site preparation treatment.

AB  - In addition to its well-known banded iron formations, the late Archean to Paleoproterozoic Hamersley Group of Western. Australia contains substantial volumes of thinly laminated carbonaceous shale and carbonate lutite. Locally, some of the laminae in these carbonates are deformed into highly distinctive folds in pockets whose cross-sections range up to about 2 cm in height and 10 cm in length. Individual folds consistently have circular hinge zones and vary in shape from simple buckles to recumbent, elastica, and even spiral geometries. Based on the strength and flexibility with which they responded to soft-sediment deformation, we infer the deformed carbonaceous laminae were bound by cohesive microbial mats. We propose the name roll-up structures for these features as they differ in subtle but important ways from most previously described soft-sediment deformation structures. Roll-up structures only occur in. lutites deposited below wave base and are absent from peritidal deposits, suggesting that the microbial mats involved may not have been based on photosynthesis. Large portions of the deep sea floor could presumably have been stabilized by mats built by heterotrophic or chemoautotrophic microbes prior to the Neoproterozoic, given the lack of both predators and competing algae. Roll-up structures are potentially useful as indicators of deposition below wave base, but very few candidates have been reported anywhere else save for the coeval carbonates of the Transvaal basin of South Africa. The paucity of other examples, particularly in younger strata, means that either roll-up structures have simply not been distinguished from other types of soft-sediment deformation structures, or the microbes and/or environmental conditions required to make them are a rarity in Earth history.

TI  - Importance and variability in processes relevant to environmental tritium ingestion dose models
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY
LA  - English
AB  - The Aiken List was devised in 1990 to help decide which transport processes should be investigated experimentally so as to derive the greatest improvement in performance of environmental tritium assessment models. Each process was rated high, medium and low on each of two criteria. These were 'Importance', which rated processes by how much each contributed to ingestion doses, and 'State of Modelling', which rated the adequacy of the knowledge base on which models were built. Ratings, though unanimous, were, nevertheless, qualitative and subjective opinions. This paper describes how we have tried to quantify the ratings. To do this, we use, as measures of 'Importance', sensitivities of predicted ingestion closes to changes in values of parameters in mathematical descriptions of individual processes. Measures of 'Modelling Status' were taken from a recently completed BIOMOVS study of HTO transport model performance and based either on by how much predicted transport by individual processes differed amongst participating modellers or by the variety of different ways that modellers chose to describe individual processes. The tritium transport model UFOTRI was used and because environmental transport of HTO val ies according to the weather at and after release time, sensitivities were measured in a sample of all conditions likely to arise in central Europe. With HTO released from a point source and maximum ingestion dose to the most exposed individual as an end-point, sensitivities to selected processes were negligible. No single or small group of processes emerged as more important than any other so that the 'Importance' criterion had a limited use for deciding on research priorities. Those would be determined largely by the 'State of the Art' results from BIOMOVS. These conclusions are linked to the source and end point defined. They would not apply to any other combination. A different 'Importance' rating in the Aiken List is appropriate for each model application. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Limited.

AB  - The effect of salinity and shallow water tables (1.4 m depth) used in combination with Regulated Deficit Irrigation (RDI) on peach trees (Prunus persica, L. Batsch) was studied over 2 years. Under RDI management a non-saline water table contributed up to 30% of water use. A lack of control of vegetative growth in the first season indicated that a shallow wafer table may interfere with RDI management. A decline in tree health and growth under RDI and a non-saline water table in the following season may have resulted from salinity and/or waterlogging effects. Saline irrigation under RDI management caused an additional decline in tree growth compared with RDI under non-saline conditions, and resulted in a reduction in productivity (yield and fruit size) and increased uptake of sodium (Na) and chloride (Cl) ions in various plant tissues. Similarly, a saline water table caused a decline in tree growth and fruit size in the first season and increased uptake of Na and Cl ions. For all treatments, accumulation of Cl in the leaves, Na and Cl in the fruit, Na in the bark and storage of Na in the butt wood and structural roots was demonstrated. Differences in mechanisms of transport of Na and Cl and the importance of older wood as a storage organ for ions are proposed. The potential for butt wood as a precise indicator of past salinity treatment is suggested. A combination of a shallow water table and moderate salinity environment was shown to present a potential health hazard for peach trees. The need for refinement of RDI management to incorporate leaching in the presence of saline irrigation and/or water tables is proposed. The management of drainage is also essential.

T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
LA  - English
KW  - LINEAR MIXED MODEL
KW  - VARIANCE-COMPONENTS
AB  - The prevalence of body strike was monitored in 740 mixed sex weaner progeny from 43 sires, representing 15 different Merino genotypes.  A flywave, characterized by a sudden onset in the prevalence of flystrike, occurred over a 2 month period which coincided with unseasonally high rainfall.  A total of 190 strikes were treated in 176 sheep representing a strike rate of 25.7 strikes per 100 sheep and a prevalence of 23.8%.  The majority of strikes (92.6%) were body strikes with 19.7% of all sheep affected.  The heritability of susceptibility to body strike expressed as prevalence was 0.26 +/- 0.12 for both least squares (LS) and restricted maximum likelihood (REML) procedures.  The heritability of liability to body strike using quasi-maximum likelihood procedures and assuming a continuous underlying scale was 0.53 which agreed well with estimates from the LS and REML analysis after transformation (0.54 +/- 0.25).
   Predicted genetic progress in the reduction of susceptibility to body strike was calculated for mass selection where the best 5% of rams and 60% of ewes were selected, with a starting prevalence of 20% body strike, assuming (a) an environment exposed to continuous flywaves, and (b) an environment with infrequent flywaves.  After 20 years of direct selection the prevalence of body strike would be reduced to 7.2% and 16.1% for the two environments respectively.  Indirect selection based on (c) a variable prevalence of fleece rot with a long term average of 30% and (d) fleece rot expressed at 80% would reduce the prevalence of body strike to 6% and less than 2% respectively.  Indirect selection based on (e) a hypothetical indicator trait with a continuous distribution, a high heritability (0.4) and a moderate genetic correlation with liability to body strike (0.4), would also reduce the prevalence of body strike to less than 2% after 20 years of selection.

AB  - Contaminant monitoring in tissues of wild species can help in the knowledge not only of their health, but also of the environmental health conditions in the zones where they live. In this study, concentrations of toxic metals (As, Cd, Hg, and Pb) and an essential metal (Zn) were measured in the hair of red deer (Cervus elaphus) and wild boar (Sus scrofa) inhabiting in protected areas of South-Western Spain. Zn (69.02 +/- 1.03 mg kg(-1), 70.31 +/- 2.22 mg kg(-1)), Pb (0.61 +/- 0.05 mg kg(-1), 0.68 +/- 0.08 mg kg(-1)), and As (0.33 +/- 0.03 mg kg(-1), 0.53 +/- 0.08 mg kg(-1)) were detected in the hair of red deer and wild boar, respectively. The other metals (Cd and Hg) were under the quantification limit (0.1 mg kg(-1)). No differences in the level of elements between both species were found. The levels of the detected elements in the hair showed low concentrations and similar to those observed in animals of the same species from unpolluted zones, reflecting a lack of contamination by these elements in the studied areas. Based on critical values of these elements established for organs of mammals, red deer and wild boar from the studied territories did not suffer toxicosis by the studied elements. Age-related differences in the content of As in the hair of red deer and age- and gender-related differences in the content of As in the hair of wild boar were detected, which should be considered for biomonitoring purposes. Finally, positive (Pb-As in both species) and negative (Zn-Pb in wild boar) interrelationships between elements were found.

AB  - Key message There was an inconsistent positive correlation between tree ring width and NDVI in the Tianshan Mountains, and this correlation gradually weakened from west to east and decreased with increasing elevation. Tree ring width and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are two effective indicators used to monitor changes in forest dynamics. Most studies focus on the relationship between tree ring width and regional NDVI in the mountainous areas of arid regions, failing to reflect the relationship between forest radial growth and forest canopy activities. In this paper, four study areas were selected ranging from west to east on the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains in China. Tree cores of Picea schrenkiana were collected at three elevations in each study area, and NDVI values were extracted for the forest cover at each location. Emphasis was placed on the relationship between the tree ring width and NDVI values of montane evergreen coniferous forests in an arid region in the period 2000-2012. There was an inconsistent positive correlation between tree ring width and NDVI in the Tianshan Mountains, and the relationship became increasingly weak from west to east and decreased with increasing elevation. The varied forest growth and its response to climatic factors as a result of the different environmental conditions present in arid mountain regions may be the underlying reason for the inconsistency between the tree ring width and NDVI of forests. Drought stress may be the major driving factor of the positive correlation between the tree ring width and NDVI of montane evergreen coniferous forests in arid regions. This result may be useful for integrating tree ring width and NDVI to study the ecology of montane evergreen coniferous forests in arid regions.

AB  - The question which guided our study was: How environmental variables and trees affect the parameters of diversity, composition and abundance of epiphytic moss species at a local scale? Our hypothesis is that these moss communities are shaped by tree functional traits, which in turn are determined according to soil texture. Therefore, we collected moss from 25 permanent plots distributed along six transects (three in each texture of soil) in a Seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) in Northeastern Brazil. We assessed the distribution and abundance of epiphytic moss and tree species separately by performing an ordination analysis for each plot and tested if the spatial pattern of mosses was correlated with that of trees by performing a Procrustes analysis. Structural, functional and physico-chemical variables of trees were measured and subjected to uni-and multivariate analyses as potential abiotic filters. We then described the relationship between the response (richness and abundance) and predictor variables (structural, functional and physico-chemical variables) of the trees. As a result, we found that deciduous tree species were more frequent in sandy soils with less water retention. Leaf shedding by deciduous species reduces the total evapotranspiration surface during the dry season compared to evergreens. In contrast, evergreen trees were more frequent in clay soils, which have a higher water retention capacity. These differences in tree functional groups between soil types promoted different moss epiphytic communities in environments with different soil textures. Despite generalist and sun moss species dominating the study area, we found two groups with different environmental requirements based on the abundance of life forms: tuft and weft in drier areas; and mat and dendroid in wetter areas. Epiphytic moss community composition reflects the environmental conditions for each of the formed groups through the pattern of the trees' functional traits predicted by different soil textures.

AB  - Food availability and temperature influence energetics of animals and can alter behavioral responses such as foraging and spontaneous activity. Food availability, however, is not necessarily a good indicator of energy (ATP) available for cellular processes. The efficiency of energy transduction from food-derived substrate to ATP in mitochondria can change with environmental context. Our aim was to determine whether the interaction between food availability and temperature affects mitochondrial efficiency and behavior in zebrafish (Danio rerio). We conducted a fully factorial experiment to test the effects of feeding frequency, acclimation temperature (three weeks to 18 or 28 degrees C), and acute test temperature (18 and 28 degrees C) on whole-animal oxygen consumption, mitochondrial bioenergetics and efficiency (ADP consumed per oxygen atom; P:O ratio), and behavior (boldness and exploration). We show that infrequently fed (once per day on four days per week) zebrafish have greater mitochondrial efficiency than frequently fed (three times per day on five days per week) animals, particularly when warm-acclimated. The interaction between temperature and feeding frequency influenced exploration of a novel environment, but not boldness. Both resting rate of producing ATP and scope for increasing it were positively correlated with time spent exploring and distance moved in standardized trials. In contrast, behavior was not associated with whole-animal aerobic (oxygen consumption) scope, but exploration was positively correlated with resting oxygen consumption rates. We highlight the importance of variation in both metabolic (oxygen consumption) rate and efficiency of producing ATP in determining animal performance and behavior. Oxygen consumption represents energy use, and P:O ratio is a variable that determines how much of that energy is allocated to ATP production. Our results emphasize the need to integrate whole-animal responses with subcellular traits to evaluate the impact of environmental conditions on behavior and movement.

AB  - Heat risk assessment is important due to serious health problems caused by heat waves. The complexity and diversity of socio-ecological characteristics in urban areas that lead to heat risk arc more serious in heat-exposed areas, while risk assessments and determinant based on individuals in heat-exposed areas have been neglected in previous studies. This study pursues a new idea of combining questionnaire surveys and remote sensing analysis to identify urban heat-exposed areas and assess heat risk in heat-exposed areas of Beijing, China. Morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) was used to identify large and continuous hotspot regions as urban heat-exposed areas based on summer surface temperature from 2011 to 2017. A total of 1484 valid questionnaires were completed by residents of heat-exposed areas. The majority of respondents (96.4%) indicated that they perceived heat risk. Moreover, the residents without a local "hukou" were a potentially vulnerable group (note: hukou refers to the population registration management system.). This study further analysed the diversity of community types within the heat-exposed areas. There were significant differences in heat risk among the different community types of multi-story residential districts, Hutong (a traditional architectural form) residential districts and city villages. In particular, the degree of heat risk perceived by residents living in these the community types was determined by whether they had pre-existing medical conditions; however, age only played a decisive role in city villages.

AB  - This work investigates the mechanisms determining Cr speciation and availability in two different soils polluted with two chromium sources (an industrial sludge, highly polluted with Cr, and Cr(VI) solution) and the influence of these parameters on the recovery of the soil functions related with biological quality and plant growth. The experiment was carried out in greenhouse conditions using 36 pots of 17 kg for the growth of Silene vulgaris for 21 months. Logistic Regression Model using Lasso estimator shows that soil organic matter (SOM) and pH control Cr availability in studied soils. In soils treated with the sludge, X ray Absorption spectroscopy showed that Cr was present as Cr(III), biological quality indicators increased and plants were able to grow. However, in soils polluted with Cr(VI), Cr availability was significantly different in the two soils. In the alkaline and poor in organic matter soil, 12% of Cr(VI) remained in the soil leading to the decrease of soil quality indicators and the total inhibition of plant growth. In the neutral soil, Cr(VI) was totally reduced to Cr(III) by soil organic matter (SOM), quality indicators were not affected and plants grown properly. Infrared Spectroscopy showed that different functional groups reacted with Cr in the two soils. This study highlights the importance to understand the mechanisms underlaying Cr redox and adsorption reactions in Cr polluted soils as they determine the potential recovery of the functions related with biological quality indicators and plant growth. The methodology proposed allows this study in complex soil samples at realistic concentrations and may be useful for risk assessment and for the planning of managing strategies in Cr polluted soils.

AB  - Wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) are considered to be a point source of microplastic ( particles <5 mm) for riverine environments. However, data on microplastic effluent concentrations in WWTPs is collected with a broad range of methods, which impede comparisons across data sets. We provide an estimate of the annual emissions of microplastic partides by WWTPs into the ten major river basins of Germany. We analyze the concentration patterns of microplastics among different stream orders resulting from the spatial organization of WWTPs along the river network. The local in-stream microplastic concentrations are estimated through a network model that accounts for routing of microplastics through the entire fluvial network under the assumption of no losses by sedimentation, entanglement or degradation. Previous studies have observed microplastic concentrations in treated WWTPs effluents ranging several orders of magnitude. In 19 studies reviewed (2016-2020), the concentrations of observed microplastic concentrations (size range between 10 and 5000 mu m) in 79 WWTP effluents ranged between 4 * 10(0) and 4.5 = 10(5) items/m(3) with a median of around 6400 items/m(3). The total, median microplastic load emitted by WWTPs in Germany is 7 * 10(12) items/year. The simulated microplastic concentrations, on average, tend to increase with increasing stream order suggesting that the WWTP effluent fraction accumulates with a higher rate than discharge. Simulated WWTP-derived in-stream concentrations are higher than observed concentrations with all sources of microplastic, not only those from WWTP's. Observed microplastic concentrations in rivers as well as the considerably higher simulated, WWTP-derived microplastic concentration, even for low flow conditions, are approximately one order of magnitude below currently known toxic effect levels.

AB  - A series of ruthenium(ii) complexes with N-heterocyclic carbene ligands were successfully synthesized by transmetalation reactions between silver(i) N-heterocyclic carbene complexes and [RuCl2(p-cymene)](2) in dichloromethane under Ar conditions. All new compounds were characterized by spectroscopic and analytical methods. These ruthenium(ii)-NHC complexes were found to be efficient precatalysts for the transfer hydrogenation of ketones by using 2-propanol as the hydrogen source in the presence of KOH as a co-catalyst. The antibacterial activity of ruthenium N-heterocyclic carbene complexes 3a-f was measured by disc diffusion method against Gram positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Compounds 3d exhibited potential antibacterial activity against five bacterial species among the six used as indicator cells. The product 3e inhibits the growth of all the six tested microorganisms. Moreover, the antioxidant activity determination of these complexes 3a-f, using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2 '-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) as reagent, showed that compounds 3b and 3d possess DPPH and ABTS antiradical activities. From a concentration of 1 mg ml(-1), these two complexes presented a similar scavenging activity to that of the two used controls gallic acid (GA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). From a concentration of 10 mg ml(-1), the percentage inhibition of complexes 3b and 3d was respectively 70% and 90%. In addition, these two Ru-NHC complexes exhibited antifungal activity against Candida albicans. Investigation of the anti-acetylcholinesterase activity of the studied complexes showed that compounds 3a, 3b, 3d and 3e exhibited good activity at 100 mu g ml(-1) and product 3d is the most active. In a cytotoxicity study the complexes 3 were evaluated against two human cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7. Both 3d and 3e complexes were found to be active against the tested cell lines showing comparable activity with examples in the literature.

AB  - The increasing complexity of electronics in systems used in safety critical applications, such as self-driving vehicles, requires new methods to assure the hardware reliability of the electronic assemblies. Prognostics and health management (PHM) that uses a combination of data-driven and physics-of-failure models is a promising approach to avoid unexpected failures in the field. However, to enable PHM based partly on physics-of-failure models, sensor data that measure the relevant environment loads to which the electronics are subjected during its mission life are required. In this work, the feasibility to manufacture and use integrated sensors in the inner layers of a printed circuit board (PCB) as mission load indicators measuring impacts and vibrations has been investigated. A four-layered PCB was designed in which piezoelectric sensors based on polyvinylidenefluoride-co-trifluoroethylene (PVDF-TrFE) were printed on one of the laminate layers before the lamination process. Manufacturing of the PCB was followed by the assembly of components consisting of ball grid arrays (BGAs) and quad flat no-leads (QFN) packages in a standard production reflow soldering process. Tests to ensure that the functionality of the sensor material was unaffected by the soldering process were performed. Results showed a yield of approximately 30% of the sensors after the reflow soldering process. The yield was also dependent on sensor placement and possibly shape. Optimization of the sensor design and placement is expected to bring the yield to 50% or better. The sensors responded as expected to impact tests. Delamination areas were present in the test PCBs, which requires further investigation. The delamination does not seem to be due to the presence of embedded sensors alone but rather the result of a combination of several factors. The conclusion of this work is that it is feasible to embed piezoelectric sensors in the layers of a PCB.

AB  - Mongolia is characterized by restricted sources of drinking water and intensive water pollution due to high rates of urbanization, mining industry development, enormous amount of livestock, and ever-growing attempts in domestic production of cereals and vegetables. Among others, Se is the least studied element in Mongolian water resources. Based on fluorimetric method of analysis, the first results on Se levels in drinking water of five aimags, Ulaanbaatar, and Erdenet were obtained. Uneven distribution of Se in Mongolia was manifested, the highest Se concentrations being typical for the southern resources (up to 18,600g/L) and the lowest, for the Northern ones (up to 0.022g/L). ICP-MS data of Al, As, B, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, I, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, P, Pb, Si, Sn, Sr, V, and Zn contents indicate poly-microelementosis existence in the South of Mongolia (Dorno-Gobi aimag) where ground water is characterized by elevated levels of As and extremely high levels of Se, Li, Na, F, Cl, B, and nitrates ions, exceeding maximum permissible levels by 1.86; 4.3; 3.1; 3.1; 2.7; 3.4; and 1.8 times respectively. Toxic concentrations of Se in groundwater of Dorno-Gobi aimag contradict with the published low human serum Se and low content of the element in horseflesh that suggests the possible effect of the above pollutants on Se bioavailability. Revealed phenomenon and mosaic distribution of heavy metals in areas with high and low Se content in water resources indicate the need of direct search for Se and other pollutant transfer in food chain in various ecological loading conditions, creation of a map of Se distribution in water resources of other Mongolian regions, and large-scale evaluation of the human poly-elemental status.

AB  - Sleep-related conditions require high-cost and low-comfort diagnosis at the hospital during one night or longer. To overcome this situation, this work aims to evaluate an unobtrusive monitoring technique for sleep apnea. This paper presents, for the first time, the evaluation of contactless capacitively-coupled electrocardiography (ccECG) signals for the extraction of sleep apnea features, together with a comparison of different signal quality indicators. A multichannel ccECG system is used to collect signals from 15 subjects in a sleep environment from different positions. Reference quality labels were assigned for every 30-s segment. Quality indicators were calculated, and their signal classification performance was evaluated. Features for the detection of sleep apnea were extracted from capacitive and reference signals. Sleep apnea features related to heart rate and heart rate variability achieved high similarity to the reference values, with p-values of 0.94 and 0.98, which is in line with the more than 95% beat-matching obtained. Features related to signal morphology presented lower similarity with the reference, although signal similarity metrics of correlation and coherence were relatively high. Quality-based automatic classification of the signals had a maximum accuracy of 91%. Best-performing quality indicators were based on template correlation and beat-detection. Results suggest that using unobtrusive cardiac signals for the automatic detection of sleep apnea can achieve similar performance as contact signals, and indicates clinical value of ccECG. Moreover, signal segments can automatically be classified by the proposed quality metrics as a pre-processing step. Including contactless respiration signals is likely to improve the performance and provide a complete unobtrusive cardiorespiratory monitoring solution; this is a promising alternative that will allow the screening of more patients with higher comfort, for a longer time, and at a reduced cost.

AB  - The mixed plastics, by their heterogeneity and contamination characteristics, constitute the extreme situation of difficulty in recycling, which has greatly contributed to a high fraction of mixed plastics landfilled. This situation is a cause for concern, and it is imperative to search for new application solutions for these wastes and its valorization as a raw material of high value-added products. Currently exists in Portugal and globally a need to find solutions for railway sleepers, to be a viable alternative to the replacement of wood railway sleepers, which usually have a special application and cannot be replaced by cement solutions existing on the market. Thus, the ECO SUSTAINABLE RAIL project intends to meet the listed requirements, through the mixed plastics valorization in the development of the eco-sustainable sleepers, mostly made of mixed plastics, to be tested in real scenario of operation in Infrastructures of Portugal. The ECO SUSTAINABLE RAIL project will be supported in the development of three research lines (research and development of a new material mostly of mixed plastics, research of a sleeper geometry, research of a new production process), the development of life-cycle analysis and environmental assessment of the sleepers real scenario and the sleepers testing in real operating condition. For the project execution, it was established a set of entities consortium, with experience and complementary skills, including the leading EXTRUPLAS company, the Innovation Pole in Polymer Engineering (PIEP) and the Centre for Waste Valorization (CVR), that with the technical support of Infrastructures of Portugal (IP) will be able to develop and test a new railway sleeper of quality and with less environmental impact. Overall the project ECO SUSTAINABLE RAIL will contribute to reduce the deposition of mixed plastic in landfills, to respond to a need of the railway sector, and to allow the expansion and differentiation of the EXTRUPLAS products portfolio, which will strengthen its position in the plastic recycling sector.

AB  - Turbomachinery often suffers various defects such as impeller cracking, resulting in forced outage, increased maintenance costs, and reduced productivity. Condition monitoring and damage prognostics has been widely used as an increasingly important and powerful tool to improve the system availability, reliability, performance, and maintainability, but still very challenging due to multiple sources of data uncertainties and the complexity of analytics modeling. This paper presents an intelligent probabilistic methodology for anomaly prediction of high-fidelity turbomachine, considering multiple data imperfections and multivariate correlation. The proposed method adeptly integrates several advanced state-of-the-art signal processing and artificial intelligence techniques: wavelet multiresolution decomposition, Bayesian hypothesis testing, probabilistic principal component analysis, and fuzzy stochastic neural network modeling. The advanced signal processing is employed to reduce dimensionality and to address multivariate correlation and data uncertainty for damage prediction. Instead of conventionally using raw time series data, principal components are utilized in the establishment of stochastic neural network model and anomaly prediction. Bayesian interval hypothesis testing metric is then presented to quantitatively compare the predicted and measured data for model validation and anomaly evaluation, thus providing a confidence indicator to judge the model quality and evaluate the equipment status. Bayesian method is developed in this study for denoising the raw data with multiresolution wavelet decomposition, quantifying the model accuracy, and assessing the equipment status. The dynamic stochastic neural network model is established via the nonlinear autoregressive moving average with exogenous inputs approach. It seamlessly integrates the fuzzy clustering and independent Bernoulli random function into radial basis function neural network. A natural gradient method based on Kullback-Leibler distance criterion is employed to maximize the log-likelihood loss function. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology and procedure is demonstrated with the 11-variable time series data and the forced outage event of a real-world centrifugal compressor.

AB  - Currently, potential distribution of plant species is represented by different uses of presence/absence indicators or by density-dominance-based ones such as the Importance Value (I.V.), and their geographical representation is based on statistical models (Random forest model, General Regression Models etc.) relating these indicators with climate and physical features of a given territory. Here, we have built an integrated model which is able to link climate, physical features of territory and inter-specific competition at aiming to simulate potential distribution of eight plant species (Quercus cerris, Quercus pubescens, Fraxinus ornus, Fraxinus excelsior, Acer campestre, Acer obtusatum, Ostrya carpinifolia and Carpinus betulus) either at actual climate conditions or future ones (B1 and A2 climatic scenarios; IPCC, 2013). The integrated model is based on innovative methodological approach, which combined statistical tools (Principal Component Analyses and Discretization) and two-dimensional grid based model to consider the interactive effects of climate and inter-specific competition on plant species distribution. The study case was given by geographical spatialisation of the I.V. for each considered plant species, in the overall Italian territory. The simulations had always occurred by taking into consideration both expected climate change and inter-specific competition under highly complexity terrains. The results substantially differed from other studies that used only environmental predictors for estimating potential plant distributions. Variations in the I.V. distribution seemed to be due to variations of relative competitive abilities of plants, reducing both local extinctions of some species in Southern and Central Italy and migration toward North. Furthermore, our simulations suggested that under pressure of climate change the competitive ability of plant species will be likely affected by reducing the effects of competitive asymmetry.

AB  - Quantifying the extent of biodegradation of nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) in contaminated soils and sediments is challenging because of competing oxidative and reductive reaction pathways. We have previously shown that the stable isotope fractionation of NACs reveals the routes of degradation even if it is simultaneously caused by different bacteria. However, it is unclear whether compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) can be applied in situations where multiple pollutants are biodegraded by only one microorganism under multi-substrate conditions. Here we examined the C and N isotope fractionation of 2-nitrophenol (2-NP) and 3-nitrophenol (3-NP) during biodegradation by Pseudomonas putida B2 through monooxygenation and partial reductive pathways, respectively, in the presence of single substrates vs. binary substrate mixtures. Laboratory experiments showed that the reduction of 3-NP by Pseudomonas putida B2 is associated with large N and minor C isotope fractionation with C and N isotope enrichment factors, epsilon(C) and epsilon(N), of -0.3 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand and -22 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand, respectively. The opposite isotope fractionation trends were found for 2-NP monooxygenation. In the simultaneous presence of 2-NP and 3-NP, 2-NP is biodegraded at identical rate constants and epsilon(C) and epsilon(N) values (-1.0 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand and -1.3 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand) to those found for the monooxygenation of 2-NP in single substrate experiments. While the pathway and N isotope fractionation of 3-NP reduction (epsilon(N) = -24 +/- 1.1 parts per thousand) are independent of the presence of 2-NP, intermediates of 2-NP monooxygenation interfere with 3-NP reduction. Because neither pH, substrate uptake, nor aromatic substituents affected the kinetic isotope effects of nitrophenol biodegradation, our study illustrates that CSIA provides robust scientific evidence for the assessment of natural attenuation processes.

TI  - Reproduction impact of mancozeb on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss W.) and accumulation of its carcinogen metabolite, ethylene thiourea in fish products
T2  - JOURNAL OF CENTRAL EUROPEAN AGRICULTURE
LA  - English
AB  - Pesticides can be taken up from the water and accumulated in tissues of hydrobionts, often becoming multiplied thousands of times higher in the organism than in the surrounding water. The dithiocarbamate mancozeb is applied in plant protection as fungicide. In recent years the amount of mancozeb used in Europe significantly increased. It is carcinogen due to its metabolite - ethylene thiourea (ETU), which causes thyroid and pituitary tumors. The purpose of this study is to determinate the quantity of ethylene thiourea in products of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss W.), reared in environment containing permissible, according to the European law, amount of mancozeb. Seeking an answer to the question: is this concentration limit really safe for the reproduction of rainbow trout and can the more toxic metabolite - ETU, be accumulated in the fish eggs and fillet and afterwards make them harmful to the consumers? The study included 3 stages: feeding, analysis of ethylene thiourea in fish eggs and fillet by a new developed and validated HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) method and study of the reproductive indicators. The assays of ETU in all analyzed samples (fish and water) were below the limit of quantification of the method, 0.05 mg*l(-1), so fish do not accumulate the carcinogen degradation product of mancozeb and the maximum residue level of mancozeb is really safe for the humans as consumers. But these environmental conditions caused reproductive disorders. They can be partly compensated by using sperm activation medium for artificial insemination of trout eggs, but successful fertilization does not guarantee successful hatching, especially of eggs in trout farms with presence of mancozeb in water, even in allowable concentration. The presented results confirm previous investigation, that Salmonidae are very sensitive fish species, react to the lowest deviations in concentration levels of xenobiotics and are used for indicator of non-polluted water.

AB  - Benthic invertebrate communities were assessed after the December 2008 release of approximately 4.1 million m(3) coal fly ash from a disposal dredge cell at the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Kingston Fossil Plant on Watts Bar Reservoir in Roane County, Tennessee, USA. Released ash filled the adjacent embayments and the main channel of the Emory River, migrating into reaches of the Emory, Clinch, and Tennessee Rivers. Dredging was completed in summer 2010, and the benthic community sampling was conducted in December 2010. This study is part of a series that supported an Ecological Risk Assessment for the Kingston site. Benthic invertebrate communities were sampled at transects spread across approximately 20 miles of river that includes both riverine and reservoirlike conditions. Community composition was assessed on a grab sample and transect basis across multiple cross-channel transects to gain an understanding of the response of the benthic community to a fly ash release of this magnitude. This assessment used invertebrate community metrics, similarity analysis, geospatial statistics, and correlations with sediment chemistry and habitat. The community composition was reflective of a reservoir system, with dominant taxa being insect larva, bivalves, and aquatic worms. Most community metric results were similar for ash-impacted areas and upstream reference areas. Variation in the benthic community was correlated more with habitat than with sediment chemistry or residual ash. Other studies have reported that a benthic community can take several years to a decade to recover from ash or ash-related constituents. Although released ash undoubtedly had some initial impacts on the benthic community in this study, the severity of these effects appears to be limited to the initial smothering of the organisms followed by a rapid response and the initial start of recovery postdredging.

AB  - Taylor's power law describes an empirical relationship between the mean and variance of population densities in field data, in which the variance varies as a power, b, of the mean. Most studies report values of b varying between 1 and 2. However, Cohen (2014a) showed recently that smooth changes in environmental conditions in a model can lead to an abrupt, infinite change in b. To understand what factors can influence the occurrence of an abrupt change in b, we used both mathematical analysis and Monte Carlo samples from a model in which populations of the same species settled on patches, and each population followed independently a stochastic linear birth-and-death process. We investigated how the power relationship responds to a smooth change of population growth rate, under different sampling strategies, initial population density, and population age. We showed analytically that, if the initial populations differ only in density, and samples are taken from all patches after the same time period following a major invasion event, Taylor's law holds with exponent b = 1, regardless of the population growth rate. If samples are taken at different times from patches that have the same initial population densities, we calculate an abrupt shift of b, as predicted by Cohen (2014a). The loss of linearity between log variance and log mean is a leading indicator of the abrupt shift. If both initial population densities and population ages vary among patches, estimates of b lie between 1 and 2, as in most empirical studies. But the value of b declines to similar to 1 as the system approaches a critical point. Our results can inform empirical studies that might be designed to demonstrate an abrupt shift in Taylor's law.

AB  - Plants exposed to stress due to pollution, disease or nutrient deficiency often develop visible symptoms on leaves such as spots, colour changes and necrotic regions. Early symptom detection is important for precision agriculture, environmental monitoring using bio-indicators and quality assessment of leafy vegetables. Leaf injury is usually assessed by visual inspection, which is labour-intensive and to a considerable extent subjective. In this study, methods for classifying individual pixels as healthy or injured from images of clover leaves exposed to the air pollutant ozone were tested and compared. RGB images of the leaves were acquired under controlled conditions in a laboratory using a standard digital SLR camera. Different feature vectors were extracted from the images by including different colour and texture (spatial) information. Four approaches to classification were evaluated: (1) Fit to a Pattern Multivariate Image Analysis (FPM) combined with T-2 statistics (FPM-T-2) or (2) Residual Sum of Squares statistics (FPM-RSS), (3) linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and (4) K-means clustering. The predicted leaf pixel classifications were trained from and compared to manually segmented images to evaluate classification performance. The LDA classifier outperformed the three other approaches in pixel identification with significantly higher accuracy, precision, true positive rate and F-score and significantly lower false positive rate and computation time. A feature vector of single pixel colour channel intensities was sufficient for capturing the information relevant for pixel identification. Including neighbourhood pixel information in the feature vector did not improve performance, but significantly increased the computation time. The LDA classifier was robust with 95% mean accuracy, 83% mean true positive rate and 2% mean false positive rate, indicating that it has potential for real-time applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the paper, the pseudo-basal levels of anti-oxidant system in different earthworm life stages (juvenile and adult) and the pseudo-basal distribution in different regions of adult earthworms (pre-clitellum, clitellum and post-clitellum) were studied using filter contact tests. The effects of phenanthrene (PHE) at different exposure levels on anti-oxidant enzymes along the earthworm body were also investigated after 24 and 48 h of exposure.
   The pseudo-basal levels of the anti-oxidant enzymes varied during the different growth phase, and results indicated that earthworm has a low oxidative risk and SOD plays important roles during the development whereas CAT and POD are more important in maintain the low ROS level in adult earthworm.
   The pseudo-basal distribution of the anti-oxidant enzymes along the earthworms was heterogeneous and MDA mainly located in clitellum. POD in pre-clitellum, SOD in clitellum and CAT in post-clitellum were important to eliminate excess total ROS. Time of exposure impacted the anti-oxidant enzyme activities and their distribution patterns along earthworms, from the viewpoint of which supported that exposure time was an environment stress factors.
   In a short exposure time (24 h), CAT and SOD in the three regions, POD in pre-clitellum and clitellum might be good indicator to a low PHE stress level (0.0629 mu g cm(-2) treatments). In a long exposure time (48 h), only SOD in clitellum is a good indicator to both low and high PHE stress (0.629 mu g cm(-2) treatments). Earthworm biomembrane system inflicted no oxidative damage until the stress magnitude reached or exceeds the level of exposure in low PHE concentration condition for 48 h. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A 1-year set of measurements of CO2 and energy turbulent fluxes above and within a 25-m pine forest in southern Brazil is analyzed. The study focuses on the coupling state between two levels and its impact on flux determination by the eddy-covariance method. The turbulent series are split in their typical temporal scales using the multiresolution decomposition, a method that allows proper identification of the time scales of the turbulent events. Initially, four case studies are presented: a continually turbulent, a continually calm, a calm then turbulent, and an intermittent night. During transitions from calm to turbulent, large scalar fluxes of opposing signs occur at both levels, suggesting the transference of air accumulated in the canopy during the stagnant period both upwards and downwards. Average fluxes are shown for the entire period as a function of turbulence intensity and a canopy Richardson number, used as an indicator of the canopy coupling state. Above the canopy, CO2 and sensible heat fluxes decrease in magnitude both at the neutral and at the very stable limit, while below the canopy they increase monotonically with the canopy Richardson number. Latent heat fluxes decrease at both levels as the canopy air becomes more stable. The average temporal scales of the turbulent fluxes at both levels approach each other in neutral conditions, indicating that the levels are coupled in that case. Average CO2 fluxes during turbulent periods that succeed very calm ones are appreciably larger than the overall average above the canopy and smaller than the average or negative within the canopy, indicating that the transfer of air accumulated during calm portions at later turbulent intervals affects the flux average. The implications of this process for mean flux determination are discussed.

AB  - Mortality rates are often used in population-level animal welfare assessments because they are assumed to reflect rates of disease or injury and other problems likely to cause poor welfare. High mortality is thus assumed to correlate with factors likely to cause negative affective states. Here, we argue that negative affective states are also related to mortality rates more directly, via causal rather than merely correlational routes. In humans, negative affective states predict elevated morbidity and mortality rates as well as decreased longevity, while self-reported happiness does the opposite. This review investigates whether mortality rates and longevity can thus be used to make inferences regarding past affective states in animals. The proposed mechanism is that chronic stressors cause negative affective states and thence harmful physiological consequences through continual activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and sympathetic-adreno-medullary axes, which in turn can lead to increased mortality. The convergent validity of mortality as an indicator of past negative affect is demonstrated via examples of how stressors such as bereavement in humans and social isolation in social non-human species cause negative affective states, and then increase the morbidity of potentially lethal conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and HIV/AIDS, ultimately leading to increased mortality and reduced longevity in both humans and animals. The potential drawbacks of using mortality rates to infer animal welfare are also discussed, including its low sensitivity and the multiplicity of factors unrelated to affective states that can influence mortality rates. However, providing these issues are accounted for, it is suggested that this indicator has value in welfare assessment, and is especially well suited for cases where animals are allowed to live out their natural lifespans, such as tends to be the case with zoo and companion animals.

AB  - Carotenoid-based coloration in adult birds has been often regarded as an honest signal of individual quality. However, few studies have demonstrated a link between carotenoid display and the quantity or quality of resources provided to the offspring. The present study investigated the expression of a carotenoid-based ornament, the breast plumage yellowness of the blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus, in relation to the level of parental provisioning effort and the amount of carotenoid-rich prey provided to the young. The study was conducted in two forest types (evergreen and deciduous), which also allowed an exploration of the possible existence of habitat effects on the coloration of breeding birds. It was found that plumage colour intensity (carotenoid chroma) correlated positively with nestling provisioning rates of both males and females, supporting the good parent hypothesis. In addition, carotenoid chroma was positively related with the proportion of Lepidoptera larvae brought to the nest in both sexes. Female but not male coloration was positively linked to breeding success (proportion of fledged young). Nestling coloration did not correlate with that of their parents, nor the frequency with which they were fed. Hue and lightness of nestling's plumage correlated positively with body mass and tarsus length, respectively. The results obtained in the present study indicate that ventral plumage coloration in blue tits may advertise the ingested carotenoids (carotenoid foraging ability) and also their overall parental quality in terms of nestling provisioning rates. This suggests that plumage yellowness can be used as an indicator of foraging ability in this species.

AB  - Identification of microbial communities within shoreline sediments and sediment precipitates from the Tigris-Euphrates delta (northern Kuwait) were determined by microscopic/nanoscopic studies, and by molecular analysis. Oncolites are syn-diagenetic carbonate precipitates that are surviving in a shallow subtidal to intertidal siliciclastic environment with periodically excessive hydraulic energy, extreme salinity (up to 47 per mil), and high concentrations of organic matter. X-ray diffraction techniques reveal that oncolite cortices are predominantly composed of calcite, quartz, halite and dolomite, associated with minor fractions of clay minerals. Quantitative analysis of the Corey Shape Factor reveals distinct morphological populations but with local overlap. A plot of the Equivalent Diameter vs. Corey Shape Factor provided the best indicator of the morphological relationships within the total oncolite population, indicating a hydrodynamically controlled morphological distribution defining intertidal and subtidal oncolite classes. Direct microscopic examination of the samples indicates that diatoms are the most abundant eukaryotic algae in subtidal sediments and within actively precipitating carbonate cements, especially the genus Navicula. In contrast, filamentous cyanobacteria from the genus Anabaena are most abundant in the intertidal zone sediments. The PCR-DGGE of the 16SrRNA gene of the cyanobacteria shows a higher diversity for this genus of bacteria in all sediment samples and that the cyanobacterial population in the diagenetically precipitating oncolites are closely related to the population found in the subtidal sediments. Dunaliella viridis dominates the culturable algae obtained from the four tidal zones. Our results indicate that a range of microbial populations are actively contributing to the formation of microbially-induced sedimentary structures in the extreme conditions of the southern Tigris-Euphrates delta.

AB  - Endogenous polyamine (PA) content in the seagrass Cymodocea nodosa was monitored at different embryo and seedling developmental stages. Total PA concentration, including putrescine (Put), spermidine (Spd) and spermine (Spm), and the Put (Spm + Spd)(-1) ratio decreased during embryo development, from the immature fruit to the mature seed stage (with a sharp decline in the free PA fraction), and subsequently increased during germination and seedling development from the cotyledon to seedling stage, indicating an important role during zygotic embryogenesis and seed germination. In particular, total levels of Put and Spm significantly decreased from the fruit to the mature seed, to be restored after germination. Spd levels remained constant during all the developmental stages studied. When seedlings were subjected to hypo-osmotic stress (i.e. salinity decrease from 36 to 5 psu), fluorescence levels decreased, reaching a minimum photochemical efficiency (F-v/F-m) at 5 psu (0.582 +/- 0.025, mean +/- SE), indicating that seedlings were under high stress. Contrary to expectations, this was followed by a slight decrease in total PA content (showing a significance difference between 5 psu and higher salinities in bound-insoluble PA) and the accumulation of the PA cadaverine (Cad) at 5 psu (indicating cell death), which revealed the inability of this species to face the abiotic stress promoted by long-term salinity decrease. These 2 physiological indicators may suggest that C. nodosa is an obligate halophyte because it requires an environment with relatively high and stable salinity for its survival. Moreover, exogenous application of Spd significantly improved Fv/Fm values at the lowest salinity treatment (5 psu: 0.670 +/- 0.012), which suggests a protective role of Spd in maintaining the photosynthetic apparatus of C. nodosa seedlings under long-term hypo-osmotic stress.

AB  - Excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy, combined with parallel factor analysis and measurements of UV absorption and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, was used to trace the footprints of industrial effluents discharged into the lower Kishon River (Israel). The lower Kishon River typifies streams that are affected by seawater tidal intrusion and represents an extreme case of severe long-term pollution caused mainly by a variety of industrial effluents. The industrial effluents may contribute about 90%, in terms of biochemical oxygen demand, of the total organic carbon discharged into the lower Kishon River. Water samples were collected along the river, including the points of effluent discharge from industrial plants, between November 2005 and September 2006. Two types of fluorescent components characterized the fluorescence of the lower Kishon River water: component I corresponded to humic-like matter and component II spectrally resembled material known to be associated with biological productivity, but different from typical tryptophan-like fluorophore. These fluorescent components and other substances that absorbed light at 254 nm contributed to the DOC pool that resisted riverine microbial degradation under laboratory conditions, and that constitutes up to 70% of the overall riverine DOC. The variations in DOC concentration, absorbance at 254 nm, and concentration of humic-like matter (characterized by component I) correlated with the distance from the sea and the water electrical conductivity, and were linked to seawater tidal intrusion. The increased concentration of component II, as well as its enlarged fraction in the overall riverine DOC pool, was found to be associated with the location of major inputs of the industrial effluents. These findings support the use of this fluorescent component as an indicator of industrial pollution in such severely contaminated riverine systems.

AB  - Horizontal flow constructed wetlands are engineered systems capable of eliminating a wide range of pollutants from the aquatic environment. Nevertheless, poor hydrodynamic behavior is commonly found resulting in preferential pathways and variations in both (i) the hydraulic residence time distribution (HRTD) and, consequently, (ii) the wetland's treatment efficiency. The aim of this work was to outline a methodology for wetland design that accounts for the effect of heterogeneous hydraulic properties of the porous substrate on the HRTD and treatment efficiency. Biodegradation of benzene was used to illustrate the influence of hydraulic conductivity heterogeneity on wetland efficiency. Random, spatially correlated hydraulic conductivity fields following a log-normal distribution were generated and then introduced in a subsurface flow numerical model. The results showed that the variance of the distribution and the correlation length in the longitudinal direction are key indicators of the extent of heterogeneity. A reduction of the mean hydraulic residence time was observed as the extent of heterogeneity increased, while the HRTD became broader with increased skewness. At the same time, substrate heterogeneity induced preferential flow paths within the wetland bed resulting in variations of the benzene treatment efficiency. Further to this it was observed that the distribution of biomass within the porous bed became heterogeneous, rising questions on the representativeness of sampling. It was concluded that traditional methods for wetland design based on assumptions such as a homogeneous porous medium and plug flow are not reliable. The alternative design methodology presented here is based on the incorporation of heterogeneity directly during the design phase. The same methodology can also be used to optimize existing systems, where the HRTD has been characterized with tracer experiments. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The functional flows model integrates hydrogeomorphic processes and ecological functions for stream physical habitat evaluations. Functional flows are discharge values that serve ecological uses. Assessments of functional flows are based on evaluation of shear stress dynamics. The analysis is based on the occurrence of sediment transport regimes defined by threshold values of Shields stress estimated from discharge (Q), a parameter (f) governing depth response to incremental discharge changes, water surface slope (S) and media grain size (D-50). As an example, the model was tuned for fall-run Chinook salmon spawning. Ecological functions studied were bed occupation (spawning, incubation and emergence) and bed preparation (river bed reworking periods)-both reliant on shear stress dynamics. A numerical experiment and sensitivity analysis using a wide range of realistic values of input variables indicated the effect of each variable on flow functionality. Combinations of S = 0.001, 0.005 and 0.01, D-50 = 0.02, 0.05, 0.1 m, f = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and four sediment transport stages produced 144 scenarios. Ranges of functional flows were greater for scenarios for low f (0.2) with low slope (0.001,0.05), for high f (0.5) with small grain size (0.02 m) and for intermediate low f (0.3) with coarse grain size (0.1 m). The functional flows model incorporates in-stream habitat processes by including metrics of hydrologic, hydraulic, geomorphic and ecologic dynamics. Model uncertainties related to input data, calculation algorithms, and model structure are analysed. Functional flows analysis can be useful in studying water management alternatives to improve habitat conditions for target species and lifestages. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) epidemic throughout Europe required submission of numerous wild birds to diagnostic institutes for investigation. From October 2005 to late 2006, the Austrian Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza at the AGES received about 5,000 wild bird carcasses for examination and H5N1 testing. A total of 400 carcasses including 369 wild birds were processed for further pathomorphological investigations after having been tested for HPAI by real time RT-PCR.
   Real time RT-PCR revealed that all investigated birds tested negative for the influenza A viral genome. Furthermore, routine histopathology on formaldehyde-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue samples and HE staining were performed. Special staining was applied to some samples to confirm any suspected changes.
   The pathomorphological findings were classified into the following main categories:
   Organic changes:
   inflammatory changes: hepatitis (219), enteritis (205), pneumonia (107), tracheitis (40), nephritis (17), myocarditis (9), serositis (7), meningoencephalitis (6), pancreatitis (5) and splenitis (4);
   degenerative changes: hepatic fatty degeneration (57) and tubulonephrosis (9);
   intra- and extracellular deposition: hepatic siderosis (114), pulmonary anthracosis (58), amyloidosis (15) and renal tubular concrements (4).
   General etiology:
   trauma (177), bacterial infection (89) (2 of which were diagnosed as mycobacteriosis, the rest unclassified), parasitic infestation (24, including protozoan [4] and metazoan [20] parasites), mycosis (8), starvation (43) and poisoning (2, suspicion of ethylene-glycol poisoning).
   In this study, trauma and starvation accounted for 60 % of the mortality; these can most likely be linked to the very cold weather conditions and possibly to the increased movements of birds in search of food.
   Pulmonary anthracosis seems to be an indicator of environmental pollution.
   No pathomorphological changes typical for lead poisoning were recorded. The detected infectious diseases caused by various pathogens played an important role in the wild bird mortalities. These diseases need to be considered for further detailed epidemiological analysis and study.

AB  - The correlation between the delta C-13 and delta O-18 in primary carbonates is affected by several factors such as hydrological balance, total CO2 concentrations., climatic condition and lake productivity. The influence of these factors oil the delta C-13-delta O-18 correlation may be different on different time scales. In this paper, two different-type lakes in southwestern China, Lake Erhai and Lake Chenghai, are selected to investigate the influence of climatic pattern on the delta C-13-delta O-18 correlation and to evaluate the reliability or the delta C-13-delta O-18 covariance as all indicator of hydrological closure. The results show that there exists good correlation between delta C-13 and delta O-18 in Lake Erhai (overflowing open lake) and in Lake Chenghai (closed lake). This suggests that the delta C-13-delta O-18 covariance may be not,in effective indicator of hydrological closure for lakes.. especially oil short time scales. On the one hand, a hydrologically open lake may display covariant delta C-13 and delta O-18 as a result of climatic influence. The particular alternate warm-dry and cold-wet climatic pattern in southwestern China may be the principal cause of the delta C-13-delta O-18 covariance in Lake Erhai and Lake Chenghai. On the other hand, a hydrologically closed lake unnecessarily displays covariant trends between delta C-13 and delta O-18 because or the buffering effect of high CO2 concentration oil the delta C-13 Shift in hyper-alkaline lakes. We should be prudent when we use the covariance between delta C-13 and delta O-18 to judge the hydrological closure of lake.

AB  - High-resolution analyses of pollen and radiolarians from northwest Pacific cores V28-304 and RC14-99 provide continuous, directly-linked evidence of oceanic-atmospheric climate processes through the past three Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles. Systematic fluctuations in marine pollen assemblages, which reflect changes in the forest communities of Japan, are compatible with fluctuations in faunal assemblages and inferred oceanographic properties offshore. Each interglacial has distinguishable characteristics which imply that the sequence, timing and magnitude of climatic change were not identical during the three most recent interglacial intervals. Most interglacials contain at least one 10-15 kyr period of exceptionally high percentages (>20%) of Cryptomeria, which we interpret as reflecting increased levels of precipitation in response to intensification of the summer monsoon. With the exception of Oxygen Isotope Substage 5e in RC14-99. integlacial summer sea-surface temperatures were similar to or slightly warmer than today.
   Glacial environments in central Japan and in the northern subtropical gyre were similar to those which now support cold-temperate and boreal forests on northernmost Japan and a dominant subpolar fauna and associated low sea-surface temperatures offshore. Climatic change was apparently not as severe in southern Japan (where temperate vegetation largely replaced warm-temperate flora) or in the southern subtropical gyre (where only winter SSTs were cooler than present). We attribute these changes in vegetation and surface-water conditions to shifts in the atmospheric polar and oceanographic subarctic fronts in response to the seasonal variations in the Siberian High. Maxima in Cryptomeria systematically lag maxima in solar insolation at 30 degrees N. This correlation between our summer monsoon indicator and summer insolation substantiates the view that the strength of the Asian monsoon is linked to variations in northern hemisphere solar radiation.

AB  - To this day, there is still some debate on the specific conditions that limit primary production in lakes. The discussion increases as this phenomenon is studied in temperate, subtropical, and tropical lakes. This work presents an analysis of the behavior of the total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratio (TN:TP) in Lake Cajititlan (Mexico). This subtropical lake, located within a small endorheic watershed, has presented a notable decrease in the TN:TP ratio in the last few years. Considering a TN:TP ratio <16 as the criterion indicative of nitrogen limitation for lakes located in the central-western region of Mexico, Lake Cajititlan has been predominately nitrogen limited from 2009 to 2020. From 2013 to 2020, the TN:TP ratio has declined to values below 10. This is reported in literature as a threshold value that favors algal blooms in subtropical lakes. This year also corresponds with the start of an unusually large fish die-off in the lake during August and early September. The TN:TP ratio exhibits a seasonal pattern, with the lowest mean values (TN:TP < 10) occurring during the dry season, and the highest values (TN:TP > 10) coincide with the rainy season (TN:TP > 10). The seasonal variations in the TN:TP ratio are primarily controlled by the annual precipitation regime, which increases the organic matter and nutrient loads to the lake mostly from treated and raw wastewater discharges, and from the runoff from agricultural land that extends along the entire lowlands of the lake watershed. The use of the TN:TP ratio as an environmental indicator is proposed, to guide public policies and governance practices in order to reduce the high level of eutrophication of the lake and rescue the potential uses of the lake and its watershed.

AB  - Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is present in numerous body fluids and generally blood cells. It is undoubtedly the utmost promising tool among all components of liquid biopsy. Liquid biopsy is a specialized method investigating the non-solid biological tissue by revealing circulating cells, cell-free DNA, etc., that enter the body fluids. Since cancer cells disengage from compact tumors circulating in peripheral blood, evaluating cancer patients' blood profile is essential for the molecular level analysis of various tumor-derived constituents. Cell-free DNA samples can deliver a significant diagnosis in oncology, for instance, tumor heterogeneity, rapid tumor development, response to therapy and treatment, comprising immunotherapy, and mechanisms of cancer metastasis. Malignant growth at any phase can cause the occurrence of tumor cells in addition to fragments of neoplasticity. Liquid biopsy indicates diverse blood-based biomarkers comprising circulating tumor cells (CTCs), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) or cfDNA, circulating RNA (cfRNA), and exosomes. Cell-free DNAs are little DNA fragments circulating in plasma or serum, just as other fluids present in our body. Cell-free DNA involves primarily double-stranded nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA, present both on a surface level and in the vesicles' lumen. The probable origins of the tumor-inferred portion of cfDNA are apoptosis or tumor necrosis, lysis of CTCs or DNA release from the tumor cells into circulation. The evolution of innovations, refinement, and improvement in therapeutics to determine the fragment size of cfDNA and its distribution provide essential information related to pathological conditions of the cell, thus emerging as a promising indicator for clinical output in medical biotechnology.

AB  - Plants emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which undergo photochemical reactions to generate secondary organic aerosols and cause ozone (O-3) accumulation; thus, they are the focus of urban pollution control strategies. Although some studies on biogenic VOCs and aerosols have been conducted, their environmental effects at the community scale are uncertain, particularly in suburban areas where abundant vegetation and pollutants coexist. Simple data processing methods cannot well address complex environmental conditions, whereas the long short-term memory (LSTM) model can learn relationships between research objects autonomously, thus enabling the analysis of influencing factors. Therefore, we collected 11 indicators of isoprene and submicron aerosol (PM1) concentrations, as well as other pollutants and meteorological factors, for six consecutive months in a suburban plantation in Shanghai. On the basis of correlation and redundancy analyses, LSTM was used to determine the main environmental factors influencing isoprene and PM1 concentrations. The results showed that nitrogen oxides (NOX), O-3, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and temperature had the highest influence. The reactions between NOX, O-3, and isoprene, PM1 are complex, and high levels of both isoprene and NOX in suburban areas may favor O-3 production. PAR and temperature control the emission and photooxidation of isoprene and influence their conversion from a gaseous state to a particulate state. Considering the complex atmospheric environment, this study analyzed the sensitivity of isoprene and PM1 to environmental factors by artificial intelligence method. It demonstrated the effectiveness of LSTM for analyzing complex time-series data with unknown mapping relationships, which provided solutions for large-scale studies. And the results provided a scientific basis to further explain the mechanism through which influencing factors affect suburban communities and to control suburban air pollution.

AB  - Pakistan is among the most vulnerable regions to climate change impacts, in particular the agricultural areas found in the worlds' largest contiguous irrigation system, the Indus River Basin (IRB). This study assesses the impacts of two climate change scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways-RCPs 4.5 and 8.5) on soil evaporation and transpiration rates, crop water productivity (CWP) and wheat and sugarcane yields over the 21st century, under two irrigation schedules (less/more frequent irrigation and higher/lower volume) for six locations along the Sindh and Punjab provinces. Maximum and minimum temperatures are projected to increase across the study area over the course of the 21st century. Additionally, precipitation is projected to increase (decrease) along the southernmost (northernmost) areas during the summer rainy season from June to September. To evaluate the crop-water productivity of wheat and sugarcane, we used the AquaCrop model in the six selected locations. For assessing the goodness of model validation and calibration, different statistical indicators are considered for comparing simulated and observed inter-annual yield variability (e.g. NRMSE of 12.4% and 12.1% for wheat and sugarcane, average values of the calibration and validation process). Our results show that wheat yields are likely to remain constant over time across the study areas, whereas sugarcane yields are expected to experience a decline in the Sindh province and an exponential increase in the Punjab province up to 2080, then yields will start to decline. In addition, our results reveal that both crops perform better, in terms of CWP, under low frequent irrigation and higher volumes of water. Overall, the findings of this work also support policymakers and project developers to implement adaptation strategies to cope with changing environmental conditions in a country where pressure on water resources is expected to continue to grow.

AB  - Global solar radiation is an important atmospheric stimulus affecting the human body and has been used in heliotherapy for years. In addition to environmental factors, the effectiveness of global solar radiation is increasingly influenced by human activity. This research was based on the use of heliographic and actinometric data (1996-2015) and the model distribution of global solar radiation to determine the possibility of heliotherapy with the example of two health resorts: Cieplice and Kolobrzeg (Poland). The solar features of health resorts (sunshine duration and global solar radiation) were characterized, and they were correlated with the spatial distribution of global solar radiation data obtained with the use of remote sensing techniques (System for Automated Geoscientific Analyzes-SAGA), including COoRdination and INformation on the Environment (CORINE) land cover (CLC) data. Using the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt), a qualitative and quantitative relationship between morphometric parameters and solar climate features was demonstrated for individual land cover types. Studies have shown that the period of late spring and summer, due to the climate's solar features, is advisable for the use of heliotherapy. The human activity that determines the land cover is the main element influencing the spatial differentiation of the possibilities of using this form of health treatment. It also affects topographic indicators shown as significant in the MaxEnt predictive model. In general, areas with high openness were shown as predisposed for health treatment using global solar radiation, which is not consistent with areas commonly used for heliotherapy. The conducted research has shown the need for an interdisciplinary approach to the issue of heliotherapy, which will contribute to the optimization of the use of this form of health treatment from the perspective of climate change and human pressure.

AB  - The retention behavior of a series of acidic drugs, namely ketoprofen (KET), naproxen (NAP), diclofenac (DIC), and ibuprofen (IBU), on the heat-resisting ZORBAX 300SB-C-18 column, was studied thermodynamically using high-temperature liquid chromatography (HTLC). A perfect correlation of the compounds' lipophilicity and the calculated thermodynamic indicators evidenced its contribution to the retention behavior. Besides, the steric fitting has a subsidiary effect on IBU retention. Isocratic HTLC separation of the four compounds was achieved using an aqueous mobile phase containing 30% acetonitrile-0.2% acetic acid-0.2% triethylamine at 60 degrees C. This method has been utilized to monitor the adsorption efficiency of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) for the removal of the four NSAIDs from water. Different variables affecting the remediation process have been optimized such as the time of contact, pH, ionic strength, temperature, and the mass of MWCNTs. The kinetics and thermodynamics of the adsorption were investigated. The adsorption was evidenced to take place via pseudo-second-order kinetics and the intraparticle diffusion is the rate-controlling step. The thermodynamic investigation showed that the adsorption process is exothermic and enthalpy-driven, and the adsorption is more extensive at a lower temperature. The MWCNTs showed excellent adsorption efficiency of about 76.4 to 97.6% at the optimum conditions. The obtained results are promising and encouraging for the full-scale application of MWCNTs for remediation of NSAIDs-related water pollution. The green analytical chemistry metric "AGREE" and the analytical eco-scale score tool confirmed that the developed protocol is greener and more favorable to the environment and user than most of the reported literature.

AB  - Cetaceans are long-lived, social species that are valued as ambassadors inspiring the public to engage in conservation action. Under professional care, they are critical partners with the scientific community to understanding the biology, behavior, physiology, health, and welfare requirements of this taxonomic group. The Cetacean Welfare Study was a highly collaborative research effort among zoos and aquariums accredited by the Alliance for Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums and/or the Association of Zoos & Aquariums that provided important empirical and comparative information on the care and management of cetaceans. The goal was to identify factors that were related to the welfare of bottlenose dolphins and to develop reference intervals and values for common and novel indicators of health and welfare for common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus), beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas), and Pacific white-sided dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens). Data were collected from cetaceans at 43 accredited zoos and aquariums in seven countries in 2018 and 2019. This overview presents a summary of findings from the initial research articles that resulted from the study titled "Towards understanding the welfare of cetaceans in zoos and aquariums." With multiple related objectives, animal-based metrics were used to advance frameworks of clinical care and target key conditions that were associated with good welfare of cetaceans in zoo and aquarium environments. As a result of this collaboration, species-specific reference intervals and values for blood variables and fecal hormone metabolites were developed and are freely available in an iOS application called ZooPhysioTrak. The results suggested that environmental enrichment programs and social management factors were more strongly related to behaviors likely indicative of positive welfare than habitat characteristics for common and Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins. These findings can be widely applied to optimize care and future science-based welfare practice.

AB  - Objectives. During the current covid-19 pandemic, healthcare students had to stop their face-to-face attendance at medical colleges and universities. This condition has resulted in a change in how learning and assessment of psychiatric and interprofessional practice occur. The pandemic has also increased clinical mentors' need to follow their mentees' educational progress via virtual technology, including smart-phone-based educational apps. The aim of the study is to propose a model in psychiatric and medical interprofessional practice e-assessment. Methods. In this study, 228 undergraduate healthcare students underwent a training period in interprofessional practice across specialties being assessed by Ecological Momentary e-Assessment (EMeA), and consisting of ongoing or before/after Interprofessional Education (IPE) learning evaluations with the assistance of an IPE-app linked to online surveys. The Goodness of Fit Test Chi-square and t-test statistics analyzed the data. Results. Surveys during, at entry and exit points in IPE captured increased percentages of learners, specifically, reporting high patient satisfaction with interprofessional teams (chi(2)=22.54; p<.01), learners experiencing very good quality of care when delivered by interprofessional teams (chi(2)=30.02; p<.01) assessed by distance technology, and learners selecting less frequently peers from the same clinical background when support was needed in patient care (chi(2)=19.84; p<.01). Conclusions. Contextual assessment (in the real-time and real-world scenario) of IPE learning moments via EMeA shows its value and applicability during the current covid-19 pandemic when the assessment of learning cannot occur face-to-face between learners and teachers. All healthcare students, including those on psychiatric rotations, could log in their progress, self-reflective assessments, and responses to coordinated care in interprofessional teams, without needing direct contact with their clinical tutors, and while treating patients with mental and physical illnesses, also including covid-19 positive patients.

AB  - Recent EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) reports highlighted that the ecological risk assessment of pesticides needed to go further by taking more into account the impacts of chemicals on biodiversity under field conditions. We assessed the effects of two commercial formulations of fungicides separately and in mixture, i.e., Cuprafor Micro (R) (containing 500 g kg(-1) copper oxychloride) at 4 (C1, corresponding to 3.1 mg kg(-1) dry soil of copper) and 40 kg ha(-1 )(C10), and Swing (R) Gold (50 g L-1 epoxiconazole EPX and 133 g L-1 dimoxystmbin DMX) at one (D1, 5.81 10(-2) and 1.55 10(-1) mg kg(-1) dry soil of EPX and DMX, respectively) and ten times (D10) the recommended field rate, on earthworms at 1, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after the application following the international ISO standard no. 11268-3 to determine the effects on earthworms in field situations. The D10 treatment significantly reduced the species diversity (Shannon diversity index, 54% of the control), anecic abundance (29% of the control), and total biomass (49% of the control) over the first 18 months of experiment. The Shannon diversity index also decreased in the mixture treatment (both fungicides at the recommended dose) at 1 and 6 months after the first application (68% of the control at both sampling dates), and in C10 (78% of the control) at 18 months compared with the control. Lumbricus terrestris, Aporrectodea caliginosa, Aporrectodea giardi, Aporrectodea Tonga, and Allolobophora chlorotica were (in decreasing order) the most sensitive species to the tested fungicides. This study not only addressed field ecotoxicological effects of fungicides at the community level and ecological recovery, but it also pinpointed some methodological weaknesses (e.g., regarding fungicide concentrations in soil and statistics) of the guideline to determine the effects on earthworms in field situations.

AB  - A precise estimation of the state of charge (SoC) of the lithium-ion battery is crucial for reducing range-anxiety and improving the performance of the electric vehicle (EV) battery management system. An accurate estimation of the SoC, however, has remained elusive due to the complex and nonlinear behavior of the battery. In this article, a new mixed estimation model (MEM) for the battery parameters and the SoC estimation is proposed, where the route is specified before the travel. The new MEM uses a combination of a battery power-based method (BPBM), a combined model, and a partial adaptive forgetting factor recursive least-square (PAFF-RLS) SoC calibration algorithm to make use of the best characteristics of each model to determine a better and more accurate SoC estimation. The partial adaptive forgetting factors solves the issue of the different rate changes in the battery parameters and reduces the complexity of the algorithm compared to the fully adaptive recursive models. The BPBM allows various traveling factors to be included in the model, such as the environmental conditions, the effect of auxiliary loads, and the traffic congestion. To verify the validity of the PAFF-RLS algorithm, two laboratory tests using real-time driving cycles have been conducted on a 2012 Nissan Leaf 31.1 Ah Manganese-oxide Li-ion battery cell. The effectiveness of the MEM model has been demonstrated by driving the Nissan Leaf along two selected routes in Australia. The results demonstrate the great accuracy of the proposed method for the SoC estimation, when compared with those from the previous models.

AB  - Passive sampling to regularly identify the occurrence of pyrethroid insecticides in urban streams is a crucial work of risk management with respect to intrinsic toxicity of pyrethroids to aquatic organisms. Polymeric films, based on an equilibrium sampling principle, have found increasing use as passive samplers for hydrophobic contaminants. Herein, we investigated two thin-film samplers, namely silicone rubber (SR) and polyvinylchloride (PVC), compatible with a suite of 8 pyrethroids, for measuring freely dissolved concentrations (C-free) in water. The characteristics of SR and PVC samplers were estimated in terms of equilibrium partitioning coefficients (K-f) with log units of 3.90-4.67 and sampling rates (R-s) of 0.011-0.016 L/h. The parameters were correlated positively with octanol-water partition coefficients of the compounds, whereas independent on water solubility. A strong agreement between C-free obtained from the two samplers was observed in a range of 0.1-10 mu g/L for pyrethroids under laboratory simulated conditions. Both of SR and PVC were confirmed as equilibrium samplers with faster sampling rates of pyrethroids that equilibrated on films within only one week, and higher accumulation at factors of 5.3-12.5 and 1.5-2.4 compared to a performance reference compound (PRC)-preload sampler. Additionally, the comparable results of the two passive sampling methods in multiple field applications indicated that the direct deployment of the two samplers without PRCs calibration can provide reliable assessment of trace concentrations. This study demonstrated the routine utilization of SR and PVC as promising tools for rapid and sensitive in-situ monitoring of pyrethroids, and indicators for the bioavailability against total chemical concentrations in variable aquatic environments.

AB  - Additives are ubiquitously used in plastics to improve their functionality. However, they are not always desirable in their 'second life' and are a major bottleneck for chemical recycling. Although research on extraction techniques for efficient removal of additives is increasing, it resembles much like uncharted territory due to the broad variety of additives, plastics and removal techniques. Today solvent-based additive extraction techniques, solid-liquid extraction and dissolution-precipitation, are considered to be the most promising techniques to remove additives. This review focuses on the assessment of these techniques by making a link between literature and physicochemical principles such as diffusion and Hansen solubility theory. From a technical point of view, dissolution-precipitation is preferred to remove a broad spectrum of additives because diffusion limitations affect the solid-liquid extraction recoveries. Novel techniques such as accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) are promising for finding the balance between these two processes. Because of limited studies on the economic and environmental feasibility of extraction methods, this review also includes a basic economic and environmental assessment of two extreme cases for the extraction of additives. According to this assessment, the feasibility of additives removal depends strongly on the type of additive and plastic and also on the extraction conditions. In the best-case scenario at least 70% of solvent recovery is required to extract plasticizers from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) via dissolution-precipitation with tetrahydrofuran (THF), while solid-liquid extraction of phenolic antioxidants and a fatty acid amide slip agents from polypropylene (PP) with dichloromethane (DCM) can be economically viable even without intensive solvent recovery.

AB  - In the process of the study of foreign language as a phenomenon of culture and language model of the world of a certain linguocultural community, a new paradigm of foreign language education is being built with the aim of developing a person with intercultural foreign language competence and adaptation in a new educational space. In accordance with this, new ways are being sought to enter into real intercultural communication. The problem of the study is to determine how, using communicative discourse, it is possible to train intercultural foreign-language competence of bachelor of linguistics, including knowledge of foreign-language culture and ways of interaction of representatives of different linguistic and cultural communities with the establishment on development of cultural and linguistic personality of students in conditions of educational environment of the university. The use of communicative discourse seems appropriate because, firstly, communicative discourse characterizes communication in the form of language means and their stylistic use, secondly, reveals communicative context and pragmatic settings, indicates communicative intentions of the subject of communication, and thirdly exposes ethno-psychological features of the subject of communication belonging simultaneously to language, culture and personality. It follows that the formation of intercultural foreign-language competence requires not only linguistic but also linguistic and ethno-cultural knowledge of the context of communication, where the ethno-cultural and sociocultural characteristics of communication subjects representing different cultures are traced. Considering communication discourse as speech in a social context and social action, we highlight its typical indicators and reveal them through the components of filling the educational environment in the university when forming the intercultural foreignlanguage competence of bachelor of linguistics. In this case, it is a question of creating a cognitive-discursive concept of teaching intercultural foreign-language competence on the basis of comprehensive consideration of communicative discourse and its design in the educational environment of the university.

AB  - The Kulunda Steppe in southwestern Siberia is one of the most intensely used agricultural landscapes in the world. Today it is characterized by depletive soil management practices and intensities that are unadapted to the local site conditions. Severe soil degradation and a loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) occurs at agriculturally used areas. So far, only fewstudies analyzed the spatial extent of these degradation effects and came to inconsistent assessments. We consider that different results arise from different definitions of SOC changes and from different spatial scales. Thus, local soils under different land-uses were sampled to a depth of 30 cm to determine land use dependent changes in topsoil SOC. Site specific soil data was merged with appropriate land-use classifications and soil maps from the mid-1970s and up-to-date data from 2013/2014 to balance land use corrected SOC pools. Here, we use a hierarchical approach to extrapolate local findings to regional and biome scale for typical and dry steppe. At the test area, land-use changed only moderately after the Soviet period. The steppe biomes are also characterized by large areas that are not affected by land-use change and ensuing SOC loss. Agricultural use led to a mean carbon loss of 23.3% for Chernozem soils and 13.9% for Kastanozems. Natural heterogeneities, such as small scale changes in relief or soil type, are missing in small scale maps due to generalization that leads to varying results. The calculated region wide SOC loss is maximally 15.2% using the small scale map. Following different calculation approaches, according to different map scales, detailed or coarse resolution SOC-stocks differ by up to 59.7%. Consequently, subsequent calculations or modellings may include this uncertainty into consideration. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - With rapid urbanization and industrialization processes, the problem of groundwater pollution under the influence of various human activities has become increasingly severe in most developed areas of China. However, the problem of dissolved salt pollution caused by increasing concentrations of conventional ions is often overlooked and easier to be seen as a high background of natural formation rather than pollution. The Hutuo River alluvial fan in North China was selected as the study area; dissolved salt pollution is evaluated based on the factor analysis method (FA); groundwater exploitation, pollutant input, and the attenuation of the vadose zone were discussed to explain the salt pollution; the formation mechanism and different source contributions were also explored. The results show that the total hardness (TH) and nitrate are the main contributing indicators of salt pollution in the Hutuo River alluvial fan. The long-term overexploitation of groundwater promoted the leaching and nitrification reactions, resulting in a large area of moderate to strong salt pollution in the top unit of the alluvial fan, which accounted for 51.6% of the salt pollution according to the multivariate regression model. In addition, the input pollution generated by various types of pollution sources along with rainfall infiltration is also an important driving factor. The surface pollution load and hydrogeological conditions affected the cation exchange and leaching, resulting in a point distribution of strong salt pollution, with a contribution rate of 37.6%. The analysis of the factors that affect salt pollution and the specific contributions in different regions cannot only help decision-makers understand the causes of water quality deterioration but also propose solutions in a targeted manner.

AB  - A wide range of endocrine disruptor compounds are routinely discharged to the ecosystem. Water contaminated with these compounds has a potential effect on the reproductive physiology of aquatic organisms as well as humans. In the present study, we tested the effect of the steroid estrogen, 17 beta-estradiol, on Biomphalaria alexandrina, a snail species that is widely distributed in Egypt and that acts as an intermediate host for the human blood fluke, Schistosoma mansoni. The effects of exposure to 0.3mg/L and 1mg/L 17 beta-estradiol on fecundity (M-X) and reproductive rate (R-0) of B. alexandrina were recorded. In addition, levels of steroid sex hormones and antioxidants in the hemolymph and ovotestis (OT) of exposed snails were measured. Histopathological changes in the OT of B. alexandrina were also investigated. Exposure to 0.3mg/L and 1mg/L 17 beta-estradiol caused a significant increase in the number of egg masses per snail after 3weeks and 1week of exposure for the two tested concentrations compared with unexposed controls. An increase in the levels of progesterone hormone was recorded in the hemolymph of exposed snails in comparison with unexposed controls. Additionally, levels of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione (GSH) were increased in the hemolymph and OT tissues of snails after 2 and 4weeks of exposure. Histopathological sections in the OT revealed an increase in the oocyte and a decrease in the sperm densities after 2weeks and this effect was restored to normal conditions after 4weeks of exposure to both tested concentrations. The current results indicate that B. alexandrina is sensitive to 17 beta-estradiol and can therefore be used as bioindicator and model organism for the assessment of water pollution with endocrine disruptor compounds.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) concentrations in the liver and the quadriceps muscle of adult stone marten (9 specimens) and pine marten (11 specimens) from Central Italy were assessed. No significant difference in the heavy metal values for each of the two selected tissues was detected for the two mustelid species. The measured heavy metal values were generally below the contamination level ranges from other areas of Central Italy and Croatia, except for the Cd in this latter area. Toxic Contamination Index (TCI) values for Cd showed high contamination levels both in the stone marten (most synanthropic species, colonizing mainly suburban environments) and in pine marten (species less adaptable to the anthropic environments, colonizing mainly rural and forest environments). High TCI values for Pb were detected only in stone marten. This fact indicates a higher Pb contamination in suburban habitats, probably due to the past use of leaded gasoline and still currently released by several anthropogenic activities, as the industrial emissions of mineral processing and incinerators, making Pb one of the most common heavy metal contaminant in soils. The present study suggests that stone marten and pine marten can be good bioindicators with a complementary role regarding the evaluation of the heavy metal contamination in a given territory. When high levels of TCI (in our case for Cd) are detectable in selected tissues of both stone marten and pine marten, it means that we are in the presence of widespread pollution. On the other hand, when this condition is observed only for stone marten (in our case for Pb), it means that we are in the presence of a local contamination mainly localized in areas with high anthropization.

AB  - The humphead wrasse (Cheilinus undulatus) and bumphead parrotfish (Bolbometopon muricatum) are two of the largest, most iconic fishes of Indo-Pacific coral reefs. Both species form prized components of subsistence and commercial fisheries and are vulnerable to overfishing. C. undulatus is listed as Endangered and B. muricatum as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. We investigated how night spearfishing pressure and habitat associations affected both species in a relatively lightly exploited setting; the Kia fishing grounds, Isabel Province, Solomon Islands. We used fisheries-independent data from underwater visual census surveys and negative binomial models to estimate abundances of adult C. undulatus and B. muricatum as a function of spearfishing pressure and reef strata. Our results showed that, in Kia, night spearfishing pressure from free divers had no measurable effect on C. undulatus abundances, but abundances of B. muricatum were 3.6 times lower in areas of high spearfishing pressure, after accounting for natural variations due to habitat preferences. It is likely the species' different nocturnal aggregation behaviors, combined with the fishers' use of night spearfishing by spot-checking underpin these species' varying susceptibility. Our study highlights that B. muricatum is extremely susceptible to night spearfishing; however, we do not intend to draw conservation attention away from C. undulatus. Our data relate only to the Kia fishing grounds, where human population density is low, the spot-checking strategy is effective for reliably spearing large numbers of fish, particularly B. muricatum, and fisheries have only recently begun to be commercialized; such conditions are increasingly rare. Instead, we recommend that regional managers assess the state of their fisheries and the dynamics affecting the vulnerability of the fishes to fishing pressure based on local-scale, fisheries-independent data, where resources permit.

AB  - Many researchers have studied the influence of rainfall patterns on soil water movement processes using rainfall simulation experiments. However, less attention has been paid to the influence under natural condition. In this paper, rainfall, soil water content (SWC), and soil temperature at 10-, 20-, 30-, 40-, and 50-cm depths were simultaneously monitored at 1-min intervals to measure the variation in SWC (SWCv) in response to rainfall under different rainfall patterns. First, we classified rainfall events into four patterns. During the study period, the main pattern was the advanced rainfall pattern (38% of all rainfall events), whereas the delayed, central, and uniform rainfall patterns had similar frequencies of about 20%. During natural rainfall, rainwater rapidly passed through the top soil layers (10-40cm) and was accumulated in the bottom layer (50cm). When a high rainfall pulse occurred, the water storage balance was disturbed, resulting in the drainage of initial soil water from the top layers into the deeper layers. Therefore, the critical function of the top layers and the bottom layers was infiltration and storage, respectively. The source of water stored in the bottom layer was not only rainfall but also the initial soil water in the upper soil layers. Changes in soil temperature at each soil depth were comonitored with SWCv to determine the movement characteristics of soil water under different rainfall patterns. Under the delayed rainfall pattern, preferential flows preferred to occur. Under the other rainfall patterns, matrix flow was the main form of soil water movement. Rainfall amount was a better indicator than rainfall intensity for SWCv in the bottom layer under the delayed rainfall pattern. These results provide insights into the responses of SWCv under different rainfall patterns in northern China.

AB  - Assessing and comparing the pest killing capacity of predators is a crucial but laborious task during the implementation of sustainable farming systems. Critical attributes of assessment include quantifying predator's attack rate (a) and handling time (T-h). The maximum attack rate (T/T-h) (i.e. the maximum number of prey that can be attacked by a predator during the time interval (T) considered) could be a more precise and interpretable indicator of the potential suppression of pests exerted by a predator; however, its calculation only provides a point estimator usually derived from incomplete datasets (e.g. unbalanced or low replicated experimental designs) that could lead to draw wrong conclusions. We introduce simaR (simulation of maximum attack rates using R), an R library that generates 95% confidence intervals around estimates of the maximum attack rate that can be easily and intuitively used to compare across species. We validated the simulation method and used the empirical results of a controlled laboratory experiment to compare the maximum attack rates of spiders across a range of Medfly prey densities and illustrate how to use simaR with non-replicated partial data. Applying our method we found a significant effect of temperature on the maximum attack rate of two different guilds of spiders, the orb-weaver A. cucurbitina and the ambusher S. globosum that was not relevant regarding their attack rate and handling time. Our method compares different predator species and/or experimental conditions in a simple and reproducible procedure through an accurate, easy-to-use, fast and statistically robust analysis, based on simulation and bootstrapping, that can be used to assess the pest suppression potential of predators by simulating their functional responses from low-effort laboratory trials.

AB  - Logistics infrastructures play an important role in many fields of economic activity, substantially influencing land use planning. Despite this, scholars and practitioners have dedicated little attention to setting up efficient indicators able to define the effect that infrastructure investments have on industrial activities. Many theoretical and empirical studies have been dedicated to calculating the exact numerical effect of infrastructure investment on social wellbeing, but their explicative capacity has always proved to be scarce since it is difficult work and with high levels of arbitrariness. This work becomes much more difficult when it aims to determine the effects on industrial efficiency. In this paper, we will use an indicator to overcome the problems related to determination of the exact economic impact of infrastructure investment on an economic region or local territory and suggest land use policy models to analyse infrastructure economic impacts. More specifically, we will focus our attention on the factors affecting logistics and economic performance within the economic regions around twenty major European ports. By using the new ACIT (Autoregulation, Compensation, Invariance and Transversality) indicator, we show that positive effects, deriving from port logistics interventions, can occur in those regions that have an ACIT indicator positively associated with other variables, such as propensity to innovation and level of education. This indicator represents a starting point to study how, in the better performing regions, it could be possible to develop logistics services able to stimulate a higher level of transport demand and, at the same time, respect high standards in environmental quality. Finally, we explain how an improvement in logistics performances of a port region may determine an improvement in its socioeconomic and environmental conditions.

AB  - Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been a worldwide public health concern. Current widespread AMR pollution has posed a big challenge in accurately disentangling source-sink relationship, which has been further confounded by point and non-point sources, as well as endogenous and exogenous cross-reactivity under complicated environmental conditions. Because of insufficient capability in identifying source-sink relationship within a quantitative framework, traditional antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) signatures-based source-tracking methods would hardly be a practical solution.
   Results: By combining broad-spectrum ARG profiling with machine-learning classification SourceTracker, here we present a novel way to address the question in the era of high-throughput sequencing. Its potential in extensive application was firstly validated by 656 global-scale samples covering diverse environmental types (e.g., human/animal gut, wastewater, soil, ocean) and broad geographical regions (e.g., China, USA, Europe, Peru). Its potential and limitations in source prediction as well as effect of parameter adjustment were then rigorously evaluated by artificial configurations with representative source proportions. When applying SourceTracker in region-specific analysis, excellent performance was achieved by ARG profiles in two sample types with obvious different source compositions, i.e., influent and effluent of wastewater treatment plant. Two environmental metagenomic datasets of anthropogenic interference gradient further supported its potential in practical application. To complement general-profile-based source tracking in distinguishing continuous gradient pollution, a few generalist and specialist indicator ARGs across ecotypes were identified in this study.
   Conclusion: We demonstrated for the first time that the developed source-tracking platform when coupling with proper experiment design and efficient metagenomic analysis tools will have significant implications for assessing AMR pollution. Following predicted source contribution status, risk ranking of different sources in ARG dissemination will be possible, thereby paving the way for establishing priority in mitigating ARG spread and designing effective control strategies.

Both in marine and in lagoon sites, the results obtained in 2013-2015 showed a significant decline in the incidence of imposex in respect to those from the 2002 survey. In 2002, lagoon samples exhibited Relative Penis Size Index (RPSI) higher than marine samples, whereas no differences were detected in the recent survey, when all RPSI values were below 0.6%. Vas Deference Sequence Index (VDSI) mean values were over 4 before the ban introduction and below this value after that, indicating more critical conditions for gastropod population in 2002 rather than in 2013-15. Percentage of sterile females was up to 69% in 2002, whilst in the more recent survey no sterile female was found. Range of BT concentrations in gastropods decreased from 252 to 579 to 16-31 ng Sigma BT/g d.w. BT body burdens varied according to a gender dependant pattern, with higher concentrations observed in females than in males. A first attempt to propose a classification based on BT impact on H. trunculus, according to the Water Framework Directive, revealed that most sites were in Bad ecological status before the ban and attained a Poor/Moderate status after that.

AB  - The recycling of biosolids and livestock manure in agriculture may lead to the introduction of antibiotic residues, i.e., parent molecule and transformation products, into amended soils. Their fate in soils can be approached through the assessment of their environmental availability. In this work, the environmental availability of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and three transformation products (N-4-acetyl-SMX, 3-amino-5-methylisoxazole, aniline) was assessed in soils amended with sludge compost or cow manure throughout a three-month incubation, using soft extractions with CaCl2, EDTA or cyclodextrin solutions. First, the freeze-storage of soil samples was shown to decrease the SMX extractability. The SMX extractability depended on the initial concentration, the amendment type and the extracting solution at day 0. From 1.9% up to 63% of the SMX total content was initially extractable. The lowest fractions were quantified in EDTA extracts in which the dissolved organic matter was the most complex and responsible for high matrix effects in mass spectrometry compared to CaCl2 extracts. The purification of cyclodextrin extracts highly reduced the matrix effects, but CaCl2 was considered as the most suitable extractant. SMX extractability strongly decreased after the first 8 days of incubation to finally reach 0.4-0.8% after 84 days, whatever the initial conditions. This high decrease could be related to humification observed through the increasing complexity of extracted dissolved organic matter. Very low levels of transformation products were quantified throughout the incubation period. The low environmental availability of SMX was mainly due to its sorption on soil organic matter and resulted in its low biotransformation in these amended soils. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Little is known about vegetation changes in Icelandic peatlands in the context of soil chemical properties. By connecting soil chemical and physical characteristics with palaeobotanical data we examined interactions between climate, histosols, vegetation and land use during the Holocene.
   Exchangeable base cations, cation exchange capacity (CEC), base saturation (BS), decomposition rates, using carbon:nitrogen ratio (C:N) and von Post humification, and soil physical properties were determined. Vegetation development was reconstructed based on pollen analysis. The impact of geographic location was examined by comparing results from three sloping fens (coastal, inland and highland fringe).
   Minerogenic content was highest in the proximity of the active volcanic zone, reflected in higher C:N and nutrient content in the histosol profiles of the fens inland and at the highland fringe. The coastal site revealed exceptionally high BS. C:N was either stable throughout the profile or increased with depth. Plant species richness, and evenness based on pollen data, and pollen concentrations were greatest at the site with lowest nutrient levels.
   Minerogenic content facilitates the ability of histosols to bind nutrients. Plant growth is optimised at the sites with lower fertility levels. C:N alone is not a reliable indicator of decomposition rates, but depends on the quality of the organic parent material. Environmental conditions driven by climate changes caused alterations in vegetation and soil properties before the human settlement of Iceland (c. AD 870), but overall the histosols showed resilience towards severe degradation. After the settlement, the histosols struggled to buffer the impact caused by destruction of vegetation and increased erosion. This study increases our understanding of environmental and anthropogenic determinants of soil- and vegetation development.

AB  - Water harvesting techniques (WHTs) improve the availability of water, which is essential for growing crops, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. A decision support approach can help in the selection of WHTs suitable under site-specific bio-physical and socio-economic conditions. This paper describes a participatory approach for the selection of suitable WHTs in watersheds in (semi) arid regions. It builds on a database of suitability indicators for WHTs, which was developed by integrating worldwide knowledge on their suitability. Once developed, the approach was applied on a case study for WHTs in the upper Geba watershed in northern Ethiopia. First, based on evaluation criteria and participants' scientific and local knowledge, a pre-selection of most promising WHTs took place in a multi-stakeholder workshop. Next, the suitability indicators and a GIS-based multi-criteria analysis (MCA) were used to identify suitable areas for these WHTs. The results of the MCA were presented to stakeholders during a second stakeholder workshop. At this workshop, a final selection of WHTs to test was made based on a participatory ranking of WHTs using economic, ecological and socio-cultural criteria. The MCA approach was validated by comparing the predicted suitable areas with the already existing WHTs in the watershed. This led to the result that 90% of the existing check dams and 93% of the percolation ponds were correctly identified by the approach. We conclude therefore that this approach can be successfully applied for the participatory selection of WHTs and the identification of suitable areas for their implementation. Given that this approach is based on the newly developed database of WHTs, it can be easily applied in other (semi) arid regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Controlled field experiments were carried out for monitoring the emissions of three plastic commercial household waste bins, which were adapted for studying the effect of aeration process in the evolved volatiles, during house storing of green food waste for 2 weeks, prior to collection. Three experimental scenarios were examined based on no aeration ("NA," closed commercial waste bin), diffusion-based aeration ("DA," closed commercial waste bin with tiny holes), and enforced aeration ("EA," closed commercial waste bin with tiny holes and enforced aeration). The monitoring of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from organic household kitchen waste was performed using solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS) analysis. Portable sensors were also used for monitoring selected gases and parameters of environmental, bioprocess, and health interest (e.g., CO2, O-2, H2S, CH4, NH3, % RH, waste temperatures). VOC emissions are strongly dependent on the waste material. The most frequent VOCs identified over the storing waste, showing over 50 % appearance in all examined samples, were terpenes (e.g., di-limonene, beta-myrcene, delta-3-carene, alpha-pinene, alpha-terpinolene, linalool, etc.), sulfides (dimethyl disulfide), aromatics (benzene, 1-methyl-2-(2-propenyl)), alkanes (e.g., decane, dodecane), ketones (2-propanone), esters (e.g., acetic acid ethyl ester, acetic acid methyl ester), and alcohols (e.g., 3-cyclohexen-1-ol, 4-methyl-1-(1-methylethyl)). The prominent role of terpenes in the "pre-compost" odor and especially that of di-limonene was highlighted. In all examined scenarios, the emitted volatiles were increased at raised temperatures and later decreased in time. Aeration of waste bins slightly affected the volatilization process resulting in higher profiles of VOCs; uniformity in the composition of VOCs was also noted. Slight modifications of commercial waste bins may favor the initiation of home composting.

AB  - Groundwater-dependent ecosystems are threatened worldwide by unsustainable groundwater (GW) extraction. This is the case of the Prosopis tamarugo Phil forest in the hyper-arid Atacama Desert (Northern Chile), one of the most extreme ecosystems on Earth. Despite concerns about the conservation of this ecosystem, little research has been done to quantify the effects of the increasing GW depth (GWD) on the Tamarugo population. Here we provide a spatio-temporal assessment of the water condition of Tamarugo trees and propose GWD thresholds for their conservation. We studied spatio-temporal changes of GWD and the water status of the forest using Landsat images and hydrogeological records (1988-2013). This was complemented with a digital inventory and estimation of the green canopy fraction (GCF) of all trees using fine resolution satellite images. Since Tamarugos are solar trackers, their canopy spectral reflectance changes on a diurnal and seasonal basis. Thus, novel remote sensing drought stress indicators were defined: the mean NDVI in winter (NDVIW) accounting for foliage loss and the NDVI difference between mean winter and summer (Delta NDVIW-S) accounting for canopy water loss. NDVIW and Delta NDVIW-S of the Tamarugo forest declined on average 19% and 51%, respectively, while GW depleted on average 3 m over the period 1988-2013. About 730,000 trees were identified in the study area, from which 5.2% showed a GCF < 0.25 associated with severe drought stress. A GWD > 12 m increasingly limited the paraheliotropic leaf movement, leading to dehydration and foliage loss. Tamarugos at 12-16 m GWD suffered moderate drought stress while GWD of 16-20 m implied severe drought stress. We suggest 20 m GWD as a critical threshold for the survival of Tamarugo trees.

AB  - This study was based mainly on environmental magnetic, soil science and geochemical methods to analyze the spatial variation of magnetic characteristics of the S5-1 paleosol (age similar to 470Ka) in a NW-SE transect from Xifeng, Linyou and Baoji sections from the Chinese Loess Plateau. The results show that (a) pedogenesis and chemical weathering of the coeval S5-1 paleosol layers increased with rainfall from Xifeng to Baoji, (b) the proportion of the pedogenic maghemite component decreased, while (c) the concentrations of weakly magnetic antiferromagnetic minerals (hematite and goethite) relatively increased. Maghemite and hematite appear to have formed simultaneously with development of pedogenesis, thus being similar in this aspect to soil in arid regions of SW Spain. However, amount of goethite did not show a consistent relationship as observed from magnetism in the three sections. Maghemite was found to be the main contributor to magnetic enhancement. Iron manganese cutans, an indicator of diagnesis, increased with the rainfall in the S5-1 paleosol layer from Xifeng to Baoji. As expected, they show that pedogenesis occurred intermittently between wet and dry conditions causing iron mineral transformation. However, we suggest that parts of the fine-grained strongly magnetic minerals (mainly oxidized magnetite and maghemite) were converted into weakly magnetic minerals (mainly hematite and goethite) by pedogenesis, which resulted in a decline in the finest superparamagnetic (SP) and stable single-domain (SSD) ferrimagnetic minerals, thus decreasing the susceptibility of S5-1 paleosol from north to south. This behavior in a high rainfall region is different from the aerobic soil in SW Spain in which part of the initial hydro-maghemite transformed only to hematite rather than goethite and hematite.

AB  - Lake Clark is an important nursery lake for sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in the headwaters of Bristol Bay, Alaska, the most productive wild salmon fishery in the world. Reductions in water clarity within Alaska lake systems as a result of increased glacial runoff have been shown to reduce salmon production via reduced abundance of zooplankton and macroinvertebrates. In this study, we reconstruct long-term, lake-wide water clarity for Lake Clark using the Landsat TM and ETM+ surface reflectance products (1985-2014) and in situ water clarity data collected between 2009 and 2013. Analysis of a Landsat scene acquired in 2009, coincident with in situ measurements in the lake, and uncertainty analysis with four scenes acquired within two weeks of field data collection showed that Band 3 surface reflectance was the best indicator of turbidity (r(2) = 0.55, RMSE << 0.01). We then processed 151 (98 partial- and 53 whole-lake) Landsat scenes using this relation and detected no significant long-term trend in mean turbidity for Lake Clark between 1991 and 2014. We did, however, detect interannual variation that exhibited a non-significant (r(2) = 0.20) but positive correlation (r = 0.20) with regional mean summer air temperature and found the month of May exhibited a significant positive trend (r(2) = 0.68, p = 0.02) in turbidity between 2000 and 2014. This study demonstrates the utility of hindcasting turbidity in a glacially influenced lake using the Landsat surface reflectance products. It may also help land and resource managers reconstruct turbidity records for lakes that lack in situ monitoring, and may be useful in predicting future water clarity conditions based on projected climate scenarios.

AB  - The Namling-Oiyug basin is the only Cenozoic lake basin that has hydrocarbon potential in southern Tibet, China. Coal was once exploited in the basin from the early Miocene Mangxiang Formation, which also hosts oil-prone source rock layers. Herein, a combined investigation of sedimentological features and organic geochemistry is performed on a measured outcrop section of the Mangxiang Formation to study the lake-basin types as well as the depositional history of aquatic and terrestrial organic matter (OM).
   There are two periods in the lake basin evolution history: the balanced-fill and overfilled stages. In the balanced-fill basin stage, oil-prone laminated shale was deposited in a relatively deep lake environment, with total organic carbon (TOC) contents around 5 wt.%, and HI values up to 316 mg HC/g TOC, indicating hydrogen-poor Type II kerogen with transition to Type III kerogen. Comparison between maceral composition and geochemical properties suggests that the relative low HI values are results of thermal maturity. The high value of the gammacerane index indicates water stratification of the lake. In this stage, water and sediment input approximately equaled potential accommodation, the lake was relatively stable and hosted large amounts of lacustrine algae, and accumulated OM with low terrestrial input in an anoxic environment. After the onset of the thrusting, the potential accommodation was decreased, large volumes of clastic sediments also drained into the lake from the surrounding area, resulting in an overfilled lake basin. During this stage, peat was deposited in freshwater environment, with >30 wt% TOC, low HI, and Type III OM. The high Pr/Ph (>3) implies oxic conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigated the influence of corn straw application on soil microbial communities and the relationship between such communities and soil properties in black soil. The crop used in this study was maize (Zea mays L.). The five treatments consisted of applying a gradient (50, 100, 150, and 200%) of shattered corn straw residue to the soil. Soil samples were taken from May through September during the 2012 maize growing season. The microbial community structure was determined using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. Our results revealed that the application of corn straw influenced the soil properties and increased the soil organic carbon and total nitrogen. Applying corn straw to fields also influenced the variation in soil microbial biomass and community composition, which is consistent with the variations found in soil total nitrogen (TN) and soil respiration (SR). However, the soil carbon-to-nitrogen ratio had no effect on soil microbial communities. The abundance of PLFAs, TN, and SR was higher in C1.5 than those in other treatments, suggesting that the soil properties and soil microbial community composition were affected positively by the application of corn straw to black soil. A Principal Component Analysis indicated that soil microbial communities were different in the straw decomposition processes. Moreover, the soil microbial communities from C1.5 were significantly different from those of CK (p<0.05). We also found a high ratio of fungal-to-bacterial PLFAs in black soil and significant variations in the ratio of monounsaturated-to-branched fatty acids with different straw treatments that correlated with SR (p<0.05). These results indicated that the application of corn straw positively influences soil properties and soil microbial communities and that these properties affect these communities. The individual PLFA signatures were sensitive indicators that reflected the changes in the soil environment condition.

AB  - The rise in the world demand for food poses a challenge to our ability to sustain soil fertility and sustainability. The increasing use of no-till agriculture, adopted in many areas of the world as an alternative to conventional farming, may contribute to reduce the erosion of soils and the increase in the soil carbon pool. However, the advantages of no-till agriculture are jeopardized when its use is linked to the expansion of crop monoculture. The aim of this study was to survey bacterial communities to find indicators of soil quality related to contrasting agriculture management in soils under no-till farming. Four sites in production agriculture, with different soil properties, situated across a west-east transect in the most productive region in the Argentinean pampas, were taken as the basis for replication. Working definitions of Good no-till Agricultural Practices (GAP) and Poor no-till Agricultural Practices (PAP) were adopted for two distinct scenarios in terms of crop rotation, fertilization, agrochemicals use and pest control. Non-cultivated soils nearby the agricultural sites were taken as additional control treatments. Tag-encoded pyrosequencing was used to deeply sample the 16S rRNA gene from bacteria residing in soils corresponding to the three treatments at the four locations. Although bacterial communities as a whole appeared to be structured chiefly by a marked biogeographic provincialism, the distribution of a few taxa was shaped as well by environmental conditions related to agricultural management practices. A statistically supported approach was used to define candidates for management-indicator organisms, subsequently validated using quantitative PCR. We suggest that the ratio between the normalized abundance of a selected group of bacteria within the GP1 group of the phylum Acidobacteria and the genus Rubellimicrobium of the Alphaproteobacteria may serve as a potential management-indicator to discriminate between sustainable vs. non-sustainable agricultural practices in the Pampa region.

AB  - The quest for sustainability in agricultural production through conservation management practices such as no-tillage, has favored the biochemical processes of soil, such as soil arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMFs), which promote a significant increase in specific surface absorption of the root system of plants. The objective of this study was to evaluate the root colonization, spore density and diversity of AMFs in rhizosphere of corn and soybean grown under no-tillage with different cover crops and compared an area conventional tillage and fallow, in Uberaba, state of Minas Gerais. The corn and soybeans were rotated with millet, crotalaria and brachiaria. The experimental design was randomized blocks, with split plots. The experiment was established in 2000, and in 2007 assessed the colonization (COL) and spore density (ESP) (0.0-0.05m and 0.05-0.10m). In the layer of 0.0-0.10m evaluated the diversity of AMFs. It was found that there was a strong effect of culture on COL and ESP. However, the effect of the covers and management was seen only in 0.0-0.05m. The roots of corn has a higher percentages of COL and ESP compared with soybeans, for the coverage Brachiaria and millet. The mycorrhizal colonization of soybean and maize in Cerrado area was up 80% for soybeans and up 95% for corn. Conventional tillage soil the lowest number of AMFs species in relation to the coverage of millet and Brachiaria in no-till corn and soybeans. The principal components analysis with some chemical, physical and biological factors of soil shows the separation of the areas assessed, and the biological component (COL and ESP) in the efficient separation of the areas under cultivation, for the conditions of this study.

AB  - Toxic at low concentrations, phenol is one of the most common organic pollutants in air and water. In this work, phenol biodegradation was studied in extreme conditions (80A degrees C, pH = 3.2) in a 2.7 l bioreactor with the thermoacidophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus 98/2. The strain was first acclimatized to phenol on a mixture of glucose (2000 mg l(-1)) and phenol (94 mg l(-1)) at a constant dissolved oxygen concentration of 1.5 mg l(-1). After a short lag-phase, only glucose was consumed. Phenol degradation then began while glucose was still present in the reactor. When glucose was exhausted, phenol was used for respiration and then for biomass build-up. After several batch runs (phenol < 365 mg l(-1)), specific growth rate (mu(X)) was 0.034 +/- A 0.001 h(-1), specific phenol degradation rate (q(P)) was 57.5 +/- A 2 mg g(-1) h(-1), biomass yield (Y(X/P)) was 52.2 +/- A 1.1 g mol(-1), and oxygen yield factor (Y(x/o2)) was 9.2 +/- A 0.2 g mol(-1). A carbon recovery close to 100% suggested that phenol was exclusively transformed into biomass (35%) and CO(2) (65%). Molar phenol oxidation constant (Y(o2/P)) was calculated from stoichiometry of phenol oxidation and introducing experimental biomass and CO(2) conversion yields on phenol, leading to values varying between 4.78 and 5.22 mol mol(-1). Respiratory quotient was about 0.84 mol mol(-1), very close to theoretical value (0.87 mol mol(-1)). Carbon dioxide production, oxygen demand and redox potential, monitored on-line, were good indicators of growth, substrate consumption and exhaustion, and can therefore be usefully employed for industrial phenol bioremediation in extreme environments.

AB  - Our analysis of the surface aerosol and ultraviolet (UV) measurements in Pearl River Delta (PRD) region shows that the surface UV radiation is reduced by more than 50% due to high aerosol concentrations. This has important impacts on urban ecosystem and photochemistry, especially on ozone photochemical production over the region. The quantitative effect of aerosols on surface ozone is evaluated by analyzing surface observations (including ozone, ultraviolet radiation, aerosol radiative parameters) and by using radiative and chemical models. A case study shows that the aerosol concentrations and UV radiation are significantly correlated with ozone concentrations. The correlation coefficient between the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the PM10 mass concentration is very high, with a maximum of 0.98, and the AOD and UV radiation/ozone is anticorrelated, with a correlation coefficient of -0.90. The analysis suggests that ozone productivity is significantly decreased due to the reduction of UV radiation. The noon-time ozone maximum is considerably depressed when AOD is 0.6, and is further decreased when AOD is up to 1.2 due to the reduction of ozone photochemical productivity. Because the occurring probability of aerosol optical depth for AOD(550 nm)a (c) 3/40.6 and AOD(340 nm)a (c) 3/41.0 is 47, and 55% respectively during the dry season (October, November, December, January), this heavy aerosol condition explains the low ozone maximum that often occurs in the dry season over the Guangzhou region. The analysis also suggests that the value of single scattering albedo (SSA) is very sensitive to the aerosol radiative effect when the radiative and chemical models are applied, implying that the value of SSA needs to be carefully studied when the models are used in calculating ozone production.

AB  - Water enrichment has been described to have major impact on the freshwater food-webs structure. We investigated the structure of the epilithic algal assemblage and the gut contents of a rheophilic orthoclad in situ in a nutrient enriched stream. 4-th instar larvae of Eukiefferiella claripennis, a widespread orthoclad in the Palearctic ecozone and abundant in nutrient-enriched streams, were chosen to be studied due to their great densities in such environment. The taxonomic composition of the epilithic algal assemblage, the gut contents and the ingested algal-cell biovolumes were used to establish the foraging behavior of this chironomid, and to explain its success under such environmental conditions. A CoInertia analysis, and a Two Way INdicator SPecies ANalysis were uses to compare the co-structure of algae assemblages in the epilithon and the guts. Then Strauss's linear food selection index was used to assess the electivity of each algae taxon. Cell biovolumes and distribution were also compared and tested for significant differences between the epilithic algal assemblage and the gut contents. Biovolumes of cells in the epilithon were tested for significant differences from the mean biovolume value of the ingested cells. Eukiefferiella claripennis larvae seem to feed preferentially on Chlorophyceae and Cyanophyceae; Diatomophyceae were randomly grazed without preference while Rhodophyceae were avoided. Cell biovolumes were significantly different between the epilithon and the gut contents, and the larvae preferentially consumed a narrow range of cell biovolumes compared to the wide range of cell biovolumes encountered in the environment. Stigeoclonium and Oscillatoria were the key taxa of the algal assemblage foraged by the larvae. Two complementary approaches seem to drive the foraging behavior of this orthoclad, 1) taxa-type preference and 2) cell-bivolume preference. In nutrient enriched streams, an algal assemblage consisting of cells of Chlorophyceae and Cyanophyceae averaging 1702 mu m(3) offers the best diet to this chironomid.

AB  - The loss of forest area globally due to change of land use, the importance of forests in the conservation of biodiversity and in carbon and other biogeochemical cycles, together with the threat to forests from pollution and from the impacts of climate change, place forestry policy and practice at the center of global environmental and sustainability strategy. Forests provide important economic, environmental, social, and cultural benefits, so that in forestry, as in other areas of environmental policy and management, there are tensions between economic development and environmental protection. In this article we review the current information on global forest cover and condition, examine the international processes that relate to forest protection and to sustainable forest management, and look at the main forest certification schemes. We consider the link between the international processes and certification schemes and also their combined effectiveness. We conclude that in some regions of the world neither mechanism is achieving forest protection, while in others local or regional implementation is occurring and is having a significant impact. Choice of certification scheme and implementation of management standards are often influenced by a consideration of the associated costs, and there are some major issues over the monitoring of agreed actions and of the criteria and indicators of sustainability. There are currently a number of initiatives seeking to improve the operation of the international forestry framework (e.g., The Montreal Process, the Ministerial Convention of the Protection of Forests in Europe and European Union actions in Europe, the African Timber Organisation and International Tropical Timber Organisation initiative for African tropical forest, and the development of a worldwide voluntary agreement on forestry in the United Nations Forum on Forests). We suggest that there is a need to improve the connections between scientific understanding, policy development, and forestry practice, and also the cooperation between the various international initiatives and processes, so that the international framework is more effective and its influence is extended geographically.

AB  - Trunk diameter variation (TDV) is considered one of the most promising tools for automating the scheduling of fruit tree irrigation, and trunk growth rate (TGR) a possible indicator of TDV values. The use of TGR in commercial orchards is less common in olive trees than in other species, possibly because the influence of the environment, orchard age and the presence of developing fruit on the olive tree seasonal TGR pattern is poorly understood. In this study the trunk growth rate (TGR) seasonal progression was characterized in fully irrigated young olive trees during fruiting and non-fruiting years. In both years, at the beginning of the season, a period with an almost linear increase was found, mainly determined by temperature. In the non-fruiting year TGR remained almost constant after that initial increase, while during the fruiting year a significant decrease occurred at approximately 25 days, from values around 0.2 mm day(-1) to values around 0. 1 mm day(-1). Since midday shoot water potentials were not affected, this variation was likely not produced by water stress conditions. In addition, the lack of relationship between trunk growth rate and air temperature indicated that the TGR decrease in the fruiting year was not determined either by air temperature. The period of decreasing TGR values, however, coincided with the time that the endocarp reached its maximum transverse area, a significant moment for fruit development which precedes pit hardening. These results suggest that the traditional period where regulated deficit irrigation is done, "the pit hardening", may be indicated easier and more accurate for TGR decrease and endocarp expansion.

AB  - Stream temperature is a complex function of energy inputs including solar radiation and latent and sensible heat transfer. In streams where groundwater inputs are significant, energy input through advection can also be an important control on stream temperature. For an individual stream reach, models of stream temperature can take advantage of direct measurement or estimation of these energy inputs for a given river channel environment. Understanding spatial patterns of stream temperature at a landscape scale requires predicting how this environment varies through space, and under different atmospheric conditions. At the landscape scale, air temperature is often used as a surrogate for the dominant controls on stream temperature. In this study we show that, in regions where groundwater inputs are key controls and the degree of groundwater input varies in space, air temperature alone is unlikely to explain within-landscape stream temperature patterns. We illustrate how a geologic template can offer insight into landscape-scale patterns of stream temperature and its predictability from air temperature relationships. We focus on variation in stream temperature within headwater streams within the McKenzie River basin in western Oregon. In this region, as in other areas of the Pacific Northwest, fish sensitivity to summer stream temperatures continues to be a pressing environmental issue. We show that, within the McKenzie, streams which are sourced from deeper groundwater reservoirs versus shallow subsurface flow systems have distinct summer temperature regimes. Groundwater streams are colder, less variable and less sensitive to air temperature variation. We use these results from the western Oregon Cascade hydroclimatic regime to illustrate a conceptual framework for developing regional-scale indicators of stream temperature variation that considers the underlying geologic controls on spatial variation, and the relative roles played by energy and water inputs.

AB  - Host-specific Bacteroides-Prevotella 16S rRNA genetic markers are promising alternative indicators for identifying the sources of fecal pollution because of their high abundance in the feces of warm-blooded animals and high host specificity. However, little is known about the persistence of these genetic markers in environments after being released into environmental waters. The persistence of feces-derived four different host-specific Bacteroides-Prevotella 16S rRNA genetic makers (total, human-, cow-, and pig-specific) in environmental waters was therefore investigated at different incubation temperatures (4, 10, 20, and 30 degrees C) and salinities (0, 10, 20, and 30 ppt) and then compared with the survival of conventional fecal-indicator organisms. The host-specific genetic markers were monitored by using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays with specific primer sets. Each host-specific genetic marker showed similar responses in non-filtered river water and seawater: They persisted longer at lower temperatures and higher salinities. In addition, these markers did not increase in all conditions tested. Decay rates for indicator organisms were lower than those for host-specific genetic markers at temperature above 10 degrees C. Furthermore, we investigated whether the PCR-detectable 16S rRNA genetic markers reflect the presence of live target cells or dead target cells in environmental waters. The result revealed that the detection of the Bacteroides-Prevotella 16S rRNA genetic markers in environmental waters mainly reflected the presence of 'viable but non-culturable' Bacteroides-Prevotella cells. These findings indicate that seasonal and geographical variations in persistence of these host-specific Bacteroides-Prevotella 16S rRNA genetic markers must be considered when we use them as alternative fecal indicators in environmental waters.

AB  - The carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13) of wood and leaf cellulose of beech trees (Fagus sylvatica L.) was studied at 80 sites in northeastern France. We sampled sites with contrasting water balance, depending on soil type and precipitation. We tested the hypothesis that inter-site variations in plant delta C-13 reflect the spatial distribution of soil water availability, and we assessed whether delta C-13 could be used as a bioindicator of soil water availability. Patterns of variation in delta C-13 were compared with estimates of monthly water balance and with other soil characteristics. Between-site variability in delta C-13 was high (2.9 parts per thousand range in wood cellulose, 2.1 parts per thousand in leaf cellulose), but variation in water availability appeared to be only a minor factor contributing to this variation in delta C-13. Unexpectedly, spatial variations in wood and leaf cellulose VC were significantly and positively related to soil fertility expressed by soil pH (r = 0.42 and 0.43, respectively) and cation content. On average, trees growing on acidic soils displayed 0.5 parts per thousand lower delta C-13 in both wood and leaf material than trees growing on neutral or calcareous soils. Our initial hypothesis of a strong negative relationship between delta C-13 and site water availability was not confirmed. In the study zone, neither wood nor leaf delta C-13 appeared to be a reliable bioindicator of spatial variations in water availability. Possible causes for the lack of a relationship are discussed. Our findings confirm, under natural conditions, the strong effect of soil fertility on water-use efficiency previously observed in experiments. This effect needs to be considered in isotopic studies involving different sites.

AB  - This study analyzes delta C-13 of subdivisions of the 1988 and 1989 growth rings from three conifer species (Pinus resinosa, Pinus strobus, and Picea glauca) across a network of nine sites over four states in the upper U. S. Midwest to infer seasonal and interannual environmental moisture conditions. Both years were characterized by different spatial patterns of drought (expressed through rainfall and Palmer Drought Indices), with the area of 1989 drought being smaller and shifting westward relative to 1988. Rings were subdivided into four equal segments from which holocellulose was separated. The range of delta C-13 variation within each ring was typically 1-2 parts per thousand for both years, and the single site where all three species co-occurred revealed coherent seasonal delta C-13 patterns for the pines but no correlation of the spruce delta C-13 patterns with those of the pines. Various averaged combinations of monthly Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and precipitation assigned to each subdivision versus both delta C-13 and discrimination (Delta approximate to delta C-13(air) - delta C-13(plant)) yielded significant correlations (generally higher with PDSI) and even stronger correlations when the spruce data were removed. The fraction of average monthly cumulative precipitation (relative to 1900 - 2001 means) for these 2 years was more strongly related to delta C-13 than either monthly precipitation or monthly fraction of average precipitation, but was not as strongly related to delta C-13 as was PDSI. Furthermore, the pattern of increasing delta C-13 in 1988 observed at several sites is an indicator of the increasing moisture stress of that year, and the difference between the 1988 and 1989 average isotopic compositions of the third and fourth subdivisions matched the regional moisture shift well.

AB  - The horizontal distribution of macrozooplankton (greater than or equal to3 mm) was studied with respect to changes in environmental conditions along 3 transects across the marginal ice zone (MIZ) in the NW Barents Sea during late winter (March 2000) and spring (May 1999). The water masses, which were identified by their salinity and temperature characteristics, largely determined the macrozooplankton composition, but season (late winter vs spring), geographical area (latitude and longitude) and bottom depth were also important. Almost 80% of the total macrozooplankton variability could be explained by changes in these environmental variables. Ice cover and the algal bloom situation had no significant impact on the horizontal macrozooplankton distribution early in the season (March to May). We sampled 3 main water masses: cold and less saline Arctic water (ArW), warm and saline Atlantic water (AtW) and mixtures of these (MIX); 5 distinct macrozooplankton communities were found, 2 in ArW (ArW bank and ArW slope), 2 in MIX (warm, >1degreesC, and cold, <0degreesC, MIX) and 1 in AtW. These communities were characterised by differences in species abundance rather than differences in taxonomic composition. Numerically important macrozooplankton were Calanus glacialis, C. hyperboreus, Thysanoessa inermis and Aglantha digitale. These were also important in terms of wet biomass together with Beroe cucumis, Clione limacina and Sagitta elegans. Good indicator species for ArW were C. glacialis, C. limacina, Mertensia ovum and Parathemisto libellulla, and for AtW Thysanoessa spp. (T. inermis, T. longicaudata and T. raschii). Characteristic for MIX, i.e. the Polar Front region, was low macrozooplankton abundance, biomass and species richness compared to AtW and ArW. Seasonal variability (late winter vs spring) accounted for 21% of the total macrozooplankton variability. Particularly the herbivores showed large seasonal variability in abundance and biomass, most probably due to their seasonal migration patterns.

AB  - The paper presents an index of vulnerability to climate variability, change and environmental hazard for Dhaka (mega-city) and Cumilla (medium-sized city), to determine how migrant-friendly the cities are for people fleeing rural poverty and environmental destruction. Three key functional components: adaptive capacity, sensitivity, and exposure; incorporating six parameters: demographic, political, economic, social, physical, and environmental and 36 indicators have been used to create the Vulnerability Index (VI). Data is utilised from 253 household surveys, focus groups, semi-structured in-depth interviews and secondary data analysis. Composite indices and differential vulnerabilities are presented and compared, demonstrating that Cumilla is less vulnerable to disruption caused by socio-economic, political and environmental change, has a higher adaptive capacity, and is less vulnerable overall than Dhaka. Unlike Dhaka, Cumilla suffers from fewer socio-economic disadvantages such as traffic congestion, crime, unemployment, and water access issues. In terms of exposure to adverse environmental events and trends, Dhaka suffers more flooding, waterlogging, air and water pollution, and higher annual temperature and temperature variability and lower monsoon rainfall and monsoon rainfall variability than Cumilla. The results suggest Cumilla could be a more migrant-friendly destination for poor migrants than Dhaka. This paper investigates the stresses and societal crisis in mega-cities, and contributes to devising plans to mitigate them. These findings are of increasing importance in a situation of increasing climate change and migratory flows caused in part by climate change. Overall, the results of this study could contribute to understanding the challenges faced by mega-cities with similar climatic, socioeconomic, urban, and vulnerability conditions, in which 1 billion people currently reside.

AB  - Meteorological series and phenological data were analyzed in the framework of our environmental monitoring in the southern taiga Central Forest Reserve. During the period 1984-2017, the average annual air temperature was 4.63 +/- 0.41 degrees C, and the average annual rainfall was 2.14 +/- 0.12 mm/day. For eight of the 43 (19%) climatic parameters, reliable linear trends of variability were found: an increase in air temperature in July, August, September, and December; an increase in soil temperature in December; an increase in precipitation in November and December; and a decrease in precipitation in September. Three causes of their directed long-term changes were revealed, namely: a shift of the winter timing, violation of the annual dynamics of climatic parameters, and a change in the type of precipitation during a longer fall, when snow is replaced by rain. Of the 11 species of vascular plants, the statistical significance of the long-term displacement of phenological dates was proven for Anemone nemorosa: the longer the fall and the softer the beginning of winter, the earlier the onset of its flowering. Two classification types of vascular plants were considered when identifying the interspecific synchrony in variation of the phenological events. The variability components of the occurrence of phenological phenomena were estimated: the share of long-term trends of the shift in the timing of phenological dates due to changes in the reserve's climatic system ranges from 20 to 68% of the total character dispersion; interannual climatic fluctuations explain 5-34% of its variability; and the proportion of variability under the influence of factors unaccounted for is high (21-64%). Species with a high proportion of their long-term variability components (Anemone nemorosa: more than 60%) are recommended for use as indicators of climate change in the conditions of the study area.

AB  - Most landfill leachates contain organic compounds that cannot be easily separated by conventional biological processes. Recently, integration of membrane bioreactors and electro-oxidation has been proposed as a suitable option for the treatment and separation of organic and inorganic contaminants in leachate. Therefore, in the present study, the performance of submerged electro-membrane bioreactor (SEMBR) along with a conventional membrane bioreactor (MBR) on a pilot scale was evaluated for the treatment of leachate. Both bioreactors were used to compare treatment efficiency under the same conditions. The removal rates of chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), phosphate (PO43--P), color, UV254, and metals were investigated. The results showed that applying electric current to the MBR could approximately increase the COD removal efficiency from 94 to 98.5%; PO43--P removal from 70 to 99%; NH3+-N removal from 91 to 99%; UV254 removal from 80 to 96%; and heavy metals removal from 40 to 95%. Humic acid removal efficiency as another indicator of humic substances was increased from 75% in the MBR to 96% in the SEMBR process. The results also showed that the effluent can be introduced into the wastewater treatment plant for further treatment. The SEMBR process achieved a minimization of fouling of membranes compared to conventional MBR. The consumption of the energy and electrode was in accordance with the previous results, and the required energy of 1.57 kWh/m(3) of wastewater was calculated. The sludge volume index (SVI) in SEMBR (105 ml/g) was better than MBR (135 ml/g) due to the electrokinetic effect on the production of denser flocs. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the application of electric current can improve the performance of MBR in removing PO43-, NH4+, and membrane fouling.

AB  - Benthic ostracods and foraminifers are commonly applied as paleoenvironmental indicators in shallow marine successions, ignoring that individual meiofaunal groups could provide distinct information. We aim to shed light on the distinct paleoecological record of benthic ostracods and foraminifers by analyzing the shallow marine Holocene succession of the Po Delta (Italy) in a sequence stratigraphic fashion. Multivariate elaborations connecting the modern North Adriatic reference set to fossil data allowed to investigate community dynamics, obtain quantitative estimates of (paleo-)environmental drivers and assess the meiofaunal response to coastal and delta dynamics through time and space under the influence of allogenic and autogenic factors. Benthic ostracods and foraminifers easily discern transgressive (TST) and highstand (HST) systems tract, and also discriminate between locations at different distance from paleo-river mouths under highstand conditions. Specifically, community changes reflecting shifts in delta regimes at distal locations suggest that lobe-fringe deposits are more indicated for paleoenvironmental purposes. We emphasize that a deep knowledge of the analyzed datasets should drive the interpretation of multivariate outputs, as reconstructed values from significantly similar deposits could be inappropriate, and the lack of true modern analogs could reflect authentic differences in community composition, or either pitfalls in the modern reference set. Our results show that ostracods evidence depositional regimes determined by the interplay of sediment supply and hydrodynamic energy in relationship with the position from main river outlets; on the other hand, foraminifers highlight changes in riverine inputs in terms of organic matter. Our findings demonstrate that shallow marine benthic ostracods and foraminifers provide distinct but complementary paleoecological information, and their integration allows to achieve high-resolution reconstructions.

AB  - Despite the crucial role of forage fish in ecosystem functions globally, data on population demographic structure are often not readily available for many forage fish stocks. Data to characterize variability in population size structure can be highly informative for population monitoring and management, as such data can be used to estimate cohort strength and recruitment, variation in growth rates, and for body-size dependent broadcast spawners such as anchovy, variation in reproductive capacity. In this study, Anchovy Length Indices (ALI) were developed for the central California portion of the central stock of Northern anchovy using predatorand trawl derived samples. Five different data sources were examined: seabird, sea lion and salmon diet, and midwater and acoustic-trawl surveys. Seabird and midwater trawl surveys had the longest time-series of data. Seabird and midwater trawl methods differed somewhat in their relative selectivity patterns, yet both sampled all age classes of anchovy and reflected similar patterns of inter-annual variability in length frequency. The combined seabird trawl ALI (1998-2017) was used to characterize anchovy size structure for years when the fishery was not sampled (< 2014). The overall bimodal distribution of anchovy size was divided at 94 mm, suggesting that separation of age 0 and age 1+ anchovy in central California in summer (June) during this timespan was smaller than historic means for the region. The predator-based ALI provided further information prior to the initiation of anchovy length sampling during midwater trawl surveys (1993-1997). The ALIs encompassed periods of extremely high and low anchovy biomass, as well as extreme warm and cold ocean climate events; small mean anchovy lengths appeared to be related to warm conditions (ENSO).

AB  - This study was aimed to determine the fossil fuel consumption, energy use, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in per unit production area (ha) considering the petroleum products (PP) directly used and the chemical fertilizers and pesticides for the cultivation of paste tomatoes in open-field conditions in Bursa region of Turkey. The primary data of the study consisted of data collected by making face-to-face surveys with the producers of paste tomatoes in the Bursa region. The direct energy inputs and CO2 emissions related to diesel fuel and lubricant oil consumptions of engines of agricultural tractors for cultivation operations and the indirect energy inputs and CO2 emissions related to the manufacturing of chemical fertilizers and plant growth regulators used for plant nutrition and pesticides used for plant protection were determined for paste tomato cultivation. A total of 288.6 L diesel fuel and 0.067 L lubrication oil are consumed per hectare when using tools and machinery in paste tomato production. A total of 408 kg of chemical fertilizers and 15.5 kg of pesticides are used per hectare in paste tomato production in the Bursa region of Turkey. A total of 2343.45 MJ/ha and 2700.5 MJ/ha indirect energy is used in the application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, respectively. A total of 792.43 kg and 0.189 kg CO2 is released as a result of diesel fuel and lubricant oil consumptions. For the production of one kilogram of paste tomato, 2.68 grams (g) diesel fuel and lubricating oil, 175.02 kilojoules (kJ) of energy is consumed, and 15.88 g CO2 is released in the Bursa region of Turkey.

AB  - There is a lack of information on understanding how marine organisms respond to environmentally relevant microplastics (MP) which hampers decision making for waste management strategies. This study addresses this information gap by determining whether responses to MPs are species specific within a functional group. Benthic residing sea urchins, Psammechinus miliaris and Paracentrotus lividus were used as a case study. Psammechinus miliaris are strong omnivores with dietary intake including hard components (e.g. shell, tubeworms) and therefore likely to cope with the ingestion of MPs, while P. lividus are strong herbivores consuming softer dietary items (e.g. biofilms, algae) and therefore more likely sensitive. Responses to environmentally relevant MPs were conducted across two trials. Trial one determined the impact of short term (24 h) external exposure to storm-like sediment resuspension of MP concentrations (53 mu m polyvinyl chloride (PVC) 25,000 MP L-1) compared to a control without MPs. No significant impacts were observed for both P. lividus and P. miliaris on metabolic rate or righting time, and urchins were able to remove MPs from the body surface using pedicellariae and cilia. Trial two determined the impact of medium term (2 months) ingestion of a diet laced with PVCMPs (59 mu m) at an inclusion rate of 0.5% mass and a control diet (without MPs) on somatic growth and animal condition. The ingestion of MPs did not significantly impact P. miliaris but significantly reduced the alimentary index within P. lividus, indicating a compromised nutritional state. This study shows that responses to microplastics are species-specific and therefore cannot be generalized. Furthermore, feeding habit could act as a potential indicator for sensitivity to MP ingestion which will be important for impact assessments of plastic pollution and management strategies.

AB  - In the real world, we often come across conditions like optimization of more than one objective functions concurrently which are of conflicting nature and that makes the prospect of the problem more intricate. To overpower this contrasting state, an efficient meta-heuristic (MH) is required, which provides a balanced trade-off between diverging objective functions and gives an optimum set of solutions. In this article, a recently proposed MH called Heat Transfer Search (HTS) algorithm is enforced to elucidate the structural optimization problems with Multi-objective functions (described as MOHTS). MOHTS is an efficient MH which works on the principle of heat transfer and thermodynamics, where search agents are molecules which interact with other molecules and with surrounding through conduction, convection, and radiation modes of heat transfer. Five challenging benchmark problems of truss optimization have been taken into consideration here to examine the effectiveness of MOHTS. Procure results through the proposed method show the predominance over considered MHs. These benchmark problems are considered for discrete design variables for the structural optimization problem with two objectives, namely minimization of truss weight and maximization of nodal displacement. Here, the Pareto-optimal front achieved through computational experiments, in the process of optimization, is evaluated by three distinct performance quality indicators namely the Hypervolume, the Front spacing metric, and Inverted Generational Distance. Also, the obtained results after a number of runs are compared with other existing optimizers in the literature like multi-objective ant system, multi-objective ant colony system, and multi-objective symbiotic organism search, which manifest the superiority in the performance of the proposed algorithm over others. The statistical analysis of the experimental work has been carried out by conducting Friedman's rank test and Post-Hoc Holm-Sidak test. Graphic abstract

AB  - The stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen (delta H-2 and delta O-18, respectively) have been widely used to investigate tree water source partitioning. These tracers have shed new light on patterns of tree water use in time and space. However, there are several limiting factors to this methodology (e.g., the difficult assessment of isotope fractionation in trees, and the labor-intensity associated with the collection of significant sample sizes) and the use of isotopes alone has not been enough to provide a mechanistic understanding of source water partitioning. Here, we combine isotope data in xylem and soil water with measurements of tree's physiological information including tree water deficit (TWD), fine root distribution, and soil matric potential, to investigate the mechanism driving tree water source partitioning. We used a 2 m(3) lysimeter with willow trees (Salix viminalis) planted within, to conduct a high spatial-temporal resolution experiment. TWD provided an integrated response of plant water status to water supply and demand. The combined isotopic and TWD measurement showed that short-term variation (within days) in source water partitioning is determined mainly by plant hydraulic response to changes in soil matric potential. We observed changes in the relationship between soil matric potential and TWD that are matched by shifts in source water partitioning. Our results show that tree water use is a dynamic process on the time scale of days. These findings demonstrate tree's plasticity to water supply over days can be identified with high-resolution measurements of plant water status. Our results further support that root distribution alone is not an indicator of water uptake dynamics. Overall, we show that combining physiological measurements with traditional isotope tracing can reveal mechanistic insights into plant responses to changing environmental conditions.

AB  - Street greenery plays an essential role in improving the street environment and residents' health. The evaluation of street greenery is of great value to establish environmentally friendly streets. The evaluation indicators of present studies evaluating street greenery were relatively single, either the Green View Index (GVI) or Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which cannot describe the greenery condition in its entirety. The objective of this study is to assess the street greenery using multiple indicators, including GVI, NDVI, and Vegetation Structural Diversity (VSD). We combined street view images with a semantic segmentation method to extract the GVI and VSD and used satellite images to calculate the NDVI in the urban area of Nanjing, China. We found correlations and discrepancies of these indicators using statistical analyses in different urban districts, functional areas, and road levels. The results indicate that: (1) the GVI and NDVI are strongly correlated in open spaces, whereas weakly correlated in residential and industrial lands, (2) the areas with higher VSD are mainly located in the new city, whereas the VSD in the old city is lower, and a weak negative correlation exists between the GVI and VSD in the research area, and (3) the old city has a higher GVI level compared to the new city on the main road, whereas the new city has a higher GVI level than the old city on the branch road. Compared with the GVI, the trend of VSD in the old city and the new city is relatively consistent. Our findings suggest that considering multiple indicators of street greenery evaluation can provide a comprehensive reference for building more human-friendly and diversified street green belts.

AB  - We investigated changes in traffic-related air pollutant concentrations in an urban area during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was conducted in a mixed commercial-residential neighborhood in Somerville (MA, USA), where traffic is the dominant source of air pollution. Measurements were made between March 27 and May 14, 2020, coinciding with a dramatic reduction in traffic (71% drop in car and 46% drop in truck traffic) due to business shutdowns and a statewide stay-at-home advisory. Indicators of fresh vehicular emissions (ultrafine particle number concentration IPNCiand black carbon [BC]) were measured with a mobile monitoring platform on an interstate highway and major and minor roadways. Our results show that depending on road class, median PNC and BC contributions from traffic were 60-68% and 22-46% lower, respectively, during the lockdown compared to prepandemic conditions, and corresponding reductions in total on-road concentrations were 45-69% and 22-56%, respectively. A higher BC: PNC concentration ratio was observed during the lockdown period likely indicative of the higher fraction of diesel vehides in the fleet during the lockdown. Overall, the scale of reductions in ultrafine particle and BC concentrations was commensurate with the reductions in traffic. This natural experiment allowed us to quantify the direct impacts of reductions in traffic emissions on neighborhood-scale air quality, which are not captured by the regional regulatory-monitoring network. These results underscore the importance of measurements of appropriate proxies for traffic emissions at relevant spatial scales. Our results are useful for exposure analysis as well as city and regional planners evaluating mitigation strategies for traffic-related air pollution. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Colombian industrial sector is moving toward alternative forms of treatment of industrial waste, considering that the waste can be a source of raw material in the production chain. Thus, aiming at the decrease in mineral fertilizer use, and maintaining or even raising the crop yield, the sugarcane industry has recently advanced in the composting of the industrial waste and application in the field, both of them being potentially sustainable practices. This manuscript reports the economic benefits and the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions related to the sugarcane production system in Colombia that has been simulated in this study to evaluate the beneficial effects of reusing industrial waste from ethanol production. This study was performed using the Virtual Sugarcane Biorefinery (VSB) modeling software for the simulation of agricultural and industrial parameters on integrated alternatives for the sugarcane industry. Colombian sugarcane sector was modeled using three scenarios representing agricultural systems that do not use composted industrial wastevsa paired scenario for each condition where composted waste is utilized. Regarding compost and vinasse use as fertilizer and soil conditioner, GHG emissions from the biogenic origin are not included as a reported item in the matrix of GHG emissions of the sugarcane sector. Inputs for the economic and environmental assessment models are based on actual operational data from two mill sites, one located in the traditional sugarcane production region of Cauca River Valley and the other one, on the agricultural expansion region of Llanos Orientales. Here, we have found that the reuse of composted industrial waste is beneficial and provides an economic cost savings of 2-6% per year. However, it also results in an annual increase of 10-20% in the GHG emissions.

AB  - In order to guarantee the performance or to qualify the risk of nonperformance of cementitious materials over time, a significant number of experimental data obtained from tests mimicking various degradation mechanisms are required. The slowness of the materials' degradation under environmental service conditions is an issue, and thus, acceleration strategies are required to obtain reliable and comprehensive results in a shorter time. The objective of this research work is to provide a generic framework for the design of optimal accelerated destructive degradation tests (ADDTs) for cementitious materials qualification. The definition of the optimal design of experiments depends on the capacity to capture the influence of data variability and uncertainty from any sources; they are extracted either from physical models or from experimental tests. In this research, the evolution of carbonation depth is characterized with the Wiener process formalism and the random effects related to the material heterogeneity are taken into account. Once the process parameters are estimated through the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), associated with the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, we provide a step-by-step and detailed method to investigate the optimal design of ADDTs. The latter is defined as the one for which we can estimate durability indicators such as mean-time-to-failure with the best accuracy based on three criteria (D-V-A optimality) considering constraints of time, total number of samples, or limited costs. The optimal total sample size for the accelerated carbonation test and the optimal sample size allocation proportions for each stress level are determined, and the effects of the stress level on the objective functions and of test time duration constraint are also discussed. A comparison of the relative efficiency of optimal three-level versus optimal two-level ADDT completes this work.

AB  - Determination of the nature of magma flow (vertical or lateral) from rock fabrics in a dyke swarm holds significant importance in deciphering its emplacement mechanism, depth of magma chamber and its association with mantle plumes. Nandurbar-Dhule dyke swarm from Western India consists of similar to 210 mappable, tholeiitic, large, linear dykes intruding the country rocks of Deccan basalt. We discuss here the development of flow-controlled rock fabrics in these dykes as a function of their thicknesses. Magnetic fabric obtained from anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) analysis of the samples collected from these dykes was used as a proxy for rock (flow) fabric. Samples from the central parts of the thicker dykes (strike perpendicular thickness > 10 m) show random and inconsistent development of magnetic fabrics than their marginal counterparts. Petrography suggests the development of relatively clear shape-preferred orientations of the elongated mineral grains only at the margin of a thick dyke. Thinner dykes (strike perpendicular thickness < 10 m) show both consistent magnetic fabrics and clear shape-preferred orientations. We propose that the center of a thick dyke fails to provide (due to high flow velocity, slower cooling rate, lack of friction-induced shearing, and draining back of magma) a favorable condition where (a) flow fabric can efficiently develop and (b) magnetic fabric can effectively mimic the flow fabric. Thinner dykes and the margins of the thicker dykes are, hence, better candidates for observing flow fabrics represented by magnetic fabrics. This work is also motivated by the reservations expressed by earlier researchers in using the AMS technique for magma flow characterization, especially for giant dyke swarms. We have critically evaluated their reservations in light of our results and commented on the applicability of the AMS technique on such studies.

AB  - The business sector represents one of the most important parts of the modern economy. It creates and secures most products and services, contributing to most of the sales tax revenues. Business development is not possible without creating a favourable business environment and suitable conditions for creating and entering new business into the market. This paper focuses on the evaluation of some business environment factors in starting a business. Attention is attended to the business environment and funding activities management, including the managerial assessment of proactive, innovative, and business-supporting activities. Besides, this study encompasses the issues of obstacles and barriers to starting a business. The interest of the article is to point out the state and problems in the field of start-up entrepreneurs and the importance of supporting motivational factors and removing barriers by improving the business environment. Methodological tools of the research are classical methods of science analytics, synthesis, and data selection. The basic heuristic approach consists of professional literature on the subject matter, and secondary sources obtained from European Commission, Eurostat - Flash Barometer, and the World Bank to monitor selected indicators of the business environment and SMEs in Slovakia, EU-27 countries and the world. The primary information was represented with the questionnaire-based survey conducted throughout the Slovak Republic, in which a total count of 426 respondents participated. For hypothesis testing, the Friedman Test, Kolmogorov - Smirnov test, and Kruskal - Wallis test was used. The empiric results confined the significant differences between motivational factors for starting doing business. At the same time, there are still significant barriers to enter the business in Slovakia, which considerably limit the further development of doing business in Slovakia. The article provides recommendations for improving the business environment's current status and entering into business in the Slovak Republic.

KW  - Carpathian Ruthenia
KW  - demographic reproduction
KW  - demographic regime
AB  - Carpathian Ruthenia was a historical territory which is now mostly situated in the Zakarpattia Oblast in Ukraine. During the long nineteenth century, however, it was an integral part of the Kingdom of Hungary. It became a part of interwar Czechoslovakia after the First World War, and after the Second World War it was annexed to the Soviet Union. Regardless of the period or state to which Carpathian Ruthenia belonged, it has always been a peripheral area outside the main thrust of social and economic development. It is this peripherality, combined with unfavourable socio-economic conditions, that could be one of the reasons that Carpathian Ruthenia showed several signs of the old demographic regime for a long time in the twentieth century. The first signs of demographic transition occurred in Hungary at the end of the nineteenth century, and knowing the nature of the demographic reproduction of Carpathian Ruthenia and its possible changes in the second half of the nineteenth century is a key development. Using available data, the aim of the study is to analyse the basic demographic processes and their development over a longer period and to point out some possible differences in comparison with the whole population of the Kingdom of Hungary. The study will focus primarily on the intensity of mortality, fertility, and nuptiality, with an effort to identify their longer developmental trends. It will also analyse some aspects of the timing of marriages and motherhood, as well as the interconnection of nuptiality and fertility processes. For this purpose, the study will construct some basic indicators (crude marriage rate, crude birth rate, and crude mortality rate) as well as some more sophisticated indicators (life tables, total fertility rate, total marriage rate, mean age at marriage, and mean age at birth).

AB  - This study focused on developing surrogate indicators for predicting oxidation of phenolic groups in dissolved organic matter (DOM), suppression of halophenols' formation potential and abatement of estrogenic activity during ozonation of water and wastewater. The evolution of pH-dependent differential absorbance spectra suggests that O-3 preferentially reacts with the DOM phenolic moieties and less so with the aromatic carboxylic groups with increasing O-3/DOC (dissolved organic carbon) ratios and changes of UV absorbance and fluorescence. When ozonation used as pretreatment, the formation of halophenols in subsequent chlorination decreased linearly with increasing O-3 doses or changes of UV absorbance until it reached 85% suppression of the halophenols' formation from unaltered DOM. The thresholds of decreases of UVA254, UVA280 and humic-like fluorescence corresponding to 85% suppression of halophenols' formation were in the range of 25%-30%, 30%-35% and 30%-45%, respectively. Pre-ozonation also showed a moderate suppression of haloacetic acids (HAAS) formation potentials, <= 26.5% for reverse osmosis isolate of Suwannee River natural organic matter and <= 31.5% for Yangtze River at applied O-3 doses. Measurement of changes of estrogenic activity during ozonation of water and wastewater showed that to attain a >90% abatement of estrogenic activity, the corresponding thresholds of decreases of UVA254, UVA280 and humic-like fluorescence were similar to 30%, similar to 40%, and similar to 70%, respectively. Bromate formation was also suppressed to below 10 mu g/L before these thresholds. This study suggests that optimal ozonation conditions and a balance between control of disinfection byproducts (halophenols, HAAS and bromate) and elimination of estrogenic activity can be reached based on online data.

AB  - Introduction
   Injury prevention programs (IPPs) are an inherent part of training in recreational and professional sports. Providing performance-enhancing benefits in addition to injury prevention may help adjust coaches and athletes' attitudes towards implementation of injury prevention into daily routine. Conventional thinking by players and coaches alike seems to suggest that IPPs need to be specific to one's sport to allow for performance enhancement. The systematic literature review aims to firstly determine the IPPs nature of exercises and whether they are specific to the sport or based on general conditioning. Secondly, can they demonstrate whether general, sports-specific or even mixed IPPs improve key performance indicators with the aim to better facilitate long-term implementation of these programs?
   Methods
   PubMed and Web of Science were electronically searched throughout March 2018. The inclusion criteria were randomized control trials, publication dates between Jan 2006 and Feb 2018, athletes (11-45 years), injury prevention programs and included predefined performance measures that could be categorized into balance, power, strength, speed/agility and endurance. The methodological quality of included articles was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration assessment tools.
   Results
   Of 6619 initial findings, 22 studies met the inclusion criteria. In addition, reference lists unearthed a further 6 studies, making a total of 28. Nine studies used sports specific IPPs, eleven general and eight mixed prevention strategies. Overall, general programs ranged from 29-57% in their effectiveness across performance outcomes. Mixed IPPs improved in 80% balance outcomes but only 20-44% in others. Sports-specific programs led to larger scale improvements in balance (66%), power (83%), strength (75%), and speed/agility (62%).
   Conclusion
   Sports-specific IPPs have the strongest influence on most performance indices based on the significant improvement versus control groups. Other factors such as intensity, technical execution and compliance should be accounted for in future investigations in addition to exercise modality.

AB  - In the conditions of limited sources of financing for the introduction of advanced innovative technologies and equipment modernization, to retain the existing positions and increase the overall level of competitiveness can only the company that establishes a close relationship with government bodies, local governments and trade union organizations with the aim of obtaining possible preferences for development within the existing regulatory right field. The purpose of the article is to analyze the main socio-economic indicators of the development of Ukraine and its regions, the definition and justification of possible areas of establishing interaction between private enterprises and government agencies. The methodological basis of the study consisted of scientific works of domestic and foreign scientists and leading specialists, statistical and analytical materials of state authorities. The results are obtained through the use of such methods as expert - to identify the impact of qualitative and quantitative indicators on the socio-economic development of the Kherson region; economics and mathematics - to study the influence of a defined group of indicators on the index of the physical volume of the gross regional product; abstract-logical - for a theoretical synthesis and formulation of conclusions. It is revealed that among the key areas of interaction is the promotion of the state and local authorities in the creation of industrial parks. The conducted research on identifying the strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the economy of the Kherson region indicates the need to develop measures to ensure the economic security of the region. To solve these problems at the regional level, it is proposed to implement a state policy that would be carried out in the following areas: ensuring a solid institutional protection of investor's property rights; improvement of the legislative framework; establishing an effective mechanism for combating corruption in Ukraine, developing an effective state policy on amnesty and unshadowing of incomes of individuals and legal entities.

AB  - The quantification of the enantiomeric fraction (EF) during the biodegradation process is essential for environmental risk assessment. In this paper the enantioselective biodegradation of ibuprofen, IBU, and ketoprofen, KET, two of the drugs most consumed, was evaluated. Biodegradation experiments were performed in batch mode using a minimal salts medium inoculated with an activated sludge (collected from a Valencian Waste Water Treatment Plant) and supplemented with the racemate of each compound. The inoculum activity was verified using fluoxetine as reference compound. The experimental conditions used (analyte concentration and volume of inoculum) were chosen according to OECD guidelines. In parallel, the optical density at 600 nm was measured to control the biomass growth and to connect it with enantioselectivity. Two RPLC methods for chiral separations of IBU and KET using polysaccharides-based stationary phases were developed. Novel calculations and adapted models, using directly the chromatographic peak areas as dependent variable, were proposed to estimate significant parameters related to the biodegradation process: biodegradation (BD) and EF values at given time, half-life times of (R)- and (S)-enantiomers, number of days to reach a complete BD and the minimum EF expected. The modelled BD and EF curves fitted adequately the data (R-2 > 0.94). The use of these new equations provided similar results to those obtained using concentration data. However, the use of chromatographic peak areas data, eliminates the uncertainty associated to the use of the calibration curves. The results obtained in this paper indicate that an enantiorecognition towards 1BU enantiomers by the microorganisms present in the activated sludge used in this study occurred, being the biodegradation of (R)-IBU higher than that of (S)-IBU. For KET, non-enantioselective biodegradation was observed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Canine visceral leishmaniosis (CVL), a parasitic disease caused by Leishmania infantum, may evolve to a chronic condition and lead to death. Evaluation of infected dogs is important to establish the clinical and laboratory parameters involved in the evolution of the disease. The objectives of the present study were to discriminate a canine population (n = 52) into sub-clinical and clinically affected dogs based on signs and scores, to evaluate the hematological, biochemical, histopathological and parasitological parameters of the two dog groups, and to analyze the results by multivariate regression analysis with the aim of establishing biomarkers of CVL clinical disease. The most common signs observed in the clinically affected dogs (n = 29) were hyperkeratosis, weight loss, onychogryphosis, pale mucosa and lymphadenomegaly. In the multivariate analysis, animals presenting high IgG avidity index and low red blood, lymphocyte and eosinophil counts, and low serum urea concentration had an increased probability of being classified as clinically affected (p < 0.05). All five parameters were considered to be strong biomarkers for monitoring the clinical disease, while IgG avidity percentage was strongly correlated with the number of clinical signs and could function as an indicator of the duration of infection. This is the first report on the application of IgG avidity and of multivariate regression analysis in establishing associations between the clinical signs of CVL and host biomarkers. Since avidity index (Al) percentages were strongly correlated with the number of clinical signs, it could be useful in clinical practice for auxiliary diagnosis of CVL and monitoring disease progression. A limitation of this study is the lack of information on co-infections by Anaplasma platys, Babesia conic vogeli, Ehrlichia canis and Hepatozoon conic. Therefore future studies should evaluate the influence of such co-infections on the associations studied using multivariate methods with larger samples.

AB  - Relationships between the beryllium-7 activity concentrations in surface air and meteorological parameters (temperature, atmospheric pressure, and precipitation), teleconnection indices (Arctic Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, and Scandinavian pattern) and number of sunspots are investigated using two multivariate statistical techniques: hierarchical cluster and factor analysis. The beryllium-7 surface measurements over 1995-2011, at four sampling sites located in the Scandinavian Peninsula, are obtained from the Radioactivity Environmental Monitoring Database. In all sites, the statistical analyses show that the beryllium-7 concentrations are strongly linked to temperature. Although the beryllium-7 surface concentration exhibits the well-characterised spring/summer maximum, our study shows that extremely high beryllium-7 concentrations, defined as the values exceeding the 90th percentile in the data records for each site, also occur over the October-March period. Two types of autumn/winter extremes are distinguished: type-1 when the number of extremes in a given month is less than three, and type-2 when at least three extremes occur in a month. Factor analysis performed for these autumn/winter events shows a weaker effect of temperature and a stronger impact of the transport and production signal on the beryllium-7 concentrations. Further, the majority of the type-2 extremes are associated with a very high monthly Scandinavian teleconnection index. The type-2 extremes that occurred in January, February and March are also linked to sudden stratospheric warmings of the Arctic vortex. Our results indicate that the Scandinavian teleconnection index might be a good indicator of the meteorological conditions facilitating extremely high beryllium-7 surface concentrations over Scandinavia during autumn and winter.

AB  - This paper deals with the geographical distribution and habitat preferences of B. trapezoidea, the third most widespread species of the 14 species of Burnupia currently on record in the database of the National Freshwater Snail Collection (NFSC) of South Africa. Although the 121 loci (1/16 square degrees) from which the 445 samples of B. trapezoidea were collected are much fewer than the number reported for B. capensis, the range of its geographical distribution is almost as widespread as that of B. capensis. The limited distribution of B. trapezoidea in the Limpopo, Northern Cape and Western Cape Provinces can most probably be attributed to the paucity of perennial water bodies in these areas and the fact that Burnupia spp. in general have poor abilities to overcome conditions of desiccation prevalent in these areas. It is therefore not surprising that the majority of samples were collected in perennial rivers and streams. A Random Forest statistical analysis selected water bodies, the presence or absence of marginal and aquatic vegetation, and type of substratum as the most important variables that played a significant role in determining the presence and numbers of specimens of B. trapezoidea in a specific area. In this respect, temperature and turbidity, respectively, played a moderate and minor role. Little is known regarding the conservation status of Burnupia spp, in general, but habitat degradation and climatic warming could be reasons for concern. However, in extensive on- going biodiversity surveys in two rivers and selected tributaries in the North- West Province, many new distribution records of B. trapezoidea are still being created and therefore this species could probably be considered for listing as not endangered. In view of its wide distribution, largely sessile, benthic lifestyle, and ability to bioaccumulate various substances, the feasibility to utilise it as indicator of river ecosystem health in South Africa should be explored.

AB  - The suitability of linden and elder as biomonitors was evaluated in the tourist zone of the Bor region well known for pyrometallurgical copper production. The concentrations of As, Cu, Pb and Zn in the soil, washed and unwashed leaves and roots of linden and elder were determined. The absorption of As, Cu, Pb and Zn from soil to roots and leaves, as well as the translocation of the studied elements from roots to leaves, was analysed. It was observed that the soil in the tourist zone of Bor (Bor lake and Brestovac spa) was greatly polluted with Cu and As. Linden and elder leaves can be used as a low-cost material for detection of As, Cu, Pb and Zn in the atmospheric deposition, which was concluded due to the amounts of these elements removed after a washing treatment. Thus, canopies of linden and elder might have an important role in the removal of the polluting substances from the air. The elder leaves were more suitable to be used for indication of environmental pollution with As, Cu and Pb than the linden leaves. The area of the Bor lake sampling site had higher air pollution with As and Pb than Brestovac spa, since greater amounts of As and Pb were washed off the linden and elder leaves from the Bor lake sampling site. The linden and elder used different adaptation strategies in conditions of the increased soil and air pollution. These strategies were based on different efficiencies of element absorption from the soil and on limited or efficient translocation of the studied elements from roots to leaves, and therefore, they have an important role in the biogeochemical cycling of the examined elements in the environment.\

AB  - Resolution of plant diversity goals with the agricultural demands placed on grasslands may result in conflict between farmers and conservationists. To investigate options for reconciling these important issues implementable in the short-term within agro-environmental schemes, we analysed the impact of four years' management with grazing replaced by mowing on coordination of agricultural objectives, i.e. herbage yield, plant functional groups, nutrient contents and removal, forage value and plant diversity, i.e. species richness, Shannon-Wiener index, Ellenberg N indicator value. The study was carried out in three hillslope highland pasture sites (S1-S3) in the Sumava Mountains, Czech Republic, differing in soil properties and animal stocking rates, which were 0.92 in S1, 0.34 in S2, combined with mowing in some years and 0.73 in S3 LU ha(-1). Some sections of each pasture site were twice yearly mowed. Our findings related to grazing combined or replaced with mowing were relevant to farmers' priorities acceptable for dairy cattle nutrition. Across sites, the herbage dry matter yield, herbage P, K and Mg contents and removal, proportion of graminoids and Ellenberg N values decreased with mowing, but forage value and herbage Ca removal remained identical under both managements. Species richness, Shannon-Wiener index and herbage Ca content increased with mowing via spread of forbs and/or legumes. However, to achieve a merit, short-term grazing exclusion with mowing has to take into account site-specific soil nutrient conditions. Very high soil P availability prevented from the increase in species richness with mowing (S3). Contrarily, in sites with lower soil P availability, but different availability of other nutrients (S1, S2), mowing fostered number and/or proportions of forbs and/or legumes.

AB  - Plastic particles smaller than 5 mm, so called microplastics have the capability to accumulate in rivers, lakes and the marine environment and therefore have begun to be considered in eco-toxicology and human health risk assessment. Environmental microplastic contaminants may originate from consumer products like body wash, tooth pastes and cosmetic products, but also from degradation of plastic waste; they represent a potential but unpredictable threat to aquatic organisms and possibly also to humans. We investigated exemplarily for polyethylene (PE), the most abundant constituent of microplastic particles in the environment, whether such fragments could be produced from larger pellets (2 mm x 6 mm). So far only few analytical methods exist to identify microplastic particles smaller than 10 mu m, especially no imaging mass spectrometry technique. We used at first time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) for analysis and imaging of small PE-microplastic particles directly in the model system Ottawa sand during exposure to sea surf simulation. As a prerequisite, a method for identification of PE was established by identification of characteristic ions for PE out of an analysis of grinded polymer samples. The method was applied onto Ottawa sand in order to investigate the influence of simulated environmental conditions on particle transformation. A severe degradation of the primary PE pellet surface, associated with the transformation of larger particles into smaller ones already after 14 days of sea surf simulation, was observed. Within the subsequent period of 14 days to 1 month of exposure the number of detected smallest-sized particles increased significantly (50%) while the second smallest fraction increased even further to 350%. Results were verified using artificially degraded PE pellets and Ottawa sand. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Middle-Upper Devonian Bahram Formation carbonates in eastern Iran were investigated in three strati graphic sections including Cheshmeh Shir (NE Tabas), Kamar Kuh (S Kashmar), and Hozedorah (E Tabas), in order to define their depositional environment, diagenesis, and geochemistry of major and minor elements. Petrographic and microfacies pattern studies led to the recognition of five microfacies groups including shore face, tidal flat, lagoonal, shoal and open-marine facies. Evidences such as absence of calciturhidite deposits, reefal facies, slumping and sliding facies, gradual facies changes, absence of the special grains of carbonate shelf such as cortoid, oncoid, pisoid, and aggregate and abundant micrites indicate that the Bahram Formation carbonates deposited on a ramp type carbonate platform, shallower southward. The most important diagenetic processes which affected the Bahram Formation carbonates are micritization, cementation, dolomitization, compaction, dissolution, fracturing, and calcitic veins formation. Cementation, dissolution, and dolomitization are the main diagenetic processes that affected the original texture. The abundant presence of bioclasts such as ecinoid, ostracod, and brachiopod together with geochemical analysis results such as low strontium content, low average of strontiumisodium ratio, high average of strontium/manganese ratio and low sodium content suggest that the primary mineralogy of carbonates were mainly calcitic. Paleoclimate conditions at the time of deposition seem to have been similar to climate of recent temperate regions. Investigation of the Middle-Late Devonian geographic maps reveals that the studied region which is located 30 S had been a part of Gondwana land so that geochemical results confirm this fact (Scotese 2014). In addition, the diagenetic and geochemical changes are indicators of long term effect of meteoric diagenetic fluids on the Bahram carbonates. So, it seems that the effect of meteoric diagenesis in north of the basin is greater than the south of it.

AB  - Tryptophan-like fluorescence (TLF) is an indicator of human influence on water quality as TLF peaks are associated with the input of labile organic carbon (e.g. sewage or farm waste) and its microbial breakdown. Hence, real-time measurement of TLF could be particularly useful for monitoring water quality at a higher temporal resolution than available hitherto. However, current understanding of TLF quenching/interference is limited for field deployable sensors. We present results from a rigorous test of two commercially available submersible tryptophan fluorometers (ex similar to 285, em similar to 350). Temperature quenching and turbidity interference were quantified in the laboratory and compensation algorithms developed. Field trials were then undertaken involving: (i) an extended deployment (28 days) in a small urban stream; and, (ii) depth profiling of an urban multi-level borehole. TLF was inversely related to water temperature (regression slope range: -1.57 to -2.50). Sediment particle size was identified as an important control on the turbidity specific TLF response, with signal amplification apparent <150 NTU for clay particles and <650 NTU for silt particles. Signal attenuation was only observed >200 NTU for clay particles. Compensation algorithms significantly improved agreement between in situ and laboratory readings for baseflow and storm conditions in the stream. For the groundwater trial, there was an excellent agreement between laboratory and raw in situ TLF; temperature compensation provided only a marginal improvement, and turbidity corrections were unnecessary. These findings highlight the potential utility of real time TLF monitoring for a range of environmental applications (e.g. tracing polluting sources and monitoring groundwater contamination). However, in situations where high/variable suspended sediment loads or rapid changes in temperature are anticipated concurrent monitoring of turbidity and temperature is required and site specific calibration is recommended for long term, surface water monitoring.

AB  - Decision-making under ambiguity in cognitive bias tasks is a promising new indicator of affective valence in animals. Rat studies support the hypothesis that animals in a negative affective state evaluate ambiguous cues negatively. Prior automated operant go/go judgement bias tasks have involved training rats that an auditory cue of one frequency predicts a Reward and a cue of a different frequency predicts a Punisher (RP task), and then measuring whether ambiguous cues of intermediate frequency are judged as predicting reward ('optimism') or punishment ('pessimism'). We investigated whether an automated Reward Reward (RR) task yielded similar results to, and was faster to train than, RP tasks. We also introduced a new ambiguity test (simultaneous presentation of the two training cues) alongside the standard single ambiguous cue test. Half of the rats experienced an unpredictable housing treatment (UHT) designed to induce a negative state. Control rats were relatively 'pessimistic', whilst UHT rats were quicker, but no less accurate, in their responses in the RR test, and showed less anxiety-like behaviour in independent tests. A possible reason for these findings is that rats adapted to and were stimulated by UHT, whilst control rats in a predictable environment were more sensitive to novelty and change. Responses in the new ambiguity test correlated positively with those in single ambiguous cue tests, and may provide a measure of attention bias. The RR task was quicker to train than previous automated RP tasks. Together, they could be used to disentangle how reward and punishment processes underpin affect-induced cognitive biases.

AB  - In order to document benthic foraminiferal and testate amoeba diversity, a total of 115 sediment samples were collected from nine different transitional environments along a 100-km long coastal area located in Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil). This area is directly affected by both the input of freshwater from the Tramandai River and a marine influence due to its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. In particular, 14 and 101 species are recognized within the benthic foraminiferal and testate amoeba assemblages, respectively. Testate amoebae diversity is significantly higher than that documented in previous investigations carried out in other parts of the Brazilian coast. The two dominant testate amoeba families are Difflugidae and Hyalospheniidae, which are represented by 74 and 9 species, respectively. On the other hand, the benthic foraminiferal assemblages are poorly diversified and mainly dominated by agglutinated forms that are typical of transitional environments under the direct influence of a freshwater input. The distribution of these two groups characterizes both the freshwater environments, where testate amoebae are the only representatives, and the more marine conditions, where benthic foraminifera tend to dominate the benthic community, and allows the recognition of a marine influence gradient. The benthic foraminiferal assemblages are mainly observed in front of the direct opening to the sea, but are completely absent in the innermost environments, whereas testate amoebae are more widely distributed, albeit in variable abundances, but are completely missing close to the Tramandai Basin's outlet. Although the diversity of the benthic community in South Atlantic coastal regions is difficult to determine, this study represents, to our knowledge, the first investigation of benthic foraminifera and testate amoebae along the 100-km long coastal area, characterized by lagoons and lakes interconnected by canals and small rivers.

AB  - The discharge of concentrate and other process waters from seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) plant operations into the marine environment may adversely affect water quality in the near-field area surrounding the outfall. The main concerns are the increase in salt concentration in receiving waters, which results in a density increase and potential water stratification near the outfall, and possible increases in turbidity, e.g., due to the discharge of filter backwash waters. Changes in ambient water quality may affect microbial abundance in the area, for example by hindering the photosynthesis process or disrupting biogenesis. It is widely accepted that marine biodiversity is lower in more extreme conditions, such as high salinity environments. As aquatic microbial communities respond very rapidly to changes in their environment, they can be used as indicators for monitoring ambient water quality. The objective of this study was to assess possible changes in microbial abundance as a result of concentrate discharge into the near-field area (<25 m) surrounding the outfall of the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) SWRO plant. Flow cytometric (FCM) analysis was conducted in order to rapidly determine microbial abundance on a single-cell level in 107 samples, taken by diving, from the discharge area, the intake area and two control sites. FCM analysis combined the measurement of distinct scatter of cells and particles, autofluorescence of cyanobacteria and algae, and fluorescence after staining of nucleic acids with SYBR Green for a total bacterial count. The results indicate that changes in microbial abundance in the near-field area of the KAUST SWRO outfall are minor and appear to be the result of a dilution effect rather than a direct impact of the concentrate discharge.

AB  - Study on recovering waste heat of engine exhaust gas using organic Rankine cycle (ORC) has continuously increased in recent years. However, it is difficult to find out appropriate working fluids to match with exhaust gas waste heat due to high temperature. In this work, several tentative attempts and explorations are made in selecting Alkanes as working fluid owing to their excellent thermo-physical and environmental characteristics. Parameters optimization of the combined system of diesel engine with bottoming ORC (DE-ORC) is performed on Alkane-based working fluids with six indicators, including thermal efficiency (eta), exergy destruction factor (EDF), turbine size parameter (SP), total exergy destruction rate (I-ORC), turbine volume flow ratio (VFR) and net power output per unit mass flow rate of exhaust (P-net). Afterwards, the impact of molecular complexity on the indicators of VFR and SP is analyzed. Furthermore, the energy distribution of engine exhaust gases and the improvement of fuel economy, after integrating the bottoming ORC with diesel engine, are also discussed. Finally, the performance comparison between Cyclohexane-based ORC and steam cycle with relative pressure is carried out. The results show that optimized working fluids are not always constant subject to different indicators and operation parameters. However, cyclic Alkanes, Cyclohexane and Cyclopentane are considered as the most suitable working fluids when taking into account of all comprehensive indicators. The maximum improvement of 10% in brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) is obtained for DE-ORC combined systems with Cyclohexane used as working fluid. In addition, although steam has more advantages in thermal efficiency in the current conditions, from a technical and economic point of view, Alkane-based ORCs may be more attractive than conventional steam cycles, specifically for DE waste gas heat recovery.

AB  - The mixture of Bacillus subtilis strain SM21 and Bacillus cereus strain AR156, referred to as ASB, is a biopesticide in the process of registration in China, which has the capacity of controlling root-knot nematode in cucumber, Phytophthora wilt in pepper and Ralstonia wilt in tomato. In this study, we tested its effects on a range of physiological indicators of plant growth including biomass, yield, chlorophyll content and fruit nutrients of pepper, as well as, its efficacy in controlling bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum under field conditions in 2009 and 2010 by a variety of inoculation methods. Three application methods -soaking seeds, drenching soil around seeds right after sowing and drenching the rhizosphere of transplanted seedling with the aqueous solution (as a soil drench) -and three concentrations of ASB (1.0 x 10(6) CFU/mL, 1.0 x 10(7) CFU/mL, and 1.0 x 10(8) CFU/mL) were employed. The results showed that both soaking seeds with ASB at 1.0 x 10(7) CFU/mL as well as drenching rhizosphere with ASB at 1.0 x 10(6) CFU/mL and 1.0 x 10(7) CFU/mL promoted growth, increased yield and fruit nutrient contents of pepper. The combination of these two inoculation methods led to significant increases in growth and fruit nutrient contents. We found that the most effective way was the combination of soaking seeds with the ASB at 1.0 x 10(7) CFU/mL and drenching rhizosphere with it at 1.0 x 10(6) CFU/mL, which is also easy for Chinese farmers to implement.

AB  - The current trend of declining epiphytic richness caused by human activities (forest fragmentation, logging, agriculture, and livestock grazing) and the greater efforts required to sample and identify the most inconspicuous species have necessitated the use of indicators of the species richness. In this study, we examined the potential of predicting epiphytic lichen richness based on the richness of a single taxon (family) of the most conspicuous lichens (macrolichens) in Mediterranean woodlands. Since our working hypothesis is that the richness of some conspicuous elements is tightly connected with the total richness, we expect this connection is maintained even after composition shifts (for instance composition changes between coniferous and oak forests). In order to control the large set of confounding factors at macro- and microclimate scales our present study was conducted in 504 forest stands, which represented a wide range of Mediterranean climates, management intensity levels, canopy cover types, and tree sizes. The presence/absence of epiphytic lichens were determined in 7560 trees, which were dominated by coniferous (Pinus nigra and P. sylvestris) and oak (Quercus ilex ssp. ballota, Q, faginea, and Q. pyrenaica) species. In oak forests, the increased richness of Collemataceae and the complex known as "rest of Peltigerales" was followed by an increase in the overall epiphytic richness, whereas there was a strong positive correlation between Parmeliaceae and total epiphytic richness in coniferous forests. In both cases, the richness of these predictors increased in well-preserved forest stands with dense canopies. Thus, we propose the potential use of Parmeliaceae (for coniferous forests) and the Collemataceae and the "rest of Peltigerales" (for oak forests) as indicators in the Mediterranean region because they have a cosmopolitan distribution, grow in a wide range of environmental conditions, and are correlated with changes in the epiphytic richness caused by forest disturbances.

AB  - Soil exhibits layers of extreme compaction from both natural causes and wheel traffic. These compaction layers impede root growth, thereby reducing the plants capacity to obtain water during drought. Subsoil tillage is a remedy for adverse soil compaction that results in improved conditions for crop growth. Mechanical disturbance of subsoil increases water holding capacity and reduces impedance to root penetration. Vertical mulching is a technique that can be used to partially alleviate soil compaction within the critical root zones of deep rooted crops. A study was conducted by placing raw and composted coir pith using a two row subsoil coir pith mulching machine in three different soil depths (250, 350, and 450 mm) at the three application rates of 15 t/ha, 20 t/ha, and 25 t/ha and the effect of soil strength was investigated. The experiment was conducted for a minted cotton crop. The soil strength profile was recorded in all the treatments. The cone penetrometer resistance was measured for each increment of 10 mm and recorded manually from a digital force indicator during maturity stages of crop in all the treatment plots. The cone penetrometer resistance was measured directly on the row and the cone index was computed. Deep placement of mulch reduced the soil strength as compared to shallow placement. The lower soil strength (0.5 kPa to 0.8 kPa) in the loosened and mulched zone provided an impedance free zone for the root to proliferate. The rapid increase in cone index values at depths immediately below the respective depth of placement (250, 350 and 450 mm) of raw and composted coir pith mulch indicated that the existence of undisturbed soil profile below the mulched zone which could be potential limiting factor for root development.

AB  - Governed by a series of non-linear feedback mechanisms among water, vegetation and decomposers, carbon storage within wetlands is important on a global scale. However, the effect that climatic fluctuations have on those mechanisms is not well documented. In this study, we introduce a mechanistic model connecting hydrology, vegetation and microbial biomass to investigate how changes in the climate signal propagate through wetland ecosystems, via vegetation and microbial dynamics, and attempt to quantify how net rates of wetland carbon metabolism change in response to a changing climate. Our particular focus is the dryland-wetland systems found in south-west Western Australia (SWWA), as they are expected to be sensitive to projected climatic changes due to their close linkage to the seasonal water delivery pattern. The model simulations investigate wetland carbon retention under different hydroclimatological conditions ranging across a regional gradient in the dryness index. The results indicate that short term and long term vegetation responses may be counter-intuitive due to adaptability in the water uptake strategy of the vegetation community partially decoupling biomass from water availability. Furthermore, changes in water delivery are not a good indicator for overall changes in wetland metabolism, defined as the net rate of carbon assimilation, due to the dominance of the soil carbon storages and their sensitivity to heightened bacterial metabolism rates with increasing temperatures. The results highlight that an optimum combination of water supply and vegetation leads to a higher percentage of carbon being stored in soils, therefore increasing the resistance of the carbon storage to changes in precipitation. The model presented here provides a first step to explain how changing patterns of rainfall, temperature and evapotranspiration can change carbon cycling characteristics and the carbon retention efficiency of dryland-wetlands.

AB  - The Bengalese finch (BF; Lonchura striata var. domestica) is a domesticated strain of the white-backed munia (WBM; Lonchura striata). Environmental stresses activate the hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis and release corticosterone (CORT). We hypothesized that domesticated songbirds have reduced CORT levels because of reduced levels of environmental stresses (compared to wild conditions) and reductions in the role of CORT, which is necessary for survival in the wild. However, no study has examined the effects of domestication on songbird CORT levels. To explore the domestication effects, we compared CORT levels between domesticated BFs and their wild ancestors WBMs. We also compared CORT levels between bought and aviary-raised BFs, and between wild-caught and captive-raised WBMs to examine the influence of being raised. However, blood collection causes stress, which affects endocrine dynamics and makes continuous sampling difficult in small birds. Therefore, we used a non-invasive method to measure fecal CORT. Parallelism between diluted fecal extracts and a CORT standard, extraction efficiency, and ACTH challenge demonstrated the effectiveness of this method. This study demonstrates that BFs have lower fecal CORT than do WBMs, regardless of whether the WBMs were wild-caught or captive-raised. In addition, BFs sing more complex songs than WBMs. Considerable evidence suggests that song complexity is related to CORT levels. Previously, we found that the corticosteroid receptors were expressed in song-control areas of the BF brain. Based on these results, we hypothesize that reduced CORT levels through domestication might be one factor allowing for the development of more complex songs in BFs. J. Exp. Zool. 317A:561570, 2012.

TI  - Transitioning sediment quality assessment into regulations: Challenges and solutions in implementing California's sediment quality objectives
T2  - INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
LA  - English
AB  - Development and promulgation of sediment quality criteria represents a substantial challenge for water quality agencies. Unlike water quality programs that rely on individual chemical thresholds to assess water quality, the complex processes affecting contaminant bioavailability in sediments preclude the use of contaminant concentrations to independently assess impacts or identify cause. Various multiple line of evidence approaches (e.g., sediment quality triad) have been developed for sediment quality assessment, but such frameworks are rarely fully incorporated into statewide regulatory programs due to a lack of standardized and validated tools. In 2003, California's State Water Resources Control Board (State Water Board) initiated development of sediment quality criteria and an assessment framework that required the developers to resolve many challenging technical and policy related issues to the satisfaction of stakeholders, scientists, and the general public. The first part of this multiyear effort has been completed and resulted in the development and validation of an integrated collection of tools, thresholds, and a data interpretation framework for assessing sediment contamination impacts on benthic community condition. The State Water Board's narrative sediment quality criteria and assessment framework became effective in 2009, following US Environmental Protection Agency approval. The results of this effort are described in a series of 6 articles published in this issue of Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management. The articles describe: 1) a multiple line of evidence framework for data integration and assessment, 2) calibration and evaluation of sediment quality guidelines for predicting toxic responses, 3) development and evaluation of sediment quality guidelines with respect to benthic macrofauna responses, 4) selection of toxicity test methods and thresholds, 5) identification and characterization of benthic community assemblages, 6) the effect of sampling methods on benthic community assessment, and 7) recommendations on improving the assessment of contaminant exposure in sediment quality assessment. This collection of articles illustrates the steps needed to improve the scientific foundation for sediment quality assessment in regulatory applications. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2012; 8: 586588.

AB  - O-2 reduction and denitrification rates were determined in shallow aquifers of 12 study areas representing a wide range in sedimentary environments and climatic conditions. Zero- and first-order rates were determined by relating reactant or product concentrations to apparent groundwater age. O-2 reduction rates varied widely within and between sites, with zero-order rates ranging from <3 mu mol L-1 yr(-1) to more than 140 mu mol L-1 yr(-1) and first-order rates ranging from 0.02 to 0.27 yr(-1). Moderate denitrification rates (10-100 mu mol N L-1 yr(-1); 0.06-0.30 yr(-1)) were observed in most areas with O-2 concentrations below 60 mu mol L-1, while higher rates (> 100 mu mol N L-1 yr(-1); > 0.36 yr(-1)) occur when changes in lithology result in a sharp increase in the supply of electron donors. Denitrification lag times (i.e., groundwater travel times prior to the onset of denitrification) ranged from < 20 yr to > 80 yr. The availability of electron donors is indicated as the primary factor affecting O-2 reduction rates. Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and/or sulfate (an indicator of sulfide oxidation) were positively correlated with groundwater age at sites with high O-2 reduction rates and negatively correlated at sites with lower rates. Furthermore, electron donors from recharging DOC are not sufficient to account for appreciable O-2 and nitrate reduction. These relations suggest that lithologic sources of DOC and sulfides are important sources of electrons at these sites but surface-derived sources of DOC are not. A review of published rates suggests that denitrification tends to occur more quickly when linked with sulfide oxidation than with carbon oxidation.

AB  - Carbon stable isotopes (delta C-13) of particulate organic matter (POM) have been used as indicators for energy flow, primary productivity and carbon dioxide concentration in individual lakes. Here, we provide a synthesis of literature data from 32 freshwater lakes around the world to assess the variability of delta C-13(POM) along latitudinal, morphometric and biogeochemical gradients. Seasonal mean delta C-13(POM), a temporally integrated measure of the delta C-13(POM), displayed weak relationships with all trophic state indices [total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and chlorophyll a (Chl a)], but decreased significantly with the increase in latitude, presumably in response to the corresponding decrease in water temperature and increase in CO2 concentration. The seasonal minimum delta C-13(POM) also correlated negatively with latitude while seasonal maximum delta C-13(POM) correlated positively with all trophic state indices, pH, and delta C-13 of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Seasonal amplitude of delta C-13(POM) (the difference between seasonal maximum and minimum values) correlated significantly with pH, TP and Chl a concentrations and displayed small variations in oligotrophic, mesotrophic and low latitude eutrophic lakes, which is attributed to low primary productivity and abundant non-living POM in the low trophic state lakes and relatively stable environmental conditions in the subtropics. Seasonal amplitude of delta C-13(POM) was the greatest in high latitude eutrophic lakes. Greater seasonal changes in solar energy and light regime may be responsible for the large seasonal variability in high latitude productive lakes. This synthesis provides new insights on the factors controlling variations in stable carbon isotopes of POM among lakes on the global scale.

AB  - The projection of robust regional climate changes over the next 50 years presents a considerable challenge for the current generation of climate models. Water cycle changes are particularly difficult to model in this area because major uncertainties exist in the representation of processes such as large-scale and convective rainfall and their feedback with surface conditions. We present climate model projections and uncertainties in water availability indicators (precipitation, run-off and drought index) for the 1961-1990 and 2021-2050 periods. Ensembles from two global climate models (GCMs) and one regional climate model (RCM) are used to examine different elements of uncertainty. Although all three ensembles capture the general distribution of observed annual precipitation across the Middle East, the RCM is consistently wetter than observations, especially over the mountainous areas. All future projections show decreasing precipitation (ensemble median between -5 and -25%) in coastal Turkey and parts of Lebanon, Syria and Israel and consistent run-off and drought index changes. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) GCM ensemble exhibits drying across the north of the region, whereas the Met Office Hadley Centre work Quantifying Uncertainties in Model Projections-Atmospheric (QUMP-A) GCM and RCM ensembles show slight drying in the north and significant wetting in the south. RCM projections also show greater sensitivity (both wetter and drier) and a wider uncertainty range than QUMP-A. The nature of these uncertainties suggests that both large-scale circulation patterns, which influence region-wide drying/wetting patterns, and regional-scale processes, which affect localized water availability, are important sources of uncertainty in these projections. To reduce large uncertainties in water availability projections, it is suggested that efforts would be well placed to focus on the understanding and modelling of both large-scale processes and their teleconnections with Middle East climate and localized processes involved in orographic precipitation.

AB  - GIS (Geographical Information Systems) based decision support tools will be useful in helping guide regions to sustainability. These tools need to be simple but effective at identifying, for regional managers, areas most in need of initiatives to progress sustainability. Multiple criteria analysis (MCA) has been used as a decision support tool for a wide number of applications, as it provides a systematic framework for evaluating various options. it has the potential to be used as a tool for sustainability assessment, because it can bring together the sustainability criteria from all pillars, social, economic and environmental, to give an integrated assessment of sustainability. Furthermore, the use of GIS and MCA together is an emerging addition to conducting sustainability assessments.
   This paper further develops a sustainability assessment framework developed for the Glenelg Hopkins Catchment Management Authority region of Victoria, Australia by providing a GIS-based decision support system for regional agencies. This tool uses multiple criteria analysis in a GIS framework to assess the sustainability of sub-catchments in the Glenelg Hopkins Catchment. The multiple criteria analysis based on economic, social and environmental indicators developed in previous stages of this project was used as the basis to build a model in ArcGIS (R). The GIS-based multiple criteria analysis, called An Index of Regional Sustainability Spatial Decision Support System (AIRS SDSS), produced maps showing sub-catchment sustainability, and environmental, social and economic condition. As a result, this tool is able to highlight those sub-catchments most in need of assistance with achieving sustainability. It will also be a valuable tool for evaluation and monitoring of strategies for sustainability. This paper shows the usefulness of GIS-based multiple criteria analysis to enhance the monitoring and evaluation of sustainability at the regional to sub-catchment scale. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Mar Chiquita saline lake is located in the lowest part of one of the largest endorreic saline basins of South America. With a surface area of 6000-6500 km(2), the lake is located in a tectonic depression with an asymmetric cross section. The Sierras Pampeanas foothills, (with altitudes near 1500 m) are to the west and a 100-m topographic high (San Guillermo high) is to the east whose western border is bounded by a buried Middle Pleistocene fault (the Tostado-Selva Fault). The main tributary of the lake is the Dulce River, which flows from north to south. The southward flow of the river was impeded by an obstacle that closed the Dulce Valley, generating the Mar Chiquita Lake. The megafans of the Primero, Segundo, and Tercero Rivers deposited a large amount of sediment against the faulted border of the San Guillermo high, generating an obstacle that impeded the normal flow of the rivers and diverted the Dulce and the Salado Rivers to their present positions. Precise data concerning the age of the impounding of Mar Chiquita does not exist, but lacustrine conditions are undoubtedly younger than the uplift of the San Guillermo high, which occurred in the Middle Pleistocene. The well-preserved dry valley of the Dulce River, located southward of Mar Chiquita, is still visible in satellite images and confirms the youth of the impounding. The observations introduced in this paper allow us to understand the origin of a significant feature of the central plains of South America. The generation of Mar Chiquita Lake and upstream wetlands produced a pronounced environmental change in the and Chaco-Pampeana Plain, which favored human life by introducing changes in vegetation and fauna.

AB  - The industrial corrosion research in the past used descriptive methods for the development of corrosion protective coatings. The legal demand of environmentally friendly coatings and customer demand of high-performance coatings requires the understanding of corrosion effects and the protection against these with organic protective layers. Therefore, actual developments of corrosion protective coatings use modem electrochemical methods for a mechanistic understanding of corrosion processes and there protection. This approach promotes a better description of the interaction between a coating and the corrosion mechanism of the substrate, the development of new coatings with known protection mechanism and additionally actual corrosion protective concepts could be optimized. With the Scanning Kelvin Probe (SKP) the corrosion rate at different geometries and conditions of an E-coated sample has been measured, showing an increased corrosion rate up to seven times higher if the electrolyte layer is very thin. Furthermore, simulated disturbances of pre-treated surfaces have been carried out by a local deposition with mineral oils. By means of SKP measurements, their effect on the pre-treatment layer and on a consecutively applied E-coat were discussed. It was shown that these simulated disturbances could be detected from changes in the Volta potential and that they correlate with noise effects on the coating. Utilizing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), an easy way will be presented to measure the "network density" as an indicator of the performance of the corrosion protection by a coating in dependence of its curing temperature, thickness, etc. Finally a new "fast corrosion test" has been developed which measures the delaminated area with EIS after a certain fast climate chamber test. This test correlates quite well with the standard climate chamber test, whereas the expenditure of time could be reduced to 4 days instead of 10-12 weeks. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The main aim of this paper was to study the responses of mountain plants in relation to the time of snowmelt. Three mountain areas situated along an oceanic-continental gradient were selected as study sites, and the sample plots ranged from 182 m below to 473 m above the climatic forest limit. in total, 185 quadrats (2 m x 2 m), stratified to include only oligotrophic and mesotrophic mountain vegetation types, were selected to represent a topographic range along altitudinal gradients. In each quadrat, the percentage groundcover of the species was recorded. From the beginning of April until July 2004, snow thickness was monitored, and the Julian day when the snow had completely melted was determined for all plots. The relationship between species abundances and Julian day of snowmelt were analysed by two different numerical methods: (1) relative values for species optimum and tolerance were given by Detrended Canonical Correspondence Analysis (DCCA) with Julian day of snowmelt as the constraining variable. (2) Species responses were modelled by Generalized Linear Models (GLM). For species with significant unimodal responses, optimum and tolerance were calculated. For species with significant linear models, different species response models were identified by the regression intercepts. One hundred and twenty six species (taxa) were tested, and 103 evidenced statistically significant (p < 0.05) distribution responses. Several common alpine plants had a distribution that appeared to be independent of snow. On the basis of the results of the numerical methods, the species were separated into nine Snow Indicator (SI) classes, as a parallel to the Ellenberg indicator values. The species' SI values were used to calculate weighted average SI values to examine the relationships between previously described plant communities and vegetation transects which experience different snow conditions.

AB  - We evaluated the influence of environmental factors on recruits per spawner (RS) anomalies of 12 New England groundfish stocks. Nonparametric methods were used to analyse time-series of RS anomalies derived from stock-recruitment data in recent assessments. The 12 stocks occur in three geographic regions: the Gulf of Maine (cod Gadus morhua, redfish Sebastes fasciatus, winter flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus, American plaice Hippoglossoides platessoides, witch flounder Glyptocephalus cynoglossus, and yellowtail flounder Limanda ferruginea), Georges Bank (cod. haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus, and yellowtail flounder), and Southern New England (summer flounder Paralichthys dentatus, yellowtail flounder, and winter flounder). Randomization tests were applied to detect years when RS anomalies were unusually high or low for comparison with oceanographic conditions such as the 1998 intrusion of Labrador Subarctic Slope water into the Gulf of Maine region. Randomization methods were also used to evaluate the central tendency and dispersion of all RS anomalies across stocks. Average RS anomalies were significantly positive in 1987 across stocks and regions, indicating that environmental forcing was coherent and exceptional in that year. Responses of RS values of individual stocks to lagged and contemporaneous environmental variables such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, water temperature, windstress, and shelf water volume anomalies were evaluated using generalized additive models. Overall, the NAO forward-lagged by 2 years had the largest impact on RS anomalies, This apparent effect is notable because it could provide a leading indicator of RS anomalies for some commercially exploited stocks. In particular, the three primary groundfish stocks on Georges Bank (cod, haddock, and yellowtail flounder) all exhibited positive RS anomalies when the NAO(2) variable was positive.

AB  - For hedgerows to act as corridors for woodland plants they must provide habitat conditions to suit species' autecological requirements. This supposition was tested by examining differences in the habitat and autecological characteristics of woodland plants according to their relative frequency in hedgerows and woodlands using a novel Habitat Preference Index (HPI). Indicator values for habitat and autecological characteristics of plant species were derived from Ellenberg and other published sources. Analyses were done separately for three main types of landscape in which hedgerows are found in Britain: (1) Lowland Arable; (2) Lowland Pastural; and (3) Marginal Upland. The relative frequency of plant species across all three landscape types was similar and significant differences between HPIs and environmental indicators were found for all three landscape types. Plants more frequently found in hedgerows had significantly higher indicator scores for soil fertility, temperature, continentality together with reduced soil acidity, in comparison to those species more frequent in woodlands. Analyses of autecological indicators failed to show similar consistent trends across landscape types except for the number of woodland types of the National Vegetation Classification (NVC) in which species occur. Plants more frequently found in hedgerows were associated with fewer woodland communities suggesting that hedgerows contain only a narrow range of recognised woodland NVC stand types. Also, a significantly higher proportion of ancient woodland indicators were found in the group of plants that were more frequent in woodlands. Overall, results suggested that the environments of hedgerows are more similar to woodland edges than interiors. Qualitative differences between the environmental characteristics of hedgerows and woodlands are such that certain woodland plant species are highly likely to be limited in their capacity to use hedgerow networks. Implications for conservation of biodiversity are considered. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

AB  - Estrogenic discharges are known or suspected to be present in many United Kingdom estuaries and are also occurring from offshore oil and gas installations. The aim of this study was to establish whether estrogens and their mimics are present in marine waters at concentrations that can produce biological responses in fish and, if so, to discover whether the effects are likely to be harmful to populations and communities through changes in reproductive and other physiological processes. Laboratory studies and extensive field surveys were carried out with the euryhaline flounder (Plalichthys flesus), using the amount of yolk protein vitellogenin in the blood of free-living male fish as an indicator of exposure to estrogens. Exposure to the synthetic estrogen ethynylestradiol for 3 weeks confirmed that the vitellogenin response was made and showed that this species is about one order of magnitude less sensitive than the freshwater species rainbow trout. The fish did not respond to the estrogen mimic nonylphenol at concentrations of 30 mu g/L. Wild male flounder were sampled from four contaminated United Kingdom estuaries: the Tyne, Crouch, Thames, and Mersey. Fish from one or more sites in each estuary had significantly elevated concentrations of vitellogenin in their blood when compared to concentrations in fish from the clean control estuary (Alde River). Vitellogenin concentrations in the Tyne and Mersey fish were four and six orders of magnitude greater, respectively, than control concentrations. Elevated vitellogenin concentrations were also seen in some male flounder caught in coastal areas. Approximately 20% of male fish from the Mersey estuary contained oocytes in their testes, but this intersex condition was not seen elsewhere. The implications of these findings for fish populations are discussed.

AB  - Two complementary surveys of the benthos around the United Kingdom coastline and offshore are described. The first sampled the macroinfauna by day grab at several stations around the England and Wales coastline as part of a wider interdisciplinary assessment of environmental quality by the regulatory authorities. The second sampled the epifauna with a small beam trawl at the grab stations, and at several additional stations, most of which were in the central and southern North Sea.
   Similar infaunal assemblages were encountered on both the eastern and western UK coasts in comparable environmental conditions. Tidal current velocity and sediment characteristics accounted for a significant amount of the observed variability in species richness and densities. There was no evidence of any adverse effects on these measures of assemblage structure arising from trace metal contamination of sediments.
   Coastal influences (proximity to large estuaries), depth, tidal current velocity, and temperature all helped to explain the distribution of epifaunal assemblages. However, sediment type appeared to be the main structuring force, with a coarser component to samples collected from the north and west of the survey area, i.e. especially around the UK coastline, supporting a much wider variety of sessile taxa.
   Grab samples provide unambiguously quantitative data which can be easily linked with sediment type within the small unit area of the sample. Trawls provide integrated samples of the fauna over a much larger area. However, both the design of the trawl, and inherent uncertainties over its sampling efficiency, determine that the survey results are "operationally defined". and consistency in sampling procedures is essential, especially for the analysis of temporal trends.
   There is a need to provide better working descriptions of the environment along trawl tows where sediments are variable; a combination of acoustic methods and underwater photograpy may be most suitable.

AB  - Leaching/extraction tests are widely used for the assessment of the release of contaminants from different matrices, e.g., leaching tests for waste materials, single extractions for soil and compost materials and sequential extractions for sediments. Extraction procedures are also undertaken for evaluating plant uptake and the effects of landfill applications. In many instances, such schemes are included in national regulations or are considered in the framework of normalizing bodies such as CEN or ISO. If no efforts are made for harmonizing these procedures a multiplicity of tests will result. It is clear that this variety of schemes will not allow the data to be compared worldwide and will hence, create problems for the interpretation of data by the different regulatory bodies. Different groups of analysts (i.e., waste, compost, soil and sediment scientists) often follow radically different approaches, terminologies and data interpretations. Closer relationships between these groups would certainly encourage joint efforts for harmonizing these procedures which could, in some cases, be adapted for different matrices for a given purpose (e.g., assessment of release or soil fertility). At this stage, it was deemed necessary to discuss critically possible strategies to harmonize leaching and extraction schemes for environmental risk assessment and a workshop was held on 4 June, 1994, with participants covering different fields of expertise. The discussions allowed recommendations to be made regarding possible approaches to improve the present situation through, e.g., the creation of networks, interlaboratory studies prior to the adoption of standardized procedures, field validation of leaching/extraction schemes and production of reference materials certified for specified leaching/extraction conditions. This paper gives a summary of the round-table discussions. An outline of the programme along with the panel of experts participating in this workshop is given in the Appendix.

AB  - Butyrylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.8) (BChE) was purified from pigeon serum to electrophoretic homogeneity by a four-step procedure involving blue sepharose CL-6B chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, procainamide affinity chromatography and gel filtration. An overall 2789-fold purification was achieved, with a final specific activity of 61.35 mumol/min/mg. The purified enzyme separated into two peaks when filtered through a column of Sephacryl S-300, a smaller peak containing the tetrameric form of BChE (C4) and a larger peak containing the monomeric form of BChE (C1). Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of both peaks revealed single protein bands which coincided with esterase activity, with approximate M(r) values of 84,000 and 340,000, respectively. The C1 monomer represented 85-90% of the activity found in the pigeon serum. It is not clear whether this polymorphism of BChE in vertebrates contributes to the wider inter-individual variations observed in xenobiotics elimination kinetics and in the response to the pharmacological and toxic effects of pesticides. PAGE of the monomeric form of the enzyme in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate showed only one protein band with a M(r) of 84,000, while that of the tetrameric form revealed two bands, a major protein band (84,000) and a minor band (170,000), representing the monomer and the dimer of the dissociated tetrameric BChE enzyme under reducing conditions. Highly specific polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits against the purified enzyme. These antibodies cross-reacted with other avian BChEs, a criterion which make them useful for the immunopurification of other BChEs from different species as well as for biomonitoring and toxicological studies on the role of esterases as an indicator of avian exposure to organophosphorous pesticides.

AB  - This study analyzed the function of different glutathione S-transferase (GST) isoforms and detoxification metabolism responses in Manila clam, Ruditapes philippinarum, exposed to 4 kinds of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) single, and their mixtures for 15 days under laboratory conditions. 13 kinds of GSTs in R. philippinarum were classified, and the results of tissue distribution indicated that 12 kinds of GSTs (except GST sigma 3) expressed most in digestive glands. We detected the mRNA expression levels of aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling pathway, and detoxification system in digestive glands of clams exposed to benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), chrysene (CHR), benzo[a]anthracene (BaA), benzo[b]fluoranthene (BbF), and BaP + CHR + BaA + BbF, respectively. Among these genes, we selected GST-sigma, GST-omega and GST-pi as potential indicators to BaP; GST-sigma, GST-A and GST-rho to CHR; GST-pi, GST-sigma, GST-A, GST-rho and GST-microsomal to BaA; GST-theta and GST-mu to BbF; while GST-pi and GST-mu to the mixture of BaP, CHR, BaA and BbF. Additionally, the bioaccumulation of PAHs in tissues increased remarkably over time, and showed an obvious dose effect. Under the same concentration, the bioaccumulation in single exposure group was higher than that in mixture group, and the bioaccumulation of PAHs in tissues with different concentrations of stress was irregular. The results revealed the metabolic differences and bioaccumulation rules in clams exposed to four kinds of PAHs, and provided more valuable information for the PAHs risk assessment.

AB  - Background The timing of migration for herbivorous migratory birds is thought to coincide with spring phenology as emerging vegetation supplies them with the resources to fuel migration, and, in species with a capital breeding strategy also provides individuals with energy for use on the breeding grounds. Individuals with very long migration distances might however have to trade off between utilising optimal conditions en route and reaching the breeding grounds early, potentially leading to them overtaking spring on the way. Here, we investigate whether migration distance affects how closely individually tracked Eurasian wigeons follow spring phenology during spring migration. Methods We captured wigeons in the Netherlands and Lithuania and tracked them throughout spring migration to identify staging sites and timing of arrival. Using temperature-derived indicators of spring phenology, we investigated how maximum longitude reached and migration distance affected how closely wigeons followed spring. We further estimated the impact of tagging on wigeon migration by comparing spring migratory timing between tracked individuals and ring recovery data sets. Results Wigeons migrated to locations between 300 and 4000 km from the capture site, and migrated up to 1000 km in a single day. We found that wigeons migrating to more north-easterly locations followed spring phenology more closely, and increasingly so the greater distance they had covered during migration. Yet we also found that despite tags equalling only around 2% of individual's body mass, individuals were on average 11-12 days slower than ring-marked individuals from the same general population. Discussion Overall, our results suggest that migratory strategy can vary dependent on migration distance within species, and even within the same migratory corridor. Individual decisions thus depend not only on environmental cues, but potentially also trade-offs made during later life-history stages.

AB  - Urban villages are typical informal settlements in Chinese cities where rural villages were gradually surrounded by urban built environments during urbanisation. In the era of urban renewal, these "urban enclaves" have been systematically demolished due to their "chaotic" building layouts and "backward" appearance. Existing policies related to the redevelopment of urban villages mainly follow a "demolish-rebuild" orientation, while lacking sufficient consideration of the mechanisms behind their environmental aspects and performances. In the long run, such a direction of urban redevelopment will hinder the achievement of sustainable development goals. This paper reviews the major municipal-level policies that relate to urban villages and urban renewal in Shenzhen through the adoption of systematic literature survey and content analysis. An analytical framework of "Three Contents and Six Instruments" is established to examine the highlighted and overlooked aspects of these policies. Results reveal that Shenzhen's implemented policies aim to formulise, modernise, and consequently homogenise urban villages into "urban-like modern communities" through the following upgrades: urban infrastructure development, improvement of sanitation conditions, and building facade beautification. However, these approaches for "environmental enhancement" were not primarily based on identifying and understanding the real causes of the exhibiting "environmental problems." Meanwhile, the inspiration and inheritance of informal rules, especially the involvement and participation of residents for the rehabilitation of urban villages have been entirely overlooked. These two overlooked crucial aspects should be introduced in policy-making and integrated with existing adopted strategies to match local contexts and resolve specific issues. The paper advocates to extend the connotation of the concept of environment from an infrastructural consideration to a mechanism-based and performance-orientation thinking during the making of urban renewal policies. It suggests that environment could be utilised as an inclusive medium to efficiently frame and link multiple aspects in the policies.

AB  - The high share of impermeable surfaces in cities modifies the terrain characteristics that facilitate natural water flow and balance. The street network, an impervious surface on its own, is also the impetus for developing other impervious surfaces by facilitating access. The purpose of this work is to assess the interconnectedness between the underlying structural lines of the terrain and the street network for making informed decisions on locating green infrastructure to maintain water balance. For this purpose, the work measures the spatio-structural similarity between the co-located networks, assesses the variation of the measure with city size and relation to an indicator of water balance. Cross-sectional analysis is performed across a large sample of cities of varying sizes to extract generalized patterns of spatial structure and variations to size. The larger cities have low index values of spatio-structural similarity ranging between -0.2 and 0.2. The low index values for larger cities relate to the emergence of small-world properties in large street networks for functional efficiency and large street networks' web-like shape. Next, the paper identifies two zones based on the interconnectedness of the roads and the terrain. The spatial extent of a zone based on points where the arterial road intersects higher orders of drainage channels and ridgelines is associated with the number of above-normal wet conditions (SPEI >= 2.0) with the r-value of -0.30 at a p-value of 0.05. In summary, spatial statistics on spatial network data are helpful to extract trends inherent in the multi-layered network structure of cities to provide informed solutions. The policymakers and planners can use the spatial co-location patterns between street and terrain to make data-driven decisions to locate interventions for a nature-based resilient city.

AB  - The use of automation in cars is increasing. In future vehicles, drivers will no longer be in charge of the main driving task and may be allowed to perform a secondary task. However, they might be requested to regain control of the car if a hazardous situation occurs (i.e., conditionally automated driving). Performing a secondary task might increase drivers' mental workload and consequently decrease the takeover performance if the workload level exceeds a certain threshold. Knowledge about the driver's mental state might hence be useful for increasing safety in conditionally automated vehicles. Measuring drivers' workload continuously is essential to support the driver and hence limit the number of accidents in takeover situations. This goal can be achieved using machine learning techniques to evaluate and classify the drivers' workload in real-time. To evaluate the usefulness of physiological data as an indicator for workload in conditionally automated driving, three physiological signals from 90 subjects were collected during 25 min of automated driving in a fixed-base simulator. Half of the participants performed a verbal cognitive task to induce mental workload while the other half only had to monitor the environment of the car. Three classifiers, sensor fusion and levels of data segmentation were compared. Results show that the best model was able to successfully classify the condition of the driver with an accuracy of 95%. In some cases, the model benefited from sensors' fusion. Increasing the segmentation level (e.g., size of the time window to compute physiological indicators) increased the performance of the model for windows smaller than 4 min, but decreased for windows larger than 4 min. In conclusion, the study showed that a high level of drivers' mental workload can be accurately detected while driving in conditional automation based on 4-min recordings of respiration and skin conductance.

AB  - Oceanic upwelling is an important process in ocean cycling and has implications for climate change and ocean productivity. During the Late Ordovician to early Silurian (O/S) transition, many dramatic geologic events occurred, including the Hirnantian Glaciation, enhanced organic matter accumulation, and upwelling events. Upwelling is thought to be closely linked to contemporary geologic events; however, the internal relationships and mechanisms involved remain poorly understood due to a reliance on qualitative evidence and low-resolution data. To better determine the presence and development of upwelling, as well as its underlying mechanisms and potential implications for environmental changes during the O/S transition, we report new evidence and insights based on data for South China. Detailed petrographic and geochemical analyses of a well-sequenced drill core from the Lower Yangtze region are presented and compared with other extensively examined sections from the Upper Yangtze region. We show that the excessive biogenic silica content associated with certain geochemical fingerprints (i.e., Cd/Mo, Co x Mn, and Co-EF x Mn-EF) offer compelling evidence for widespread upwelling in the Yangtze region during the O/S transition. This upwelling was strong during the late Katian to Hirnantian, significantly weaker during the early Rhuddanian, and was generally more intense in the relatively deep waters of the Yangtze region. The glacially-influenced temperature difference between the poles and equator, as well as longshore trade winds, may have been the drivers of this widespread upwelling. The upwelling event may have increased surface productivity, driving the accumulation of organic matter in the Wufeng Formation in South China. Moreover, the upwelling event can be regarded as a broad indicator of Late Ordovician glaciation and may be the geochemical basis for the Boda warm Event that occurred prior to Hirnantian cooling.

AB  - The world's elderly population is growing, and in Chile they represent 16.2% of the total population. In Chile, old age is marked by retirement, with a dramatic decrease in income that brings precariousness. Older adults are economically, socially, and psychologically vulnerable populations. This condition increases their likelihood of disengaging from their usual social environment, facilitating their isolation, sadness, and discomfort. From the perspective of social identity, well-being (WB) can be explained by two principles: social groups' importance for health and people's psychological identification with those groups. This study analyzes the relationships between belonging to the neighborhood and extra-neighborhood groups and neighborhood social identification with WB. Urban or rural location and gender are measured, and the sample is 1,475 older Chilean adults of both sexes. The results show that the majority are not members of social groups (52%), and the remaining 48% are members of one or two groups or organizations (42.65%). Only 4.47% belong to three groups or organizations. Those who belong to groups obtain higher scores, emotional-mental WB, and positive emotions than older adults who do not belong to any organization. Urban and rural older adults have the same level of WB. Membership in close social organizations (neighborhood councils) or distant ones (clubs for the elderly and religious groups) causes different WB associations. Membership in neighborhood councils reduces gender differences in self-assessment of health. This result supports the idea that participation in heterogeneous groups with a shared sense of belonging to the neighborhood is associated with higher WB and lower perceived loneliness. Social identification with the neighborhood, rather than belonging to the group, had the most widespread impact on WB and health indicators. The variable social identification with the neighborhood was consistently associated with indicators of hedonic WB.

AB  - Climate change mitigation entails reaching net-zero emissions, which in turn requires unprecedented actions in all aspects of society. These include the cement industry, which represents 7% of global CO2 emissions. A proposed option for reducing CO2 emissions in the cement industry is the use of CO2-containing flue gas and cement kiln dust (CKD) for producing mineral carbonates that serve as non-reactive fillers for blending cement. This work proposes the mineral carbonation of CKD (MCCKD process) to convert CO2 to synthetic carbonates and analyzes under which conditions the MCCKD process can be a promising concept for the cement industry in Colombia. For this purpose, an existing conventional cement plant (base case) is compared with a hypothetical cement plant with MCCKD. Both systems are compared in an integrated techno-economic and environmental assessment and in eight emission scenarios with no full-abatement (NA) and full-abatement (FA) parameters, assuming a conventional energy mix and a renewable energy mix. Key findings show that implementing the MCCKD process increases by 27-30 % the cost of goods manufactured (COGM) for a 7-8% reduction in CO2 emissions for fossil and renewable scenarios, respectively, in the NA scenario. In contrast, the FA scenarios result in a reduction of COGM by 13-14 % for fossil and renewable scenarios. The evaluation supports the economic feasibility of implementing the MCCKD within a conventional cement plant from a net-zero emissions perspective, with total CO2-captured costs ranging from 37.2 to 43.9 USD/t CO2-captured (FA). The analysis shows that the MCCKD process, combined with transport and storage with renewable energy sources, has significant economic and environmental advantages compared to the same process based on fossil energy sources.

AB  - Energy storage is recognized as a key technology for enabling the transition to a low-carbon, sustainable future. Energy storage requires careful management, and capacity prediction of a lithium-ion battery (LIB) is an essential indicator in a battery management system for Electric Vehicles and Electricity Grid Management. However, present techniques for capacity prediction rely mainly on the quality of the features extracted from measured signals under strict operating conditions. To improve flexibility and accuracy, this paper introduces a new paradigm based on a multi-domain features time-frequency image (TFI) analysis and transfer deep learning algorithm, in order to extract diagnostic characteristics on the degradation inside the LIB. Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is used to transfer the one-dimensional (1D) terminal voltage signals of the battery into 2D images (i.e., wavelet energy concentration). The generated TFIs are fed into the 2D deep learning algorithms to extract the features from the battery voltage images. The extracted features are then used to predict the capacity of the LIB. To validate the proposed technique, experimental data on LIB cells from the experimental datasets published by the Prognostics Center of Excellence (PCoE) NASA were used. The results show that the TFI analysis clearly visualised the degradation process of the battery due to its capability to extract different information on electrochemical features from the non-stationary and non-linear nature of the battery signal in both the time and frequency domains. AlexNet and VGG-16 transfer deep learning neural networks combined with stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM) and adaptive data momentum (ADAM) optimization algorithms are examined to classify the obtained TFIs at different capacity values. The results reveal that the proposed scheme achieves 95.60% prediction accuracy, indicating good potential for the design of improved battery management systems.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the forest stand structure in managed and unmanaged ravine forests. The study was conducted in the Carpathians and the Krakow-Czestochowa Upland (SE Poland). We used 24 plots, of which 13 were from managed forests and 11 from unmanaged areas. We used 12 metrics related to both living and dead trees. The density of large living trees, quadratic mean diameter and maximum diameter were higher in the unmanaged forests, while the total density of all living trees, percentage of dead trees and number of stumps were higher in the managed forests. In addition, we found only subtle differences related to dead trees. The point pattern analysis also showed differences in the spatial distribution of trees. In unmanaged forests, we found a tendency towards tree aggregation, which was significant in several plots at small distances (up to 5 m), thereby suggesting the common presence of trees with multiple stems. In managed forests, we did not find any significant deviations from random patterns.
   Our findings show that forest management significantly influences the stand structure in ravine forests. Surprisingly, although metrics related to dead trees are considered as the best indicators of naturalness, we detected only subtle differences between managed and unmanaged forests. The characteristics related to living trees performed much better when distinguishing between managed and unmanaged stands. This is probably due to the specific habitat conditions in ravine forests characterized by steep slopes and highly dynamic dead biomass. In addition, a lack of tree clusters in managed forests is probably a result of selective cutting of trees with multiple stems. Finally, we conclude that the analysis of stand structure is more sensitive for the detection of management than a comparison of the plant species composition.

AB  - A geochemical analysis has been conducted on twenty-six sediment samples spanning the P-E boundary interval collected from the Esna Shale in three well-dated stratigraphic sections in west-central Sinai, Egypt to interpret paleoenvironmental changes associated with the P-E boundary events. The Esna Shale consists of hemipelagic marine shales and marls and it is subdivided stratigraphically into the uppermost Paleocene Hanadi Member unconformably overlain by the lowermost Eocene Dababiya Quarry Bed (DQB) and El-Mahmiya members. A variety of geochemical proxies including the Al-normalized elemental concentrations and redox-related elemental ratios and parameter (V/Cr, V/V + Ni and Mn*) and productivity indicators (P-org and Ba-bio) were employed for paleoceanographic interpretations. Across the P-E transition, the concentrations of SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3 Fe2O3, MgO, V, Cr, Ni, Cu, Rb, and Zr notably increased, whereas the concentrations of CaO, MnO, Sr, and Zn abruptly decreased. The variation in the elemental concentrations is attributed to the carbonate dissolution because of increased ocean acidification as well as a brief increase in the detrital influx associated with the brief humid interval at the base of the Eocene. The Al-normalized detrital-related elements (Ti, Zr, and Rb) values show a relatively homogeneous profile suggesting a uniform detrital input from an unchanged source rock. The simultaneous significant increase in the V/Cr and V/V + Ni ratios and enrichment of Ni, Cu, and Zn in the sediments of the DQB suggest that the depositional basin experienced dysoxic to slightly anoxic bottom conditions. The coeval increase in the P-org and Ba-bio in the sediments of the DQB suggests an increase in nutrients availability and consequently primary productivity possibly due to enhanced upwelling during early Eocene.

AB  - Water quality monitoring and predicting the changes in water characteristics require the collection of water samples in a timely manner. Water sample collection based on in situ measurable water quality indicators can increase the efficiency and precision of data collection while reducing the cost of laboratory analyses. The objective of this research was to develop an adaptive water sampling device for an aerial robot and demonstrate the accuracy of its functions in laboratory and field conditions. The prototype device consisted of a sensor node with dissolved oxygen, pH, electrical conductivity, temperature, turbidity, and depth sensors, a microcontroller, and a sampler with three cartridges. Activation of water capturing cartridges was based on in situ measurements from the sensor node. The activation mechanism of the prototype device was tested with standard solutions in the laboratory and with autonomous water sampling flights over the 11-ha section of a lake. A total of seven sampling locations were selected based on a grid system. Each cartridge collected 130 mL of water samples at a 3.5 m depth. Mean water quality parameters were measured as 8.47 mg/L of dissolved oxygen, pH of 5.34, 7 mu S/cm of electrical conductivity, temperature of 18 degrees C, and 37 Formazin Nephelometric Unit (FNU) of turbidity. The dissolved oxygen was within allowable limits that were pre-set in the self-activation computer program while the pH, electrical conductivity, and temperature were outside of allowable limits that were specified by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Therefore, the activation mechanism of the device was triggered and water samples were collected from all the sampling locations successfully. The adaptive water sampling with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-assisted water sampling device was proved to be a successful method for water quality evaluation.

AB  - The question of the origin of Alpine farming and pastoral activities associated with seasonal vertical transhumance and dairy production in the Silvretta Alps (Eastern Switzerland) has recently benefitted from renewed interest. There, pastoral practises began during the Late Neolithic (2300 BC), but alpine dairy farming was directly evidenced so far only since the Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age (1300-500 BC). The vegetation development, timberline shifts at 2280 m a.s.l. and environmental conditions of the subalpine Urschai Valley (Canton of Grisons, Switzerland) were reconstructed for the small (8 m(2)) Plan da Mattun fen based on palynological and geochemical analyses for the last six millennia. The X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyses are among the first ones performed on a European peatland in such altitudes. A high Rb/Sr ratio in the fen peat sediments revealed an increase in catchment erosion during the time when the forests of the Upper Urschai Valley were steadily diminished probably by fire and livestock impact (2300-1700 BC). These landscape openings were paralleled by increasing micro-charcoal influx values, suggesting that prehistoric people actively set fire on purpose. Simultaneously, palynological evidence for pastoralism was revealed, such as pollen from typical herbs indicating livestock trampling, and abundant spores from coprophilous fungi. Since then, vertical transhumance and pastoral activities remained responsible for the open subalpine landscape above 2000 m a.s.l., most probably also in the context of milk and dairy production since 1300 BC, which is characteristic for the European Alps until today.

AB  - Adjustments of upstream river regimes are one of the main factors affecting downstream fluvial processes. However, not all adjustments of river regimes will propagate downstream. There are some distinctive river reaches where upstream and downstream adjustments have no relevance. However, the irrelevance is neither caused by different river types nor by the different conditions of water and sediment; but rather, the channel boundaries and riverbed morphologies block the propagation effect. These are referred to here as the barrier river reach phenomena. The migration of the thalweg line is the essential reason for causing the propagation effect. Numerous influencing factors for thalweg migration exist, including 1) the average flow rate above the critical bankfull discharge, the average flow rate below the critical bankfull discharge, and their ratio, 2) the ratio of the duration of the aforementioned two periods, 3) the thalweg displacement at the entrance of the river reach, 4) the deflecting flow intensity of the node, 5) the ratio of the river width to water depth, 6) the relative width of the floodplain, and 7) the Shields number. In this study, the correlativity between the measured distances and the restricting indicators of thalweg migration in the Middle Yangtze River over the years was established. The barrier degree of 27 singlethread river reaches was subsequently assessed. These reaches included 4 barrier river reaches; 5 transitional reaches transforming from barrier to non-barrier; 10 transitional reaches transforming from non-barrier to barrier; and 8 non-barrier river reaches. Barrier river reaches were found to be important for maintaining the stability of the river regime and the transverse equilibrium of sediment transport in the downstream reaches. To some extent, the barrier river reaches may protect the natural dynamical properties from being destroyed by artificial river regulation works. Thus, they are of great significance for river management.

AB  - Soil microbial respiration (SMR) is considered a robust estimate of potential soil biological activity. SMR measurement by incubation studies in laboratory conditions is a well-established technique, however is costly and time consuming depending on the selected incubation period. Based on 210 data available from Iran and Italy, we developed and validated (randomly selecting 70 and 30% of total data, respectively) a multiple linear regression analysis procedure for evaluating SMR. CumR (cumulative respiration during a 28 days incubation period) was evaluated from laboratory incubation measured at day 1 (R1d), day 2 (R2d) and day 4 (R4d), and CbasR (basal respiration at the last day of incubation, 28 days) from laboratory incubation at R4d. The best model prediction for CumR was found for the three parameters model (R1d, R2d and R4d; Adjusted R-2 = 0.90, RMSE = 46.5), and was still accurate in the two parameters model (R1d and R4d; Adjusted R-2 = 0.89, RMSE= 48.1) and in the one parameter model (R4d; Adjusted R-2 = 0.86, RMSE= 57.2). Model prediction for CbasR from R4d was acceptable (Adjusted R-2= 0.71, RMSE= 3.64). Since the main aim of the study was to provide a time and cost-effective method for deriving CumR and CbasR, we can speculate that model prediction based on one parameter model (R4d) is still sufficiently accurate. The models were validated with a large dataset of laboratory measures from Italy (1050 samples) and very close relationships were found between actual and predicted values for both CumR and CbasR. Therefore, the proposed models can be used for the application of composite indexes for soil quality assessment and recommended for further research with the same methodology using other datasets.

AB  - Middle Jurassic mudstones from the Yangye Formation are widely exposed in the Kashi Sag and regarded as significant potential source rocks. Geochemical characteristics of mudstones in the Keziletao Depression have been analysed to decipher their source-area weathering, provenance, tectonic setting, and depositional environment that have received significantly little attention. Mudstones are characterized by high Ca, U, Th, and REE contents when compared to those of PAAS. Their total REE abundances range from 155.2 to 234.2 ppm, with the enrichment of LREEs and distinct negative Eu anomalies, implying a principal felsic provenance. Various indicators (e.g., CIA, Th/Sc, ICV, and Rb/Sr) and A-CN-K ternary diagram suggest parental rocks experienced a moderate to intense chemical weathering degree and simple recycling and sorting. Furthermore, paleoenvironmental indexes (e.g., B, "S," Sr/Ba, "C," Sr/Cu, and V/(V + Ni)) indicate that they were likely deposited in a suboxic to anoxic freshwater setting, with semi-arid to semi-humid paleoclimatic conditions during the deposition of Yangye Formation. The geochemical data also demonstrate that the provenances were derived predominantly from the unroofing of felsic rocks with a minor intermediate supply. These parental rocks were commonly formed in the continental island arc, active continental margin, and/or collision tectonic settings. The results of this study, combined with published data, suggest the West Kunlun Orogen and thrusting zone to the west and south-west of the basin were probably arrested to provide substantial detritus for sediments, stimulating a better understanding for the formation mechanism of the Yangye Formation sediments (especially for potential source rocks) in the Kashi Sag.

AB  - Urban configuration can influence the local thermal environment by altering energy balances. However, previous studies have found that either sprawling urban or compact urban development could intensify urban heat island (UHI) intensity. How urban configurations can mitigate the UHI intensity has drawn full attention. In this study, we quantified the diurnal and seasonal UHI intensities in 36 cities in China and investigated their response to urban configurations. In each city, urban land cover maps were classified from Landsat 8 and UHIs were quantified using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST). Results show that the average UHI intensities of 36 cities vary temporally with a sequence of summer day > summer night > winter night > winter day. Moreover, whether the daytime UHI is higher or lower than the nighttime UHI significantly depends on climatic zones and seasons. Besides, we found that UHIs significantly correlate with urban configurations in two ways. First, for the spatial structure among built-up patches, a lower UHI located in the smaller built-up area with dispersed distribution when compared to the larger built-up patches, if the total built-up area holds constant. Second, for the spatial structure of a single patch, the single patch with more complex shape would mitigate the UHI intensities. Overall, urban configuration and other control variables (e.g., urban characteristics and climatic condition) can explain 41% and 51% of the variance in UHI in summer day and night, respectively. Therefore, the design of urban configuration can serve as an essential practice to mitigate UHI intensity. Considering the difficulties of altering the urban configuration in the urbanized area, planting vegetation might be a great choice to change the urban contiguity and shape complexity with providing an extra cooling effect.

AB  - Transport planning is gradually shifting targets towards modifying the pedestrian streetscapes that favor walking and enhance urban sustainability. We cannot be optimistic about walkability on condition that walkable streets are not evenly distributed within urban settings. Auditing the street walkability and associated social inequalities in developing countries should provide critical implications for transport planning. This paper identifies the most common indicators in existing indicator classification frameworks based on word frequency; and then establishes an indicator classification system (connectivity, accessibility, suitability, serviceability, and perceptibility) through expert panel evaluation for auditing street walkability in China. Using a case of Hangzhou metropolitan area, a set of 13 indicators are first selected by referring to the established indicator classification system and then aggregated into an integrated walkability index (IWI) through the catastrophe theory (CT) model after appropriate data treatment (standardization, normalization and correlation calculation). Camera signaling data are employed to validate the developed IWI. Results show that IWI is efficient to audit street walkability. IWI presents great heterogeneity at segment level. In general, higher walkability is observed in streets across the central and western areas. Walkability profiles of the segments are further produced by the clustering approach and the categorized groups can inform more targeted planning options. Spatial regression is finally utilized to quantify the associations between community socio-demographics and neighborhood IWI at two levels. We discover that lower neighborhood walkability would be observed in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. These results suggest that significant social inequalities in street walkability should exist across the communities within Hangzhou metropolitan area. The developed IWI not only brings a standardized measurement of street walkability in the field of transport planning, but also paves the way for addressing the social inequalities in street design across various jurisdictions.

AB  - River ice breakup is an annual event with ecological and economic significance in the Northern Hemisphere. Breakup timing forecasting is critical for supporting emergency responses to river-ice related flooding. Little attention has been paid to applications of the classification and regression tree (CART) and M5 models as well as the stacking ensemble of multiple types of model trees to river ice forecasting problem. Thus, a framework of stacking ensemble tree models (SETM) is proposed, which consists of multiple types of model trees in a two-level structure: base and ensemble models. The Athabasca River at Fort McMurray is selected as the study area because the Athabasca River is the largest unregulated river in Alberta, Canada and ice jams frequently occur in the vicinity of Fort McMurray. To facilitate the comparison of models, the historical data in the past 36 years is collected and the leave-one-out cross validation method is employed. The results show that, the indicators influencing or corresponding with the breakup timing can be categorized as temperature and water flow conditions just before breakup (in March), during freeze-up (in last November and last December) and during middle winter (in January). The performance of optimal CART and M5 models are almost the same but the M5 model does simplify the tree structure. Although their performance can be further improved by the SETM framework, the structure of the base models can facilitate explicit explanations of the relations between indicators and the breakup date. In terms of validation performance (RMSEavg), the optimal ensemble model is the simple average method, which improves upon the two optimal base models (CART and M5) by 13.1% and 13.2%, respectively.

AB  - Sleep electroencephalography (EEG) provides an opportunity to study sleep scientifically, whose chaotic, dynamic, complex, and dissipative nature implies that non-linear approaches could uncover some mechanism of sleep. Based on well-established complexity theories, one hypothesis in sleep medicine is that lower complexity of brain waves at pre-sleep state can facilitate sleep initiation and further improve sleep quality. However, this has never been studied with solid data. In this study, EEG collected from healthy subjects was used to investigate the association between pre-sleep EEG complexity and sleep quality. Multiscale entropy analysis (MSE) was applied to pre-sleep EEG signals recorded immediately after light-off (while subjects were awake) for measuring the complexities of brain dynamics by a proposed index, CI1-30. Slow wave activity (SWA) in sleep, which is commonly used as an indicator of sleep depth or sleep intensity, was quantified based on two methods, traditional Fast Fourier transform (FR) and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD). The associations between wake EEG complexity, sleep latency, and SWA in sleep were evaluated. Our results demonstrated that lower complexity before sleep onset is associated with decreased sleep latency, indicating a potential facilitating role of reduced pre-sleep complexity in the wake-sleep transition. In addition, the proposed EEMD-based method revealed an association between wake complexity and quantified SWA in the beginning of sleep (90 min after sleep onset). Complexity metric could thus be considered as a potential indicator for sleep interventions, and further studies are encouraged to examine the application of EEG complexity before sleep onset in populations with difficulty in sleep initiation. Further studies may also examine the mechanisms of the causal relationships between pre-sleep brain complexity and SWA, or conduct comparisons between normal and pathological conditions.

AB  - Particulate matter (PM) is one of the most serious environmental problems, exacerbating respiratory and vascular illnesses. Plants have the ability to reduce non-point source PM pollution through retention on leaves and branches. Studies of the dynamic processes of PM retention by plants and the mechanisms influencing this process will help to improve the efficiency of urban greening for PM reduction. We examined dynamic processes of PM retention and the major factors influencing PM retention by six trees with different branch structure characteristics in wind tunnel experiments at three different wind speeds. The results showed that the changes of PM numbers retained by plant leaves over time were complex dynamic processes for which maximum values could exceed minimum values by over 10 times. The average value of PM measured in multiple periods and situations can be considered a reliable indicator of the ability of the plant to retain PM. The dynamic processes were similar for PM10 and PM2.5. They could be clustered into three groups simulated by continually-rising, inverse U-shaped, and U-shaped polynomial functions, respectively. The processes were the synthetic effect of characteristics such as species, wind speed, period of exposure and their interactions. Continually-rising functions always explained PM retention in species with extremely complex branch structure. Inverse U-shaped processes explained PM retention in species with relatively simple branch structure and gentle wind. The U-shaped processes mainly explained PM retention at high wind speeds and in species with a relatively simple crown. These results indicate that using plants with complex crowns in urban greening and decreasing wind speed in plant communities increases the chance of continually-rising or inverse U-shaped relationships, which have a positive effect in reducing PM pollution.

AB  - Six species of phytoplankton recently isolated from upper San Francisco Bay were tested for their sensitivity to growth inhibition by ammonium (NH4+), and for differences in growth rates according to inorganic nitrogen (N) growth source. The quantum yield of photosystem II (F-v/F-m) was a sensitive indicator of NH4+ toxicity, manifested by a suppression of F-v/F-m in a dose-dependent manner. Two chlorophytes were the least sensitive to NH4+ inhibition, at concentrations of >3,000moles NH4+<bold>L</bold>-1, followed by two estuarine diatoms that were sensitive at concentrations >1,000 moles NH4+<bold>L</bold>-1, followed lastly by two freshwater diatoms that were sensitive at concentrations between 200 and 500moles NH4+<bold>L</bold>-1. At non-inhibiting concentrations of NH4+, the freshwater diatom species grew fastest, followed by the estuarine diatoms, while the chlorophytes grew slowest. Variations in growth rates with N source did not follow taxonomic divisions. Of the two chlorophytes, one grew significantly faster on nitrate (NO3-), whereas the other grew significantly faster on NH4+. All four diatoms tested grew faster on NH4+ compared with NO3-. We showed that in cases where growth rates were faster on NH4+ than they were on NO3-, the difference was not larger for chlorophytes compared with diatoms. This holds true for comparisons across a number of culture investigations suggesting that diatoms as a group will not be at a competitive disadvantage under natural conditions when NH4+ dominates the total N pool and they will also not have a growth advantage when NO3- is dominant, as long as N concentrations are sufficient.

AB  - A simulation program for the evaluation of leachate generation at landfill sites is herein presented. The developed tool is based on a water balance model that accounts for all the key processes influencing leachate generation through analytical and empirical equations. After a short description of the tool, different simulations on four Italian landfill sites are shown. The obtained results revealed that when literature values were assumed for the unknown input parameters, the model provided a rough estimation of the leachate production measured in the field. In this case, indeed, the deviations between observed and predicted data appeared, in some cases, significant. Conversely, by performing a preliminary calibration for some of the unknown input parameters (e.g. initial moisture content of wastes, compression index), in nearly all cases the model performances significantly improved. These results although showed the potential capability of a water balance model to estimate the leachate production at landfill sites also highlighted the intrinsic limitation of a deterministic approach to accurately forecast the leachate production over time. Indeed, parameters such as the initial water content of incoming waste and the compression index, that have a great influence on the leachate production, may exhibit temporal variation due to seasonal changing of weather conditions (e.g. rainfall, air humidity) as well as to seasonal variability in the amount and type of specific waste fractions produced (e.g. yard waste, food, plastics) that make their prediction quite complicated. In this sense, we believe that a tool such as the one proposed in this work that requires a limited number of unknown parameters, can be easier handled to quantify the uncertainties.

AB  - The aim of the study was to demonstrate the impact of soil agricultural usage on the abundance of ammonifying bacteria (AB) and their activity, expressed as arginine ammonification (AA). Five agriculturally exploited types of soils (FAO): Haplic Luvisol, Brunic Arenosol, Mollic Gleysol, Eutric Fluvisol, and Rendzina Leptosol were studied. The controls were non-agricultural soils of the same type located in close proximity to agricultural sites. The tested soils varied in terms of pH (4.18-7.08), total carbon (8.39-34.90 g kg(-1)), easily degradable carbon content (0.46-1.11 g kg(-1)), moisture (5.20-13.50 %), and nitrogen forms (mg kg(-1)): 1.68-27.17, 0.036-0.862, 0.012-3.389 for nitrate nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, and ammonia nitrogen, respectively. The AB abundance in agricultural soils ranged from 1.1 to 6.4 x 10(4) cfu g(-1), while in the controls it was significantly higher-from 2.0 to 110 x 10(4) cfu g(-1) of soil. Also, AA in the controls was three-times higher than in the agricultural soils. Strong associations between AA and the abundance of AB in the control (r = 0.954***) and agricultural soils (r = 0.833***) were proved. In the agricultural soils, the AB abundance and AA were influenced by pH (r = 0.746*** and r = 0.520***) and carbon content (r = 0.488*** and r = 0.391***). The AB abundance was also affected by easily degradable carbon (r = 0.517**) and nitrite nitrogen (r = 0.376*), whilst ammonium nitrogen influenced AA (r = 0.451*). Our results indicate that the abundance of AB and AA may be good indicators of soil biological conditions.

AB  - Three dimensional (3D) culture is a more physiologically relevant method to model cell behavior in vitro than two dimensional culture. Carcinomas, including breast carcinomas, are complex 3D tissues composed of cancer epithelial cells and stromal components, including fibroblasts and extracellular matrix (ECM). Yet most in vitro models of breast carcinoma consist only of cancer epithelial cells, omitting the stroma and, therefore, the 3D architecture of a tumor in vivo. Appropriate 3D modeling of carcinoma is important for accurate understanding of tumor biology, behavior, and response to therapy. However, the duration of culture and volume of 3D models is limited by the availability of oxygen and nutrients within the culture. Herein, we demonstrate a method in which breast carcinoma epithelial cells and stromal fibroblasts are incorporated into ECM to generate a 3D breast cancer surrogate that includes stroma and can be cultured as a solid 3D structure or by using a perfusion bioreactor system to deliver oxygen and nutrients. Following setup and an initial growth period, surrogates can be used for preclinical drug testing. Alternatively, the cellular and matrix components of the surrogate can be modified to address a variety of biological questions. After culture, surrogates are fixed and processed to paraffin, in a manner similar to the handling of clinical breast carcinoma specimens, for evaluation of parameters of interest. The evaluation of one such parameter, the density of cells present, is explained, where ImageJ and CellProfiler image analysis software systems are applied to photomicrographs of histologic sections of surrogates to quantify the number of nucleated cells per area. This can be used as an indicator of the change in cell number over time or the change in cell number resulting from varying growth conditions and treatments.

AB  - Organic-rich sediments within the Abu Gabra Formation from three wells in the Great Moga oilfield were analyzed using organic geochemistry and organic petrology. The analyzed samples generally contain more than 2.0 wt.% TOC and have a very good to excellent hydrocarbon generative potential. This is supported by high bitumen extract and hydrocarbon (HCs) yields with values exceeding 4000 and 2000 ppm, respectively. The Abu Gabra also have moderate to high hydrogen index (HI) values of 287-865 mg HC/g TOC and large amounts of amorphous organic matter and alginite, consistent with oil-prone Types I and Type II kerogen. Vitrinite reflectance (0.59-0.72) %Ro and pyrolysis T-max (430-438 degrees C) indicate an early oil window stage. This is supported by bitumen/TOC ratios (0.04-0.09) and biomarker thermal maturity parameters with equilibrium C-32 homohopane 22S/(22S + 22R) ratios (0.50-58), moretane/hopane (0.11-018) and C-29 beta beta/(beta beta + alpha alpha) (0.53-0.73) and 20S/(20S + 20R) ratios (0.26-0.48).
   The biomarkers are characterized by a dominance of low to medium molecular weight n-alkane compounds with significant waxy alkanes (n-C-25-n-C-34), moderately high Pr/Ph ratios (1.17-2.51), high abundance of C-27 regular steranes, high C-27/C-29 regular sterane ratios, the presence of tricyclic terpanes and relatively low sterane/hopane ratios. These data indicate that the organic-rich sediments of the Abu Gabra Formation contain a mixture of aquatic (algal and bacterial) and terrigenous organic matter, deposited in a lacustrine environment and preserved under suboxic conditions.

AB  - Background: Comparative studies of the associations between different infectious diseases and climate variability, such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, are lacking. Diarrheal illnesses, particularly cholera and shigellosis, provide an important opportunity to apply a comparative approach. Cholera and shigellosis have significant global mortality and morbidity burden, pronounced differences in transmission pathways and pathogen ecologies, and there is an established climate link with cholera. In particular, the specific ecology of Vibrio cholerae is often invoked to explain the sensitivity of that disease to climate.
   Methods and Findings: The extensive surveillance data of the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh are used here to revisit the known associations between cholera and climate, and to address their similarity to previously unexplored patterns for shigellosis. Monthly case data for both the city of Dhaka and a rural area known as Matlab are analyzed with respect to their association with El Nino and flooding. Linear correlations are examined between flooding and cumulative cases, as well as for flooding and El Nino. Rank-correlation maps are also computed between disease cases in the post-monsoon epidemic season and sea surface temperatures in the Pacific. Similar climate associations are found for both diseases and both locations. Increased cases follow increased monsoon flooding and increased sea surface temperatures in the preceding winter corresponding to an El Nino event.
   Conclusions: The similarity in association patterns suggests a systemic breakdown in population health with changing environmental conditions, in which climate variability acts primarily through increasing the exposure risk of the human population. We discuss these results in the context of the on-going debate on the relative importance of the environmental reservoir vs. secondary transmission, as well as the implications for the use of El Nino as an early indicator of flooding and enteric disease risk.

AB  - A recent forestry road cut on the slopes of Mt Wysoka (Sudetes Mountains, Central Europe) exposed a 1.6 km-long, nearly continuous outcrop of hillslope regolith. The regolith is divided into two main parts. The lower one is made of disintegrated tuff, while the upper part, from less than 1 m to at least 3 m thick, includes five different lithological types which combine to form recurring layered vertical sequences of cover materials. This upper part is markedly transformed by pedogenesis. The main aims of the paper are to examine and explain vertical and lateral diversity of these cover materials and to review the findings in the context of their origin and age. Methods included field regolith mapping and soil research followed by basic laboratory analyses of soil properties, including particle size distribution, pH and organic carbon content Topmost fine-grained and coarse open-work surface materials have been subject to some, although limited downslope transport, while the underlying layers, although lithologically different, are interpreted as mainly products of bedrock weathering and pedogenic alterations, with minimal downslope movement. Slope corrugation into shallow hollows, indistinct spurs and long sections of planar slope exerts an effect on hillslope materials and soil-forming processes via pathways of groundwater circulation. Open-work structures are mainly products of preferential eluviation. Periglacial inheritance in the regolith is uncertain and these layered materials should not be interpreted as indicators of changing environmental conditions in the late Pleistocene. Regional models of hillslope covers do not fit the complexity of regolith present on Mt Wysoka. Generalizations about hillslope materials are better avoided if a limited number of outcrops is investigated. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Healthcare facility construction is increasing because of population demand and the need to replace ageing infrastructure. Research suggests that there may be a relationship between healthcare environment and patient care. To date, most evaluations of new healthcare facilities are derived from techniques used in other industries and focus on physical, financial and architectural performance. However, few studies have evaluated the impact of healthcare facility design on processes and outcomes of patient care.
   Study aims The primary objective of this study was to investigate the impact of relocation to a new intensive care unit (ICU) facility on clinical performance measures. This study also proposes to develop and test a framework for facility performance evaluation using accepted ICU design guidelines and Donabedian's model for healthcare quality.
   Methods and analysis We will utilise a mixed-methods, observational, retrospective, controlled, before-and-after design to take advantage of the quasiexperimental conditions created with the construction of a new ICU facility in Calgary, Canada. For the qualitative substudy, we will conduct individual interviews with end-users to understand their impressions and experiences with the new environment and perform thematic analysis. For the quantitative substudy, we will compare process of care indicators and patient outcomes for the 12-month period before and after relocation to the new facility. Two other local ICU facilities that did not undergo structural change during the study period will serve as controls. We will triangulate qualitative and quantitative results utilising a novel framework.
   Ethics and dissemination The results of this study will contribute in understanding the impact of new ICU facilities on clinical performance measures centred on patients, their families and healthcare providers. The framework will complement existing building performance evaluation techniques and help healthcare administrators plan new ICU facilities. The University of Calgary Research Ethics Board approved this study protocol.

AB  - Balancing forest harvesting and restoration is critical for forest ecosystem management. In this study, we used LANDIS, a spatially explicit forest landscape model, to evaluate the effects of 21 alternative forest management initiatives which were drafted for forests in the upstream region of the Hun River in northeastern China. These management initiatives included a wide range of planting and harvest intensities for Pinus koraiensis, the historically dominant tree species in the region. Multivariate analysis of variance, Shannon's Diversity Index, and planting efficiency (which indicates how many cells of the target species at the final year benefit from per-cell of the planting trees) estimates were used as indicators to analyze the effects of planting and harvesting regimes on forests in the region. The results showed that the following: (1) Increased planting intensity, although augmenting the coverage of P. koraiensis, was accompanied by decreases in planting efficiency and forest diversity. (2) While selective harvesting could increase forest diversity, the abrupt increase of early succession species accompanying this method merits attention. (3) Stimulating rapid forest succession may not be a good management strategy, since the climax species would crowd out other species which are likely more adapted to future climatic conditions in the long run. In light of the above, we suggest a combination of 30% planting intensity with selective harvesting of 50% and 70% of primary and secondary timber species, respectively, as the most effective management regime in this area. In the long run this would accelerate the ultimate dominance of P. koraiensis in the forest via a more effective rate of planting, while maintaining a higher degree of forest diversity. These results are particularly useful for forest managers constrained by limited financial and labor resources who must deal with conflicts between forest harvesting and restoration.

AB  - The response of diatom assemblages to changes in climate and nutrients over a 1200 year timescale was investigated by means of a multiproxy sediment core study involving radiometric dating, diatoms, grain size, loss on ignition and geochemical analysis. Four stages of environmental change were defined, each being consistent with changes in documented human activity and known climate patterns. From ad 750 to 880 relatively high nutrient status and a cold, unstable climate was inferred based on the high abundance of Aulacoseira subarctica and high Na/K and Na/Al values. In the following 1000 years (AD 880-1880) diatom assemblages were dominated by Cyclotella comensis, Cyclotella radiosa and Achnanthidium minutissimum, suggesting a long period of relatively low productivity and, by implication, that climate was the main control on the community during this period. Two climatic phases, namely the 'Medieval Warm Period' (MWP) and the 'Little Ice Age' (LIA), were apparent. According to shifts in the diatom assemblages and other proxies, it was proposed that the MWP was initiated from similar to AD 880 and was terminated by the LIA at similar to AD 1350. After AD 1880 the palaeoecological data revealed a period of strong human impact in the catchment and hence higher productivity. This work illustrates the complexity of climate-nutrient interactions and the roles of the two drivers on different timescales and at various stages of the lake's history: climate impacts were more pronounced when nutrient concentrations were relatively stable prior to similar to AD 1880; while nutrients appeared to play a more important role in regulating diatom communities from the mid-eighteenth century.

AB  - In monogamous birds, early male parental effort, such as nest building, may serve as a post-mating sexually-selected display allowing female assessment of male quality. We examined the functional significance of male nest building and the potential role of nest size as a sexually-selected signal in the red-necked grebe (Podiceps grisegena), a species with high mate fidelity. Time-activity budgets showed that no behaviour was performed exclusively by one sex in the pre-laying period, but males spent significantly more time nest building and were more often involved in aggressive intra- and interspecific interactions. Nest building in pairs attempting a second brood was also performed predominantly by males. Greater participation in nest construction by males allowed females to allocate more time to self-maintenance activities in the period prior to egg-laying. The positive relationship found between the relative contribution of males to nest building and later to brood provisioning indicates that male nest building is an honest indicator of future paternal effort. Males obtained copulations solicited by females proportionally to the time spent on nest building, and the extent of male participation in nest construction was of importance for explaining variation in clutch size. Nest size itself is not very likely to be sexually selected in red-necked grebes, as it was found to depend on nest site conditions such as water depth and exposure to wave action. We suggest that greater investment of males in energetically demanding pre-laying activities is functionally similar to post-mating courtship feeding; it constitutes males' indirect contribution to clutch production and may help to negotiate the relative investment each sex makes in the different stages of the breeding cycle. The results support the idea that, in monogamous birds, naturally selected male characters related to parental care may evolve into important sexual signals to females, although not into extreme displays.

AB  - Sagebrush-steppe ecosystems are one of the most threatened ecosystems in North America due to woodland expansion, wildfire, and exotic annual grass invasion. Some scientists and policy makers have suggested that woodland expansion will lead to increased carbon (C) storage on the landscape. To assess this potential we used data collected from a Joint Fire Sciences Program demonstration area to develop a Microsoft Excel (TM) based biomass, carbon, and nitrogen (N) spreadsheet model. The model uses input for tree cover, soil chemistry, soil physical properties, and vegetation chemistry to estimate biomass, carbon, and nitrogen accumulation on the landscape with woodland expansion. The model also estimates C and N losses associated with prescribed burning. On our study plots we estimate in treeless sagebrush-steppe ecosystems, biomass accounts for 4.5 Mg ha(-1) C and 0.3 Mg ha(-1) N this is <10% of total estimated ecosystem C and N to a soil depth of 53 cm, but as tree cover increases to near closed canopy conditions aboveground biomass may account for 62 Mg ha(-1) C and 0.6 Mg ha(-1) N which is nearly 53% of total estimated ecosystem C and 13% of total estimated ecosystem N to a soil depth of 53 cm. Prescribed burning removes aboveground biomass, C and N, but may increase soil C at areal tree cover below 26%. The model serves as a tool by which we are able to assess our understanding of the system and identify knowledge gaps which exist for this ecosystem. We believe that further work is necessary to quantify herbaceous biomass, root biomass, woody debris decomposition, and soil C and N with woodland expansion and prescribed fire. It will also be necessary to appropriately scale these estimates from the plot to the landscape. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Two Patagonian lakes studied here, Lago Sarmiento and Laguna Amarga, are located within the orographic rain shadow formed to the east of the Southern Patagonian Ice Field in the Andes Range. Major thrombolite colonies are present in Lago Sarmiento, whereas widespread stromatolites occur in Laguna Amarga. Based on the characterization of the hydrologic system of these two lakes, together with an estimation of the isotopic balance and an analysis of the equilibrium conditions between the water and biologically induced carbonates, it is concluded that the microbialites of Lago Sarmiento are better suited as paleotemperature indicators than those of Laguna Amarga. Lago Sarmiento thrombolites contain unique carbonate mineral species in which carbonate precipitation occurs close to isotopic equilibrium and where the variation in water temperature controls fractionation of the stable oxygen isotope.
   The results indicate that at 1215 cal yr Bp the level of the lake was at 85 m a.s.l with a temperature close to 9.3 degrees C, was at 82 m a.s.l. at 600 cal yr Bp with a temperature close to 8.5 degrees C. This coincides with the timing of the Northern Hemisphere Medieval Warming Period. At 183 cal yr Bp the level of the lake was at 80 m a.s.I with a cooler temperature close to 7.7 degrees C, representing a colder period coinciding with the timing of the Little Ice Age (LIA). An interesting outcome of this study is that it reinforces the idea that the delta C-13 signal in carbonate deposits can be an effective tool in distinguishing between inorganic and biologically induced precipitation.

AB  - Monitoring of nitrate leaching in croplands by lysimeters. The European Nitrates Directive (91/676/CEE) aims at moderating or preventing water pollution with nitrates issued from agricultural practices. The Walloon region transposed it into its law and initiated a Sustainable Nitrogen Management Program on 2002, also called PGDA in French. Six lysimeters have been implemented in agricultural open fields, being under real condition of industrial harvest crops, especially vegetable ones. The lysimeters are used as follow up tools to monitor and quantify the amount of nitrates leaching beyond root zone towards underground water ressource. This study demonstrates that lysimeters are efficient and permit to collect representative quantity of seepage water. Their nitrates content, combined with data related to agricultural practices, fertilisation rates and advised, climate, the defined environmental indicator (APL) provide a global approach to link agricultural practices and underground water protection from nitrates pollution. The lysimeters validate the reliability of the environmental indicator (APL) with the nitrates content in leaching water, which will not be catched up by the next crop. Unfortunately, it is also demonstrated that even when the nitrogen management is respectful of the related legislation, the warranty to respect the targeted norms of water quality on nitrates is not ensured. The lysimeter tool clearly shows that the respect of seepage water quality standards issued from industrial agriculture does not have to be considered crop per crop but rather from an integrated and global approach of the complete crop sequences and rotations, in respect with best agricultural practices, reasonable fertilisation rates, inset crops, etc. for each individual crops. Some favourable and non favourable crop sequences to nitrates content of underground water are listed. Experiments are in progress on crop sequences evaluation and fertilisation levels and advises for Walloon industrial crops and their impacts on the leaching water quality and nitrates content collected by lysimeters.

AB  - Decomposing stature into its major components is proving to be a useful strategy to assess the antecedents of disease, morbidity and death in adulthood. Human leg length (foot + tibia + femur), sitting height (trunk length + head length) and their proportions (for example the relative leg length in proportion to stature, and the sitting height ratio [sitting height/stature x 100], among others) are used as epidemiological markers of risk for overweight (fatness), coronary heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers. There is also wide support for the use of relative leg length as an indicator of the quality of the environment for growth during infancy, childhood and the juvenile years of development. Human beings follow a cephalo-caudal gradient of growth, the pattern of growth common to all mammals. A special feature of the human pattern is that between birth and puberty the legs grow relatively faster than other post-cranial body segments. For groups of children and youth, short stature due to relatively short legs (i.e. a high sitting height ratio) is generally a marker of an adverse environment. The development of human body proportions is the product of environmental x genomic interactions, although few if any specific genes are known. The short stature homeobox-containing gene (SHOX) is the first genomic region that may be relevant to human body proportions. For example, one of the SHOX related disorders is Turner syndrome. However, in most cases research has been showing that environment is a more powerful force to shape leg length and body proportions than genes. Leg length and proportion are important in the perception of human beauty, which is often considered a sign of health and fertility. There are a variety of cosmetic, fashion, and surgical interventions to enhance perceived or actual leg length.

AB  - The flotation tailing pond Bozinta is located at 5 Km West from Baia Mare town. It is closed and is preparing for ecological reclaiming. Preliminary investigations have been made on the meteorological and climatologic indicators of the site. The temperature, air relative humidity, the wind speed, the rain values and the soil temperature have been measured during the vegetation period of 2008 year. The air temperature on the tailing pond is always 1 divided by 2 degrees C higher than the values registered on Sasar riverside located quite near the Southern side of the dump. Very high temperatures and drought have been registered during the months of June and Augus. The temperature values arc higher than the multiannual average values.
   Experiments regarding the installment of different sapling species were conducted during the vegetation season of 2008, in order to determine an effective and reliable method for the phytoremediation of Bozinta tailing pond. 300 saplings of different sizes and ages were used, of the following species: common oak, birch tree, poplar and willow. The saplings were planted in March, directly in the waste soil, with no nutritive add-on or no vegetal soil added.
   The following results were determined during the first year of vegetation: dead saplings: 36% for common oak, 30% for poplar, 22% for birch tree, and 5% for willow. The percentage of dead saplings is lower than the abovementioned values right after planting the saplings, but part of the green saplings (right after they were planted) died during the summer, due to the lack of water.
   Microbiological investigations made on the tailing pond material indicate that the material is rather poor in heterotrophic bacteria, but the fungi and the actinomycetes are well represented. This last result shows the possibility that the roots of the plants could form mycorrhizae, that are not negatively affected by the conditions in the soil.

AB  - Concern has greatly increased about the potential for contamination of water, food, and air by pathogens present in manure. We evaluated pathogen reduction in liquid swine manure in a mufti-stage treatment system where first the solids and liquid are separated with polymer, followed by biological nitrogen (N) removal using nitrification and denitrification, and then phosphorus (P) extraction through lime precipitation. Each step of the treatment system was analyzed for Salmonella and microbial indicators of fecal contamination (total coliforms, fecal coliforms, and enterococci). Before treatment, mean concentrations of Salmonella, total coliforms, fecal coliforms, and enterococci were 3.89, 6.79, 6.23 and 5.73 log(10) colony forming units (cfu)/ml, respectively. The flushed manure contained 10,590 mg/l TSS, 8270 mg/l COD, 688 mg/l TKN and 480 mg/l TP, which were reduced >98% by the treatment system. Results showed a consistent trend in reduction of pathogens and microbial indicators as a result of each step in the treatment system. Solid-liquid separation decreased their concentrations by 0.5-1 log(10). Additional biological N removal treatment with alternating anoxic and oxic conditions achieved a higher reduction with average removals of 2.4 log(10) for Salmonella and 4.1-4.5 log(10) for indicator microbes. Subsequent P treatment decreased concentration of Salmonella and pathogen indicators to undetectable level (<0.3 log(10) cfu/ml) due to elevated process pH (10.3). Our results indicate that nitrification/denitrification treatment after solids separation is very effective in reducing pathogens in liquid swine manure and that the phosphorus removal step via alkaline calcium precipitation produces a sanitized effluent which may be important for biosecurity reasons.

KW  - hot-gas filters
AB  - The University of North Dakota Energy and Environmental Research Center is determining some of the fuel-, sorbent- and operations-related conditions that lead to blinding or bridging of hot-gas particle filters in pressurized fluidized bed combustion systems. Several mechanisms contribute to the stickiness of dust particles within a filter cake: electrostatic and van der Waals attractions, and mechanical, liquid and solid bridging. The magnitudes of these mechanism impacts depend on the size and composition distributions of the dust particles, cake porosity, gas composition and system temperature. High-temperature tensile strength measurements of filter dust cakes have shown that only a small amount of liquid is necessary to double the tensile strength of a cake. The amount of strength increase is related more to the wettability of the dust than to the liquid's viscosity or air-liquid surface tension. Also, if the tensile strength of a filter cake is less than approximately 50 N/m(2), the cake re-entrains after being pulsed off and can lead to blinding of the filters. If the cake strength is over approximately 300 N/m(2), it can bridge between filters, in some cases forcing them apart and causing them to break. However, the factors affecting cake strength are not independent variables and laboratory measurements have shown that the tensile strength of filter dust does not adequately explain its propensity to bridge across filters in a hot-gas filter system. A better measurement is the tensile strength divided by the density of the cake, or its specific strength. The authors have defined the cake-specific strength as its critical thickness index (CTI) because it indicates the maximum thickness for which a cake would build before failing or shedding under its own weight. Laboratory measurements show that the CTI is a better indicator of the observed propensity of a particular dust to form bridges between filters than its simple tensile strength.

AB  - This paper reviews the expectations for forestry's contribution to rural development - and for its special contributions to the most disadvantaged, to women and the landless users of the forest commons. A growing literature challenges some of these expectations; in particular, certain expectations about cultural differences and physical stocks as explanatory factors for patterns of household behavior. This literature could also be used to support a call for sharper definitions of deforestation, improved indicators of the effects of forest resources on the rural poor, and improved design of forest policy interventions. Our paper reviews the literature, suggests some unifying themes, and identifies the critical issues that remain unanswered.
   The primary contention arising from this literature is that households follow systematic patterns of economic behavior in their consumption and production of forest resources, and that policy interventions in social forestry should be analyzed with regard to markets, policies, and institutions. Markets for forest resources generally exist in some form - although they may be thin. Successful forestry projects and policies require careful identification of the target populations and careful estimation of market and market-related effects on the household behavior of these populations. Institutional structures that assure secure rights for scarce forest resources are uniquely important in a forest environment often characterized by open access resources and weak government administration. Social and community forestry, improved stoves, improved strains of multi-purpose trees, and even private commercial forest operations can all improve local welfare, but only where scarcity is correctly identified and the appropriate institutions are in place. An increasing number of observations of afforestation from developing countries around the world is evidence that forestry activities do satisfy these conditions in selective important cases. The critical point for policy is to identify the characteristics of these successful cases that are predictive of other cases where new forestry activities can be welfare enhancing.

AB  - Management problems arise in semiarid rangeland that are characterized by marked wet and dry seasons because or forage deficiencies in the dry season. These natural vegetation rangelands can sustain livestock all year long when forage and senesced grass are available into the dry season. Seasonal range condition data are required to provide a basis for pasture management to help locate dry season cover and thereby minimize overstocking and degradation. The generation of seasonal data using Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery was undertaken to assess changes in natural vegetation cover in the southern Botswana Kalahari. Visual analysis of spectral reflectance curves, the development of spectral separability indexes, and conventional classification analysis techniques were used to identify and differentiate rangeland features. Results from reflectance curves indicated that most rangeland cover types could be preferentially distinguished using mainly wet season data, especially on the longer TM wavebands, and that range feature differentiation was more problematic on darker soils than on lighter soils. Spectral separability indexes (SSIs) confirmed that range feature separation varied considerably as a function of waveband and was more effective in the wet than the dry season. The SSIs also showed that range feature differentiation in both seasons was most effective using a combination of the chlorophyll absorbance band (TM3) and two mid-infrared bands (TM5 and TM7). Wet season data were more effectively classified in terms of range features than dry season data although some class similarity was inferred across the two classified data sets. The work shows that overall trends may be generated by comparing seasonal data sets, thereby providing an overall basis for dry season decision making. However, particular problems arise within the dry season data sets probably because of spectral similarities between shadow and darkened vegetation cover, thereby implying that further work is needed.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that there exists a direct relationship between environmental pollutants (PM2.5, smog), the respiratory system, and the morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular diseases. However, the mechanism and principle of how these harmful substances are deposited in lung tissues and impair lung function remain unclear. It is important to gain improved understanding of the interaction between environmental pollutants and human lungs. Owing to the complexity of air pollution and toxicological risks, it is difficult to predict and evaluate the response of human lungs toward the damage caused by air pollution. Although animal models can be used as a basis for toxicological classification, the toxic effect on the human body could be very different from that on animals owing to the distinctive features of different species. This article provides a comprehensive review of in vitro lung-on-a-chip technologies and their application in the toxicological assessment of environmental pollutants. A lung-on-a-chip uses a bionic structure mimicking the physiological characteristic of lungs, features of a real airway, and condition of the physiological airflow. Accordingly, it can be used to reveal the intrinsic interaction between lung tissues and particulate matter and provide new insights into the effect of the toxicology of environmental particles on lungs. In addition, the development of novel and optimized lung-on-a-chip devices and their application devices in the health assessment of air pollution are expected to overcome the limitations of the current in vitro toxicological tests. They are also anticipated to provide effective and accurate methods for drug screening and toxicity testing. Finally, the application potential of in vitro lung-on-a-chip models is emphasized in this review. (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background Domestic pigs have an evolutionary conserved exploratory behaviour. To comply with this requirement, the European Union aims at setting standards for appropriate enrichment materials for pigs (Council Directive 2008/120/EC). As recommended characteristics include 'chewable' and 'edible', pigs might also consume these materials (Commission Recommendation (EU) 2016/336), which are often additionally advertised to enhance lying comfort and hygienic conditions in stables. To date, a wide range of bedding, enrichment and disinfectant materials is available on the market to ensure environmental enrichment, a dry, hygienic environment or lying comfort. Previous studies revealed considerable amounts of undesirable substances in some of these materials possibly being a risk for food safety considering oral uptake by the animal. To determine interest and indicators for consumption of different types of materials by pigs during exploratory behaviour, a camera-assisted observational study with 12 female pigs (German Landrace) was conducted. We tested their preference for a disinfectant powder, peat, biochar and straw as reference material in a 4 x 6 factorial arrangement. Results Pigs manipulated and consumed all offered materials. However, longest manipulation time per pig was observed for biochar (63 min/day) and peat (50 min/day) (p < 0.05). Analyses of the bulk molecular-chemical composition and n-alkanes and acid insoluble ash as markers in the materials and in faeces clearly revealed the consumption of these materials by pigs. Conclusions Whether the consumption of considerable amounts together with certain levels of undesirable substances represents a risk for pig and consumer health could yet not be established. Future studies will address the quantitative contribution of undesirable substances by oral ingestion of bedding and enrichment materials and disinfectant powders to the daily feed ration.

AB  - About 50% of all hydropower plants (HPPs) worldwide were originally commissioned more than 40 years ago, so that the advanced age of the fleet is a major concern across all continents, and especially in Europe. The modernization of HPPs can generate several benefits in terms of generation, flexibility, safety, operation, and may have neutral or even positive implications for the environment. In this work, we appraise several options for the modernization of existing plants, with the exclusion of measures expected to increase the hydro morphological pressure on water bodies (e.g. increase of withdrawals or new parallel waterways): dam heightening, head loss reduction in waterways, increase of weighted efficiency of electro-mechanical equipment, digitalization and inflow forecast, and floating photovoltaic (evaporation reduction). We provide an indicative estimation of the additional power and annual generation that could be obtained compared to the current condition. We estimate that the overall energy generation could be increased by 8.4% for European Union and 9.4% for the whole Europe by implementing the above-mentioned strategies. The additional energy gain achievable by increasing the inflow was discussed but not included in the above mentioned overall indicator, because it is very site-specific. The additional energy storage achievable by reservoir interconnection and coordinated operation has been estimated in literature as 169 TWh. This suggests that the modernization of HPPs can generate significant benefits in terms of energy, and should be considered as an important element of energy policy, also considering the additional benefits in terms of reliability and flexibility of the energy system that it may deliver. The modernization options considered here, insofar as not entailing a worsening of the hydro morphological alterations, are also expected to cause limited or no conflict with the environmental objectives of water policies in Europe.

AB  - The objective of this work is to determine mepivacaine hydrochloride (MPVHC) as local anesthetic drug. Modified carbon paste ion-selective electrode was used for the determination of MPVHC in different dosage forms and biological fluids. The study depends on potentiometric titration of MPVHC drug using modified carbon paste (MCPE) as end point indicator electrode. The effects of the paste composition, different conditioning parameters and foreign ions on the electrode performance were investigated and response time of the electrode has been studied. The results obtained showed that carbon paste electrode modified with sodium tetraphenyl borate-MPV ion pair gives the highest potential break at the end point, Nernstian slope, wide concentration range and lower detection limit than the reinckate-, phosphotungestic-and phosphomolybdic-MPV ion pairs. The fabricated electrode obtained Nernstian response of 57.71 +/- 0.67 mV decade(-1) in the concentration range of 3.1x10(-7) - 1.0x10(-1) mol L-1 for MCPE electrode. The electrode was found to be operating within the pH range of 3.0-8.0 and exhibited a fast response time (about 14 s), low detection limit of 3.1x10(-7) mol L-1 and long lifetime (98 days). The electrode showed high selectivity to the MPVHC drug in the presence of different organic, inorganic and amino acids. The electrode was successfully applied for the determination of MPVHC in pharmaceutical preparations and biological fluids (urine and plasma) with high percent recovery and low standard and relative standard deviation values. The results obtained applying this potentiometric electrode are comparable with British pharmacopeia. The method validation parameters were optimized and the method can be applied for routine analysis of MPVHC drug.

AB  - Microbial metabolism drives changes in the physicochemical properties and, consequently, the sensory characteristics of fermented cocoa beans. In this context, information regarding the structure, function, and metabolic potential of microbial communities' present during cocoa pulp-bean mass fermentation is limited, especially concerning the formation of aromatic compounds. To bridge the gap, the metagenome of fermented cocoa pulp-bean mass (Criollo and Forastero) has been investigated using shotgun metagenomics coupled with physicochemical, microbiological, quality, and sensory analyses to explore the impact of microbial communities on the quality of fermented cocoa pulpbean mass on one farm in one season and in one region under the same environmental conditions. Our findings showed that the metagenomic diversity in cocoa, the fermentation length, and the diversity and function of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) greatly influence the resulting distinctive flavors. From the metabolic perspective, multiple indicators suggest that the heterolactic metabolism was more dominant in Criollo fermentations. KEGG genes were linked with the biosynthesis of acetic acid, ethanol, lactic acid, acetoin, and phenylacetaldehyde during Criollo and Forastero fermentations. MAGs belonging to Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Limosilactobacillus reuteri, and Acetobacter pas-teurianus were the most prevalent. Fermentation time and roasting are the most important determinants of cocoa quality, while the difference between the two varieties are relatively minor. The assessment of microbiological and chemical analysis is urgently needed for developing fermentation protocols according to regions, countries, and cocoa varieties to guarantee safety and desirable flavor development.
   IMPORTANCE Monitoring the composition, structure, functionalities, and metabolic potential encoded at the level of DNA of fermented cocoa pulp-bean mass metage-nome is of great importance for food safety and quality implications.

AB  - Erosion is one of the predominant hazards in coastal Bangladesh. For implementing effective adaptation and mitigation strategies, assessment of risk to coastal erosion is crucial. This study aimed to assess the levels of risk to coastal erosion in the Meghna estuary, a major erosion-prone area in the coastal region of the country impacted by abrupt changes in hydrological and geomorphological conditions. Using physical, environmental, and socio-economic geospatial data, this is the first attempt in assessing erosion risk and characterizing three main risk components: hazard, vulnerability, and exposure at a regional extent in the estuary. A total of 19 indicators were considered, and statistical methods assisted with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) were used for the construction of hazard, vulnerability, and exposure indices, which were then integrated to calculate erosion risk comprehensively at the lowermost administrative unit (union) level throughout the study area. The results of hazard and vulnerability analyses depicted 35.72% and 46.69% areas as highly hazard-prone and highly vulnerable to erosion, respectively. Assessment of the exposure index exhibited 42.25% area as highly exposed to coastal erosion in the estuary. Finally, the results quantified different levels of risk as very high (14.91%), high (19.36%), moderate (23.40%), low (23.91%), and very low (18.41%). Among 161 coastal unions, 45 unions were identified as high to very high erosion risk-prone areas, located in the coasts of Bhola, Noakhali, and Barishal districts including their major islands. The validation result confirmed a reasonable level of acceptance of the calculated risk map, despite several data limitations. The geospatial distribution of different risk categories presented in this paper can assist relevant authorities with reliable spatial information in formulating improved erosion risk mitigation policies in the most dynamic estuary of the country.

AB  - In Operational Modal Analysis, the modal parameters, i.e. natural frequencies, damping ratios and mode shapes, are estimated from vibration measurements, where they are related to the eigenstructure of a linear system [1]. Only the measured output data are required, such as accelerations, displacements, velocities or strains, that are recorded on the structure during unknown, unmeasured, ambient excitation conditions. The resulting modal parameter estimates are never equal to the exact parameters of the structure, since they are computed from data of finite length that is moreover afflicted with measurement noise. They are hence impaired with statistical uncertainties. These uncertainties can be quantified or accounted for, which is often crucial in practice when interpreting the outcome from the related system identification algorithms. In this context, explicit expressions for the variance computation of the modal parameter estimates have been developed
   The Modal Phase Collinearity (MPC) is a modal indicator designed to decide whether the mode shape used in its computation is a real or complex-valued vector. Its estimate inherits the statistical properties of the corresponding mode shape estimate. While the statistical framework for the uncertainty quantification of modal parameters is well-known and developed in the context of subspace-based system identification methods, uncertainty quantification for the MPC estimate has not been carried out yet. In this paper, the uncertainty quantification of the MPC estimates is developed when the corresponding mode shapes are complex-valued vectors. In this case, the theoretical value of the MPC is strictly lower than 1 and it is shown that the distribution of the MPC estimate can be approximated as Gaussian. The computation of its variance and the resulting confidence intervals of the MPC estimate are developed. The proposed framework is validated in Monte Carlo simulations and illustrated on experimental data of an offshore structure.

AB  - Land issues have always been acute. States around the world have been gradually reforming the land sector. At the present stage, European countries are actively contributing to the development of the land market. The purpose of the scientific article: to determine the legal and economic aspects of the land market in European countries of the functioning of the land market in European countries, study of the impact of the land market on the economic stability of European countries, identify the factors influencing the development of the land market in Europe. To achieve the purpose outlined, were used the following methods: statistical analysis and comparison, historical retrospective, element-theoretical method, analysis, generalization and analogy. It has been established that there are four types of land market in European countries. In the countries of European Union two types of land market dominate, namely: a fully open market and an open market for foreigners. The closed market for foreigners operates only in Croatia. A comprehensive analysis of economic aspects of the land market, reflected in the share of gross profit of the agro-industrial complex in GDP, agricultural land prices and other indicators, proves the causal link between them, the type of land market, investment and economic development in general. The factors influencing the formation of the land market have been revealed, namely: historical, mentality and established traditions of the people, economic development of the country, the share of the agricultural complex in the state's activities, and the functional purpose of the land. The main ways to improve the regulation of the land market have been proposed, namely: attracting investors, improving infrastructure, creating favorable conditions for the development of national farming, introducing innovative technologies for land cultivation, preserving the environment, fighting corruption, removing shadow business, informatization of the land market.

AB  - Water erosion on arable land can reduce soil fertility and agricultural productivity. Despite the impact of water erosion on crops, it is typically neglected in global crop yield projections. Furthermore, previous efforts to quantify global water erosion have paid little attention to the effects of field management on the magnitude of water erosion. In this study, we analyse the robustness of simulated water erosion estimates in maize and wheat fields between the years 1980 and 2010 based on daily model outputs from a global gridded version of the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) crop model. By using the MUSS water erosion equation and country-specific and environmental indicators determining different intensities in tillage, residue handling and cover crops, we obtained the global median water erosion rates of 7 t ha(-1) a(-1) in maize fields and 5 t ha(-1) a(-1) in wheat fields. A comparison of our simulation results with field data demonstrates an overlap of simulated and measured water erosion values for the majority of global cropland. Slope inclination and daily precipitation are key factors in determining the agreement between simulated and measured erosion values and are the most critical input parameters controlling all water erosion equations included in EPIC. The many differences between field management methods worldwide, the varying water erosion estimates from different equations and the complex distribution of cropland in mountainous regions add uncertainty to the simulation results. To reduce the uncertainties in global water erosion estimates, it is necessary to gather more data on global farming techniques to reduce the uncertainty in global land-use maps and to collect more data on soil erosion rates representing the diversity of environmental conditions where crops are grown.

AB  - Biomass has been considered a potential source of value-added products and energy vectors. Most biomass studies have researched the best pathways or processes to upgrade this renewable raw material through stand-alone processes or biorefineries. The biomass supply chain is a crucial aspect in the economic analysis of biomass upgrading since most of the raw materials need to be transported. A supply chain analysis gives an idea about the availability, real costs, and storage conditions of the raw material to guarantee an accurate feasibility analysis and a standardized production process. Calendula (Calendula Officinalis) is an aromatic plant used to produce valuable extracts in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. Nevertheless, high amounts of exhausted biomass (more than 95% w/w) are produced and wasted. These residues represent an environmental issue to be solved through the implementation of valorizing options. This paper analyses the supply chain and environmental impact of essential oil production using Calendula (Calendula Officinalis) as a raw material in the Colombian context. The case study comprises a single-objective optimization of the calendula supply chain to produce essential oil and the life cycle assessment (LCA) of the process through a cradle-to-gate approach in the Colombian context. The results showed the best locations to upgrade Calendula in Colombia (i.e., Manizales and Bucaramanga), supplying 1.1 % of the total product demand. The optimal product flow to customers was 0.32 tons/year, and the required feedstock from suppliers was 162 tons/year. The agricultural stage of essential oil production represented the highest environmental impact of the supply chain. In particular, plastic sheets, organic fertilizers, and chemical fungicides were the main contributors to this impact.

AB  - Lichens dominate a significant part of the Earth's land surface, and are valuable bioindicators of various environmental changes. In the northern hemisphere, the largest lichen biomass is in the woodlands and heathlands of the boreal zone and in tundra. Despite the global coverage of lichens, there has been only limited research on their spectral properties in the context of remote sensing of the environment. In this paper, we report spectral properties of 12 common boreal lichen species. Measurements of reflectance spectra were made in laboratory conditions with a standard spectrometer (350-2500 nm) and a novel mobile hyperspectral camera (400-1000 nm) which was used in a multiangular setting. Our results show that interspecific differences in reflectance spectra were the most pronounced in the ultraviolet and visible spectral range, and that dry samples always had higher reflectance than fresh (moist) samples in the shortwave infrared region. All study species had higher reflectance in the backward scattering direction compared to nadir or forward scattering directions. Our results also reveal, for the first time, that there is large intraspecific variation in reflectance of lichen species. This emphasizes the importance of measuring several replicates of each species when analyzing lichen spectra. In addition, we used the data in a spectral clustering analysis to study the spectral similarity between samples and species, and how these similarities could be linked to different physical traits or phylogenetic closeness of the species. Overall, our results suggest that spectra of some lichen species with large ground coverage can be used for species identification from high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery. On the other hand, for lichen species growing as small assemblages, mobile hyperspectral cameras may offer a solution for in-situ species identification. The spectral library collected in this study is available in the SPECCHIO Spectral Information System.

AB  - Recent advances in imaging technology and fluorescent probes have made it possible to gain information about the dynamics of subcellular processes at unprecedented spatiotemporal scales. Unfortunately, a lack of automated tools to efficiently process the resulting imaging data encoding fine details of the biological processes remains a major bottleneck in utilizing the full potential of these powerful experimental techniques. Here we present a computational tool, called PunctaSpecks, that can characterize fluorescence signals arising from a wide range of biological molecules under normal and pathological conditions. Among other things, the program can calculate the number, areas, life-times, and amplitudes of fluorescence signals arising from multiple sources, track diffusing fluorescence sources like moving mitochondria, and determine the overlap probability of two processes or organelles imaged using indicator dyes of different colors. We have tested PunctaSpecks on synthetic time-lapse movies containing mobile fluorescence objects of various sizes, mimicking the activity of biomolecules. The robustness of the software is tested by varying the level of noise along with random but known pattern of appearing, disappearing, and movement of these objects. Next, we use PunctaSpecks to characterize protein-protein interaction involved in store-operated Ca2+ entry through the formation and activation of plasma membrane-bound ORAI1 channel and endoplasmic reticulum membrane-bound stromal interaction molecule (STIM), the evolution of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-induced Ca2+ signals from sub-micrometer size local events into global waves in human cortical neurons, and the activity of Alzheimer's disease-associated beta amyloid pores in the plasma membrane. The tool can also be used to study other dynamical processes imaged through fluorescence molecules. The open source algorithm allows for extending the program to analyze more than two types of biomolecules visualized using markers of different colors.

AB  - Wood supply chain performance suffers from risks intensified by more frequent and extreme natural calamities such as windstorms, bark beetle infestations, and ice-break treetops. In order to limit further damage and wood value loss after natural calamities, high volumes of salvage wood have to be rapidly transported out of the forest. In these cases, robust decision support and coordinated management strategies based on advanced contingency planning are needed. Consequently, this study introduces a contingency planning toolbox consisting of a discrete event simulation model setup for analyses on an operational level, strategies to cope with challenging business cases, as well as transport templates to analyze outcomes of decisions before real, costly, and long-lasting changes are made. The toolbox enables wood supply managers to develop contingency plans to prepare for increasing risk events and more frequent natural disturbances due to climate change. Crucial key performance indicators including truck to wagon ratios, truck and wagon utilization, worktime coordination, truck queuing times, terminal transhipment volume, and required stockyard are presented for varying delivery time, transport tonnage, and train pick-up scenarios. The strategy BEST FIT was proven to provide robust solutions which saves truck and train resources, as well as keeps transhipment volume on a high level and stockyard and queuing time on a low level. Permission granted for increased truck transport tonnages was evaluated as a potential means to reduce truck trips, if working times and train pick-ups are coordinated. Furthermore, the practical applicability for contingency planning is demonstrated by highly relevant business cases such as limited wagon or truck availability, defined delivery quota, terminal selection, queuing time reduction, or scheduled stock accumulation. Further research should focus on the modeling and management of log quality deterioration and the resulting wood value loss caused by challenging transport and storage conditions.

AB  - Despite the spatial and social restrictions it causes, single stall housing still prevails in sport and riding school horses, leading to the emergence of abnormal behaviours such as stereotypic or abnormal repetitive behaviours (SB/ARB). In the present study, we investigated the impact of the type (visual/tactile) and amount of social information that could be exchanged (i.e. distance between the individuals) on the expression of welfare indicators, including, but not limited to, STB. Additional observations were made on the production of snorts, recently described as a potential indicator of positive emotions, according to the type of stall horses were housed in. Two complementary studies were performed. One observational study on 32 sport horses, all living in the same place, being of the same breed and sex, whose aim was to compare the behaviours of horses maintained for a long time in two types of stalls differing mostly in the possibilities of contact with close neighbours versus looking outdoors. The second, experimental study, consisted in moving purebred Arab broodmares from one condition to another randomly every day for 66 days, the two types of stalls differing only by the possibility or not to put the head outside above the open top half door. The results show clear statistical relations between stall architecture and horses' behaviour, especially STB, their prevalence and type differing according to the type of stall in both studies. Overall, the access to outdoor visibility and its degree (possibility to put the head out or not) had a major effect on the horses' behaviours, which was the same in both studies, despite the differences between populations in terms of breed, sex and type of work. The experimental study also reveals that changes in behaviours can be rapid after a change of housing.

AB  - Objectives To measure levels of occupational stress, burn-out, work-life balance, presenteeism, work ability (balance between work and personal resources) and desire to practise in trainee and consultant hospital doctors in Ireland.
   Design National cross-sectional study of randomised sample of hospital doctors. Participants provided sociodemographic data (age, sex), work grade (consultant, higher/basic specialist trainee), specialty, work hours and completed workplace well-being questionnaires (Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) Scale, overcommitment, Maslach Burnout Inventory) and single item measures of work ability, presenteeism, work-life balance and desire to practise.
   Setting Irish publicly funded hospitals and residential institutions.
   Participants 1749 doctors (response rate of 55%). All hospital specialties were represented except radiology.
   Results 29% of respondents had insufficient work ability and there was no sex, age or grade difference. 70.6% reported strong or very strong desire to practise medicine, 22% reported good work-life balance, 82% experienced workplace stress, with effort greatly exceeding reward, exacerbated by overcommitment. Burn-out was evident in 29.7% and was significantly associated with male sex, younger age, lower years of practice, lower desire to practise, lower work ability, higher ERI ratio and greater overcommitment. Apart from the measures of work ability and overcommitment, there was no sex or age difference across any variable. However, ERI and burn-out were significantly lower in consultants than trainees.
   Conclusions Hospital doctors across all grades in Ireland had insufficient work ability, low levels of work-life balance, high levels of work stress and almost onethird experienced burn-out indicating suboptimal work conditions and environment. Yet, most had high desire to practise medicine. Measurement of these indices should become a quality indicator for hospitals and research should focus on the efficacy of a range of individual and organisational interventions for burn-out and occupational stress.

AB  - Yellow meadow ant (Lasius flavus) mound building activity alters the physico-chemical properties of grassland soils. In this study, L. flavus mediated changes were assessed along vegetation and soil type differences within four plots located on two study sites. Fine soil, cold- (readily soluble) and hot-water extractable (labile) organic matter (OM) and nutrient fractions of four L. flavus mounds (0-5 cm and 5-10 cm sampling depth) and four control locations (0-5 cm sampling depth) each, were quantified. All three fractions were further assessed in the horizons of each soil type and complemented by measures of aboveground biomass and vegetation indices related to plant species and composition (Ellenberg indicator values, Shannon-Diversity and Evenness).
   The surface area covered by L. flavus mounds and mound density exhibited site and plot related differences, attributed to differences in the soil moisture and -fertility regime, as well as to aboveground biomass. The mound building activity led to a depletion of fine soil, readily soluble and labile OM and sulfur stocks, while mineral-derived fine soil nutrient stocks (calcium (Ca), magnesium, potassium, iron and phosphorous) were higher in the mounds. Effects of L. flavus activity were most pronounced in a Haplic Stagnosol and an Umbric Leptosol (calcaric), possibly due to stronger contrasts between topsoil and subsoil OM, as well as lower Ca stocks in comparison to the other soils (Stagnic Luvisol and Stagnic Leptosol).
   This interplay of nutrient depletion and enrichment introduced through the bioturbation by L. flavus, may create a topsoil providing suitable habitat conditions for the establishment of plant species adapted to poor organic nutrient availability. Thus, promoting and preserving L. flavus mounds may be an important tool to establish resource heterogeneity and hence floral diversity in Central European grasslands.

   Gallstone disease is a common surgical entity worldwide and accounts for a major portion of hospital admissions and surgeries. Metabolic syndrome is diagnosed when three of the following medical conditions are positive: central obesity, high blood pressure, increased fasting glucose levels, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels and high serum triglycerides.
   Objective
   To compare the frequency of metabolic syndrome in patients with uncomplicated gallstone disease and complicated gallstone disease.
   Study design
   Observational, cross-sectional study.
   Methodology
   A total of 104 patients, above age 18 years, visiting the outpatient department (OPD) or the emergency department, diagnosed as having gallstone disease. The study was conducted in surgical unit VI, civil hospital Karachi from June 2014 to June 2015. Patients' demographics, abdominal waist circumference, blood pressure, serum fasting blood sugar, triglyceride level and HDL levels were recorded. Final outcome was labeled as presence or absence of metabolic syndrome. Presence of metabolic syndrome was compared in patients with complicated gallstone disease as well as in patients with uncomplicated gallstone disease. Chi square test was used to detect statistical significance and a p-value of <0.05 was taken as significant.
   Results
   The ages were comparable between the two groups, that is, the complicated and uncomplicated gallstone disease at 42.42 +/- 12.15 years in the former and 39.24 +/- 10.41 years in the latter group. Metabolic syndrome was more predominant in the complicated arm 40.38% when compared to uncomplicated arm 25% but it was not significant statistically with a p-value of 0.2.
   Conclusion
   Metabolic syndrome is associated with complicated gallstone disease though this study failed to reach statistical significance due to small sample size, it re-enforces the findings of previous studies. It is an easily assessable and useful measure to predict complications associated with gall stone disease.

AB  - Background
   Accountability for ensuring sexual and reproductive health and rights is increasingly receiving global attention. Less attention has been paid to accountability mechanisms for sexual and reproductive health and rights at national and sub-national level, the focus of this systematic review.
   Methods
   We searched for peer-reviewed literature using accountability, sexual and reproductive health, human rights and accountability instrument search terms across three electronic databases, covering public health, social sciences and legal studies. The search yielded 1906 articles, 40 of which met the inclusion and exclusion criteria (articles on low and middle -income countries in English, Spanish, French and Portuguese published from 1994 and October 2016) defined by a peer reviewed protocol.
   Results
   Studies were analyzed thematically and through frequencies where appropriate. They were drawn from 41 low-and middle-income countries, with just over half of the publications from the public health literature, 13 from legal studies and the remaining six from social science literature. Accountability was discussed in five health areas: maternal, neonatal and child health services, HIV services, gender-based violence, lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender access and access to reproductive health care in general. We identified three main groupings of accountability strategies: performance, social and legal accountability.
   Conclusion
   The review identified an increasing trend in the publication of accountability initiatives in Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR). The review points towards a complex 'accountability ecosystem' with multiple actors with a range of roles, responsibilities and interactions across levels from the transnational to the local. These accountability strategies are not mutually exclusive, but they do change the terms of engagement between the actors involved. The publications provide little insight on the connections between these accountability strategies and on the contextual conditions for the successful implementation of the accountability interventions. Obtaining a more nuanced understanding of various underpinnings of a successful approach to accountability at national and sub national levels is essential.

AB  - The use of biomarkers constitutes an essential tool to assess the bioavailability of carotenoids in humans. The present article aims to review several methodological, host-related and modulating factors relevant on assessing and interpreting carotenoid bioavailability. Markers for carotenoid bioavailability can be broadly divided into direct, biochemical or "analytical" markers and indirect, physiological or "functional" indicators. Analytical markers usually refer to biochemical indicators of intake and/or status (short and long term exposure) while functional measures may be interpreted in terms of cumulative exposure, biological effect (bioactivity) or modification of risk factors. Both types of markers display advantages and limitations but, in general, a relationship exists among the type of marker, the biological specimen needed and the time required for a change. Humans may absorb a wide range of carotenes and xanthophylls and many of them may be found in serum and tissues. However, under physiological conditions, the several classes of dietary carotenoids may behave unequally leading to a different systemic profile and, moreover, they can be selectively accumulated at target tissues. In addition, some carotenoids may be chemically and enzymatically modified generating different oxidative metabolites and apocarotenoids. Quantitatively, the biological response upon carotenoid intervention (assessed by analytical and functional markers) is highly variable but the use of large doses and long-term protocols may lead to saturation effects and the loss of linearity in the response. Also, despite carotenoid exposition is considered to be safe, markers of overexposure include clinical signs (i.e. carotenodermia, corneal rings and retinopathy) and biochemical indicators (hypercarotenemia, xanthophyll esters). Overall, both host-related and methodological factors may influence analytical and functional markers to assess carotenoid bioavailability although the different subclasses of carotenoids may not be equally affected.

AB  - AimLocal extinction after habitat modifications is often delayed, leading to an extinction debt. Our first aim was to develop a conceptual model for natural and human-mediated habitat improvements after a disturbance that may waive part of the predicted extinction debt. Second, we wanted to test this model on the distribution of epiphytic plants on trees that had been isolated in the agricultural matrix after forest clearing, around which coffee subsequently had been planted with a possible improvement of the microclimate.
   LocationBonga, Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region (SNNPR), Ethiopia.
   MethodsWe studied 50 trees that had been isolated for periods ranging from a few years to half a century after clearing. The trees were now located in the agricultural landscape at different distances from intact Afromontane forests. Fourteen trees in the forests were used as references. Each tree was inventoried for all vascular epiphytic plants, mosses and liverworts.
   ResultsTime since clearance had a direct negative effect on number of forest specialist species via delayed extinctions and the detected large extinction debt of both bryophytes and vascular plants continued to be paid over several decades. However, time since clearance had an indirect positive effect on number of forest indicator species via the reappearance of shade from coffee planted surrounding the trees, even if the waiving effect on the extinction debt was rather small. Additionally, trees at further distances from the forest edge had fewer forest-associated species.
   Main conclusionsOur results show that the ability of agroecological landscapes to foster forest biodiversity may be overestimated if meta-community processes over time and space are not taken into account. However, the possibility of initiating counteracting processes that modify the level of expected local extinctions should be evaluated more often to find ways of improving conditions for biodiversity in human-modified landscapes.

AB  - Background: As many as half of all patients with major traumatic injuries do not receive the recommended care, with variance in preventable mortality reported across the globe. This variance highlights the need for a comprehensive process for monitoring and reviewing patient care, central to which is a consistent peer-review process that includes trauma system safety and human factors. There is no published, evidence-informed standardised tool that considers these factors for use in adult or paediatric trauma case peer-review. The aim of this research was to develop and validate a trauma case review tool to facilitate clinical review of paediatric trauma patient care in extracting information to facilitate monitoring, inform change and enable loop closure.
   Methods: Development of the trauma case review tool was multi-faceted, beginning with a review of the trauma audit tool literature. Data were extracted from the literature to inform iterative tool development using a consensus approach. Inter-rater agreement was assessed for both the pilot and finalised versions of the tool.
   Results: The final trauma case review tool contained ten sections, including patient factors (such as pre-existing conditions), presenting problem, a timeline of events, factors contributing to the care delivery problem (including equipment, work environment, staff action, organizational factors), positive aspects of care and the outcome of panel discussion. After refinement, the inter-rater reliability of the human factors and outcome components of the tool improved with an average 86% agreement between raters.
   Discussion: This research developed an evidence-informed tool for use in paediatric trauma case review that considers both system safety and human factors to facilitate clinical review of trauma patient care.
   Conclusions: This tool can be used to identify opportunities for improvement in trauma care and guide quality assurance activities. Validation is required in the adult population.

AB  - Seed germination is the key step for successful establishment, growth and further expansion of population especially for alien plants with annual life cycle. Traits like better adaptability and germination response were thought to be associated with plant invasion. However, there are not enough empirical studies correlating adaptation to environmental factors with germination response of alien invasive plants. In this study, we conducted congeneric comparisons of germination response to different environmental factors such as light, pH, NaCl, osmotic and soil burials among four alien amaranths that differ in invasiveness and have sympatric distribution in Jiangsu Province, China. The data were used to create three-parameter sigmoid and exponential decay models, which were fitted to cumulative germination and emergence curves. The results showed higher maximum Germination (G(max)), shorter time for 50% germination (G(50)) and the rapid slope (G(rate)) for Amaranthus blitum (low-invasive) and A. retroflexus (high-invasive) compare to intermediately invasive A. spinosus and A. viridis in all experimental regimes. It indicated that germination potential does not necessarily constitute a trait that can efficiently distinguish highly invasive and low invasive congeners in four Amaranthus species. However, it was showed that the germination performances of four amaranth species were more or less correlated with their worldwide distribution area. Therefore, the germination performance can be used as a reference indicator, but not an absolute trait for invasiveness. Our results also confirmed that superior germination performance in wide environmental conditions supplementing high seed productivity in highly invasive A. retroflexus might be one of the reasons for its prolific growth and wide distribution. These findings lay the foundation to develop more efficient weed management practice like deep burial of seeds by turning over soil and use of tillage agriculture to control these invasive weed species.

AB  - Palaeolimnological studies should ideally be based upon continuous, undisturbed sediment sequences with reliable chronologies. However for some lake cores, these conditions are not met and palaeolimnologists are often faced with dating puzzles caused by sediment disturbances in the past. This study chooses Esthwaite Water from England to illustrate how to identify sedimentation discontinuities in lake cores and how chronologies can be established for imperfect cores by correlation of key sediment signatures in parallel core records and with long-term monitoring data (1945-2003). Replicated short cores (ESTH1, ESTH7, and ESTH8) were collected and subjected to loss-on-ignition, radiometric dating (Pb-210, Cs-137, and C-14), particle size, trace metal, and fossil diatom analysis. Both a slumping and a hiatus event were detected in ESTH7 based on comparisons made between the cores and the long-term diatom data. Ordination analysis suggested that the slumped material in ESTH7 originated from sediment deposited around 1805-1880 AD. Further, it was inferred that the hiatus resulted in a loss of sediment deposited from 1870 to 1970 AD. Given the existence of three superior C-14 dates in ESTH7, ESTH1 and ESTH7 were temporally correlated by multiple palaeolimnological proxies for age-depth model development. High variability in sedimentation rates was evident, but good agreement across the various palaeolimnological proxies indicated coherence in sediment processes within the coring area. Differences in sedimentation rates most likely resulted from the natural morphology of the lake basin. Our study suggests that caution is required in selecting suitable coring sites for palaeolimnological studies of small, relatively deep lakes and that proximity to steep slopes should be avoided wherever possible. Nevertheless, in some cases, comparisons between a range of contemporary and palaeolimnological records can be employed to diagnose sediment disturbances and establish a chronology.

AB  - Diagenesis in human remains is a subject of growing interest due to the increase in bone chemical studies to reconstruct pre- and post-mortem features in archaeological and forensic sciences. The efforts made during the last decades have solidified our understanding of diagenetic processes; however, their high complexity demands more research to address them empirically, specifically considering factors such as types of soil substratum and skeletal element. In this work, a geochemical study of human remains from the archaeological site of A Lanzada (NW Spain) is performed to understand diagenesis (i.e. chemical alteration) and life environmental exposure. Three types of bone (thoracic, long and cranial) from 30 skeletons of two periods (9 Roman, 21 post-Roman) were analysed by X-ray fluorescence. Bones were recovered from burials located in slightly alkaline (Haplic Arenosol (calcaric)) and acidic (Cambic Umbrisol (humic)) soils. Principal components analysis was applied to extract the main chemical signatures, and analysis of variance to determine the influence of different factors.
   Bone composition was characterized by four chemical signals related to: i) alteration of bone bioapatite; ii) metal sorption from the soil solution; iii) presence of fine (silt-clay) soil particles; and iv) lead incorporation. Thoracic bones were found to be more sensitive to diagenesis and the burial environment; long bones and crania presented a similar response. Skeletons buried in the acidic soil were significantly poorly preserved. Lead content was higher in bones of the Roman period, which seems to be related to pre-mortem conditions.

AB  - Surface ozone is an environmental issue occurring at several scales, ranging from local to continental. One of the most developed regions in China, the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), experiences severe tropospheric ozone problem. Hence, quantifying the contributions from various geographical source regions is helpful for better understanding the regional ozone problem. Ozone source apportionment studies can provide relevant information for designing suitable air pollution protection strategies. In the present work, the WRF-Chem model coupled with an online ozone tagging method is applied to a case study, with the objective of exploring the ozone contributions to the surface ozone from different source regions over the YRD region, during a frequent wind-shifting period. Our results show that the YRD was highly affected by the upwind source regions bearing high values both ozone and its precursors. The contribution from the source region outside the main air pollution zones in the Central Eastern China (super regional contribution) was also important, accounting for more than 30 ppb of daytime maximum mean ozone concentrations. Ozone arising from increased local and regional emissions during high-concentration events was more significant than super regional contribution. It reveals that the ozone from Anhui region was transported through vertical mixing and horizontal advection to receptor areas in the YRD during the study time focus. Chemical process contributed significantly at ground and high altitude levels of 500 and 1000 m. However, most of the ozone from the remote regions of Henan and Hubei provinces was transported to the receptor of Nanjing through physical processes. The vertical mixing process played a crucial positive role at super regional scales, with regard to the formation of surface ozone over the YRD region during the addressed time interval.

AB  - Aim The aims of this study were (1) to assess the spatial distribution of orchid species richness in New Guinea, and (2) to examine patterns of species turnover in the orchid community through phytogeographical regionalization. We aimed to achieve these goals using botanical collection records, species distribution models (SDMs) and partitioning around medoids (PAM) clustering.
   Location New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago and surrounding islands.
   Methods We combined 6760 collection records of 532 orchid species with 16 uncorrelated environmental predictor variables, to model species distributions at 5 arc-min resolution, using the presence-only modelling algorithm, Maxent. All SDMs were tested for significant deviation from random expectation using bias-corrected null models. The results from significant SDMs were stacked to create a map of orchid species richness. The same significant SDMs were used to derive phytogeographical regions through a PAM cluster analysis.
   Results Of the 532 modelled species distributions, 283 showed significantly stronger correlation with environmental conditions than expected by chance alone. It is inferred that the central mountain ranges of eastern New Guinea, including part of the Papuan Peninsula, harbour the highest levels of orchid species richness. The study area was divided into eight phytogeographical regions that maximized internal community similarity among orchids. Two of these regions are found almost exclusively in western New Guinea, while the remainder are more evenly distributed.
   Main conclusions Our study provides an objective assessment of the distribution of relative orchid species richness in New Guinea. The eight derived phytogeographical regions are largely consistent with existing knowledge of the island's internal biogeography. These findings give insight into one of the global hotspots of orchid diversity, and improve our understanding of the phytogeography of New Guinea.

AB  - Microbial decay processes are one of the mechanisms whereby sewage contamination is reduced in the environment. This decomposition process involves a highly complex array of bacterial and eukaryotic communities from both sewage and ambient waters. However, relatively little is known about how these communities change due to mixing and subsequent decomposition of the sewage contaminant. We investigated decay of sewage in upper Mississippi River using Illumina sequencing of 16S and 18S rRNA gene hypervariable regions and qPCR for human-associated and general fecal Bacteroidales indicators. Mixtures of primary treated sewage and river water were placed in dialysis bags and incubated in situ under ambient conditions for seven days. We assessed changes in microbial community composition under two treatments in a replicated factorial design: sunlight exposure versus shaded and presence versus absence of native river microbiota. Initial diversity was higher in sewage compared to river water for 16S sequences, but the reverse was observed for 18S sequences. Both treatments significantly shifted community composition for eukaryotes and bacteria (P < 0.05). Data indicated that the presence of native river microbiota, rather than exposure to sunlight, accounted for the majority of variation between treatments for both 16S (R = 0.50; P > 0.001) and 18S (R = 0.91; P = 0.001) communities. A comparison of 16S sequence data and fecal indicator qPCR measurements indicated that the latter was a good predictor of overall bacterial community change over time (rho: 0.804-0.814, P = 0.001). These findings suggest that biotic interactions, such as predation by bacterivorous protozoa, can be critical factors in the decomposition of sewage in freshwater habitats and support the use of Bacteroidales genetic markers as indicators of fecal pollution.

AB  - The abundance and proportion of specific fatty acids differ among fundamental groups of lower trophic levels. Some prey fatty acids are transferred directly to predators. In this study, fatty acid compositions of juvenile, young, and adult anchovies (Engraulis japonicus) were evaluated as trophic markers for feeding environments in four regions (Tongyeong, Namhaedo, Yeosu, and Jindo) of the southern coastal waters of Korea. The condition factor (CF) increased with advancing life stage, and the gonad somatic index (GSI) peaked in May. C14:0, C16:0, C18:0, C16:1n-7, C18:1n-9, C20:1n-9, C20:5n-3, and C22:6n-3, among other saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) were predominant in all life stages. We observed geographic eastward and life-stage dependent trends wherein C14:0, C16:1n-7 C18:1n-9, and C20:5n-3 fatty acids increased, while C22:6n-3 decreased during development from juvenile to adult in most season. Indicating Calanus copepod trophic markers, MUFA 20:1n-9 and 22:1n-9, were high in the upwelling area of the southwestern sea, but low in southern coastal areas. High MUFA 18:1n-9 and SFA 16:0 in all areas suggests a significant dietary input from non-calanoid copepods in the southern coastal waters of Korea. High dependence on dinoflagellate harmful algal blooms (HABs) was detected in the ratios of major fatty acids (C20:5n-3/C22:6n-3 and C16:1n-7/C16:0) in juvenile and young fish. These results indicate that life stage- and area-specific fatty acid compositions may be explained by regional feeding environments, which influence juvenile and young fish growth and adult maturation in the southern coastal waters of Korea.

AB  - Recent shifts in water quality and food web characteristics driven by anthropogenic impacts on the Laurentian Great Lakes warranted an examination of pelagic primary producers as tracers of environmental change. The distributions of the 263 common phytoplankton taxa were related to water quality variables to determine taxon-specific responses that may be useful in indicator models. A detailed checklist of taxa and their environmental optima are provided. Multivariate analyses indicated a strong relationship between total phosphorus (TP) and patterns in the diatom assemblages across the Great Lakes. Of the 118 common diatom taxa, 90 (76%) had a directional response along the TP gradient. We further evaluated a diatom-based transfer function for TP based on the weighted-average abundance of taxa, assuming unimodal distributions along the TP gradient. The r(2) between observed and inferred TP in the training dataset was 0.79. Substantial spatial and environmental autocorrelation within the training set of samples justified the need for further model validation. A randomization procedure indicated that the actual transfer function consistently performed better than functions based on reshuffled environmental data. Further, TP was minimally confounded by other environmental variables, as indicated by the relatively large amount of unique variance in the diatoms explained by TP. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the transfer function by hindcasting TP concentrations using fossil diatom assemblages in a Lake Superior sediment core. Passive, multivariate analysis of the fossil samples against the training set indicated that phosphorus was a strong determinant of historical diatom assemblages, verifying that the transfer function was suited to reconstruct past TP in Lake Superior. Collectively, these results showed that phytoplankton coefficients for water quality can be robust indicators of Great Lakes pelagic condition. The diatom-based transfer function can be used in lake management when retrospective data are needed for tracking long-term degradation, remediation and trajectories.

AB  - Household air pollution from solid fuel combustion is the leading environmental health risk factor globally. In China, almost half of all homes use solid fuel to meet their household energy demands. Gasifier cookstoves offer a potentially affordable, efficient, and low-polluting alternative to current solid fuel combustion technology, but pollutant emissions and energy efficiency performance of this class of stoves are poorly characterized. In this study, four Chinese gasifier cookstoves were evaluated for their pollutant emissions and efficiency using the internationally recognized water boiling test (WBT), version 4.1.2. WBT performance indicators included PM2.5, CO, and CO2 emissions and overall thermal efficiency. Laboratory investigation also included evaluation of pollutant emissions (PM2.5 and CO) under stove operating conditions designed to simulate common Chinese cooking practices. High power average overall thermal efficiencies ranged from 22 to 33%. High power average PM2.5 emissions ranged from 120 to 430 mg/MJ of useful energy, and CO emissions ranged from 1 to 30 g/MJ of useful energy. Compared with several widely disseminated "improved" cookstoves selected from the literature, on average, the four Chinese gasifier cookstoves had lower PM2.5 emissions and higher CO emissions. The recent International Organization for Standardization (ISO) International Workshop Agreement on tiered cookstove ranking was developed to help classify stove performance and identify the best-performing stoves. The results from this study highlight potential ways to further improve this approach. Medium power stove operation emitted nearly twice as much PM2.5 as was emitted during high power stove operation, and the lighting phase of a cooking event contributed 45% and 34% of total PM2.5 emissions (combined lighting and cooking). Future approaches to laboratory-based testing of advanced cookstoves could improve to include greater differentiation between different modes of stove operation, beyond those evaluated with the WBT.

AB  - Attachment of enteric pathogens such as Escherichia coli O157:H7 to fresh produce is a crucial first step for contamination to occur, and irrigation water (IW) is considered a potentially important preharvest introduction route. In a natural situation, E. coli O157:H7 may be present in the irrigation water for some time and may, therefore, be starved. Most research, however, is performed with freshly cultured strains. The aim of this study was to examine the behavior of E. coli O157:H7 MB3885 under starvation stress in water used for overhead irrigation in the greenhouse and the consequence on its subsequent ability to attach to butterhead lettuce leaves. E. coli O157:H7 MB3885 was starvation stressed by introducing it at +/- 7.5 log CFU/ml into phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), sterile distilled water (SDW), or IW. The suspensions were stored at 4 or 20 degrees C and were used after 0, 2, and 6 days for an attachment assay on butterhead lettuce. E. coli O157:H7 MB3885 levels were determined by plating method and live and dead quantitative PCR technique. A decrease in plate counts, an indicator of stress, was observed for most of the conditions, whereas a die-off, as revealed by the live and dead quantitative PCR data, was only observed in IW stored at 20 degrees C. Overall, stress appeared to be highest in IW and lowest in PBS. The stressed cells were still able to recover, even at 4 degrees C, and to attach to the lettuce. Furthermore, our results show that standard laboratory solutions such as PBS and SDW may not be the best to simulate stressed cells in IW, in which the bacteria may behave significantly differently.

AB  - Pollutants can have detrimental effects on living organisms. They can cause toxicity, damaging cells, tissues and organs because of their high concentrations or activities. Plants provide a useful system for screening and monitoring environmental pollutants. Among pollutants, aluminum is considered as a primary growth limiting factor for plants resulting in decreased plant growth and development. Although considered to be a non-essential and highly toxic metal ion for growth and development, aluminum (Al) is easily absorbed by plants. Urticaceae family members have high nutrient requirements demonstrated by leaves containing high levels of calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), and nitrogen (N). Urtica pilulifera is one of the important traditional medicinal plants in Turkey. In this study, U. pilulifera was used as a bioindicator to investigate the possible differences in the absorption and accumulation of mineral nutrients at different levels of the Al exposure and examine the mineral nutrition composition of U. pilulifera under Al stress. Also, some growth parameters (leaf-stem fresh and dry weights, root dry weights, stem lengths and leaf surface area) were investigated. U. pilulifera seedlings were grown for two months in growth-room conditions and watered with spiked Hoagland solution, which contained 0, 100, and 200M aluminium chloride (AlCl3). It was observed that macro- and micro-nutritional status of roots and leaves was altered by Al exposure. The concentrations of some macro- and micronutrients were reduced while concentrations of others were increased by excess of Al. Some macro- and micronutrients were increased at low level of Al whereas reductions were observed at high level of Al, and vice versa. The patterns were dependent on the macro- or micronutrient and the plant part.

AB  - Green spaces within cities counteract the loss of bird diversity due to urbanization because they provide food, nesting sites, and protection against predators. Nevertheless, the influence of vegetation,area, and impervious surfaces on the distribution of wild species is not well understood and can vary between seasons and even from city to city in different parts of the world. In this study we estimated bird abundances in 12 parks of Mexico City during two seasons in 2008. We found 96 songbirds and grouped them according to their urban affinities and migratory status. The number of species increased in relation to park area in the breeding season, but not during the migratory season. Unexpectedly, migratory bird richness increased in relation to distance from natural woodlands. Furthermore, seven winter transient parulines were common in all parks and could therefore be considered as suburban adaptable. On the other hand, species that use urban resources and tolerate the conditions created by human beings in towns and cities were more abundant in parks with a high impervious cover and/or located far from natural areas. In both seasons, the opposite was true for insectivore-frugivorous species, which generally avoid urban areas. The latter group was more abundant in larger parks as well. Widely distributed species tended to be ground insectivore-granivores and many were gregarious. Indicator value analyses selected 22 species in winter and 17 in the breeding season. The distribution of these birds was associated with distance to natural areas and impervious surfaces cover in both seasons, and with the cover of small-leaved trees in the wintering season and the cover of Fraxinus uhdei in the breeding season: These results may be useful for future management actions focused on the conservation of songbirds in urban parks.

AB  - Wastewater samples from the secondary clarifier of two treatment plants were spiked in the microgramto-tens-of-microgram per liter range With diuron (herbicide), ibuprofen and diclofenac (anti-inflammatory drugs), sulfamethoxazole and erythromycin (antibiotics), bezafibrate and gemfibrozil (lipid regulators), atenolol (beta-blocker), carbamazepine (anti-epileptic), hydrochlorothiazide (diuretic), caffeine (stimulant) and N-acetyl-4-amino-antipiryne, a metabolite of the antipyretic drug dypirone. They were subsequently ozonated in continuous flow using 1.2 L lab-scale bubble columns. The concentration of all spiking compounds was monitored in the outlet stream. The effects of varying ozone input, expressed as energy per unit volume, and water flow rate, and of using single or double column were studied in relation to the efficiency of ozone usage and the ratio of pollutant depletion. The ozone dosage required to treat both wastewaters with pollutant depletion of >90% was in the 55-8.5 mg/L range with ozone efficiencies greater than 80% depending on the type of wastewater and the operating conditions. This represented 100-200 mol of ozone transferred per mole of pollutant removed. Direct and indirect environmental impacts of ozonation were assessed according to Life Cycle Assessment, a technique that helped identify the most effective treatments in terms of potential toxicity reduction, as well as of toxicity reduction per unit mass of greenhouse-gas emissions, which were used as an indicator of environmental efficiency. A trade-off between environmental effectiveness (toxicity reduction) and greenhouse-gas emissions was observed since maximizing toxicity removal led to higher greenhouse-gas emissions, due to the latter's relatively high ozone requirements. Also, there is an environmental trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency. Our results indicate that an efficient use of ozone was not compatible with a full pollutant removal.

AB  - Chemically mediated behaviour of insects is often strongly affected by mixtures of odour stimuli and their temporal characteristics. Both sensory transduction and central processing of odour mixtures can give rise to several different kinds of interaction, which can influence how individual components are perceived and processed. In particular, odour mixtures have been examined in model experiments as premixed binary mixtures in comparison with pure odour stimuli. Only in few experiments, the influence of the temporal structure of odour mixtures on odour perception has been taken into account. Natural odour stimuli often have a pulsed structure and may in general be superimposed on a background of irrelevant or interfering compounds, which can fluctuate with different frequencies, depending on their source. To achieve a better representation of these natural conditions, our odour mixing experiments apply a new kind of stimulation protocol: odours were not premixed but superimposed with a specific time pattern; one odour stimulus was presented as a longer persisting background and the second stimulus was a superimposed short test signal. To gain an overview of odour interaction patterns in the Colorado potato beetle by causing adaptation of one receptor population at naturally occurring levels of concentration and time intervals, electroantennographic recordings were made on excised antennae. A matrix of 12 stimulus compounds led to 132 pairs of compounds tested, each in the role of background and test stimulus. In 64 cases, the interaction was significantly different, when the role of background and stimulus was exchanged. Interaction patterns ranging from no interference (independence) to suppression were found and assigned to four clearly distinguishable types. We discuss that the observed effects of the presentation sequence in odour mixtures may contribute to the mechanisms of olfactory pattern recognition and olfactory contrast perception by insects.

AB  - Soil enzymes are widely used as indicators of soil quality because they are sensitive to various land management practices. In particular, enzyme kinetic behaviour and the derived kinetic parameters (V-max and K-m) can be indirectly influenced by changes of soil structure, organic matter quantity and quality due to the addition of organic amendments to the soil. When measuring enzyme kinetics, the calculation of the specificity constant (K-a), i.e.: the ratio V-max to K-m, is advisable to obtain additional information on the whole catalytic process.
   Many assays for a wide range of soil enzymes have been set up and they differ for the substrate used, incubation conditions and detection methods: the most widely used are those based on spectrophotometric and fluorimetric techniques. However, the comparative information between the two assays is poor.
   Therefore this study aimed to answer the following questions: (1) Can beta-glucosidase kinetic parameters be considered reliable indicators in detecting changes due to soil management? (2) Can the specificity constant (K-a) be considered an additional kinetic parameter useful as a new ecological indicator? (3) Do different analytical approaches give the same results?
   Both experimental approaches, fluorimetric and spectrophotometric, were effective in highlighting changes occurred under organic and conventional management indicating higher level of enzyme (V-max) under organic cropping system.
   However the specificity constant (K-a) demonstrated that organic management did not affect the whole catalytic behaviour of beta-glucosidase. On the other hand, as regards the two analytical approaches, K-a increased significantly using the fluorogenic substrate, 4-MUF-beta-D-glucopyranoside, indicating a higher catalytic efficiency of the enzyme with the fluorimetric approach.

AB  - Subfossil Chironomidae assemblages were studied in a sediment sequence from Zabieniec bog in central Poland. The climate history and habitat changes in the palaeo-lake were reconstructed from these assemblages. Currently no chironomid-based climate calibration set is available from Poland and so past mean July air temperatures were inferred from chironomid-climate calibration data-sets from Norway, Russia, and Switzerland. During the Late Weichselian the three calibration functions from these data-sets provided similar temperature inferences but there was some divergence in the reconstructions for the Younger Dryas and Holocene. In the late Pleniglacial, inferred summer air temperature was relatively low (8-12 degrees C) and the lake was oligotrophic. At about 16.5 ka BP, temperature rapidly rose to 15 degrees C and assemblage diversity substantially increased. During the interstadial, temperature stayed at this level. In the Younger Dryas, July air temperature was only 1-2 degrees C lower than in the interstadial, as inferred from the Norwegian calibration data-set, whereas the Russian and Swiss calibration functions did not indicate any temperature decrease. From the beginning of the Holocene, taxa typical of meso-eutrophic conditions dominated. There was an increased abundance of phytophilous species and the assemblage composition was also influenced by changes in water-level. Palaeotemperature reconstructions differed in their values. From 8.0 to 8.7 ka BP, inferences based on the Swiss and Russian data-sets indicated a cold oscillation while reconstructions based on the Norwegian data-set did not show any temperature decrease. After 2.5 ka BP assemblage diversity and head-capsule concentrations decreased. In the last millennium semi-terrestrial taxa dominated, except from Late Medieval to Early Modem times when shallow-water species reappeared. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that Escherichia coli and enterococci are unreliable indicators of fecal contamination in Hawaii because of their ability to multiply in environmental soils. In this study, the method of detecting Bacteroides phages as specific markers of sewage contamination in Hawaii's recreational waters was evaluated because these sewage specific phages cannot multiply under environmental conditions. Bacteroides hosts (GB-124, GA-17), were recovered from sewage samples in Europe and were reported to be effective in detecting phages from sewage samples obtained in certain geographical areas. However, GB-124 and GA-17 hosts were ineffective in detecting phages from sewage samples obtained in Hawaii. Bacteroides host HB-73 was isolated from a sewage sample in Hawaii, confirmed as a Bacteroides sp. and shown to recover phages from multiple sources of sewage produced in Hawaii at high concentrations (5.2-7.3 x 10(5) PFU/100 mL). These Bacteroides phages were considered as potential markers of sewage because they also survived for three days in fresh stream water and two days in marine water. Water samples from Hawaii's coastal swimming beaches and harbors, which were known to be contaminated with discharges from streams, were shown to contain moderate (20-187 CFU/100 mL) to elevated (173-816 CFU/100 mL) concentrations of enterococci. These same samples contained undetectable levels (<10 PFU/100 mL) of F+ coliphage and Bacteroides phages and provided evidence to suggest that these enterococci may not necessarily be associated with the presence of raw sewage. These results support previous conclusions that discharges from streams are the major sources of enterococci in coastal waters of Hawaii and the most likely source of these enterococci is from environmental soil rather than from sewage.

AB  - Several processes are hypothesised to mediate the relationship between local (microsite) plant species richness and the topographical heterogeneity of the surrounding landscape. In a topographically heterogeneous landscape with various habitats occurring close to each other, local species richness may be enriched by species from surrounding habitats due to the spatial mass effect (sink-source dynamics). In contrast, increased habitat fragmentation due to spatial heterogeneity may have a negative effect on local species richness. The spatial mass effect is thought to be more pronounced in communities with a higher ratio of generalists, as generalists are more likely to establish viable populations in sink habitats. To reveal the pattern of local species richness along a gradient of landscape topographical heterogeneity at middle altitudes of the Bohemian Massif, we used 2551 forest vegetation plots stored in the Czech National Phytosociological Database. We developed an analytical approach relating the pattern of local species richness of vegetation types to the gradient of landscape topographical heterogeneity. An increase or decrease in species richness with increasing landscape heterogeneity was related to changes in the generalist/specialist ratio, and also to changes in soil reaction and productivity estimated through Ellenberg indicator values. Local species richness along a gradient of increasing landscape heterogeneity increased in nutrient-poor vegetation and decreased in nutrient-rich vegetation. Nutrient-poor vegetation types, such as thermophilous and acidophilous oak forests, also had a high proportion of habitat generalists, supporting the hypothesis that increased richness in heterogeneous landscapes may result from the spatial mass effect. However, the same pattern may be explained by a shift in environmental conditions along the landscape heterogeneity gradient, such as increasing productivity of nutrient-rich vegetation types or increasing soil reaction of most vegetation types in more heterogeneous landscapes. We discuss available evidence and conclude that these two explanations need not be mutually exclusive.

AB  - We propose a method to evaluate the detection abilities of networks used for protection purposes. Such networks are designed for the detection of nuclear, biological or gaseous emissions, without constraint on the source location. Their assigned goal is to have the best chance to detect a threatening emission located anywhere in the vicinity of a domain to protect. Two sensors siting applications are addressed: sensors placed in the surroundings of a facility to protect, or sensors carried by people scattered within a small area. A network protection ability is related both to its detection scope, and to its response time. To assess the performance of such networks, two statistical indicators are therefore designed: the detection probability, computed on a large number of possible source locations, and the saturation time, which is the time when the maximum detection probability has been reached.
   Simulations are then carried out with the Polyphemus air quality modeling system for many emission scenarios, including 961 possible source locations, various emitted species, and a few representative meteorological situations. This allows to assess the performance of single sensors as well as full networks, and their sensitivity to parameters like meteorological conditions and source characteristics. The emitted quantity and meteorological dispersion are found to be important parameters, whereas the species type does not significantly influence the results. Two network design methods are considered: (1) networks composed of a given number of the "best" sensors according to an indicator. and (2) sensors placed in circles around the protected domain. The networks built with respect to the detection probability show good results with a limited number of sensors, while the saturation time is not reliable enough to build networks. The networks based on circles also show a good performance in the studied cases, provided there is a sufficient number of sensors. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In socially monogamous species, extra-pair paternity has the potential to increase the variance in male reproductive success, thereby affecting the opportunity for sexual selection on male extravagant ornamentation. In the European barn swallow (Hirundo rustica rustica), the tail streamer length is a sexually selected male ornament and an honest indicator of viability. The North American barn swallow (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster) also shows sexual dimorphism in tail streamer length, but whether this trait holds the same signalling function in this subspecies is a controversial issue, and the available literature is presently scarce. Here, we present data on paternity in the North American barn swallow, including a complete sampling of extra-pair sires in four colonies. We analysed how extra-pair paternity affected the variance in male fertilization success and examined whether male tail streamer (i.e. the outermost tail feather) length correlated with fertilization success (n=86 males). Extra-pair paternity constituted 31% of all offspring and significantly increased the variance in male fertilization success. The number of offspring sired by extra-pair males accounted for almost half of the total variance in male fertilization success. Males with naturally long tail streamers had a higher fertilization success than males with shorter tail streamers, and this pattern was mainly caused by a higher extra-pair success for males with long tail streamers. Males with long tail streamers also paired with early breeding females in prime body condition. These results are consistent with the idea that there is directional sexual selection on male tail streamer length, possibly mediated through male extra-pair mating success or the timing of breeding onset.

AB  - In an effort to develop indicators for Great Lakes near-shore conditions, diatom-based transfer functions to infer water quality variables were developed from 155 samples collected from coastal Great Lakes wetlands. embayments and high-energy shoreline sites. Over 2,000 diatom taxa were identified, and 352 taxa were sufficiently abundant to include in transfer function development. Multivariate data exploration revealed strong responses of the diatom assemblages to stressor variables. including total phosphorus (TP). Spatial variables such as lake. latitude and longitude also had notable relationships with assemblage characteristics. A diatom inference transfer function TP provided a robust reconstructive relationship (r(2) = 0.67; RMSE = 0.28 log(mu g/L); r(2)jackknife = 0.55; RMSEP = 0.33 log (mu g/L)) that improved following the removal of 13 samples that had poor observed-inferred TP relationships (r(2) = 0.75; RMSE = 0.22 log(mu g/L); r(jackknife)(2) = 0.65; RMSEP = 0.26 log (mu g/L)). Diatom-based transfer functions for other water quality variables, such as total nitrogen chloride. and chlorophyll a also performed well. Measured and diatom-inferred water quality data were regressed against watershed characteristics (including gradients of agriculture, atmospheric deposition, and industrial facilities) to determine the relative strength of measured and diatom-inferred data to identify watershed stressor influences. With the exception of pH, diatom-inferred water quality variables were better predicted by watershed characteristics than were measured water quality variables. Because diatom communities are subject to the prevailing water quality in the Great Lakes coastal environment. it appears they can better integrate water quality information than snapshot measurements. These results strongly support the use of diatoms in Great Lakes coastal monitoring programs.

AB  - Solifluction lobes and rock glaciers show similar geometry with a wide range of sizes. Morphometric analysis classifies these lobate landforms in the eastern Swiss Alps into five subgroups. A bouldery rock glacier has an active layer composed of matrix-free boulders, whereas a pebbly rock glacier consists of matrix-supported debris derived from less resistant rocks. Both move by permafrost creep at 5-30 m depth, but the former tends to have a longer tread. A high solifluction lobe, having a riser 0.2-3 m high, originates mainly from annual gelifluction operating within the top 0.5 m of sediment, and its variation, a mudflow-affected high solifluction lobe, occurs where prolonged snowmelt triggers a rapid flow of the thawed surficial layer. A low solifluction lobe has a riser up to 0.2 m high and occurs where thin fine-grained debris responds mainly to diurnal frost creep. These lobes show, on the whole, positive relations between the tread length (L), width (W) and the riser height (H). However, a regression analysis separates the rock glaciers from the solifluction lobes by a distinct gap at W (or L) = 30 m and H = 3 m and provides different regression lines for the two populations. The morphometry primarily determined by the transport process is H, which approximates or slightly exceeds the maximum depth of movement. The depth of movement also affects the horizontal extent of a moving mass, which defines W. A lobe appears where horizontal homogeneity exceeds 3H, and advances with time until reaching a maximum L controlled by climatic or dynamic conditions. Lobe morphometry can be used as an environmental indicator. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - We present a new climatic reconstruction method appropriate for biological proxies where modern distributions are poorly defined and data sets are small. The technique uses a sine function in conjunction with maximum likelihood estimates of best high and best low values for the distribution of each species. To demonstrate the model we present temperature reconstructions for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and Holocene from beetle fossil assemblages from the Awatere Valley, New Zealand. The temperature estimates are determined by the mutual overlap of the climate range for all the species in the assemblage. The overlap is then compared with modern physio-chemical conditions.
   For our example, we estimate the LGM summer (February) mean temperature was about 3.5-4degreesC cooler, and July (winter) mean daily minimum temperature was about 4-5degreesC cooler than present day temperatures. The maximum likelihood estimates broaden the reconstructed temperature ranges to 2.5-5degreesC cooler for February temperatures and 3.5-6.0degreesC cooler for mean minimum daily temperature of the coldest month (July). These estimates are consistent with LGM temperature estimates of 4-7degreesC from other climate proxy indicators.
   Estimates of Holocene temperatures are very similar to modern. Estimates are compared with results from the established mutual climatic range (MCR) technique and the results are compatible. MCR is less robust than the sine model approach for these data because it requires the pre-determination of the critical physiochemical controls and assumes Gaussian distributions in climate space. The sine model is conceptually superior to traditional BIOCLIM modelling, with which it shares many features, because BIOCLIM also assumes Gaussian distributions and the sine model allows attribute testing of the data sets which are not possible with BIOCLIM.

AB  - Leaching to ground water and tile drains are important parts of the environmental assessment of pesticides. The aims of the present study were to (i) assess the significance of preferential flow for pesticide leaching under realistic worst-case conditions for Dutch agriculture (soil profile with thick clay layer and high rainfall) and (ii) collect a high-quality data set that is suitable for testing pesticide leaching models. The movement of water, bromide, and the pesticides bentazon [3-isopropyl-1H-2, 1,3-benzothiadiazine-4(3H)-one-2,2-dioxide] and imidacloprid [1-[(6-chloro-3-pyridinyl)-methyl]-wN-nitro-2-imidazol-idinimine] was monitored in a clay soil for about 1 yr. The 1.2-ha field was located in the central part of the Netherlands (51degrees53' N, 5degrees43' E). The soil was a Eutric Fluvisol cropped with winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Tile drains were present at a 0.8- to 0.9-m depth and the ground water level fluctuated between a 0.5- and 2-m depth. All chemicals were applied in spring. None of the soil concentration profiles showed bimodal concentration distributions. However, for each substance the highest concentration in drain water was found in the first drainage event after its application, which indicates preferential flow. This preferential flow is probably caused by permanent macropores that were present in the 0.3- to 1.0-m layer. At the time of the first drainage event, the drain water concentration of each substance was about an order of magnitude higher than its ground water concentration. Thus, the flux concentrations in drain water proved to be a more sensitive detector of preferential flow than the resident concentrations in the soil profile and the ground water.

AB  - This paper addresses the inheritance of host resistance to gastro-intestinal nematode parasite infections in commercial Texel lambs, and the role of resistance to parasites in breeding programmes. In two flocks of Texel sheep, faecal egg counts following natural parasite challenge were measured on up to three occasions post weaning per lamb over a 4-year period, with 1385 and 287 lambs measured on the two farms. Live weight, and ultrasonically measured fat and muscle depth at weaning were available for each lamb, as were deep pedigrees. Egg counts were moderately to strongly heritable on all occasions, with Nematodirus egg counts more heritable than the Strongyle egg counts. Weighted average heritabilities for Strongyle and Nematodirus egg counts were 0.26 and 0.38, respectively. Within the same category of parasite, genetic correlations across time were positive and strong but somewhat less than unity, as were the correlations between Strongyle and Nematodirus egg counts measured at the same time. Genetic correlations between performance traits and Strongyle egg counts were usually favourable (i.e. negative) but weak, whereas those with Nematodirus egg counts were generally neutral or slightly positive. Whilst Nematodirus resistance may not necessarily be included in a breeding goal, the results suggest that Nematodirus egg counts can be used as an additional genetic indicator of Strongyle egg counts, at little extra cost. Including the epidemiological consequences of decreasing Strongyle egg counts in benefits of increasing parasite resistance, it is suggested that under UK conditions selection goals that place equal emphasis on live weight and log-transformed egg counts will be a robust means of improving growth rate and decreasing parasite larval challenge.

AB  - Diversity in rhizobiophages from rhizosphere soils of different legumes inhabiting eight localities in the Delhi, Jaisalmer Plateau and Great Nicobar ecogeographical regions of India was assessed using 14 rhizobial indicator strains that nodulate three species of Sesbania (S. sesban, S. aegyptica and S. rostrata). Phage activity was detected in 47% of the soil samples tested. Most of the positive responses were observed in soils of localities inhabited by host legumes of indicator bacterial strains and their close relatives. The results suggest that rhizobiophages are maintained in the vicinity of their target host populations and are spread through the man-made introduction of host legumes and their rhizobia. Diversity among phage isolates was assessed by studying the plaque traits on their indicator bacterial strains, and variation in morphology using transmission electron microscopy. Except for plaque size, the variation in the plaque traits was rather narrow. Based on the variability pattern, the 64 phages were grouped into I I plaque types. In contrast to plaque characteristics, the diversity in morphological characters was high and phage isolates differ from the rhizobiophages reported from Indian soils; the Indian phages of Azorhizobium caulinodans strain ORS571 are different from the Senegal isolates. Based on the morphological diversity, the phages are grouped into Bradley's basic four phage groups (A1, B1, B2 and C1) and three families, Myoviridae, Siphoviridae and Podoviridae. This pattern of grouping is reflected in cluster formation based on the variability in plaque and morphological characters. The host range of the phage isolates is rather narrow and restricted to their indicator strains and their close relatives due to marked genetic divergence among rhizobia due to legume host specialization and ecological conditions. The phages can be used for typifying closely related stem-nodulating rhizobia and other rhizobia, which are promiscuous within sesbanias. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The ground flora (vascular plants < 2 m high, excluding trees and shrubs) was recorded in 1974 and 1991 from 163 permanent 10 m x 10 m plots arranged on a systematic grid across Wytham Woods, near Oxford (UK). The Woods cover about 320 ha, are predominantly deciduous, but of varying ages and management types. The total number of species found (173, 167 respectively), the mean richness per plot (16.7, 17.2) and the breakdown of the species list between different species types (ancient woodland indicators, other woodland species, non-woodland species) showed no significant differences between 1974 and 1991, but mean ground cover declined from 80% to 64%. Ancient woodland indicators as a group showed less change between the years than species associated with the open glades and grassland patches in the wood. Some species increased in frequency across the woodland including Arum maculatum, Brachypodium sylvaticum, Deschampsia cespitosa and Poa trivialis; while others such as Ajuga reptans, Angelica sylvestris and Circaea lutetiana declined. Mean cover of Rubus fruticosus per plot declined from 35% to 6% and of Mercurialis perennis from 32 to 24%. More species were lost from plantations than from seminatural stands. The results are based on only two times, so inferences on possible causes must be drawn with caution. However the results are consistent with the effects of (1) the changing conditions associated with stand growth, particularly in the plantations, and (2) an increase in browsing/grazing by deer. No evidence was found for an effect of changing soil nitrogen levels on the vegetation. Changes in the ground flora as well as the woody layers, and in managed as well as unmanaged stands should be monitored, if nature conservation objectives are to be met.

AB  - High nitrogen (N) application rates are used by maize growers as an 'insurance', but may have an adverse effect on the environment. In this paper, the potential for nitrogen savings by the use of site-specific N fertilization rates is reviewed. Various tools for a more precise assessment of N requirements are available. Adjustments of N rates to the amounts of soil mineral N present shortly before planting can contribute to efficient N use, as can a deliberate delay of N dressings combined with indicator-based N supplementation after emergence. Conditions, under which these strategies are effective, are discussed. Post-emergence tests indicate whether a crop is likely to respond to sidedress N, but few tests quantify how much N should be sidedressed. Tissue tests are of less value for the support of decisions on N supplementation than indicators that are directly related to the soil or to the measurement of leaf and canopy greenness. Greenness and tissue tests are both unable to quantify excessive availability of N at early crop stages, as opposed to soil related indicators. Moreover, all crop tests generally need an on-site calibration with a reference plot. At later sampling dates, indicators can provide clues for the adjustment of N management in subsequent maize crops. The late stalk nitrate test and the post-harvest soil mineral N test appear to be the most valuable. Although indicators capable of identifying fields with an excessive N availability may save money, little attention has been paid to a cost-benefit analysis of indicator-based site-specific N management.

AB  - On selected plots of a long-term NPK mineral fertilization experiment set up in 1973 at the institute's Experimental Station in Nagyhorcsok, the nitrate-N content of the 0-600 cm soil layer, the depth distribution of the NO3-N and the nitrogen balance of the plots was studied in 1995, in the 22(nd) year of the experiment, similarly to the analyses carried out in the 12(th) and 17(th) years.
   After harvesting the indicator plant, rye, soil samples were taken every 20 cm from the control and from plots treated with 100, 200 and 300 kg N/ha/year.
   After the application of higher nitrogen rates, nitrate-N accumulation was detected in the sample soil layer. At an application rate of 200 kg N/ha/year the average nitrate-N content in the upper 0-600 cm soil layer in these plots was 12 mg/kg at the first sampling, 18 mg/kg after 17 years and 20 mg/kg after 22 years. These figures were 21,35 and 43.2 mg/kg in the 300 kg N/ha/year treatments.
   Differences were recorded not only in the average nitrate-N values measured in the soil profiles of the fertilized treatments, but also in the course of the nitrate accumulation curves plotted for the sampling times.
   The long-term experiment made it possible to study the nutrient uptake and mineral nutrition of a number of crops, The analysis of the nitrogen cycle confirmed the observation that nitrogen fertilization adjusted to the requirements of the cultivated crops and suited to the environmental conditions and growing site potential does not pollute the environment to an intolerable extent. Over-fertilization can be avoided by determining the mineral-N reserves of the soil and the N requirements of the cultivated crop.

AB  - Timely crop yield forecasts at a national level are substantial to support food policies, to assess agricultural production, and to subsidize regions affected by food shortage. This study presents an operational crop yield forecasting system for Poland that employs freely available satellite and agro-meteorological products provided by the Copernicus programme. The crop yield predictors consist of: (1) Vegetation condition indicators provided daily by Sentinel-3 OLCI (optical) and SLSTR (thermal) imagery, (2) a backward extension of Sentinel-3 data (before 2018) derived from cross-calibrated MODIS data, and (3) air temperature, total precipitation, surface radiation, and soil moisture derived from ERA-5 climate reanalysis generated by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The crop yield forecasting algorithm is based on thermal time (growing degree days derived from ERA-5 data) to better follow the crop development stage. The recursive feature elimination is used to derive an optimal set of predictors for each administrative unit, which are ultimately employed by the Extreme Gradient Boosting regressor to forecast yields using official yield statistics as a reference. According to intensive leave-one-year-out cross validation for the 2000-2019 period, the relative RMSE for voivodships (NUTS-2) are: 8% for winter wheat, and 13% for winter rapeseed and maize. Respectively, for municipalities (LAU) it equals 14% for winter wheat, 19% for winter rapeseed, and 27% for maize. The system is designed to be easily applicable in other regions and to be easily adaptable to cloud computing environments such as Data and Information Access Services (DIAS) or Amazon AWS, where data sets from the Copernicus programme are directly accessible.

AB  - Understanding the effect of nitrogen (N) vertical distribution within the rice canopy at different growth stages and development of critical nitrogen dilution curves for upper leaf layers will not only help accurate estimations of the spatial and temporal variation in N status, but will also provide a basis for analyses of N nutrition in rice. Based on a three-year field experiment with 2 rice varieties, 3 N levels and 4 planting densities, the effect of heterogeneity in N vertical distribution on the nitrogen nutrition index (NNI) was then determined, and for the first time, critical N dilution curves of upper leaf layers were constructed based on a Bayesian statistical model. The relationship for NNI entire canopy and its relationship with the other tested leaf layers was investigated. The leaf layer suitable for analyses of N nutrition and directly inversion of NNI by remote sensing is determined. The results revealed that the main contributor to plant N concentration (PNC) of entire canopy (PNCCanopy) was found to be the lower leaf layer of the rice canopy, and may lead to misdiagnosis under the non-N-limiting condition by using the canopy level based NNI. The PNC of top half leaf layer of the canopy was more stable in terms of shortterm environmental changes, and more accurately representing the overall N status. The top half leaf layer was the main contributor to canopy reflectance. Thus, compared with the NNI of other upper leaf layers, the NNI of the top half leaf layer is more suitable for direct inversion by using CI (1113, 743) with the R2 = 0.70. Overall, these findings suggest that the NNI of the top half leaf layer is the optimal remote sensing indicator of N nutrition in rice.

AB  - Longevity research is a hot topic in the health field. Considerable research focuses on longevity phenomenon in Bama Yao Autonomous County, which has a typical karst landform and is located in Southwest China. This study aims to illustrate the spatial feature of longevity indicators in other Yao areas, to analyze the correlation between climatic factors and longevity indicators, and to provide new clues and targets for further longevity studies. We collect and integrate population, climate, and terrain data into a spatial database. The main analysis methods include spatial autocorrelation, high/low clustering, and multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR). Two longevity clusters are identified in Guijiang River Basin (longevity index (LI%): 2.49 +/- 0.63) and Liujiang River Basin (LI%: 2.13 +/- 0.60). The spatial distribution of longevity indicators is autocorrelative (Moran's I = 0.652, p < 0.001) and clustered significantly (Z score = 4.268, p < 0.001). MGWR shows that the atmospheric pressure significantly affects the spatial distribution of LI% (estimate value (EV) = - 0.566, p = 0.012), centenarity index (CI%) (EV = - 0.425, p = 0.007), UC (EV = - 0.502, p = 0.006), and CH (EV = - 0.497, p = 0.007). Rainfall significantly affects the spatial distribution of LI% (EV = 0.300, p = 0.003) and CI% (EV = - 0.191, p = 0.016). The spatial distribution of the main longevity indicators shows significant heterogeneity and autocorrelation, and they cluster in the Guijiang River and Liujiang River basins. Atmospheric pressure and rainfall may contribute to the longevity phenomenon through complex mechanisms. The longevity phenomenon in the Yao nationality in Guijiang River Basin requires further study to improve our understanding of the health effect of meteorological, environmental, and social conditions on longevity.

AB  - Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) associated bioaerosols have emerged as one of the critical sustainability indicators, ensuring health and well-being of societies and cities. In this context, this review summarizes the various wastewater treatment technologies which have been studied with a focus of bioaerosols emissions, potential emission stages, available sampling strategies, survival and dispersion factors, dominant microbial species in bioaerosols, and possible control approaches. Literature review revealed that most of the studies were devoted to sampling, enumerating and identifying cultivable microbial species of bioaerosols, as well as measuring their concentrations. However, the role of treatment technologies and their operational factors are investigated in limited studies only. Moreover, few studies have been reported to investigate the presence and concentrations of air borne virus and fungi in WWTP, as compared to bacterial species. The common environmental factors, affecting the survival and dispersion of bioaerosols, are observed as relative humidity, temperature, wind speed, and solar illumination. Further, research studies on recent episodes of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 virus) pandemic also revealed that continuous and effective surveillance on WWTPs associated bioaerosols may led to early sign for future pandemics. The evaluation of reported data is bit complicated, due to the variation in sampling approaches, ambient conditions, and site activities of each study. Therefore, such studies need a standardized methodology and improved guidance to help informed future policies, contextual research, and support a robust health-based risk assessment process. Based on this review, an integrated sampling and analysis framework is suggested for future WWTPs to ensure their sustainability at social and/or health associated aspects.

AB  - The involvement of different isoforms of genes encoding phospholipases D (CsPLD alpha, CsPLD beta, CsPLD delta, CsPLD gamma and CsPLD zeta) and A(2) (CsPLA(2)alpha, CsPLA(2)beta and CsPAT1) on starvation-induced postharvest non-chilling peel pitting (NCPP) has been compared in the inner (albedo) and outer (flavedo) parts of the peel of citrus fruit treated or not with sucrose (Suc). The study has been performed in Navelate (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck) sweet orange, which is prone to NCPP, stored under non-stressful environmental conditions (90-95 % relative humidity (RH) and 20 degrees C). Transcriptional changes, as well as respiration rate and ATP content evolution during fruit storage were compared in both peel tissues. Results indicated that the albedo is more susceptible than the flavedo to starvation; and that, at early stress stage, ATP and all CsPLD isoforms and CsPLA(2)beta are good indicators of carbon starvation in the albedo, and CsPLD beta in the flavedo. These carbon starvation-induced signals were not activated when Suc was applied as an external energy source. In the second phase of starvation, expression of all CsPLD-encoding genes increased with NCPP; and CsPLD gamma and CsPLD zeta showed major increases in both peel tissues. The correlation of the expression of CsPLA isoforms with damage development was lower. In this phase, Suc may protect the fruit by providing additional energy sources to sustain respiration; and by favouring phospholipid-derived signaling messengers mediated by CsPLD beta and CsPAT1 in the albedo, CsPLD zeta in the flavedo, and CsPLA(2)beta in both tissues. Results from the examination of changes in gene expression point out tissue specificities in the expression of CsPL genes but also different susceptibility to starvation between the flavedo and the albedo in citrus fruit.

AB  - These effective reservoir rocks that can have sufficient porosity and permeability and hydrocarbon accumulations determine economic reserves and high yield of tight oil and gas. Understanding the origin and distribution of these effective reservoir rocks is important for sorting out "sweet spots" in tight reservoirs. Multiple-scale analyses from the microscopic, via drill core to single wellbore have been conducted to examine reservoir heterogeneity of the Upper Paleozoic Shanxi Formation in the southeastern Ordos Basin. Five sandstone petrofacies have been defined in terms of texture and framework composition, detrital matrix, diagenesis and pore types: quartz arenite, tuffaceous quartz arenite, ductile lithic-lean sub-litharenite, ductile lithic-rich sandstone and tightly carbonate-cemented sandstone. The various petrofacies show fundamentally different pathways of diagenetic and reservoir-quality evolutions, due to the complexity of texture and detrital composition in the Shanxi Formation, directly related to the provenance and depositional environment. Quartz arenites and ductile grain-lean sub-litharenites both form effective reservoir rocks. By translating petrofacies to well-log signatures corrected from petrographic and core analysis data, a model based on factor analysis has been built to predict petrofacies at the well scale. For investigating the distribution of each petrofacies at the field scale, sequential indicator simulation method has been used to construct a 3-D petrofacies model with facies conditioning. The isopach maps of quartz arenites and ductile lithic-lean sub-litharenites have been made from the 3-D petrofacies model to quantify their areal distributions, and to define the "sweet spots" by combining isopach maps of these effective reservoir rocks and gas production data from well tests. The concept of reservoir petrofacies is an important tool for the characterization of tight sandstone reservoirs.

AB  - Neighboring stand-alone hybrid microgrids with diesel generators (DGs) as well as grid-feeding photovoltaics (PV) and grid-forming battery storage systems (BSS) can be coupled to reduce fuel costs and emissions as well as to enhance the security of supply. In contrast to the research in control and small-signal rotor angle stability of microgrids, there is a significant lack of knowledge regarding the transient stability of off-grid hybrid microgrids in a cluster environment. Therefore, the large-signal rotor angle stability of pooled microgrids was assessed qualitatively and also quantitatively in this research work. Quantitative transient stability assessment (TSA) was carried out with the help of the-recently developed and validated-micro-hybrid method by combining time-domain simulations and transient energy function analyses. For this purpose, three realistic dynamic microgrids were modelled regarding three operating modes (island, interconnection, and cluster) as well as the conventional scenario "classical" and four hybrid scenarios ("storage", "sun", "sun & storage", and "night") regarding different instants of time on a tropical partly sunny day. It can be inferred that, coupling hybrid microgrids is feasible from the voltage, frequency, and also transient stability point of view. However, the risk of large-signal rotor angle instability in pooled microgrids is relatively higher than in islanded microgrids. Along with critical clearing times, new stability-related indicators such as system stability degree and corrected critical clearing times should be taken into account in the planning phase and in the operation of microgrids. In principle, a general conclusion concerning the best operating mode and scenario of the investigated microgrids cannot be drawn. TSA of pooled hybrid microgrids should be performed-on a regular basis especially in the grid operation-for different loading conditions, tie-line power flows, topologies, operating modes, and scenarios.

AB  - Twelve different brands of mineral water were collected from the Algerian market and analyzed to determine the initial antimony (Sb) content in both the PET package and mineral water. Experiments were conducted under different time conditions: 1, 10, to 365 days, different temperatures: 6, 25, and 40 degrees C, and different bottles sizes: 0.33 L and 1.5 L. The Sb in mineral water bottles varies between 0.50 and 1.12 mu g/L for 0.33 L bottles, and 0.37 to 0.77 mu g/L for 1.5 L ones. All of these values remain below the limit set by the European Union of 5 mu g/L in drinking water. The diffusion coefficient of Sb in PET has been experimentally determined at 6, 25, and 40 degrees C, after the content of Sb in 1.5 L PET bottles had been determined. In the second part of the study, a factorial design 2(3) enabled a model the migration of antimony (Sb) in the bottled solutions and highlighted the influencing effects, such as temperature (degrees C), time (h), and thickness (mm) for two different time domains encompassing the entire validity period of the product. A simple polynomial function based on a single parameter has been determined with a precision indicator R-2 = 0.98. This model has the advantage of being simple and fast. The Chronic Daily Intake (CDI) of Sb has been calculated, for adults. It does not exceed the Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) regulated CDI value of 400 ng/kg/day. The CDI values for children increase as the weight of the children decreases. The passage from the maximum child weight to the minimum value in the study increases the CDI of 77%.

AB  - This is a comprehensive review of all published, quantitative studies focused on adoption of agricultural conservation practices in the United States between 1982 and 2017. This review finds that, taken as a whole, few independent variables have a consistent statistically significant relationship with adoption. Analyses showed that variables positively associated with adoption include the farmer self-identifying primarily as stewardship motivated or otherwise nonfinancially motivated, environmental attitudes, a positive attitude toward the particular program or practice, previous adoption of other conservation practices, seeking and using information, awareness of programs or practices, vulnerable land, greater farm size, higher levels of income and formal education, engaging in marketing arrangements, and positive yield impact expected. Some variables often thought to be important, such as land tenure, did not emerge as consistently important in this cross-study review Other variables, such as farmers' sense of place, training, presence of institutional conditions supporting adoption, and the role of collective decision making are not measured in enough studies to draw conclusions but potentially have a relationship with adoption decisions. Implications for how to promote conservation adoption and directions for future research are discussed. Because positive attitudes and awareness of conservation programs or practices are positive predictors of adoption, practitioners should share benefits of specific practices and programs and leverage existing practice adoption. Further work to explore relationships between conservation adoption and the role of farmer identity, nuances of land tenure, and the influence of structural factors is needed. Moreover, we suggest that future research should focus on the impact of different messages and avenues of reaching farmers in order to continue to inform conservation practices. Future research should consider both individual and institutional factors that facilitate and constrain adoption.

AB  - Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are a large group of environmental toxicants that pose serious risks to public health. In this study, we report a new method for the complete degradation of EDCs using a dual oxidation-action composite of biogenic manganese oxides and engineered Escherichia coli cells with surface-expressed multicopper oxidase CotA. The cotA gene from a Mn2+-oxidizing bacterium was constructed as a fusion gene "inaQ-N/cotA" with an anchoring motif inaQ-N from Pseudomonas syringae and was expressed in E. coli cells to display catalytic CotA on the cell surface. Under prolonged Mn2+-enriched culturing conditions, the engineered cells were capable of forming microspherical aggregated composites that were mainly composed of ramsdellite (MnO2). The ability of the composite to degrade two EDCs, bisphenol A (BPA) and nonylphenol (NP), was investigated. GC-MS assays identified 7 and 10 degraded intermediates using the C-13 isotope from C-13-labeled BPA and C-13-labeled NP, respectively. The appearance of (CO2)-C-13 from both reaction mixtures revealed mineralization pathways of BPA and NP by this composite. Bioassays using Caenorhabditis elegans as an indicator organism demonstrated that the estrogenic activity of BPA and NP was eliminated by these degradation processes. The reaction of the composite proceeded at an acidic pH and room temperature. A consecutive three-round treatment process showed comparable levels of degradation by the composite in repeated reactions and showed that the activity could be easily recovered. Moreover, the superoxide radical levels of BPA-degradation and NP-degradation were monitored during the 24 h reaction time, and possible BPA-degradation and NP-degradation pathways by the composite were proposed.

AB  - In order to validate a visual scoring system to assess footpad dermatitis in Pekin ducks, it should be investigated whether there is a reliable linkage between parameters of visually detectable lesions and the prevalence of ulcerations, as an indicator for severe and potentially painful lesions. Therefore, feet of Pekin ducks (N = 100) representing each level of a visual five-point scoring scheme for assessing the occurrence and severity of footpad dermatitis (n = 20 per score level; subsequently named "visual scoring system") were collected at an abattoir. Size of metatarsal footpads and lesions as well as the respective proportion of lesions were investigated macroscopically using digital images of the feet (subsequently named "image analysis"). Additionally, a histopathological examination of each foot was performed. In order to assess the reliability of the visual scoring system, histopathological findings were compared with the results of the visual inspection using a descriptive analysis. Furthermore, correlation coefficients were calculated to find linkages between the occurrence of ulcerations and the visually assessed parameters (visual scoring system and image analysis). Histopathologically verified ulcerative pododermatitis occurred in 67 of 100 examined feet, whereas the visual scoring system detected only n = 20 feet with ulcerative pododermatitis. Thus, 47 feet histopathologically classified as severe lesions could not be detected by the visual scoring system. Correlation coefficient between size of lesion and occurrence of ulceration was 0.425 and 0.455 between percentage of lesion and ulceration, respectively. According to our results, there is no reliable linkage between the visual scoring system and histopathological classification in footpads of Pekin ducks, especially in terms of severe lesions. Our findings suggest that the examined parameters "visual scoring system", "size of lesion" and "percentage of lesion" are not appropriate to detect severe ulcerative footpad dermatitis in Pekin ducks in actual prevalence when performing visual inspection.

AB  - This paper critically analyzes the disjuncture between rural electrification initiatives, utilization and socioeconomic development resulting from development of small hydropower (SHP) operations in rural Yunnan Province. Across China, a contemporary rapid and sustained proliferation of SHP is driven by government-led programs endorsing the technology as a means to provide energy for isolated communities in areas where grid connectivity is deficient or absent. Through SHP development, rural electrification programs (REP's) are purported to raise quality-of-life indicators in some of the country's poorest and most marginalized areas. Currently, there is a significant dearth of research critically analyzing the success or failures of SHP based REP's in China to improve livelihoods for ethnic minority communities in rural and remote areas. This paper adds to a shallow body of China based research by analyzing outcomes of SHP development through a comparative study undertaken in two rural village communities in the upper Nu River Valley. The study analyzed a range of quantitative economic data before undertaking a suite of qualitative methods such as participant observation, household surveys, semi-structured interviews and focus groups, staggered over multiple field visits. Findings indicate substantial scope exists for SHP based REP's to achieve stated objectives for improving socioeconomic indicators in rural and remote communities. Due to a range of challenges, however, projects often underachieve or further marginalize residents, commonly mired by failures in strategic planning, lack of implementation frameworks and genuine engagement with community members. A number of recommendations are offered as pathways to improve SHP based REP's as a means to provide conditions for more equitable modes of socioeconomic development across rural and marginal China.

AB  - Background: Environmental noise exposure is associated with a greater risk of hypertension, but the link with preeclampsia, a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, is unclear.
   Objectives: We sought to determine the relationship between environmental noise pollution and risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy.
   Methods: We analyzed a population-based cohort comprising 269,263 deliveries on the island of Montreal, Canada between 2000 and 2013. We obtained total environmental noise pollution measurements (LA(eq24), L-den, L-night) from land use regression models, and assigned noise levels to each woman based on the residential postal code. We computed odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association of noise with preeclampsia in mixed logistic regression models with participants as a random effect, and adjusted for air pollution, neighbourhood walkability, maternal age, parity, multiple pregnancy, comorbidity, socioeconomic deprivation, and year of delivery. We assessed whether noise exposure was more strongly associated with severe or early onset preeclampsia than mild or late onset preeclampsia.
   Results: Prevalence of preeclampsia was higher for women exposed to elevated environmental noise pollution levels (LA(eq24h) > 65 dB(A) = 37.9 per 1000 vs. <50 dB(A) = 27.9 per 1000). Compared with 50 dB(A), an LA(eq24h) of 65.0 dB(A) was not significantly associated the risk of preeclampsia (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.99-1.20). Associations were however present with severe (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.09-1.54) and early onset (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.20-2.43) preeclampsia, with results consistent across all noise indicators.

AB  - Introduction Performance during army loaded runs provides a synthetic indicator of a soldier's capacity to move while carrying loads and thereby remain able to execute a mission. The aim of this study was to estimate and compare the energy expenditure (EE) of army loaded runs, conducted in a field environment using laboratory-based equations and HR index (HRindex).
   Methods 45 Ranger recruits had HR monitored during three loaded runs (10, 15 and 20km) in full military equipment in the field environment. EE was calculated using reference equations (EE-Eq) and estimates of oxygen consumption based on HRindex (EE-HRindex). Correspondence between EE-Eq and EE-HRindex estimates was evaluated using a two-way analysis of variance, correlation test and Bland-Altman analysis.
   Results EE-Eq relative to time and weight was significantly higher for the 10km (0.1750.016) compared with 15 and 20km (0.163 +/- 0.016 and 0.160 +/- 0.013 kcal/kg/min, not different). The overall EE-Eq increased significantly with distance (1129 +/- 59, 1703 +/- 80 and 2250 +/- 115 kcal for 10, 15 and 20km). EE-Eq was not different from and highly correlated with EE-HRindex, with a small and non-significant bias and good precision between methods.
   Conclusions Our study provides the first comprehensive data on HR and EE during long-distance loaded army runs, in full combat equipment, in actual field conditions. Equation-based estimates of EE during these heavy-intensity activities were not significantly different from and highly correlated with HR-based estimates. This corroborates the general applicability of the predictive equations in the field environment. Furthermore, our study suggests that time-resolved HR-based estimates of EE during army runs can be used to evaluate for the effects of context specificity, individual variability and fatigue in movement economy.

AB  - Recently, it has been crucial to be able to detect and quantify small molecular targets simultaneously in biological samples. Herein, a simple and conventional double-T type microchip electrophoresis (MCE) based platform for the multiplex detection of quality indicator molecule targets in urine, using ampicillin (AMPI), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and estradiol (E2) as models, was developed. Several programmable hairpin probes (PHPs) were designed for detecting different targets and triggering isothermal polymerase-catalyzed target recycling (IPCTR) for signal amplification. Based on the target-responsive aptamer structure of PHP (Domain I), target recognition can induce PHP conformational transition and produce extension duplex DNA (dsDNA), assisted by primers & Bst polymerase. Afterwards, the target can be displaced to react with another PHP and initiate the next cycle. After several rounds of reaction, the dsDNA can be produced in large amounts by IPCTR. Three targets can be simultaneously converted to dsDNA fragments with different lengths, which can be separated and detected using MCE. Thus, a simple double-T type MCE based platform was successfully built for the homogeneous detection of multiplex targets in one channel. Under optimal conditions, the assay exhibited high throughput (48 samples per hour at most, not including reaction time) and sensitivity to three targets in urine with a detection limit of 1 nM (ATP), 0.05 nM (AMPI) and 0.1 nM (E2) respectively. The multiplex assay was successfully employed for the above three targets in several urine samples and combined the advantages of the high specificity of programmable hairpin probes, the excellent signal amplification of IPCTR, and the high through-put of MCE which can be employed for screening in biochemical analysis.

AB  - The influence of the Coriolis force on the Hornsund fjord environment (southern Spitsbergen) was investigated in the marine sedimentary record from the last century. Due to the influence of the rotational effects, Atlantic and Arctic Water enter the fjord along the southern shore and exit along the northern shore. Thus, the sedimentary record from the southern part reflects the large-scale hydrological processes associated with these oceanic water-masses, whereas the northern portion is affected by a combination of regional and local waters (including glacial meltwater). To assess the significance of the Coriolis force driven circulation in this environment over the last century, two short sediment cores were sampled from the southern and northern parts of the fjord. The cores were dated with Pb-210 and Cs-137 and analysed for grain size, ice-rafted debris, benthic foraminifera and stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta C-13). The influence of the Coriolis force was most apparent in the benthic foraminiferal record. The foraminiferal assemblage of the southern part of the fjord is characterized by markedly higher species diversity and a high percentage of Atlantic water species compared to the northern part. This pattern probably resulted from the lower level of environmental disturbance and the constant introduction of propagules and juveniles from offshore pools. The northern part of the fjord is characterized by more unstable environmental conditions due to the variable delivery of turbid meltwater, which is reflected in the low-diversity foraminiferal assemblage dominated by glaciomarine taxa and bottom current indicators. The influence of the Coriolis force on the sedimentary regime is less clear. As the geometry of many of the European Arctic fjords allows the rotational dynamics of water-masses, our results may serve as a reference for further studies on the influence of the Coriolis force-driven rotational dynamics on modern and past environments.

AB  - Understanding how animals experience stress in a laboratory environment is crucial for improving their welfare. Increasing numbers of fish are being used in scientific studies and further research is required to ensure appropriate conditions are used to promote good conduct and correct housing as well as guaranteeing scientifically valid results. As zebrafish are a gregarious species, social enrichment is particularly important, with individuals separated from a group experiencing isolation stress. The present study aimed to determine the effects of social context on recovery from common laboratory procedures. Additionally, we investigated whether the noninvasive measure of water-borne cortisol can be utilized to gauge physiological stress by comparing it to an invasive measure, whole-body cortisol concentration. Zebrafish (AB strain, male) were housed in differing social contexts and were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: undisturbed, anaesthetized and handled, or anaesthetized and fin clipped. Behavioural and physiological stress indicators were recorded before and after treatment. The results indicated social context, in the form of group housing, was important in enhancing recovery from welfare challenges in zebrafish, since group-housed fish resumed normal behaviours more quickly than pairs or individuals. Moreover, the strong correlation between water-borne and whole-body cortisol suggests that the noninvasive measure is an appropriate ethical alternative as an indicator of physiological stress. These findings represent an important refinement in reducing the severity of stress through housing zebrafish in their original groups and by adopting a noninvasive measure of cortisol which will act to reduce the numbers of individuals required for time series studies on physiological stress.

AB  - This study investigates factors associated with operational hygiene of milk, fish and meat producers in Austria using official control data collected in 2014 and 2015. The control inspections (n = 352) were routinely performed by the state authorities comprising a survey as well as food and environmental sampling. The survey, developed in cooperation with official control in advance, was divided in four modules dealing with specific aspects for the three mentioned food categories as "conditions of the goods and their handling" or "microbiological criteria". The operational hygiene inspection scores were concluded from numerical indicators for the status of operational hygiene and quality management. From 2014 to 2015, the operational hygiene inspection scores of milk and meat increased and of fish decreased. This indicates an improvement of hygienic management in Austrian milk and meat companies. One factor indicating the general fulfillment of the four survey modules was determined by factor analysis. The results confirm that companies with food rejections, meaning food samples deemed as unsafe (Regulation EC No 178/2002, 2002, article 14), wrong labelling (Regulation EC No 1169/2011, 2011) or insufficient hygiene (Regulation EC No 852/2004, 2004), received a lower score than companies without rejections. The design of a scoring tool for milk, fish and meat industries by using the survey in combination with routine data was achieved as objective of this study. Additionally, the analysis of sampling data on Listeria detection revealed a clear correlation: The detection of Listeria in companies without food rejections was statistically significantly lower than in companies with food rejections. In order to provide a better insight into the contamination status (e.g. Listeria) of high-risk companies the present study shows a method to combine results of a routine survey with available data from national control authorities.

AB  - The study, which represents an innovative scientific strategy to approach the study of natural radioactivity in terms of spatial and temporal variability, was aimed to characterize the background levels of natural radionuclides in soil and rock in the urban and peri-urban soil of a southern Italy area; to quantify their variations due to radionuclide bearing minerals and soil properties, taking into account nature and extent of seasonality influence. Its main novelty is taking into account the effect of climate in controlling natural gamma radioactivity as well as analysing soil radioactivity in terms of soil properties and pedogenetic processes. In different bedrocks and soils, activities of natural radionuclides (U-238, Th-232 (4) K) and total radioactivity were measured at 181 locations by means of scintillation gamma-ray spectrometry.
   In addition, selected rocks samples were collected and analysed, using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped with an Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS) and an X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD), to assess the main sources of radionuclides. The natural-gamma background is intimately related to differing petrologic features of crystalline source rocks and to peculiar pedogenetic features and processes. The radioactivity survey was conducted during two different seasons with marked changes in the main climatic characteristics, namely dry summer and moist winter, to evaluate possible effects of seasonal climatic variations and soil properties on radioactivity measurements. Seasonal variations of radionuclides activities show their peak values in summer. The activities of U-238, Th-232 and (4) K exhibit a positive correlation with the air temperature and are negatively correlated with precipitations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although it has probably been oxic and oligotrophic since its formation, human impacts have been changing lake conditions. In this paper, we discuss long-term changes in the chemistry of bottom water by compiling literature and through our own data over the last half-century. Long-term records show an increase in temperature, decrease in dissolved oxygen (DO), and increase in nutrients in bottom water. The stoichiometry among oxygen and nutrients indicates that changes are basically consistent with aerobic decomposition of organic matter. These changes are most likely the result of global warming and local eutrophication. Of particular note, yearly minimum DO concentrations <50 mu mol kg(-1) have started to occur frequently at similar to 90 m depth since 1999. Manganese (Mn) concentrations in bottom water are at their minimum during the turnover period and at a maximum during the late stratification period each year. Yearly minimum Mn concentration has been within a narrow range over the last 30 years (0.25 +/- 0.07 mu mol kg(-1), n = 12). However, abnormally high Mn concentrations (up to 9.3 mu mol kg(-1)) were observed in 2007, caused by reductive release of a substantial amount of Mn from suboxic sediments and subsequent oxidation in bottom water. The concentration of arsenic (As) has gradually increased over the last 20 years in a similar manner, with a homologous element of phosphorus (P), resulting in an observed range of 17-29 nmol kg(-1) in 2010. The accumulation rate was similar to 0.8 nmol kg(-1) year(-1) for As and similar to 6 nmol kg(-1) year(-1) for P.

AB  - Red mud was used in the supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) disposal of sewage sludge, not only as a neutralizer for acidic substances produced in situ, but also as a catalyst for decomposition of pollutants. With initial amounts of 2, 4, 6, and 8% of red mud, the total carbon (TC) value of the solid residue increased from 9.16 mg g(-1) to 14.88, 17.91, 20.11, and 26.14 mg g(-1), respectively. This resulted from the net increase in the inorganic carbon after capturing and absorption of CO2 produced in situ. The pH of the drained water was correspondingly increased from 5.16 to the range 7.67-7.82. This was mainly determined by the balance in the system of soluble inorganic salts (SIS)-remaining organic substances (RS)-CO2-H2O under certain conditions. However, the pH controlling system switched to SIS-CO2-H2O and RS-CO2-H2O as the operating temperature increased and the residence time increased, respectively. An increase in the TOC removal rate was observed by increasing the amount of red mud, and an outcome in excess of 99.3% could be achieved, although at a relatively low temperature of 400 degrees C by an initial concentration of 8% red mud. Combined with the rise of TOC removal rate after 2% red mud addition confirmed in the experiments with different operating temperatures and that with different residence time, the catalytic effect of red mud was strongly evidenced. It was probably attributable to the active components in red mud at the primary period, and to the fine-grained calcite that formed in situ, along with tricalcium aluminate, perovskite, hematite, and other inorganic salts at the subsequent period.

AB  - The present paper describes a novel and fairly inexpensive catalytic kinetic method for the determination of Pd2+ in the concentration range 17.71-177.14 ppb (ng mL(-1)). The method is based on the catalytic effect of Pd2+ on the substitution of cyanide by 4-cyanopyridine (4-CNpy) in hexacyanoferrate(II) in acidic media. The reaction was followed by measuring an increase in the initial rate of the indicator reaction with respect to the product, [Fe(CN)(5)(4-CNpy)](3-), formation at 477 nm. The effects of various parameters, such as pH and ionic strength of the reaction medium, concentration of the reactants and temperature, on the rate of the indicator reaction were studied to optimize the reaction conditions to achieve the highest sensitivity and to get lowest limit of detection of [Pd2+]. The fixed time procedure, as a measure of the initial rate, was followed to obtain a linear regression equation relating the absorbance and [Pd2+] in the range 17.71-177.14 ppb i.e. 1 x 10(-7) to 1 x 10(-6) mol L-1. The effects of the presence of various cations commonly associated with Pd2+ and some anions have also been investigated and discussed. The detection limit of the method was calculated to be 9 ppb. The maximum average error of the proposed method was quite low. The method was successfully applied for the determination of Pd2+ in synthetic and environmental water samples. The proposed method is selective, accurate and inexpensive compared to many other methods available in literature for Pd2+ determination. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Bacteroides ovatus, a member of the genus Bacteroides, is considered for use in molecular-based methods as a general fecal indicator. However, knowledge on its fate and persistence after a fecal contamination event remains limited. In this study, the persistence of B. ovatus was evaluated under simulated sunlight exposure and in conditions similar to freshwater and seawater. By combining propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) detection, the decay rates of B. ovatus were determined in the presence and absence of exogenous photosensitizers and in salinity up to 39.5 parts per thousand at 27 degrees C.
   Results: UVB was found to be important for B. ovatus decay, averaging a 4 log(10) of decay over 6 h of exposure without the presence of extracellular photosensitizers. The addition of NaNO2, an exogenous sensitizer producing hydroxyl radicals, did not significantly change the decay rate of B. ovatus in both low and high salinity water, while the exogenous sensitizer algae organic matter (AOM) slowed down the decay of B. ovatus in low salinity water. At seawater salinity, the decay rate of B. ovatus was slower than that in low salinity water, except when both NaNO2 and AOM were present.
   Conclusion: The results of laboratory experiments suggest that if B. ovatus is released into either freshwater or seawater environment in the evening, 50% of it may be intact by the next morning; if it is released at noon, only 50% may be intact after a mere 5 min of full spectrum irradiation on a clear day. This study provides a mechanistic understanding to some of the important environmental relevant factors that influenced the inactivation kinetics of B. ovatus in the presence of sunlight irradiation, and would facilitate the use of B. ovatus to indicate the occurrence of fecal contamination.

TI  - Radio-transparent multi-layer insulation for radiowave receivers
T2  - REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS
LA  - English
AB  - In the field of radiowave detection, enlarging the receiver aperture to enhance the amount of light detected is essential for greater scientific achievements. One challenge in using radio transmittable apertures is keeping the detectors cool. This is because transparency to thermal radiation above the radio frequency range increases the thermal load. In shielding from thermal radiation, a general strategy is to install thermal filters in the light path between aperture and detectors. However, there is difficulty in fabricating metal mesh filters of large diameters. It is also difficult to maintain large diameter absorptive-type filters in cold because of their limited thermal conductance. A technology that maintains cold conditions while allowing larger apertures has been long-awaited. We propose radio-transparent multi-layer insulation (RT-MLI) composed from a set of stacked insulating layers. The insulator is transparent to radio frequencies, but not transparent to infrared radiation. The basic idea for cooling is similar to conventional multi-layer insulation. It leads to a reduction in thermal radiation while maintaining a uniform surface temperature. The advantage of this technique over other filter types is that no thermal links are required. As insulator material, we used foamed polystyrene; its low index of refraction makes an anti-reflection coating unnecessary. We measured the basic performance of RT-MLI to confirm that thermal loads are lowered with more layers. We also confirmed that our RT-MLI has high transmittance to radiowaves, but blocks infrared radiation. For example, RT-MLI with 12 layers has a transmittance greater than 95% (lower than 1%) below 200 GHz (above 4 THz). We demonstrated its effects in a system with absorptive-type filters, where aperture diameters were 200 mm. Low temperatures were successfully maintained for the filters. We conclude that this technology significantly enhances the cooling of radiowave receivers, and is particularly suitable for large-aperture systems. This technology is expected to be applicable to various fields, including radio astronomy, geo-environmental assessment, and radar systems. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB  - While conditions in shallow-water and deep-sea environments differ markedly, it remains unclear how eurybathic species adapt their life histories to cope with these changes. The present study compared indicators of maternal reproductive investment of three common echinoderms collected shallower than 20 m and deeper than 850 m: Cucumaria frondosa (Holothuroidea), Solaster endeca and Henricia sanguinolenta (Asteroidea). Depth-specific and species-specific differences were found in gonad indices (GI), potential fecundity, oocyte size frequency, as well as lipid classes and fatty acids measured in gonad tissue and oocytes. The asteroids, S. endeca and H. sanguinolenta, exemplified the interspecific trade-off between size and number of oocytes: the former had fewer larger oocytes than the latter, with higher total lipid proportions in them. However, intraspecifically, larger oocytes found in deep specimens of S. endeca did not translate into lower fecundity but rather into a seemingly higher GI, indicating greater investment per oocyte without reducing fecundity. Oocytes were absent in specimens of C frondosa sampled in deep water, suggesting delayed or impaired maturation at the limit of their depth tolerance. Analysis of S. endeca sterol proportions in gonads and oocytes across depths showed higher sterol input into oocytes in females from the deep. Gonads of S. endeca and H. sanguinolenta contained similar essential fatty acids, but showed significant differences in major fatty acids and some of the less dominant ones, indicating diet specificities. Analyses within S. endeca showed evidence of similar feeding mode (carnivory) at both depths, but suggested shifts in the diet or synthesis of fatty acids, presumably reflecting differences in available food sources and/or adaptations to their respective environments.

AB  - Marine hypersaline ponds on Anegada, British Virgin Islands contain stratigraphic evidence (Shell and Sand Sheet) of a A.D. 1650-1800 overwash event that could have formed through a hurricane or tsunami. Candidates for the deposit include far-field (e.g. 1755 Lisbon tsunami) and local Puerto Rico Trench events (e.g. 1690), but hurricanes cannot be ignored. The goal of this study is to provide additional information to assess the origin of the deposit by examining the taphonomic characters of Homotrema rubrum, a common encrusting foraminifer in Caribbean reef settings. Surface samples (n = 12) from major sub-environments (reef-flat, beach, storm wrack, and dune) and pond sections (n = 6; 20-80 cm thick) are analyzed for their Homotrema concentration (specimens/cm(3)) and taphonomic character. Particle-size analysis was conducted on the same sections and samples. Highly Preserved (red colored, angular, intact chambers) Homotrema dominate the beach, storm wrack, and reef-flat deposits relative to the dune sand, but the beach and storm wrack contain the largest specimens. The Shell and Sand Sheet in the pond has Highly Preserved and abundant Homotrema (specimens/cm(3)) versus other sedimentary units in the ponds (e.g. Mud Cap and Shelly Mud). Its taphonomic character is most similar (test size and condition) to the storm wrack deposit on the beach indicating an outside provenance for the sand. Concentration of Homotrema in the Shell and Sand Sheet declined southward indicating a northerly reef-flat provenance for the overwash, although it does not preclude a southern inundation as well. It is unclear whether Homotrema individuals originated from the reef itself or were eroded from older beach ridge deposits during the overwash event. Conclusions from Homotrema taphonomic analysis were limited by the lack of comparative data from known hurricane and tsunami deposits in other Caribbean regions.

AB  - Appropriate stress responses rely on a finely-tuned neuronal balance that must continually adapt to a frequently changing external environment. Alterations in this balance can result in susceptibility to a variety of stress-related disorders, as well as exacerbate already existing conditions. We have previously reported that rat pups injected with a very low dose (20 mu g/kg) of domoic acid during the second postnatal week of life display low-grade seizure behaviours when challenged with stressful tasks, and also exhibit a variety of structural and functional changes similar to those seen in temporal lobe epilepsy. The current study was designed to investigate markers of altered stress-response in this model. Following neonatal treatment, adult rats were tested in the elevated plus maze, as well as two water maze tasks, both of which involved a platform reversal challenge. Results indicated a modified behavioural stress/anxiety response, increased perseveration, and alterations in search strategy for all domoate-treated rats, as well as male-specific deficits in cognitive flexibility. In addition, 80% of treated males and 20% of treated females exhibited seizure behaviour. Western blot analysis revealed male-only increases in adrenergic receptor (alpha 2a and alpha 2c) and mineralocorticoid receptor expression, and subtle sex-specific changes in glucocorticoid receptor expression, but no differences in corticotropin-releasing factor receptors I/II, or dopamine D2 receptor expression. A significant decrease in glucocorticoid:mineralocorticoid ratio was also noted. We conclude that early exposure to DOM alters central mechanisms underlying stress response, and that this model may be valuable for investigating the connection between stress and neurological disorders.

AB  - This study presents changes in diatom flora assemblage composition, TOC, TOC/N and biogenic opal in a 450 cm core of Lake Panch Pokhari, Central Nepal (4,050 m asl), indicating Late Quaternary environmental fluctuations. Four Diatom Zones (DZ) were detected, with two major changes. The first one was found in similar to 430 cm depth (similar to 14.8 cal. kyr BP), where the original flora characterized by Navicula digitulus Hustedt, Pinnularia rhombarea Krammer, P. aff. viridiformis var. minor Krammer, Encyonema silesiacum (Bleisch) D. G. Mann, Cymbopleura naviculiformis (Auerswald) Krammer and Nitzschia sp. was fully replaced by an assemblage consisting of Aulacoseira alpigena (Grunow) Krammer, Diatoma hyemalis (Roth) Heib., Tabellaria flocculosa (Ehrenberg) Kutzing, Brachysira brebissonii Ross and Pinnularia subgibba Krammer, creating a stable diatom assemblage for similar to 8 kyr (DZ3). The second change was found at similar to 70 cm (similar to 2.1 cal. kyr BP) when increased nutrient inputs lead to emergence of new taxa such as Fragilaria construens var. subsalina Hustedt, F. tenera (W. Smith) Lange-Bertalot, Eunotia cf. pseudopapilio Lange-Bertalot and M. Norpel-Schempp and Gomphonema subclavatum Grunow. In order to evaluate the past environmental conditions in the Lake Panch Pokhari, the detected diatom taxa were subjected to analyses of their autecological preferences and dominance within the specific assemblage. We also assumed that TOC/N ratios > 10 indicate accelerated erosion due to the strengthening of the Summer Monsoon starting at similar to 14.8 and between 13.7 and 12.8 cal. kyr BP. Monsoon intensity was most pronounced during the Early Holocene and at the beginning of the Late Holocene. The fluctuations of TOC and TOC/N in the Late Glacial sediments seem to correlate temporally and climatically with oscillations in the Northern Atlantic region.

AB  - In many cases, the designation of Protected Areas (PM) is not based on biological information, particularly in tropical regions where such information is generally lacking. Thus it is unclear whether tropical PM are well-placed for conserving biodiversity currently, or under future climate change. We used reserve-design software ('Zonation') to investigate current and future conservation value of PM of Thailand (N = 187 PM, covering similar to 20% of Thailand) in relation to forest-cover and butterfly diversity. Currently, PAs are about 2 degrees C cooler than non-PM because PM tend to occur at higher elevation (66% of land above 1000 m is protected compared with only 6% below 250 m). Temperature is predicted to increase in Thailand in future, but PM are predicted to remain similar to 2 degrees C cooler than non-PM in future. We obtained modelled distribution data for 161 butterfly species (similar to 12% of national butterfly fauna), and used Zonation to rank areas (similar to 1 km(2) grid resolution) based on species richness, complementarity, and forest cover. The conservation value of PM was approximately twice that of non-PA areas, although many highly-ranked areas are not currently protected. The species richness of PM was projected to decline by similar to 30% in future, but the relative conservation rankings of individual PM were projected to change very little. The preponderance of PM in montane regions makes them well-placed to support forest species shifting from areas at lower elevation that become climatically unsuitable in future. By contrast, the conservation value of low-elevation PM may decline in future if climate conditions become unsuitable for species. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The biology of the Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus) has been the subject of intense scientific investigation. This is primarily due to the rapid decline of population size in the western part of the species' range since the 1970s and the subsequent Threatened and Endangered species listings that had direct impact on the management of one of the world's largest fisheries. The Steller sea lion has emerged as an indicator species representing the environmental health of the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea. In this study, to better understand the historical processes that have culminated in the extant populations of E. jubatus, a large genetic data set consisting of 3 mitochondrial regions for >1,000 individuals was analyzed from multiple phylogeographic and demographic perspectives. The results describe the role of climate change in shaping the population structure of E. jubatus. Climatically associated historical processes apparently involved differential demographic responses to ice ages (and putative glacial vicariance) dependent on population size. Ice ages during times of small effective population size promoted restricted gene flow and fragmentation, and ice ages occurring during times of large population size promoted gene flow and dispersal. These results illustrate that effective population size has a profound effect on how species respond to climate change, an observation with obvious implications for large mammals and endangered species under the present conditions of imminent anthropogenically caused climate change. In addition, the results confirm previous observations of strongly biased historic and contemporary gene flow involving dispersal from west to east. Furthermore, phylogenetic patterns in combination with available fossil data suggest the potential of an Asian origin of E. jubatus. The results of this study provide a detailed scenario for the history that has shaped contemporary populations of E. jubatus.

AB  - A 61-cm core was obtained from 4 m below the water table in Cenote Aktun Ha, on the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. The cenote is 8.6 km from the Caribbean coast and its formation and evolution have been largely affected by sea-level change. The base of the core dates to 6,940-6,740 cal year BP and overlying sediments were deposited rapidly over the subsequent similar to 200 years. The pollen record shows that the cenote evolved from a marsh dominated by red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) and fern (Polypodiaceae) to an open-water system. These vegetation changes were controlled by water level and salinity and are thus useful indicators of past sea level. At the base, the delta C-13(org) isotopic ratios reveal the influence of terrestrial vegetation (-29aEuro degrees VPDB), but shift to more negative values up-core (-33aEuro degrees), indicating an influence from particulate matter in the flooded cenote pool. Although microfossil populations were nearly absent through most of the core, the microfossil assemblage in the upper 6 cm of the core is dominated by the juvenile foraminifer Ammonia tepida and the thecamoebian genus Centropyxis. These populations indicate open-water conditions in the cenote and a major environmental shift around 6,600 cal year BP, which is related to sea-level rise in the Caribbean basin. These data fit well with previously established sea-level curves for the Caribbean Sea. Our reconstruction of the environmental history of Cenote Aktun Ha helps elucidate the floral and hydrological history of the region, and highlights the utility of cenote sediments for studying the Holocene sea-level history of the Caribbean Sea.

AB  - Organic matter occurring in Lower Palaeozoic rocks of variable lithology was investigated for its origin, depositional environment and thermal maturity. Samples from nine boreholes located in the Polish part of the Peribaltic Syneclise were collected for performing Rock-Eval Analysis, palynological investigation for Thermal Alteration Index (TAI), solvent extraction, preparative layer chromatography (PLC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of aliphatic and aromatic compound fractions. It was found that kerogen belongs to either type I or commonly, to type It. It derives from variable, planktonic and planktonic-bacterial primary organic matter deposited in dysoxic environments in the eastern part of the Syneclise and in anoxic/suboxic conditions in the western and central parts. Organic matter is in the thermal evolution stage from late diagenesis to advanced metagenesis. Correlation of biomarker parameters, TAI and Rock-Eval results show that the thermal maturity of organic matter falls into three regional groups, increasing from the north-east to the south-west along the crystalline basement of the Eastern European Platform. The organic matter contained in Ordovician and Cambrian sediments of the western part of the Syneclise is overmature, reaching metagenesis. This is most probably related to the activity of the Teisseyre-Tornquist Zone, where the Baltica and Eastern Avalonia paleocontinents collided during the Late Ordovician. It is also reflected in the profiles by elevated values of aromatic hydrocarbon and sulphur compound parameters, which show the highest levels of thermal maturity for organic matter present in the sediments of the Ordovician and Lower Silurian. Local influence of igneous intrusions oil organic matter is also visible in changes in thermal maturity values at the direct contact with diabase dykes.

AB  - The 100-m thick Middle Miocene Yallourn brown coal seam was the last of the major Latrobe Valley Group seams to form in the Gippsland Basin (southeastern Australia) and the final major coal to form in Australia. Coal deposition coincided with the Middle Miocene climatic optimum. During this warm period of relatively high sea-levels, high water tables and relatively high subsidence rates, a 565 km(2) area of alternating eutrophic and ombrogenous peat swamp developed at the western end of the Latrobe Valley to form the Yallourn Seam. Stratigraphic units of the seam contain a high sclerophyll plant component and abundant charcoal, suggesting seasonal dry periods alternated with wet warm conditions characterised by abundant rushes and dense kauri forests. Iron content in parts of the Yallourn Seam is relatively high, and a strong correlation exists between the iron distribution and the abundance of proteoid roots (mainly Proteaceae) - an indicator of seasonal dry periods. The contemporaneous carbonates of the Wuk Wuk Mart were deposited in a high-productivity, upwelling, warmer water (subtropical) environment.
   A new carbon isotope profile at 1 in intervals through the Yallourn Seam shows a poor relationship between delta C-13 isotopes and coal colour, but some correlation with Gymnosperm abundance. The delta C-13 record also correlates well with long-term secular changes in climate, the presence of global carbon maxima CM2-CM4, and with the deep-sea delta C-13 marine organic record.
   Thick coal steam, development ended near the end of the Middle Miocene climatic optimum. The termination of coal seam deposition in Latrobe Valley was primarily the result of tectonic compression, uplift and development of adjacent highland relief, and erosion at the end of the Miocene.

AB  - Occupational exposure to cadmium has for long been associated with renal tubular cell dysfunction, osteomalacia with osteoporosis, hypercalciuria and renal stone formation. High environmental exposure in Japan resulting from a stable diet of cadmium contaminated rice caused itai-itai disease, fractures occurring mainly in elderly multiparous women, with a form of osteomalacia, osteoporosis and renal dysfunction.
   More recently a population based study in Europe, in the vicinity of zinc smelters has shown that low to moderate exposure to cadmium, with a mean urinary excretion of cadmium of the order of 1 mug/g creatinine has been associated with a decrease in bone density, an increased risk of bone fractures in women and of height loss in men. In a population-based study of residents near a cadmium smelter in China, forearm bone density was shown to decrease linearly with age and urinary cadmium in both sexes, suggesting a dose effect relationship between cadmium dose and bone mineral density. A marked increase in the prevalence of fractures was shown in the cadmium-polluted area in both sexes. Concentrations of cadmium in blood and urine were taken as exposure biomarkers, and beta(2)-microglobulin, retinol binding protein and albumin as biomarkers of effect. A marked dose response relationship between these indicators of exposure and effect was shown.
   Hypercalciuria, which may progress to osteoporosis, has been taken as a sensitive renal-tubular biomarker of a low level of cadmium exposure. Cadmium may also act directly on bone. Animal studies have shown cadmium to stimulate the formation and activity of osteoclasts, breaking down the collagen matrix in bone.
   Osteoporosis is the main cause of fracures in post-menopausal women, a common occurrence worldwide, giving rise to disability and a high cost to health services. The identification of cadmium, an environmental pollutant, as one causal factor is highly significant in helping to control the incidence of this complex condition.

AB  - The conspicuous shifts in summertime values of common measures of water qualify that have persisted for 10 years (1993 to 2002) in the Seneca River, New York, as a result of the zebra mussel invasion are documented. Resolution of patterns in time and space is supported by water quality monitoring that extends back to the late 1970s. Patterns are evaluated to describe the stability of impacts and quantify metabolic activity of the invader. The water quality impacts that have persisted unabated for 10 years since the invasion are the most severe documented for a river in North America. Changes in summer median conditions since the invasion include: (1) a 16-fold decrease in chlorophyll concentration (Chl), (2) a 2.5-fold increase in Secchi disc transparency, (3) a 17-fold increase in soluble reactive phosphorus concentration, (4) a 3.7-fold increase in total ammonia concentration, (5) a greater than 25 percent decrease in dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, and (6) a decrease in pH of 0.55 units. The strength of these signatures has been driven by anthropogenic influences that include upstream nutrient loading and morphometric modifications of the river, and the functioning of Cross Lake, through which the river flows. This hypereutrophic lake sustains dense zebra mussel populations and related water quality impacts in the river downstream of the lake outflow by acting as a source of veligers and suitable food for this bivalve. Evidence is presented that levels of metabolic activity of the zebra mussel in this river have been resource limited, manifested through increased consumption of Chl and DO with increased delivery of these constituents in the lake's outflow.

AB  - Black bedded, nodular, and lenticular chert and silicified parts of stromatolites from the approximately 1 400 - 1 600 million year-old Gaoyuzhuang Formation, North China, contain remark-ably well prep served microflora composed of diverse prokaryotic and possible eukaryotic microbes. Macroscopic algae have also been found. This Formation provides important paleobiological information from which to assess status of Mesoproterozoic life, and to evaluate paleoenvironmental conditions and pre-Phanerozoic biostratigraphy. The Gaoyuzhuang Formation has yielded over 100 taxa described by over 10 investigators. Most of the microbial taxa can be divided into three different assemblages according to their paleobiological and paleoenvironmental characteristics. I. The oscillatoriacean/chroococcacean assemblage which occurs in the first member of the Formation and this is interpreted to represent an assemblage from shallow water mat-building and mat-dwelling taxa with some possible planktonic taxa; 2. the nostocacean assemblage found only in the second member, and includes benthic mat-building or mat-dwelling taxa; and 3. the chroococcacean assemblage of the fourth member, which represents intertidal to supratidal mat-building and allochthonous taxa. Proterozoic microfossils found in chert, especially cyanobacteria, are possibly more valuable as paleoenvironmental indicators than as chronostratigraphic tools because of their morphological conservation, although trends in diversity appear to exist for cyanobacteria in the Proterozoic. The general characteristics of Gaoyuzhuang microfossils, and the fact that most nostocacean chains occur and are. preserved with the chain perpendicular to bedding indicate that: (1) the individual size of Gaoyuzhuang microfossils are part of a general trend of increase with time; (2) Gaoyuzhuang deposits are possibly in a fresh water environment and the rate of sedimentation might be equal to or less than the microbial growth rate; (3) the sedimentary model of Gaoyuzhuang might be from intertidal to subtidal or deep sea, and then to intertidal or supratidal; and (4) the eukaryotic organisms had densely occurred when Gaoyuzhuang Formation deposited.

AB  - Aerosol samples were collected in 1994 in Singapore on two occasions: once in June during the normal meteorological conditions and later in October during a long haze period caused by the heavy forest fire in Indonesia, Filtration and impaction collection methods were used simultaneously so that detailed elemental analysis of bulk as well as of different size fractions could be performed. Accelerator based nuclear analytical techniques such as Particle Induced X-Ray Emission (PIXE), Rutherford Backscattering (RES) and Nuclear Microscopy (NM) were used for analysis. These techniques are fast, truly multielemental and perfectly suited for routine analysis of a large number of aerosol samples. Typically all samples were analysed for the following 24 elements: Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V, Mn, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Br, Rb, Sr and Pb. Detection limits for bulk analysis were generally below ng/m(3) and for single particle analysis absolute detectable mass was approximately 10(-17) g. Additionally, trace elements such as Cd, Sn, Sb and Pa whose characteristic X-ray lines were normally ''obscured'' by the lines of other more abundant elements, were detected when analysing by nuclear microscope in single particle mode.
   Judging by the average concentrations of lead and sulphur which are good indicators of industrial component of air pollution the situation in Singapore is satisfactory. Pb was typically found in concentrations of 5 to 50 ng/m(3) and sulphur in concentrations of 1 to 2 mu g/m(3). These concentrations are well below limits set by the World Health Organisation (1500 ng/m(3) and 40 mu g/m(3), respectively). On the other hand during the haze period the average concentrations of elements like S, K, Ti, V, Mn, Ni, As and Pb were found to be 3 to 6 times higher than usual. Results are presented and discussed.

AB  - The upper pressure limit of pyrophyllite is given by the equilibria (i) pyrophyllite = diaspore + quartz and (ii) pyrophyllite = diaspore + coesite. High-P experimental investigations carried out to locate equilibrium (i) yield brackets between 497 degrees C/24.8 kbar and 535 degrees C/25.1 kbar, and between 500 degrees C/23 kbar and 540 degrees C/23 kbar. Equilibrium (ii) was bracketed at 550 degrees C between 26.0 and 28.3 kbar. In the experimental P-T range, equilibria (i) and (ii) are metastable with respect to kyanite. A stable P-T grid is calculated using thermodynamic data derived under consideration of the present experimental results. According to these data, the lower pressure limit of the assemblage diaspore + quartz according to equilibrium (i) range from about 12 kbar/300 degrees C to 20 kbar/430 degrees C (in the presence of pure water). The upper stability of diaspore + quartz is limited by the reaction diaspore + quartz = kyanite + H2O at about 450 degrees C (nearly independent of pressure) and, to higher pressure, by the quartz = coesite transition. Equilibrium (ii) is metastable over the whole P-T range.
   Natural occurrences of the diaspore-quartz assemblage in metamorphic rocks in Sulawesi, New Caledonia, Amorgos and the Vanoise are characterized by minerals indicative of high-P such as ferromagnesiocarpholite, glaucophane, sodic pyroxene and lawsonite. The metamorphic P-T conditions of these rocks are estimated to be in the range 300-400 degrees C, >8 kbar. These data are compatible with the derived P-T stability field of the diaspore + quartz assemblage. We conclude that, in metamorphic rocks, diaspore + quartz is, as ferrocarpholite, an indicator for unusual low-T/very high-P settings.

AB  - This paper is based upon work undertaken within contract EPOC-CT9000015, in the Environment Programme (Third Framework), Commission of European Communities, Brussels.
   Late Holocene (post c.4000 BP) stratigraphies from beach-barrier-lagoon environments are presented from five locations between northwest Spain (Galicia) and western Ireland. These meso- to macrotidal coasts are conditioned by high energy waves and storms. As such the coasts are sensitive potentially to the future impacts of rising sea-level and to climate-led controls on coastal behaviour. Consequently an objective of this study has been to establish the pattern of physical environmental changes recorded here, as a basis for helping assess the possible effects of future alterations in these coastal systems. The stratigraphies studied commonly show the occurrence of interleaved inorganic and organic sediments. The sedimentary sequences together evidence the importance of sand movements, alternating irregularly with periods of vegetation growth and relative environmental stability. Mechanisms of onshore sediment transfer appear to be linked to aeolian action, possibly most associated with storms, and to barrier over-washing. Repeated periods of sand movement are recorded particularly in barrier environments from about the fifteenth century AD onward. The nineteenth century to the present day also shows strong human influences upon coastal changes. Rates of relative sea-level rise on some coasts are placed at similar to 0.5-0.6mm yr(-1) post c.2000 BP. Studies indicate that coastal barriers in Galicia appear to have been relatively stable, or even to have prograded, during this period. In Brittany and western Ireland similar systems record persistent retreat and barrier breakdown.

T2  - ZEITSCHRIFT FUR GEOMORPHOLOGIE
LA  - German
AB  - The damp endoreic basins of the coastline of the western low Provence formed the sedimentary geosystems highly damaged by an early and important human occupation. Their hydrological variations free of these of the sea-level, depend on the local climatic evaluation of which they are a good indicatory. The sedimentological analysis of a sample carried out of one of then (Etang du Pourra) is confronted with paleobotanical informations and with the geomorphical investigation in others basins and their basin-versants. A rich archeological documentation and three isotopic datings back up the chronostratigraphic argument.
   The surroundings seem to have been early stabilized as far back as the tardiglacial interstage, the settings of which are capped with a brown soil inclosing altered smectites. The late Dryas does not seem to suspend this evolution. The Holocene is characterized by a damp climatic fluctuation at the starting Subboreal, that induces a raising of sheets of water, and then by a dryer period between Bronze Age and Middle Ages.
   The effects of anthropization upon morphogenesis depend at the same time on climatic changes and conditions of ground filling. Two unequally important erosive crises are separated by a two or three millenaries morphogenic interval. They are characterized, upon slopes and talwegs, by alluval detritics silts enriched in altered minerals from scouring of pedological toppings. The first erosive crise, during last Neolithic, shows the convergence of reclaiming extent and new spell of dampness. It ends with a vertic evolution, connected with the highly swampy level in hydromorphic low zone. Between Bronze Age and Roman times, the environment become steady in spite of an increasing anthropization: the dryer climatic context and protecting cultural practices alter the morphodynamic process; fossilized farmings terraces have been discovered, The post-antic period coincides with an erosive crise of first importance, generating of thick colluvial deposits upon slopes. The investigation in that area shows then there are intricate connections of causality between anthropization, the history of climate and the starting of erosive crises.

AB  - Perennial species have evolved several strategies to survive fire, with resprouters and seeders forming two major categories. Gompholobium marginatum is a herbaceous seeder legume occurring in the Western Australian jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata) forest which since 1961 has been subjected to burns every sixth year. Such frequent fires potentially endanger the survival of seeder species like G. marginatum, whose establishment and reproductive achievement is, therefore, the subject of this study. Sexual reproduction commenced in the second growing season and reached peak reproductive capacity (136 ovules per plant) and success (38 seeds per plant) in the 3rd year of growth. This ovule production represented more than 30% of the total reproductive potential (455 ovules per plant) recorded during the normally observed 6-year life span. Maturation of several generations of reproductive units occurred consecutively over 5 months with approximately 75% of initiated flowers setting fruit. Almost 30% of all initiated ovules, i.e. 132, matured to seeds during 6 years of undisturbed growth. P and N emerged as elements most limiting to plant growth and reproduction and proved to be the best indicators of reproductive costs. In contrast to many other seeder species, the phenorythmics of G. marginatum is compatible with a high fire frequency. While its intrinsically low growth rate may be viewed as a factor responsible for poor competitiveness with cohabiting understorey species, the high investment in early reproduction at the expense of vegetative growth can be interpreted as an evolved response to the opening of the habitat after fire. Whether the tendency to senescence of plants older than 3 years has its origin mainly in unfavorable environmental conditions (e.g. canopy closure, water or nutrient competition) or in a genetically induced decline in fecundity remains to be determined.

AB  - The objective of present work is to substantiate the use of tools for strategic analysis in order to develop a strategy for the country's food security under current conditions and to devise the author's original technique to perform strategic analysis of food security using a SWOT-analysis. The methodology of the study. The article substantiates the need for strategic planning of food security. The author considers stages in strategic planning and explains the importance of the stage of strategic analysis of the country's food security. It is proposed to apply a SWOT-analysis when running a strategic analysis of food security. The study is based on the system of indicators and characteristics of the country's economy, agricultural sector, market trends, material-technical, financial, human resources, which are essential to obtain an objective assessment of the impact of trends and factors on food security, and in order to further develop the procedure for conducting a strategic analysis of the country's food security. Results of the study. The procedure for strategic analysis of food security is developed based on the tool of a SWOT-analysis, which implies three stages: a strategic analysis of weaknesses and strengths, opportunities and threats; construction of the matrix of weaknesses and strengths, opportunities, and threats (SWOT-analysis matrix); formation of the food security strategy based on the SWOT-analysis matrix. A list of characteristics was compiled in order to conduct a strategic analysis of food security and to categorize them as strengths or weaknesses, threats, and opportunities. The characteristics are systemized into strategic groups: production, market; resources; consumption: this is necessary for the objective establishing of strategic directions, responsible performers, allocation of resources, and effective control, for the purpose of further development and implementation of the strategy. A strategic analysis of food security consists of two blocks: the analyses of the external and internal environment. It is proposed, in order to improve the validity of the strategic analysis, to evaluate strengths and weaknesses, threats, and opportunities at the time of analysis, as well as to explore the trends of their change in dynamics. For this purpose, the author proposed establishing the persistence of the identified strengths, weaknesses, threats, and opportunities. To accomplish it, the persistent strengths of possibilities include, in the author's opinion, characteristics with a positive dynamic over the examined period while the persistent weaknesses and threats include, accordingly, those with a negative dynamic. Practical implications. Result of the present research is the advanced matrix of a SWOT-analysis of food security, which complements traditional method with the grouping according to the basic strategic groups of food security (production, market, resources, consumption), as well as the level of persistence of strengths and weaknesses, threats and opportunities, depending on the dynamics of the proposed characteristics. The main practical outcome of the developed procedure is the list of strategic recommendations based on the identified strengths and weaknesses, threats and opportunities of food security, depending on the level of their persistence. The value and originality of the scientific results are in that as a result of the proposed procedure, there will be built an effective instrument for carrying out a strategic analysis of the country's food security.
   Based on the strategic analysis of the persistent strengths, the author identified the main com-petitive advantages of the country's food security, which are to be strengthened, while implementing supporting strategic measures and control. It is established that the non-persistent strengths of food security of Ukraine would require a more effective management in comparison with those persistent, as well as development of an efficient mechanism of government support and regulation. Minimization of the impact of persistent weaknesses on the level of food security and their transformation into strengths should be carried out under the condition of reforming the social policy of the state and creating a system of the state support for the agricultural sector. The task on resolving the problems associated with the impact of threats in accordance with the level of their persistence has to be dealt with gradually, with the further development of strategic measures to neutralize and protect food security and the factors that affect it, in particular, to utilize the potential of external opportunities.

AB  - The release of airborne hazardous substances in the urban roughness sublayer (RSL) is a risk to human health. The atmospheric dispersion of these materials should be contained to mitigate their adverse consequences. This study investigates the effects of atmospheric stability on the air, heat, and pollutant transport within RSL by a validated 3-D RANS code. A building morphology with height variance is proposed for better representing the real urban environment and characterizing the complex interactions between the roughness elements and the flow regimes. The thermal stratification stability test subject to the ground-inflow temperature difference is extended to span from strongly unstable to moderately stable. The quantitative indicators, including air exchange rate, heat removal rate, pollutant removal rate, heat transfer coefficient, and pollutant transfer coefficient, are introduced and analyzed. The correlations between indicators and thermal stabilities are established, which provides explicit expressions to describe the influence of the changing bulk Richardson number (Rb). Results show that the design of height variance elements enables a stronger lateral momentum towards the target street canyon, which suppresses the spanwise dispersion of pollutants. The discussions upon heat and pollutant transport based on stability categories show a high Rb-dependence of heat/mass transfer efficiency. The stability threshold is demonstrated to be Rb approximate to 0.7, where the flow speed near the ground approaches zero. As a result, the high temperature gradient is formed and acts as positive feedback to facilitate a more stratified condition. The accurate and rational correlations obtained in this study will save the computational cost considerably for further research. Also, the available results will be a reference for environmentally friendly designs. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Olive orchards represent a key agricultural system with high economic and environmental prominence. Expected future climate tendencies over the Mediterranean could threaten the sustainability of such strategic tree crop. This study evaluates the productive and environmental performance of olive orchards under different climate change scenarios and management strategies across the main olive-farming regions over southern Europe using the process-based model OliveCan. Simulations were performed for low density LD (100 trees ha-1), high density HD (400 trees ha-1) and super high density SHD (1650 trees ha-1) olive orchards over baseline period (19802010) and future scenarios (2041-2070 and 2071-2100 for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Results showed that the future increase in CO2 concentration may compensate the negative effects of higher evaporative demand and diminished water supply resulting in an enhancement of water use efficiency and carbon capture potential in olive orchards. Irrigation requirement for the maximum productivity are expected to increase by 5-27%. Moreover, rainfed low density orchards will be the most vulnerable to expected climate changes, in particular in the driest areas. In fact, a decrease in yield up to 28 % with an increase in its interannual variability of 20 % is expected over the Iberian Peninsula while yield increased up to 26 % over the centre of the Mediterranean. Deficit irrigation and intensification will improve olive orchard productivity and carbon sequestration capacity. Besides, the decrease in winter chilling is not expected to be enough to produce significant flowering anomalies or failures over the study area. Even though findings of this research showed that olive orchards may benefit from future conditions, assessment of management alternatives at local scale will be a must for a better adaptability of olive orchards.

AB  - Growing evidence suggests that constraints to the availability and quality of tree seed can undermine the success of forest and landscape restoration efforts and the delivery of associated benefits such as mitigating climate change and halting biodiversity loss. Past experiences to promote tree seed supply have frequently shown limited outcomes over time, partly because of unexpected, deleterious dynamics that emerged from the interventions themselves. In this study, we used a dynamic system approach to understand the interrelated problems that constrain the supply of good quality and site-adapted tree seeds to meet smallholders' and other stakeholders' demand in Burkina Faso and the Philippines, and to identify leverage points for intervention. Causal loop diagrams were constructed for each country, based on a framework of indicators of effective tree seed supply systems, literature review, semistructured interviews, and expert validation. The diagrams illustrate the complex interactions between planned interventions and their expected and unexpected effects that frequently lead to adverse outcomes. For example, the high turnover of forestry officers in municipalities to combat corruption in Burkina Faso combined with limited resources to support smallholders undermined the officers' ability to strengthen local capacities in seedling production and sustainable forest management. In the Philippines, the imposition of rigid requirements for seedling survival rates as a condition for funding, in the absence of adequate time and resources for the production of quality seedlings and monitoring, resulted in exaggerated survival rates during reporting, which in turn hampered the detection and addressing of shortcomings. A dynamic system approach can help stakeholders recognize the broader impacts of their actions and jointly identify appropriate interventions, from developing more context-specific approaches to reconsidering investment criteria to balance benefits.

AB  - Enhanced coagulation can be an effective way to reduce disinfection by-product (DBP) precursor concentrations. Where turbidity is not extremely high, the natural organic matter concentration evaluated by total or dissolved organic carbon concentration or UV absorbance is known to be the most important factor for determining the adequate coagulant dose. Yet, treatment plant operators are often faced with difficult decisions when it comes to coagulant dosages: Should coagulation efforts and coagulant doses be consistent year-round when water quality changes seasonally? Should the coagulant dose be increased when DBP standards are not met, or has the maximum removal of DBP precursors been reached? The objective and novelty of this study is to revisit the concept of enhanced coagulation and to determine optimal coagulation guidelines based not just on the removal of common indicators such as DOC but on the removal of actual DBP precursors. Jar-tests (for DBP precursor removal evaluation) using alum were conducted under a range of conditions on 8 different natural/synthetic waters with varying physicochemical characteristics for subsequent chlorination over 48 h (for DBP formation potential). A coagulant-dose adjustment strategy based on UV254 monitoring was also implemented at a full-scale facility. Results show that, for the wide range of waters tested, an alum/UV254 stoichiometric dose of 180 +/- 25 mg alum cm/L represents a point of diminishing return (i.e. it maximises DBP precursor removal). Another original result of this work is that this dose is applicable and equally efficient in all seasons, despite changes in water quality. For utilities with similar raw waters, this means that coagulation efforts should be proportional to the UV254 of the raw water, regardless of the season. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This contribution provides better insights in the water relations and the physiological traits of four commercial poplar genotypes of different genetic background, 'Bakan', 'Oudenberg', 'Koster' and 'Grimminge'. The main continuous (nondestructive and providing continuous and automated data records) and discontinuous (destructive and not allowing automation) plant water status (PWS) indicators were monitored at a multigenotype, commercial-scale short-rotation coppice plantation in East-Flanders (Belgium), and their relationships with the principal environmental variables were assessed. All measurements were performed during the entire 2016 growing season on the third year of the third rotation in multistemmed trees. The discontinuous PWS indicators were measured on 10 separate days with a different evaporative demand and soil water content, while the continuous PWS indicators were recorded from April to November. The genotypes responded differently to environmental drivers and to soil conditions, based on the PWS indicators, featuring a different water behaviour in relation to the level of isohydricity. Poplar genotypes 'Koster' and 'Bakan' showed the typical water-conserving behaviour of isohydric species, while 'Grimminge' was more in line with the anisohydric ones. A principal component analysis showed that sap flow (F-s) was the most suitable PWS indicator. The F-s and therefore the sap flow-based canopy transpiration (E-c) were tightly linked to the phenological stage of the trees as well as to vapour pressure deficit and photosynthetic photon flux density, based on relationships between E-c and environmental variables. A quantitative predictive model was developed to estimate the crop water requirements for specific genotypes, by calculating transpiration per unit of ground area with a few environmental variables, monitored with easy-to-handle sensors.

AB  - Remnant midwestern oak savannas in the USA have been altered by fire suppression and the encroachment of woody evergreen trees and shrubs. The Gus Engeling Wildlife Management Area (GEWMA) near Palestine, Texas represents a relatively intact southern example of thickening and evergreen encroachment in oak savannas. In this study, 18 images from the CHRIS/PROBA (Compact High-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer/Project for On-Board Autonomy) sensor were acquired between June 2009 and October 2010 and used to explore variation in canopy dynamics among deciduous and evergreen trees and shrubs, and savanna grassland in seasonal leaf-on and leaf-off conditions. Nadir CHRIS images from the 11 useable dates were processed to surface reflectance and a selection of vegetation indices (VIs) sensitive to pigments, photosynthetic efficiency, and canopy water content were calculated. An analysis of temporal VI phenology was undertaken using a fishnet polygon at 90 m resolution incorporating tree densities from a classified aerial photo and soil type polygons. The results showed that the major differences in spectral phenology were associated with deciduous tree density, the density of evergreen trees and shrubs-especially during deciduous leaf-off periods-broad vegetation types, and soil type interactions with elevation. The VIs were sensitive to high densities of evergreens during the leaf-off period and indicative of a photosynthetic advantage over deciduous trees. The largest differences in VI profiles were associated with high and low tree density, and soil types with the lowest and highest available soil water. The study showed how time series of hyperspectral data could be used to monitor the relative abundance and vigor of desirable and less desirable species in conservation lands.

AB  - Aim Communities with many species at their climatic niche limits may be vulnerable to species losses, suggesting that niche-based measures can inform vulnerability assessments. We aimed to quantify spatial variation in community-level vulnerability indices based on niche limits, not just central tendencies, to predict where climate changes will produce rapid, pronounced shifts in ecological communities. Location North America. Taxon Epiphytic lichenized fungi. Methods We integrated broad-extent herbarium data (46,343 North American sites, for estimation of realized niches) with systematic, whole-community macrolichen surveys from the U.S. Forest Inventory and Analysis inventory (6,474 U.S. sites, for standardized vulnerability estimation). We introduce three niche-based vulnerability indices describing (a) percentage of vulnerable species occurring at their upper climatic limits, (b) community-mean percentile, and (c) deviation of local conditions from community-mean upper limits. We also performed sensitivity analyses and evaluated vulnerability in future climate change scenarios. Results Sensitivity of indices to uncertainty in climate variables was minor. Present-day vulnerability was greatest in north-central California, in the Southwest along the western Colorado Plateau, and on the Southeastern coastal plain-locations where climatically-induced compositional changes will become most evident. Under future warming scenarios (+0.5 to + 3.6 degrees C increases), the percentage of U.S. epiphytic macrolichen communities exceeding critical values grew from about 2%-20%. Main conclusions In all scenarios the most vulnerable communities were concentrated in low-elevation and southerly locations, suggesting that many ostensibly "warm-adapted" communities may be close to exceeding their climatic limits. Findings indicate that warming and moisture changes will modify community compositions through the local loss of intolerant species pushed beyond their niche limits. Assessing vulnerability of bioindicators such as lichens will help prioritize locations where the greatest climate-induced changes in species distributions and diversity will occur.

AB  - Outlier detection can be seen as a pre-processing step for locating data points in a data sample, which do not conform to the majority of observations. Various techniques and methods for outlier detection can be found in the literature dealing with different types of data. However, many data sets are inflated by true zeros and, in addition, some components/variables might be of compositional nature. Important examples of such data sets are the Structural Earnings Survey, the Structural Business Statistics, the European Statistics on Income and Living Conditions, tax data or - as in this contribution - household expenditure data which are used, for example, to estimate the Purchase Power Parity of a country. In this work, robust univariate and multivariate outlier detection methods are compared by a complex simulation study that considers various challenges included in data sets, namely structural (true) zeros, missing values, and compositional variables. These circumstances make it difficult or impossible to flag true outliers and influential observations by well-known outlier detection methods. Our aim is to assess the performance of outlier detection methods in terms of their effectiveness to identify outliers when applied to challenging data sets such as the household expenditures data surveyed all over the world. Moreover, different methods are evaluated through a close-to-reality simulation study. Differences in performance of univariate and multivariate robust techniques for outlier detection and their shortcomings are reported. We found that robust multivariate methods outperform robust univariate methods. The best performing methods in finding the outliers and in providing a low false discovery rate were found to be the generalized S estimators (GSE), the BACON-EEM algorithm and a compositional method (CoDa-Cov). In addition, these methods performed also best when the outliers are imputed based on the corresponding outlier detection method and indicators are estimated from the data sets.

AB  - This is the first study that describes the spatial-temporal distributions of the zooplankton community and potential control factors in Cintra Bay. Zooplankton were sampled using a bongo net, 150 mm mesh size, during two surveys, in autumn 2015 and spring 2016, extending from the coast to the open sea. Fourteen zooplankton groups were identified, where copepods represented 49.1% and 92.5% of the total abundance in autumn 2015 and spring 2016, respectively. Tintinnids accounted for 39.7% and 4.7%, respectively. The total zooplankton abundance was higher in autumn (55 992 ind m(-3)) than in spring (2123 ind m(-3)). Nineteen species of copepods, belonging to 14 families, were identified. Euterpina acutifrons and Oithona nana were the most common and abundant species. The Acartiids were represented by three species (Acartia clausi, A. tonsa and A. bifilosa) in autumn and one species in spring (A. clausi). The copepods diversity was significantly different between the two seasons showing high values at the entrance and the center of the bay in autumn 2015 and in the southern half of the bay in spring 2016. The copepod structure was characterized by 13 species at different degrees of contribution in autumn 2015. In spring 2016, only four species qualified as indicator species although their contribution was not significant. Given its large opening on the ocean, Cintra Bay benefits largely from the conditions of the oceanic environment, particularly the upwelling. This situation is likely to have an impact on the spatiotemporal variability of the composition and distribution of zooplankton, especially the copepods.

AB  - Anthropic activities such as the emission of pollutants resulting from industrial and agropastoral activities promote several changes in urban and forest areas. Lichens are organisms that are used in air quality evaluations due to their sensitivity to these changes. The aim of this study is to analyze the presence of morphophysiological damages and the metal concentration in samples of the lichen Parmotrema tinctorum, in urban and forest areas, checking for possible parameter variations between these areas, in the different matrices and seasons in the Southern region of Brazil. Six areas were selected (urban and forest), assigned to the rural/urban and urban/industrial matrices belonging to the watershed of the Rio dos Sinos, Brazil. The following parameters were analyzed: Index of photobiont vitality (IPV), photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll, carotene, and pheophytin) and metals (Cu, Cr, Zn, Pb, and Ni) in the thallus of the lichen. The data were analyzed by an ANOVA one way, Pearson correlation test, and principal component analysis (PCA). Variations in the morphophysiological parameters were recorded in all the areas revealing significant differences. The lowest IPV values and highest concentration of metals were recorded in the urban environment, while low chlorophyll levels were found in the forest areas. The PCA showed a distinction between the areas and the season. The level of urbanization, vehicle traffic, and the weather conditions might have influenced the results. The use of P. tinctorum, the index of photobiont vitality and chlorophyll and pheophytin content, has proved to be an efficient tool to diagnose the air quality in the areas analyzed, allowing its use as a model in air monitoring studies, both in urban and forest areas, as well as in distinct matrices in the subtropical region.

AB  - Drivers of soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics involve a combination of edaphic, human, and climatic factors that influence and determine SOC distribution across the landscape. High-resolution maps of key indicators of ecosystem health can enable assessments of these drivers and aid in critical management decisions. This study used a systematic field-based approach coupled with statistical modeling and remote sensing to develop accurate, high-resolution maps of key indicators of ecosystem health across savanna ecosystems in South Africa. Two 100-km(2) landscapes in Bushbuckridge Local Municipality were surveyed, and 320 composite topsoil samples were collected. Mid-infrared spectroscopy was used to predict soil properties, with good performance for all models and root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) values of 1.3, 0.2, 5, and 3.6 for SOC, pH, sand, and clay, respectively. Validation results for the mapping of soil erosion prevalence and herbaceous cover using RapidEye imagery at 5-m spatial resolution showed good model performance with area under the curve values of 0.80 and 0.86, respectively. The overall (out-of-bag) random forest model performance for mapping of soil properties, reported using R-2, was 0.8, 0.77, and 0.82 for SOC, pH, and sand, respectively. Calibration model performance was good, with RMSEP values of 2.6 g kg(-1) for SOC, 0.2 for pH, and 6% for sand content. Strong gradients of increasing SOC and pH corresponded with decreasing sand content between the study sites. Although both sites had low SOC overall, important driving factors of SOC dynamics included soil texture, soil erosion prevalence, and climate. These data will inform strategic land management decisions focused particularly on improving ecosystem conditions.

AB  - The present study aims to contribute to a better assessment of pesticide environmental and human health (here evaluated in the context of human exposure via food items) risks for the estuarine system by comprehensively studying the spatial and temporal occurrence of the pesticides atrazine, azoxystrobin, bentazon, lambda-cyhalothrin, penoxsulam and terbuthylazine in the River Mondego estuary (Portugal). Pesticide quantification was performed in surface water, sediment, macroalgae (Ulva spp., Gracilaria gracilis, Fucus vesiculosus), aquatic plants (Zostera noltii, Spartina maritime, Scirpus maritimus) and bivalves (Scrobicularia plan). Since intense precipitation could promote the runoff of pesticides from the surrounding agricultural fields, a single long-duration flood event was also studied in this estuarine system. Under normal flow conditions, quantified concentrations were determined mostly during summer in agreement with the pesticide application period. Azoxystrobin presented the highest detection frequency and atrazine (an herbicide used globally but banned in the EU) presented the second highest frequency, thus highlighting the need to include legacy pesticides in monitoring programmes. Pesticide concentrations in surface water determined in the present study suggest low risk to estuarine organisms. However, all the pesticides were bioacctunulated by S. pima, leading us to consider that pesticides may not only cause adverse effects on the aquatic organism itself, but should also be an alert for human exposure, for this is an edible species and is considered of economic interest. Concern is also expressed about edible seaweeds, since s-triazine pesticides were found in Ulva spp. and G. gracilis. Acknowledging these concerns, developing and establishing allowable pesticide safety values for edible seaweeds and bivalves is recommended, as well as monitoring bivalve pesticide levels, using the whole animal, as a human health exposure indicator for estuarine systems. During the studied flood event, it appears that no serious pesticide contamination has occurred in the River Mondego estuary.

AB  - There is increasing evidence that melanin-based plumage coloration correlates with different components of fitness and that it may act as a social or sexual signal of individual quality. We analysed variation in melanin pigmentation in the outermost tail feathers of the Common Snipe Gallinago gallinago. During courtship flights, male Snipe use their outermost tail feathers to generate a drumming sound, which plays a role in territory establishment and mate choice. As the outermost tail feathers are displayed to females during these flights, we predicted that conspicuous variation in their rusty-brown (pheomelanin-based) coloration may act as an honest signal of individual quality. To test this prediction, we spectrophotometrically measured brightness (an indicator of total melanin content) and red chroma (an indicator of pheomelanin content) of the outermost tail feathers in 180 juvenile and adult Common Snipe. An age-related decline in feather brightness was found exclusively in females, suggesting that melanization could have evolved by natural selection to camouflage incubating birds. In both sexes, brightness of the tail feathers was inversely correlated with their structural quality (as measured with mass-length residuals), suggesting that melanization could increase mechanical properties of feathers and, in males, enhance the quality of courtship sonation. Red chroma positively correlated with total plasma protein concentration, supporting our prediction that pheomelanin pigmentation of tail feathers may act as an honest signal of condition. Our study indicated that variation in the melanin-based coloration of the outermost tail feathers in the Common Snipe could have evolved as a result of several different selection pressures and it emphasizes the complexity of the processes that underlie the evolution of melanin-based plumage coloration in birds.

AB  - The importance of carbohydrate reserves in leaves for rooting performance of ornamental cuttings is well-known. Especially under environmental conditions unfavourable for photosynthesis, sufficient reserves are indispensable for an undisturbed adventitious root formation and to prevent senescence of leaves during rooting. However, due to time and costs, established methods for carbohydrates analysis are not suitable for implementation in global production chains of ornamentals. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) might be a valuable alternative. To explore the suitability of this technique, NIR spectra were taken from intact cuttings as well as from upper and lower side of detached leaves of chrysanthemum and pelargonium cuttings and partial least squares (PLS) calibration models were developed for glucose, fructose, sucrose and starch in leaves, which were analysed by a stepwise enzymatic-photometric method. Presumably because of a high percentage of cuttings with very low amounts of glucose, fructose and sucrose, calibration models for single soluble sugars and sum of soluble sugars were poor (R-CV(2)< 0.5, RPDCV < 1.5), while prediction performance for starch and sum of starch and soluble sugars was quite good (R-2> 0.8, RPD > 2.0, RER > 10). The high number of cuttings with depleted reserves of soluble sugars seems to have been at least partly caused by transportation of cuttings, before NIR analysis, from stock plant facilities in Africa and Latin America to Central Europe. The quite low levels of leaf carbohydrates on delivery at rooting facilities cannot be detected by NIRS properly. Thus, NIRS seems to be more suitable for monitoring of leaf carbohydrates in stock plants to optimise crop management than for assessment of cutting quality before rooting. (C) 2017 IAgrE.

AB  - AimOverall species richness in habitat remnants is seldom explained by the island biogeography theory (IBT). In this study, we tested the effectiveness of the IBT in explaining species richness of forest birds with or without considering the effect of the different forest specialization of species (generalist, edge and interior; community analysis). We also identified single species and groups of species that could serve as indicators of different fragmentation degrees (indicator species analysis).
   LocationBroadleaved forests in western Lombardy (northern Italy).
   MethodsWe evaluated bird species richness in 344 forest fragments. Fragment area (FA), distance from the nearest source area (>1000ha) (DSA) and number of neighbouring fragments (NF) were calculated for each fragment. Using Poisson generalized linear models, we compared a model that evaluated the relationships between fragment covariates and species richness to a model that also considered the effect of forest species specialization on each relationship. Moreover, we investigated the association between each species and particular fragmentation conditions by calculating the IndVal index.
   ResultsThe application of the IBT to species richness performed significantly better if we took into account forest species specialization when evaluating the effect of fragment covariates. In particular, the positive effects of FA and NF and the negative effect of DSA were significantly stronger on interior species rather than on generalist and edge species. Using the IndVal index we identified six species in three groups strongly associated with specific fragmentation degrees.
   Main conclusionsThe results showed the strong influence of the specialization of species on their distribution in fragmented landscapes. Interior species were the best candidates as a proxy of fragmentation effects. However, the indicator species analyses revealed that not all interior species showed the same sensitivity to fragment covariates.

AB  - Analysis of literature data shows that there is limited information about the harmful biological effects of mixture of compounds from the EDC group that are released from the surface of toys and objects intended for children and infants. One of the tools that can be used to obtain such information is appropriate bioanalytical tests. The aim of this research involved determining whether tests that use living organisms as an active element (Vibrio fischeri-MicrotoxA (R), Heterocypris incongruens-Ostrocodtoxkit F (TM) and the XenoScreen YES/YAS (TM) test of oestrogenic/androgenic activity) can be a tool for estimating the combined toxic effects induced by xenobiotics released from objects intended for children. To reproduce the conditions to which objects are exposed during their use, liquids with a composition corresponding to that of human bodily fluids (artificial sweat and saliva) were used. This research focused on the main parameters influencing the intensification of the migration process (temperature, contact time and composition of the extraction mixture). The studies aimed to estimate the endocrine potential of the extracts showed that compounds released from the surface of studied objects exhibit antagonistic androgenic activity. While on the basis of the results of MicrotoxA (R) test, one can state that the largest quantity of toxic compounds are released in the first 2 h of using the object. The FTIR spectra analyses confirmed that no degradation of polymeric material took place. On the basis of the results obtained, it was unanimously concluded that contact of the object with bodily fluids may result in the release of a large number of xenobiotics, which has disadvantageous effects on the metabolic processes of the indicator organisms.

AB  - The impact of ambient light on mood and anxiety is best exemplified in seasonal affective disorder, in which patients experience depression and anxiety in winter when there is less light in the environment. However, the brain mechanisms underlying light-dependent changes in affective state remain unclear. Our previous work revealed increased depression-like behaviors in the diurnal Nile grass rat (Arvicanthis niloticus) housed in a dim light-dark (dim-LD) cycle as compared to the controls housed in a bright light-dark (bright-LD) condition. As depression is often comorbid with anxiety and is associated with dysregulation of the body's stress response system, the present study examined the anxiety-like behaviors as well as indicators of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning in the grass rats. Animals housed in dim-LD showed increased anxiety-like behaviors compared to bright-LD controls, as revealed by fewer entries and less time spent at the center in the open field test and more marbles buried during the marble-burying test. Following the marble-burying test, dim-LD animals showed higher plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels and hippocampal Fos expression. Although the daily CORT rhythm was comparable between bright-LD and dim-LD groups, the day/night variation of corticotropin-releasing hormone mRNA expression in the paraventricular nucleus was diminished in dim-LD animals. In addition, glucocorticoid receptor and mineralocorticoid receptor mRNA expression were higher in the hippocampus of dim-LD animals. The results suggest that in diurnal species, reduced daytime illumination can lead to increased anxiety-like behaviors and altered HPA axis functioning, providing insights into the link between decreased environmental illumination and negative emotion.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate whether artificial neural networks (ANN) are able to decode participants' conscious experience perception from brain activity alone, using complex and ecological stimuli. To reach the aim we conducted pattern recognition data analysis on fMRI data acquired during the execution of a binocular visual rivalry paradigm (BR). Twelve healthy participants were submitted to fMRI during the execution of a binocular non-rivalry (BNR) and a BR paradigm in which two classes of stimuli (faces and houses) were presented. During the binocular rivalry paradigm, behavioral responses related to the switching between consciously perceived stimuli were also collected. First, we used the BNR paradigm as a functional localizer to identify the brain areas involved the processing of the stimuli. Second, we trained the ANN on the BNR fMRI data restricted to these regions of interest. Third, we applied the trained ANN to the BR data as a 'brain reading' tool to discriminate the pattern of neural activity between the two stimuli. Fourth, we verified the consistency of the ANN outputs with the collected behavioral indicators of which stimulus was consciously perceived by the participants. Our main results showed that the trained ANN was able to generalize across the two different tasks (i.e. BNR and BR) and to identify with high accuracy the cognitive state of the participants (i.e. which stimulus was consciously perceived) during the BR condition. The behavioral response, employed as control parameter, was compared with the network output and a statistically significant percentage of correspondences (p-value<0.05) were obtained for all subjects. In conclusion the present study provides a method based on multivariate pattern analysis to investigate the neural basis of visual consciousness during the BR phenomenon when behavioral indicators lack or are inconsistent, like in disorders of consciousness or sedated patients.

AB  - Seawater turbidity is a fundamental driver of the ecology of coastal marine systems, and is widely used as indicator for environmental reporting. However, the time scales and processes leading to changes in turbidity in tropical coastal waters remain poorly understood. This study investigates the main determinants of inshore turbidity in four inshore regions along similar to 1000 km of the Australian Great Barrier Reef, based on similar to 3 years of almost continuous in situ turbidity logger data on 14 reefs. Generalized additive mixed models were used to predict spatial and temporal variation in weekly mean turbidity based on variation in resuspension and runoff conditions. At any given wave height, wave period and tidal range, turbidity was significantly affected by river flow and rainfall. Averaged across all reefs, turbidity was 13% lower (range: 5-37%) in weeks with low compared with high rainfall and river flows. Additionally, turbidity was on average 43% lower 250 days into the dry season than at the start of the dry season on reefs with long-term mean turbidity >1.1 NTU. The data suggest the time scale of winnowing or consolidation of newly imported materials in this zone is months to years. In contrast, turbidity returned to low levels within weeks after river flows and rainfall on reefs with long-term mean turbidity of <1.1 NTU. Turbidity was also up to 10-fold higher on reefs near compared to away from river mouths, suggesting inter-annual accumulation of fine resuspendible sediments. The study suggests that a reduction in the river loads of fine sediments and nutrients through improved land management should lead to measurably improved inshore water clarity in the most turbid parts of the GBR.

AB  - The contribution of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), a perennial C4 grass, in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions was reviewed under three main areas; the impact on carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane emissions (CH4), whilst also taking into account the effects of land conversion to switchgrass. Switchgrass is able to enhance biomass accumulation in a wide range of environmental conditions, which is the premise for considerable carbon assimilation and storage in the belowground organs. The progress in some areas of crop husbandry (e.g., tillage and fertilization) has fostered benefits for carbon storage, while restraining GHG emissions. As root biomass is the main indicator of soil carbon sequestration, switchgrass's dense and deep rooting is a relevant advantage, although uncertainty still exists about the crop's belowground biomass accumulation. In agreement with this, most LCA studies addressing CO2 emissions report significant benefits from switchgrass cultivation and processing. Beside CO2, switchgrass performed better than most other biomass crops also in terms of N2O emission. In the case of CH4 emission, it may be argued that switchgrass should act as a moderate sink, i.e., contributing to mitigate CH4 atmospheric concentration, but a substantial lack of information indicates the need for specific research on the topic. Land conversion to switchgrass is the latest issue which needs to be addressed in LCA studies: not surprisingly, the net CO2 abatement appears remarkable if switchgrass is grown in former arable lands, although it is slightly negative to positive if switchgrass replaces permanent grassland. In conclusion, switchgrass could significantly contribute to mitigate GHG emissions, although areas of uncertainty still exist in the assessment of soil carbon storage, N2O and CH4 emissions, and the effects of converting lands to switchgrass. Further improvements must, therefore, be achieved to strengthen the crop's remarkable sustainability.

AB  - Magnetic properties are increasingly used for paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic studies. Utilizing recently developed proxies, an environmental magnetic study was conducted on the uppermost 12 m sediments of Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Site U1337 in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. This interval is above the Fe-redox boundary, and covers the past similar to 800 k.y. The site is located near the present southern boundary of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and is thus expected to be sensitive to variations of the ITCZ position. The ratio of anhysteretic remanent magnetization susceptibility to saturation isothermal remanent magnetization (k(ARM)/SIRM), first-order reversal curve diagrams, and IRM acquisition curves indicate that the magnetic mineral assemblage consists of a dominant biogenic component and a minor terrigenous component. Two groups, the biogenic soft (BS) and hard (BH), are identified for the biogenic component, and probably correspond to different magnetofossil morphology. The BH component, probably carried by elongated magnetofossils, increases in sediments of glacial periods, which are probably in less oxic conditions due to increased ocean productivity. This demonstrates that magnetofossil morphology, which can be discriminated by the rock magnetic technique, is a sensitive indicator of slight oxic-suboxic environmental fluctuations in sediments. Temporal variations of the terrigenous component, most likely transported as eolian dust, were estimated from the k(ARM)/SIRM ratio and S ratio (ratio of a moderate field IRM to SIRM, representing relative contribution of lower- and higher-coercivity magnetic minerals); significant glacial-interglacial variations occurred at marine isotope stage (MIS) 10 and before, but not after. In addition, coeval upcore increases in sedimentation rates and the BU component were observed, suggesting increased productivity. These observations may indicate that the position of the ITCZ was more southward than today ca. 250 ka and before.

TI  - Obstetrician-Assessed Maternal Health at Pregnancy Predicts Offspring Future Health
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Background. We aimed to examine the association between obstetrician assessment of maternal physical health at the time of pregnancy and offspring cardiovascular disease risk. Methods and Principal Findings. We examined this association in a birth cohort of 11,106 individuals, with 245,000 person years of follow-up. We were concerned that any associations might be explained by residual confounding, particularly by family socioeconomic position. In order to explore this we used multivariable regression models in which we adjusted for a range of indicators of socioeconomic position and we explored the specificity of the association. Specificity of association was explored by examining associations with other health related outcomes. Maternal physical health was associated with cardiovascular disease: adjusted (socioeconomic position, complications of pregnancy, birthweight and childhood growth at mean age 5) hazard ratio comparing those described as having poor or very poor health at the time of pregnancy to those with good or very good health was 1.55 (95% CI: 1.05, 2.28) for coronary heart disease, 1.91 (95% CI: 0.99, 3.67) for stroke and 1.57 (95% CI: 1.13, 2.18) for either coronary heart disease or stroke. However, this association was not specific. There were strong associations for other outcomes that are known to be related to socioeconomic position (3.61 (95% CI: 1.04, 12.55) for lung cancer and 1.28 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.58) for unintentional injury), but not for breast cancer (1.10 (95% CI: 0.48, 2.53)). Conclusions and Significance. These findings demonstrate that a simple assessment of physical health (based on the appearance of eyes, skin, hair and teeth) of mothers at the time of pregnancy is a strong indicator of the future health risk of their offspring for common conditions that are associated with poor socioeconomic position and unhealthy behaviours. They do not support a specific biological link between maternal health across her life course and future risk of cardiovascular disease in her offspring.

AB  - In this work we investigated the involvement of Glomus intraradices in the regulation of plant growth, polyamines and proline levels of two Lotus glaber genotypes differing in salt tolerance, after longterm exposure to saline stress.
   The experiment consisted of a randomized block design with three factors: (1) mycorrhizal treatments (with or without AM fungus); (2) two salinity levels of 0 and 200 mM NaCl; and (3) L. glaber genotype. Experiments were performed using stem cuttings derived from L. glaber individuals representing a natural population from saline lowlands.
   One of the most relevant results was the higher content of total free polyamines in mycorrhized plants compared to non-AM ones. Since polyamines have been proposed as candidates for the regulation of root development under saline situations, it is possible that AM plants (which contained higher polyamine levels and showed improved root growth) were better shaped to cope with salt stress.
   Colonization by G. intraradices also increased (Spd + Spm)/Put ratio in L. glaber roots. Interestingly, such increment in salt stressed AM plants of the sensitive genotype, was even higher than that produced by salinization or AM symbiosis separately. On the other hand, salinity but not mycorrhizal colonization influenced proline levels in both L. glaber genotypes since high proline accumulation was observed in both genotypes under salt stress conditions.
   Our results suggest that modulation of polyamine pools can be one of the mechanisms used by AM fungi to improve L. glaber adaptation to saline soils. Proline accumulation in response to salt stress is a good indicator of stress perception and our results suggest that it could be used as such among L. glaber genotypes differing in salt stress tolerance.

AB  - U-Pb ages of detrital zircons in clastic sediments are potential indicators of sedimentary provenance and crustal evolution. To extract geologically significant information from such data, it is necessary that the zircons analysed in the laboratory reflect the sediment from which they were separated. Among other factors, this depends on the number of grains analysed. The probability that a detrital zircon in a sediment belongs to one of several populations (defined by their age or another well-defined parameter) is described by the binomial probability formula, from which detection limits and expected values for the accuracy and precision of population sizes can be derived. Monte Carlo simulation of sets of data with up to 120 individual analyses drawn from pools with known age probability density distributions shows that quantitative representation of the age distribution of the zircons in the host sediment is unlikely to be achieved in natural cases. Methods that assume such representation (e.g., age spectrum deconvolution, multivariate statistical analysis using probability density scores, and mass balance modelling) are therefore likely to give results of questionable significance. The best way to extract the potential information contained in detrital zircons may be a combination of random and nonrandom selection of grains for analysis; yielding two complementary sets of age data from each sample, the random fraction should comprise 35-70 grains or more, depending on the complexity of the age distribution. The use of trace element and Lu-Hf isotope data from the zircons dated by U-Pb will give additional, valuable information, which may facilitate interpretation of detrital zircon ages. The use of detrital zircon ages to limit the age of deposition of the host sediment is fraught with both geological and statistical sources of error, and is therefore discouraged.

AB  - [1] The Mars Environmental Compatibility Assessment (MECA) instrument was designed, built, and flight qualified for the now canceled MSP (Mars Surveyor Program) '01 Lander. The MECA package consisted of a microscope, electrometer, material patch plates, and a wet chemistry laboratory (WCL). The primary goal of MECA was to analyze the Martian soil (regolith) for possible hazards to future astronauts and to provide a better understanding of Martian regolith geochemistry. The purpose of the WCL was to analyze for a range of soluble ionic chemical species and electrochemical parameters. The heart of the WCL was a sensor array of electrochemically based ion-selective electrodes (ISE). After 20 months storage at -23degreesC and subsequent extended freeze/thawing cycles, WCL sensors were evaluated to determine both their physical durability and analytical responses. A fractional factorial calibration of the sensors was used to obtain slope, intercept, and all necessary selectivity coefficients simultaneously for selected ISEs. This calibration was used to model five cation and three anion sensors. These data were subsequently used to determine concentrations of several ions in two soil leachate simulants (based on terrestrial seawater and hypothesized Mars brine) and four actual soil samples. The WCL results were compared to simulant and soil samples using ion chromatography and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy. The results showed that flight qualification and prolonged low-temperature storage conditions had minimal effects on the sensors. In addition, the analytical optimization method provided quantitative and qualitative data that could be used to accurately identify the chemical composition of the simulants and soils. The WCL has the ability to provide data that can be used to "read'' the chemical, geological, and climatic history of Mars, as well as the potential habitability of its regolith.

AB  - Tissue injury, in which the skeleton is stripped of living tissue, is common in reef-building corals and has potentially important demographic consequences. To examine the significance of tissue injury for natural populations, I monitored 1627 colonies in 30 taxa of Indo-Pacific branching corals at 3 to 5 mo intervals over a 2 yr period. Recent injury (inflicted within the few days prior to censusing) was a highly significant predictor of colony fate within 3 to 5 mo, for acroporid corals with small, compact branches (hispidose and corymbose growth forms). In contrast, colony size was not a significant predictor of fate for these corals after recent injury was included in the models. Both recent injury and colony size were significant predictors of fate for pocilloporids (small bushy growth form). Neither were good predictors of fate for arborescent acroporids (large, widely-spaced branches), even though recent injury was up to 3 times more common in these corals. Old injury (inflicted several weeks or more prior to censusing) covering > 5% of the colony was a highly significant predictor of colony death within 3 to 5 mo for corymbose species. Colonies with both old and recent injuries were highly likely to die: 33 and 54% of colonies in separate censuses died within 3 mo. The predictive power of recent injury implies chronic or repetitive tissue loss and prolonged decline, since most recent injuries were small (<30 cm(2)) and did not account for the colony decline per se. Since colony size was not as good a predictor of colony fate as recent injury for small-branched acroporids, size-based population models for these corals may be improved by incorporating tissue injury as an indicator of colony condition.

AB  - In-depth understanding of past climatic and biotic change requires the study of ancient ecosystems. However, terrestrial plants and vertebrates are preferentially preserved under very different taphonomic conditions, and diverse fossil floras and faunas are rarely found in close association. Big Multi Quarry and associated strata in the uppermost Fort Union Formation of the Washakie Basin, southwestern Wyoming, provide a uniquely detailed record of terrestrial fauna, flora, and climate during the early Clarkforkian. The Clarkforkian Land Mammal Age, approximately the last million years of the Paleocene, wars an interval of global warming that had profound biotic consequences.
   The mammalian fauna of Big Multi Quarry, consisting of 41 species, is the most diverse known from a single Clarkforkian locality. Unlike most other Clarkforkian faunas, this assemblage is not significantly biased against small forms. Lipotyphlan insectivores were dominant, and arboreally adapted taxa were abundant and diverse. The closely associated and well-preserved fossil plant assemblage was overwhelmingly dominated by a single species belonging to the birch family. Floral richness, heterogeneity, and evenness were as low as in the Tiffanian of the same region, showing that forest structure remained monotonous even as climate warned and mammals diversified in the Clarkforkian. The plant assemblage more closely resembles middle than early Clarkforkian floras of northern Wyoming, suggesting northward migration, of the ranges of plant taxa coincident with warming.
   A great deal of research has focused on the unusually warm interiors of continents in the terminal Paleocene and early Eocene. Multiple lines of evidence from our study, including sedimentological indicators, analyses of the nearest living relatives and functional analogues of the fossil plants and animals, size and margin analysis of fossil leaves, and cenogram analysis of the mammalian fauna, indicate that southwestern Wyoming had a humid subtropical climate with little or no seasonal frost or marked dry season, well before the terminal Paleocene.

AB  - As the crucial material basis for the development of human society, mineral resources (MRs) are facing a serious dilemma of shortage. Strengthening the intensive utilization of existing resources has great significance for ensuring the sustainable and stable supply of MRs and promoting the realization of ecological mining. This paper, taking the city of Yangquan, China as a case study, explores the intensive utilization of MRs based on its scientific connotation, and proposes dynamic improvement paths for strengthening the intensification of MRs utilization, thus filling a gap in this domain. The background conditions of mines and the basic cases of corresponding mining enterprises are all indicators presented by the resource itself in the process of transforming minerals into useful products that constitute a basic framework for identifying and strengthening the intensification of MRs utilization. The results show that mining enterprises are the core of intensive utilization. The extract recovery rate of mining enterprises contributes the most to the intensive utilization of resources. Meanwhile, the inputoutput level and per capita output level of mining enterprises and the ore loss during mining process are also highly concerned targeting the intensification. The intensive utilization level of large mines is usually relatively high, indicating that mine scale does have an impact on the intensive utilization of resources, but when it reaches a certain scale, the impact will gradually decrease. Besides, there are still weak links in the development process of mines, regardless of the intensive degree. Thus, from the perspective of enterprise governance, corresponding dynamic improvement paths (fundamental optimization-comprehensive optimization-strategic optimization) are adopted to make an attempt at increasing the intensive degree of MRs utilization. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a new course of the realizability to strengthen the intensification of MRs utilization.

AB  - The use of forage in intercrops is preponderant for ensuring diverse and conservationist grain production systems in the Cerrado. This study aimed to evaluate different grass forage crops intercropped with corn and their influence on the soil biological activity and on the successor crop grain yield. The study was carried out in the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 harvests, with four replicates under a randomized block design. The treatments consisted of corn intercropped with four grass species: corn + Massai (Megathyrsus maximus), corn + Zuri (Megathyrsus maximum cv. Zuri), corn + Marandu (Urochloa brizantha) and corn + Ruziziensis (Urochloa ruziziensis) and corn in single cultivation. The treatments were stablished in the 2017/2018 harvest and were followed by the subsequent soybean cultivation in the 2018/2019 harvest. In both cropping seasons the evaluated soil microbiological attributes and plant variables were: carbon and nitrogen from the microbial biomass (C-SMB and N-SMB), soil basal respiration, metabolic quotient, dehydrogenase enzymes, fluorescein diacetate activity, corn and forages yields. In the 2018/2019 harvest, soybean grain yield and leaf nutrients were also evaluated. N-SMB and dehydrogenase concentrations were higher in the corn + Zuri intercrop than in corn + Ruziziensis treatment in the 2017/2018 harvest. Corn grain yield is not affected by the intercropping with forage grasses. Single corn resulted in biological indicators that suggest stressful soil conditions, which resulted in lower soybean yield in succession. Soybean grown in succession to corn intercropped with forage grasses, had its average yield increased by 33%, compared to soybean grown in succession to single corn. The corn intercropped with tropical forages is an important tool for the sustainable increase of yield in the integrated production systems in the Maranhao Eastern Cerrado.

AB  - Global production networks have become the most important organizational platforms for coordinating international production activities, and their evolution patterns profoundly affect value distribution across the world. In this study, we shall firstly carry out an in-depth quantitative research to analyze the patterns and evolution of global production networks, using a long time-sequenced multi-region input-output table and the network analysis approach. Then based on the method of value-added decomposition, we will develop an index system to measure the degree of participation of regions in global production networks. Finally, we will try to identify the factors affecting the degree of participation of countries in global production networks by constructing a regression model. The results show that from 1995 to 2015, the evolution of global production networks measured by input-output linkages experienced four stages: expansion, contraction, re-expansion, and re-contraction. In addition, the core communities of global production networks evolved from two major production communities (Europe and the Americas) to three pillars (Europe, Americas, and Asia) while more segmented communities are mainly affected by geographical proximity. The latter consists of European, North American, South American, African and Asian communities. The evolution of the global production network pattern primarily manifests as a process of cooperation strengthening or weakening among communities, based on changes in the external environment and the need for individual development strategies. Meanwhile, the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom have consistently ranked among the top entities in global production networks, whereas China, Russia, and Southeast Asia have the fastest rises in ranking. In addition, government efficiency, resources endowment, infrastructure conditions and technology levels play important roles in the participation in global production networks.

AB  - A transient pressure wave is a sudden pressure change that occurs in a short time, which can be induced by sudden changes in valve and pump operation, and pipe bursts in a Water Distribution Network (WDN). An accurate estimation of a transient wave arrival time is crucial because it facilitates pipe condition assessment, hydraulic model calibration, and accurate localization of pipe burst events. Due to the noisy and highly fluctuating nature of the pressure signals, estimating an accurate transient pressure wave arrival time is not a trivial task. Among many methodologies proposed for detecting abrupt pressure changes, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) were the two most popular approaches. However, several limitations involved with these two approaches can easily lead to unsatisfactory results. Moreover, some of the existing methodologies were only tested on either a single pipeline, engineered events, or a small sample size of events, making these methodologies suitable and accurate only for a limited number of scenarios. Driven by these limitations, a novel approach is proposed to estimate the wave arrival time in water distribution networks (WDNs). The backbone of this approach is the integration of wavelet decomposition and a knee point detection algorithm, thus gaining the name WAvelet kNEe (WANE). Through a comparative study against the other methodologies using 90 recorded transient events detected in a real WDN, WANE is found to provide the best wave arrival time estimation, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.4 s. Based on the result, our estimation error is at least 15 s lesser than the other methodologies. With an improved wave arrival time estimation, WANE has the potential to minimize the response time of repair crews, service disruption time, as well as the associated water losses due to a pipe break.

AB  - Fine particulate matter such as PM2.5 has been the focus of increasing public concerns because of its adverse effect on environment and health risks. However, existing efforts of mapping PM2.5 concentrations are always limited by coarse spatial resolutions and temporal frequencies. Addressing this shortcoming, here we explicitly estimated hourly PM2.5 concentrations at 1-km spatial resolution in China from March 2018 to February 2019 using a two-stage random forest model. In the first stage, we used a gap-filling method to generate full-coverage Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) by fusing AOD data from satellite (Himawari-8 and MODIS) and weather forecast model (CAMS), and additional meteorological and geographical variables. Gap-filled AOD was subsequently used to estimate hourly PM2.5 in the Stage II. Results showed that our model achieved accurate and robust estimations of PM2.5 concentrations, with an overall cross-validated R-2 of 0.85, root mean squared error of 11.02 mu g/m(3), and mean absolute error of 6.73 mu g/m(3). CAMS-simulated PM2.5, elevation, and gap-filled AOD were identified to be important variables contributing to the model performance of PM2.5 estimation. The model performance varied over the daily temporal scale. Specifically, daily estimation model performed better in spring and winter but worse in summer and autumn. We provide an alternative to generate spatially and temporally explicit mapping of PM2.5 concentrations with fine resolutions, making it possible to achieve real-time monitoring of air pollutions. The detailed spatial heterogeneity and diurnal variability of PM2.5 concentrations will also be valuable for environmental exposure assessments.

AB  - Lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) is one of the most common methods in point-of-care testing, which is widely applied in some conditions for various applications. Image segmentation is an increasingly popular experimental paradigm to efficiently test the target area in LFIA. However, due to process pollution, and problems related to the experimental operation and irregular structure of the background of the reaction, currently available tools cannot be used to extract correct signals from these images, which affects the accuracy of detection. Machine learning has significantly improved modern biochemical analysis by pushing the limits of traditional techniques for the recognition and processing of images. In this paper, the U-Net, a variant of the convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for the quantitative analysis of LFIA images for the accurate quantification of single- and multi-target images. By graying, binarizing, and labeling different concentrations of test strips, the target area of LFIA images containing the T-/C-lines is extracted and obtained. Then it provides updated trends and directions for the development of LFIA technology. Several indicators are introduced to evaluate the proposed U-Net structure to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of its image processing capability. When the trained U-Net model was used to process images, the peak signal-to-noise ratio was 22.4 dB, significantly higher than prevalent methods in the area that have reported only a 4 dB improvement in the quality of the graphics. The intersection-over-union between samples also increased to above 93%. Our results show that the proposed method has significant potential for detecting a segmented target in an LFIA area, especially weak positive signals and multichannel detection. With other modifications, this deep learning method can be applied as a powerful tool to study rapid detection devices, systems, and biological images. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Welfare of dairy cows can be assessed using welfare assessment protocols consisting of resource, management and animal-based measures. Welfare Quality(R)Assessment Protocol is one of the best-known protocols, which depends almost entirely on animal-based measures. To gain more objective and rapid welfare assessment, new techniques have been developed to measure welfare of animals, such as hair cortisol concentration. As cortisol is released in response to stress, it has long been used as a biomarker of stress in animals. While the precise mechanism of cortisol incorporation into hair is unknown, hair cortisol concentration seems to be a marker of long-term systemic cortisol concentration. Hair cortisol is, therefore, a potential marker of chronic stress and is not likely to be affected by acute stress. Studies on cattle show connections between hair cortisol concentration and factors such as pregnancy, parity, diseases, ectoparasites, body condition score, environmental changes, stocking density and milk yield. Hair cortisol concentration appears to be affected by time of sampling, cow age and breed, UV radiation, season, body region of sampled hair and hair colour. Its concentration also depends on sampling and analytical methods. Hair cortisol is a promising non-invasive tool to evaluate welfare of dairy cows, however, more research is needed to determine the extent of effects on its concentration and the appropriate method of sampling and analysis. Correlations between Welfare Quality(R)Assessment Protocol scores and pooled hair cortisol concentrations have not yet been found, and more research is needed with larger sample size, a standardized protocol of hair sampling, processing and analysis. With proper attention to detail, hair cortisol levels in pooled hair samples might come to be used as a reliable indicator of dairy animal welfare.

AB  - The present paper is focused on the development of a new environment-friendly methanolysis catalyst completely based on waste materials: lignite coal fly ash and chicken eggshells. A novel catalyst based on CaO supported on a fly ash-based zeolitic material (CaO/FA-ZM) was obtained from a cancrinite-sodalite group zeolite-like material (vishnevite type) and active CaO by alkali activation in a new miniature autoclave reactor system and hydration-dehydration. Agitation by rotation of the entire reaction mixture led to a more homogeneous zeolitic product and saved both time and energy. The obtained catalyst structure corresponds to gis-mondine and the crystallographic modification of calcium silicate (alpha'-dicalcium silicate) with deposited CaO. The characteristics of the synthesized catalyst were determined using ED-XRF, XRD, FT-IR, SEM, Hg-porosimetry, N-2-physisorption, LDPSA, and Hammett indicators. The CaO/FA-ZM catalyst exhibited a high activity (97.8% of FAME for only 30 min) and stability (a negligible drop in activity in five consecutive cycles) in the methanolysis reaction under the optimal reaction conditions (temperature of 60 degrees C, methanol/oil molar ratio of 6:1, and catalyst concentration of 6 wt%). A kinetic study was performed using two different mechanisms: the irreversible pseudo-first-order reaction mechanism in two regimes (heterogeneous and homogeneous) and the changing mechanism combined with the triacylglycerol mass transfer limitation. Both models showed a satisfactory agreement between the experimental and predicted values of conversion degree (R-2 > 0.93), confirming their validity for the CaO-based heterogeneously catalyzed methanolysis. The values of the activation energy calculated for both mechanisms were 67.17 and 58.03 kJ mol(-1), respectively.

AB  - Due to originating from various mire or paludified forests and consequently developing after drainage under different growth conditions, the drained forests are very heterogeneous and complex. In the official Estonian forest typology, the old-drained stands are divided into Myrtillus and Oxalis site types, but recently the validity of the autonomous Dryopteris (expansa) forest site type was again asserted. The aims of the current study were to (i) elucidate the main factors determining the structure and variation of the Estonian old-drained forests, (ii) elaborate the typology of these forests at the community level and, (iii) establish the indicator species of the established community types. 118 forest stands drained not less than 35-40 years ago were analysed. According to multivariate data analyses (cluster, ordination and variance analyses, multi-response permutation procedures, indicator species analyses) it appeared that the soil reaction, nutrients, and moisture content, assessed by the Ellenberg ecological indicator values for habitats are much more significant factors for plant growth and community structure than the thickness of soil/peat horizons. Nevertheless, the litter and peat horizons in soils of drained Dryopteris site type forests are significantly thinner than in Oxalis and Myrtillus site type stands. The Dryopteris site type forests can be divided into six, the Oxalis site type forests into three, and the Myrtillu s site type forests into two types of communities. Each of the 11 established community types differ significantly (p < 0.05) from each other and have their own dominant and significant indicator species. When comparing the Estonian old-drained forests with analogous stands in neighbouring countries (Latvia, Finland, Sweden, northwestern Russia), we can find rather large similarities; the typological differences result mainly from the methodological approaches and geographical scope of countries.

AB  - Land degradation is a long-term loss of ecosystem function and productivity which takes place due to a wide variety of land processes, namely soil erosion, soil sodification, green-cover loss, and soil conditions such as soil infertility that leads to productivity loss. About 41% of the land in India is under different forms of land degradation in which a major part lies in the Indian Ganga River Basin (IGRB). In this work, we evaluated the evidence of land degradation in the IGRB by analyzing (i) the changes in the forest cover and land use (FCLU) between 1975 and 2010, (ii) forest fragmentation status for the same time period, and (iii) decline in rain-use efficiency (RUE) during 2000-2010. The FCLU-type mapping for the year 1975 and 2010 was carried out using 216 Landsat satellite scenes that derived 40 vegetation and 7 non-vegetation classes. The highest negative change (loss) was observed in the dry deciduous forest of mixed forest formation (4699.9 km(2)) and gregarious formation (1337.6 km(2)), and a major gain in settlement (5396.3 km(2)) and managed lands (3408.4 km(2)). An increase in forest fragmentation was observed in all the forest classes with the highest rise in the deciduous forest of the central basin. A consistent decline in RUE was observed highest in the South-Western semi-arid IGRB (0.02-0.15) that stretched up to the central basin. All the three analyses showed evidence of active land degradation in the form of green-cover loss, fragmented forests, and declined primary productivity with visual evidence for some of the severely degraded areas. The use of Geoinformatics to analyze land degradation using surface indicators is promising and provide possibilities of further improvements using better resolution data.

AB  - Nitrogen deposition in the northeastern US changed N availability in the latter part of the twentieth century, with potential legacy effects. However, long-term N cycle measurements are scarce. N isotopes in tree rings have been used as an indicator of N availability through time, but there is little verification of whether species differ in the strength of this signal. Using long-term records at the Fernow Experimental Forest in West Virginia, we examined the relationship between soil conditions, including net nitrification rates, and wood delta N-15 in 2014, and tested the strength of correlation between tree ring delta N-15 of four species and stream water NO3- loss from 1971 to 2000. Higher soil NO3- was weakly associated with higher wood delta N-15 across species, and higher soil net nitrification rates were associated with higher delta N-15 for Quercus rubra only. The delta N-15 of Liriodendron tulipifera and Q. rubra, but neither Fagus grandifolia nor Prunus serotina, was correlated with stream water NO3-. L. tulipifera tree ring delta N-15 had a stronger association with stream water NO3- than Q. rubra. Overall, we found only limited evidence of a relationship between soil N cycling and tree ring delta N-15, with a strong correlation between the wood delta N-15 and NO3- leaching loss through time for one of four species. Tree species differ in their ability to preserve legacies of N cycling in tree ring delta N-15, and given the weak relationships between contemporary wood delta N-15 and soil N cycle measurements, caution is warranted when using wood delta N-15 to infer changes in the N cycle.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the distribution of foraminifera of surface sediments from South Shetland Islands (62 degrees 0' S 58 degrees 0' W) in relation to physical parameters. Three sites were analyzed: 1) North of South Shetland Island; 2) Deception Island, and 3) Potter Cove. We have identified 21 species, which were distributed in 13 genera, mainly from the Orders Rotaliida and Trochamminida. There was a predominance of calcareous individuals in Shetland Islands - represented by Cibicides refulgens (Montfort) and in Potter Cove, where Globocassidulina subglobosa (Brady) and Globocassidulina rossensis (Kennett) were the main representatives. In Deception Island, the proportion of calcareous individuals was matched by that of agglutinated specimens, represented by Trochammina inflata (Montagu) and Miliammina fusca (Brady). Foraminifers also exhibited different lifestyles, microhabitats, feeding strategies, and taphonomy. A strong correlation between microfauna and physical parameters was observed at the three sites. Assemblage I consisted on Cibicides refulgens, Cibicides aknerianus (d'Orbigny), Melonis affine (Reuss) and Melonis pompilioides (Fichtel and Moll), which were all distributed along the bathymetric gradient and the clay sediments. Assemblage II comprised Trochammina inflata, Miliammina fusca and Cassidulinoides parkerianus (Brady), which were correlated with a higher content of gravel. And assemblage III included individuals of Globocassidulina subglobosa and Globocassidulina sp., both correlated with higher sand content. This work contributes to increasing our knowledge about the distribution of foraminifera in the Antarctic zone, which is a largely understudied region. The new data could be useful for both determining environmental conditions and establishing bioindicators of pollution and anthropogenic activity. In addition, the correlations with climate events might contribute to the development of new tools for monitoring climate variations. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the biological functions of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) SNHG7 in breast cancer (BC), and its underlying mechanism in the occurrence and progression of BC.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression of SNHG7 in 72 pairs of BC tissues and paracancerous tissues was detected by quantitative Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Correlation between SNHG7 expressions with pathological indicators of BC patients was analyzed. Similarly, SNHG7 expression in BC cell lines was determined by qRT-PCR as well. After constructing the small inference RNA of SNHG7, cell proliferation, migration and invasion were determined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) and transwell assay. MicroRNA-186 expression in BC tissues and cells was accessed. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was conducted to verify the binding condition between SNHG7 and microRNA-186.
   RESULTS: SNHG7 expression was higher in BC tissues than that of paracancerous tissues. High expression of SNHG7 was positively correlated to tumor stage, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis, whereas not correlated to age, sex and tumor location of BC. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed that higher expression of SNHG7 is correlated to the worse prognosis of BC patients. SNHG7 was highly expressed in BC cells as well. Knockdown of SNHG7 inhibited proliferative, invasive and migratory abilities of BC cells. QRT-PCR data showed that microRNA-186 is lowly expressed in BC tissues compared with that of paracancerous tissues. MicroRNA-186 was lowly expressed in BC cells as well. Both mRNA and protein levels of microRNA-186 were negatively correlated to SNHG7 in BC tissues. Finally, the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay demonstrated that SNHG7 could be directly targeted by microRNA-186.
   CONCLUSIONS: SNHG7 is highly expressed in BC, which is correlated to tumor stage, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis of BC patients. SNHG7 could promote malignant progression of BC by regulating microRNA-186.

AB  - Water sensitive interventions are being promoted to reduce the adverse impacts of urban development on natural water cycles. However it is currently difficult to know the best strategy for their implementation because current and desired urban water performance is not well quantified. This is particularly at the city-region scale, which is important for strategic urban planning. This work aimed to fill this gap by quantifying the water performance of urban systems within city-regions using 'urban water metabolism' evaluation, to inform decisions about water sensitive interventions. To do this we adapted an existing evaluation framework with new methods. In particular, we used land use data for defining system boundaries, and for estimating natural hydrological flows. The criteria for gauging the water performance were water efficiency (in terms of water extracted externally) and hydrological performance (how much natural hydrological flows have changed relative to a nominated pre-urbanised state). We compared these performance criteria for urban systems within three Australian city-regions (South East Queensland, Melbourne and Perth metropolitan areas), under current conditions, and after implementation of example water sensitive interventions (demand management, rainwater/stormwater harvesting, wastewater recycling and increasing perviousness). The respective water efficiencies were found to be 79, 90 and 133 kL/capita/yr. In relation to hydrological performance, stormwater runoff relative to pre-urbanised flows was of most note, estimated to be 2-, 6- and 3- fold, respectively. The estimated performance benefits from water sensitive interventions suggested different priorities for each region, and that combined implementation of a range of interventions may be necessary to make substantive gains in performance. We concluded that the framework is suited to initial screening of the type and scale of water sensitive interventions needed to achieve desired water performance objectives. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal inflammation during pregnancy increases the risk for offspring psychiatric disorders and other adverse long-term health outcomes. The influence of inflammation on the developing fetal brain is hypothesized as one potential mechanism but has not been examined in humans.
   METHODS: Participants were adult women (N = 86) who were recruited during early pregnancy and whose offspring were born after 34 weeks' gestation. A biological indicator of maternal inflammation (interleukin-6) that has been shown to influence fetal brain development in animal models was quantified serially in early, mid-, and late pregnancy. Structural and functional brain magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired in neonates shortly after birth. Infants' amygdalae were individually segmented for measures of volume and as seeds for resting state functional connectivity. At 24 months of age, children completed a snack delay task to assess impulse control.
   RESULTS: Higher average maternal interleukin-6 concentration during pregnancy was prospectively associated with larger right amygdala volume and stronger bilateral amygdala connectivity to brain regions involved in sensory processing and integration (fusiform, somatosensory cortex, and thalamus), salience detection (anterior insula), and learning and memory (caudate and parahippocampal gyrus). Larger newborn right amygdala volume and stronger left amygdala connectivity were in turn associated with lower impulse control at 24 months of age, and mediated the association between higher maternal interleukin-6 concentrations and lower impulse control.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide new evidence in humans linking maternal inflammation during pregnancy with newborn brain and emerging behavioral phenotypes relevant for psychiatric disorders. A better understanding of intrauterine conditions that influence offspring disease susceptibility is warranted to inform targeted early intervention and prevention efforts.

AB  - The determination of trace rare-earth elements (REEs) can be used for the assessment of environmental pollution, and is of great significance to the study of toxicity and toxicology in animals and plants. N, N, N', N'-tetraoctyl diglycolamide (TODGA) is an environmental friendly extractant that is highly selective to REEs. In this study, an analytical method was developed for the simultaneous determination of 16 trace REEs in simulated water samples by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). With this method, TODGA was used as the extractant to perform the liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) sample pretreatment procedure. All 16 REEs were extracted from a 3 M nitric acid medium into an organic phase by a 0.025 M TODGA petroleum ether solution. A 0.03 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA) solution was used for back-extraction to strip the REEs from the organic phase into the aqueous phase. The aqueous phase was concentrated using a vacuum rotary evaporator and the concentration of the 16 REEs was detected by ICP-OES. Under the optimum experimental conditions, the limits of detection (3 sigma, n = 7) for the REEs ranged from 0.0405 ng mL(-1) (Nd) to 0.5038 ng mL(-1) (Ho). The relative standard deviations (c = 100 ng mL(-1), n = 7) were from 0.5% (Eu) to 4.0% (Tm) with a linear range of 4-1000 ng mL(-1) (R-2 > 0.999). The recoveries of 16 REEs ranged from 95% to 106%. The LLE-ICP-OES method established in this study has the advantages of simple operation, low detection limits, fast analysis speed and the ability to simultaneously determine 16 REEs, thereby acting as a viable alternative for the simultaneous detection of trace amounts of REEs in water samples.

AB  - Landscape is a product of interactions between human and nature that bring multiple characteristics to discrete geographic settings. Landscape character assessment (LCA) is a process of describing, mapping and evaluating distinct characters in the landscape. The aim of this study is to integrate objective and subjective assessment in landscape classification in the case of Side district in Antalya, Turkey. The methodology of the study is based on a holistic approach to combine map-based biophysical information and on-site visual landscape characteristics into the LCA process. Principal component and cluster analysis were used to understand relationships and spatial patterns between 29 landscape character areas and types which were previously defined by previous work. The main source of data was landscape characters, and 35 character attributes was processed as variables. Cluster analysis showed that landscape character areas and types in Side were gathered into two main cluster groups and five sub clusters. The majority of landscape character areas tended to constitute separate subclusters, while character types appeared to form large groups of clusters in which recognisable land-use patterns were the main activity. According to the cluster dendrogram, it was possible to interpret spatial linkages between the clusters of character areas and types and to delineate geographic classification of the main landscapes in Side. Scaling relations for LCA in a pattern-process-product framework provided an explicit understanding of the data layers in landscape classification and where the clustering can function. Biophysical characteristics comprised the pattern of the landscape, while visual characteristics demonstrated the condition of the landscape as a product. The process depends upon transformation between the objective and the subjective as a link between pattern and product. Further steps would be to conduct semi structured surveys to assess local perceptions and preferences about landscape characters for landscape quality objectives. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - An 885-cm-long laminated sediment core was retrieved from Zigetang Co, a non-glacial meltwater-fed lake in the central Tibetan Plateau, and analyzed for n-alkanes as well as their hydrogen isotopes to trace the regional climatic and environmental history spanning the last 13.8 cal. ka BP. The shortchain n-alkanes C15/16/17, likely derived from aquatic algae, plankton, and photosynthetic bacteria, dominate the n-alkane composition in this lake. This unusual distribution pattern might be attributed to the meromictic lake system that is characterized by a rapid salinity increase and an abrupt decrease in dissolved oxygen in the lake water with depth, as well as anoxic conditions at the bottom. n-Alkane indicator ratios (e. g. carbon preference index (CPI), average chain length (ACL), and aquatic/terrigenous ratio (ATR)) and dD values reveal that higher effective moisture availability at Zigetang Co occurred in the middle (5.8-2.7 cal. ka BP) rather than the early Holocene. This contradicts palaeoclimate records from neighboring lakes (e. g. Nam Co, Siling Co, and Paru Co). We suggest that in the Zigetang Co catchment where glacial meltwaters are not available, the temperature-induced evaporation would outweigh the monsoonal precipitation and, therefore, result in lower effective moisture displayed by the increasing dD values during the early Holocene. The local recycling of air masses could also have an important impact on the lake level and moisture availability and cannot be excluded. Our record provides further evidence for the complex relationship of insolation-induced temperature, evaporation, and precipitation affecting the regional climate changes on the Tibetan Plateau.

AB  - Evidence of a changing environment in the catchment area of a small pond (Lansquenet, Lorraine, France) during the last millennium was provided by coupling palynology data and organic ratios [terrestrial to aquatic ratio: TAR((HC)); the C-29 vs. C-27 sterols, C-29/C-27(ST); average chain length, ACL and aquatic/macrophytes ratio, P-aq]. The depositional and alteration conditions of organic matter (OM) were provided by the 5 alpha(H)-stanols/Delta(5)-sterols ratio. This study shows that quite simple organic ratios clearly allow identification of the different evolution steps of a watershed, from a swamp to the progressive settlement of a pond. During the swampy period, the C/N-(at) (ca. 11.1), TAR((HC)) (ca. 36.8), C-29/C-27(ST) (ca. 8.7) and P-aq (<0.3) show a high contribution of allochthonous OM associated with the presence of particular aquatic and mesohygrophilous species. A woody level dated to the XIIIth century reflects the period of the settlement of the pond in a more oxic environment [5 alpha(H)-stanol/Delta(5)sterol ratio <0.2]. Then, the progressive increase in aquatic input and the development of submerged and floating macrophytes are evidenced by low C/N-(at) (<7.6), TAR((HC)) (ca. 2.7), C-29/C-27(ST) (ca. 2) and high P-aq (ca. 0.5), suggesting an increase in the water level and eutrophication of the pond. A second oxic event [5 alpha(H)-stanols/Delta(5)sterols ratio averaging 0.16], associated with extensive OM degradation, corresponds to the most recent dredging in 2002 and reflects an important disturbance of sediments due to pond management.

AB  - The present study explores the spatial variability of the continentality, oceanity and aridity indices in Turkey. Climatic indices are diagnostic tools used to describe climatic conditions and the state of a climate system. In this study, four indices were calculated using the climatic data from 229 meteorological stations in Turkey. The nature of the indices expresses general climatic features such as continentality, marine influences and aridity. The climatic indices used here are the Johansson Continentality (JC) Index, the Kerner Oceanity Index (KOI), the De Martonne Aridity Index (I-DM) and the Pinna Combinative (PV) Index. Furthermore, aridity characteristics in Turkey have been examined using the two separate periods (1960-1990 and 1991-2006). To assess the temperature and precipitation patterns in Turkey, the climatic indices were calculated by using monthly temperature and precipitation for the period 1960-2006. According to the results of the KOI, marine climates characteristics were dominant in the Black Sea region than in its Aegean and Mediterranean region. The JC index is used for the climatic classification between continental and oceanic climates. The continental effect was found across 25% of the country. The maximum continentality with a score of 71.5 has been found in the eastern Anatolia. Furthermore, semi-dry areas were increasing in the 1991-2006 period compared to 1960-1990. A significant correlation was found between the values of the JC index and the KOI. The JC index gives reasonable results for Turkey. The continental effect was found across 25% of the country. This analysis may be of benefit for the explanation of landscape characteristics and the rational utilization of water resources, agriculture and energy scenarios for the region in many areas of Turkey.

AB  - The endocrine system is the key mediator of environmental and developmental (internal) information, and is likely to be involved in altering the performance of animals when selection has favored phenotypic plasticity. The endocrine control of performance should be especially pronounced in animals that undergo a developmental shift in niche, such as occurs in migratory species. By way of example, I review the developmental and environmental control of the preparatory changes for seawater entry of juvenile salmon (known as smolting) and its hormonal regulation. There is a size threshold for smolt development in juvenile Atlantic salmon that results in greater sensitivity of the growth hormone and cortisol axes to changes in daylength. These hormones, in turn, have broad effects on survival, ion homeostasis, growth and swimming performance during entry into seawater. Migratory niche shifts and metamorphic events are extreme examples of the role of hormones in animal performance and represent one end of a continuum. A framework for predicting when hormones will be involved in performance of animals is presented. Endocrine involvement in performance will be more substantial when (1) selection differentials on traits underlying performance are high and temporally discontinuous over an animals lifetime, (2) the energetic and fitness costs of maintaining performance plasticity are less than those of constant performance, (3) cues for altering performance are reliable indicators of critical environmental conditions, require neurosensory input, and minimize effects of lag, and (4) the need for coordination of organs, tissues and cells to achieve increased performance is greater. By examining these impacts of selection, endocrinologists have an opportunity to contribute to the understanding of performance, phenotypic plasticity, and the evolution of life-history traits.

AB  - A silvicultural chronosequence was studied in upland pine stands of Fort Benning, Georgia, to assess understory vegetation and soil characteristics following silvicultural disturbance activities. Hypotheses regarding patterns of understory vegetation distribution and abundance, and the impact of disturbance on soil properties were evaluated in 32 forest stands. The chronosequence encompassed various times following clear-cut regeneration: stand age (0-3 yrs), (8-10 yrs), (18-20 yrs), and (30-80 yrs). Soil pH, total carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents, soil texture, and bulk density were used to characterize soil conditions across the chronosequence. Foliar cover by species was used to characterize vegetation across this same chronosequence. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was performed to determine the relationship between understory vegetation pattern and measured soil gradients and stand age. CCA identified stand age as the most important factor influencing distribution and abundance of understory vegetation. Herbaceous species composition and cover varied more with stand age than did understory woody species. Aside from a decrease in bulk density soil variables did not vary with recovery time. Indicator analysis identified Gaylussacia mosieri (Small) and Carya spp. as the only significant woody indicators of age class. Cyperus croceus (Vah1) and Bulbostylis barbata (Rottb.) C. B. Clarke were identified as herbaceous indicators of the 0-3 age class. Andropogon virginicus (L.), Dichanthelium sp. and Sporobolus junceus (Beauv.) Kunth were significant indicators of the 8-10 year age class. Significant indicators of the 15-20 year class were Pityopsis sp. and Tridens flavus (L.) A. S. Hitchc. Andropogon ternarius (Michx.), Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx.) Nash, Desmodium sp., Hieracium sp., and Rhynchosia tomentosa (L.) Hook. & Arn. were indicators of 30-80 year age class. Major changes in understory vegetation cover and composition continued for at least 15-20 years post clear-cut regeneration.

AB  - The historical status of coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch, was assessed in 65 watersheds surrounding the San Francisco Estuary, California. We reviewed published literature, unpublished reports, field notes, and specimens housed at museum and university collections and public agency files. In watersheds for which we found historical information for the occurrence of coho salmon, we developed a matrix of five environmental indicators to assess the probability that a stream supported habitat suitable for coho salmon. We found evidence that at least 4 of 65 Estuary watersheds (6%) historically supported coho salmon. A minimum of an additional 11 watersheds (17%) may also have supported coho salmon, but evidence is inconclusive. Coho salmon were last documented from an Estuary stream in the early-to-mid 1980s. Although broadly distributed, the environmental characteristics of streams known historically to contain coho salmon shared several characteristics. In the Estuary, coho salmon typically were members of three-to-six species assemblages of native fishes, including Pacific lamprey, Lampetra tridentata, steelhead, Oncorhynchus mykiss, California roach, Lavinia symmetricus, juvenile Sacramento sucker, Catostomus occidentalis, threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, riffle sculpin, Cottus gulosus, prickly sculpin, Cottus asper, and/or tidewater goby, Eucyclogobius newberryi. We found evidence for the occurrence of coho salmon in eight watersheds characterized by the coast redwood, Sequoia sempervirens, riparian community. These conditions are more typical of the high rainfall coastal streams directly tributary to the Pacific Ocean that historically had relatively high abundances of coho salmon. All streams known or suspected historically to support coho salmon are characterized by cool summer water temperatures, suitable spawning and juvenile rearing habitat, distinct surface water connections to the estuarine and marine environments, as well as stream flows during the months of February through May suitable for smolt out-migration.

AB  - Direct measurement of soil biodiversity is expensive, and therefore a substitution of measurement by indication is desirable. We analysed three large datasets for the potential to predict the diversity of soil faunal groups from other parameters. The datasets represent different spatial scales, namely grassland nematodes on an European scale, forest collembola on a regional scale, and grassland ants on a local scale. We tested two groups of parameters as possible surrogates for species richness: (1) environmental parameters, such as climate, soil and vegetation characteristics, and (2) community parameters, such as higher taxon richness, indicator taxa, and maximum dominance.
   Climate and soil parameters were significantly correlated with biodiversity in all datasets. However, in spite of the large variety of measurement types analysed, prediction quality of environmental variables was weak and the explained proportion of variance ranged generally below 50%. Richness was subject to considerable stochastic variation among subsamples (CV = 20-60%) thereby evading a narrow correlation with environmental parameters. Higher taxon richness, based on taxa of intermediate hierarchical order, proved the best predictor of richness in collembola and nematodes explaining 55 and 89% of total variance, respectively. A combination of two ant species was the best predictor of ant richness explaining 59% of total variance.
   The authors conclude that a rough guess of soil faunal diversity can be cost-effectively derived from environmental data while an estimate of moderate quality can be obtained with reduced taxonomic effort. The precise richness of a soil community, however, is subject to autogeneous community dynamics, to biotic interactions with other populations, and to conditions in the past, and can therefore only be retrieved by immediate investigation of the community itself. Criteria for the quality of indicator parameters are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Between May 2000 and February 2001, a major bloom of the toxic dinoflagellate Gymnodinium catenatum (a causative organism of Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning, PSP) affected over 1500 km of coastline of New Zealand's North Island. As this was the first record of this species in New Zealand, we aimed to resolve whether this represented a recent introduction/spreading event or perhaps an indigenous cryptic species stimulated by environmental/climatic change. To answer this question, we analysed for G. catenatum resting cysts in Pb-210 dated sediment cores (18-34 cm long; sedimentation rates 0.34-0.69 cm per year) collected by SCUBA divers from Manukau Harbour, where the species was first detected, and from Hokianga Harbour, where the highest shellfish toxicity was recorded, while using Wellington Harbour as a well-monitored control site. The results of this study conclusively demonstrate that abundant G. catenatum has been in northern New Zealand at least since the early 1980s, increasing up to 1200 cysts/g around the year 2000, but with low cyst concentrations possibly present since at least 1937. In contrast, Wellington Harbour cores contained only very sparse G. catenatum cysts (8 cysts/g), present only to a depth of 7 cm (surface mixed layer depth), reflecting an apparent recent range expansion of this dinoflagellate in New Zealand, possibly stimulated by unusual climatic conditions associated with the 2000 La Nina event. The significant increases since the early 1980s also of Protoperidinium cysts at Hokianga Harbour and of Gonyaulax, Protoperidinium and Protoceratium cysts at Manukau Harbour suggest a broad scale environmental change has occurred in Northland, New Zealand.

AB  - Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs) are important agents of waterborne illness and have been linked to several groundwater-related outbreaks. The presence of human enteric viruses, in particular the presence of NLVs, is difficult to detect in the environment. Consequently, surrogate organisms are typically used as indicators of viruses from faecal contamination. Whether traditional bacterial indicators are reliable indicators for viral pathogens remains uncertain. Few studies have directly compared mobility and reduction of bacterial indicators (e.g. coliforms, Escherichia coli) and other surrogate indicators (coliphages) with pathogenic human viruses in soil systems. In this study the mobility and comparative reduction of the prototype NLV, Norwalk Virus (NV), was compared to poliovirus 1 (PV1), a bacterial indicator (E. coli, EC) and a viral indicator (coliphage MS2) through miniature soil columns. Replicate, 10 cm deep, miniature columns were prepared using three soils representing a range of soil textures (sand, organic muck, and clay). Columns were initially conditioned, then incubated at 10-14 degreesC, dosed twice weekly for 8 weeks with one column pore volume of virus-seeded groundwater per dose, followed by 8 weeks of dosing with one column pore volume per dose of unseeded, simulated rainwater. Columns Were allowed to drain after each dosing until an effluent volume equivalent to an applied dose was collected. Column effluents and doses were assayed for all viruses and EC. Rapid mobility with minimal reduction was observed for all organisms in the sand. Similar reductions were observed in organic muck for most organisms but NV showed a greater reduction. No organisms were shown to pass through the clay columns. Elution of viruses, in particular PV1, from the columns was gradual. After cessation of microbe dosing, E. coli was less detectable than viruses in column effluents and, therefore, unreliable as a virus indicator.

AB  - We sampled a single station in the coastal zone off Newport OR (9 km from shore; 60 in water depth) on 206 occasions during 12 years: 1969-1973, 1983 and 1996-2001. We used cluster analysis, ordinations, and indicator species analysis (ISA) to describe temporal variations in copepod community composition. Copepod community structure during summer was distinctly different from winter. Cluster analysis showed that the transition between winter and summer communities occurred early March/April in the 1970s, late (May/June) in the late 1990s, but in (March/April) since spring 2000. Seven copepod assemblages were identified: four were found during the summer upwelling season, two during large El Nino events, and one during winter. Interannual variations in the composition of the summer assemblages was seen: most sampling dates from the summers of 1970, 1973, 2000 and 2001 clustered into one group, and dates from 1971, 1972, and 1999 clustered into a second group. The 1983 and 1998 El Nino events clustered together, but subdivided into "early El Nino" and "late El Nino" communities. The summer of 1969 corresponded with a weak El Nino event but clustered differently from both the other El Nino events and other summer clusters. Samples collected during the 1972 El Nino event clustered with "normal" summers. Non-metric multidimensional ordination analysis showed that two axes accounted for 87% of the variability in community composition; Axis I was associated with the influence of El Nino events and seasonal downwelling, and Axis 2 was associated with upwelling-induced productivity. ISA showed Centropages abdominalis, Acartia longiremis, and Microcalanus pusillus as indicators of upwelling; Corycaeus anglicus, Calanus pacificus, and Ctenocalanus vanus as good indicators of El Nino; and Ctenocalanus vanus, Clausocalanus, and Calocalanus styliremis as good indicators of winter conditions.

AB  - The integrated biogeochemical model, PnET-BGC. was used to simulate the response of soil and surface water at the reference watershed (W6) at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest. New Hampshire. to changes in atmospheric deposition. The performance of the model was assessed using two objective statistical criteria, the normalized mean absolute error, and the efficiency, in order to compare simulated results with observed values between 1980 and 1998, Model results showed good agreement with measured concentrations of stream Ca2+, and SO42-, while stream NO3- and Al concentrations and soil solution Ca/Al ratios were over predicted after 1990. Model simulations showed that there was some improvement in soil and stream chemistry in response to the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act (CAAA) compared to conditions without this legislation. However, the 1990 CAAA will not result in substantial changes in critical indicators (e.g. soil base saturation, soil solution Ca/Al. stream pH. acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) and Al concentrations), The slow recovers rates suggest that additional reduction in strong acid inputs will be required to significantly alleviate ecosystem stress from acidic deposition. Simulation of the impact of equivalent reductions in SO42- and NOT deposition indicated slightly greater recovery under the SO42- reductions compared with NO An interannual pattern of stream NO3- concentrations suggests that nitrification under snowpack is a significant source of N in the ecosystem. Vegetation N uptake during summer greatly limits NO3- loss. and as a result, summer utility controls of NOx emissions will not significantly mitigate stream NO3- loss and associated surface water acidification.

AB  - Reconstruction of the pre-Pleistocene climate of continental interiors has been hampered by a lack of climatic proxies and limited temporal resolution. We developed a ne iv approach based on the oxygen isotope composition (delta(18)O) of hematite, which occurs as a coating on fossil vertebrates, and used this method to study climatic change across the Paleocene-Eocene boundary in the Bighorn basin, Wyoming.
   Hematite coatings form in soils or shallow sediments, and therefore may be used to monitor near-surface conditions, Hematite delta(18)O values are measured by combining selective leaching, laser fluorination, and mass-balance calculation, These values, in conjunction,vith delta(18)O values for co-occurring carbonates, are used to assess the plausibility of published hematite-water oxygen isotope fractionation relations. Though uncertainty remains as to the appropriate fractionation, all are relatively insensitive to temperature variations. Thus, differences in hematite delta(18)O values most likely reflect shifts in surface-water delta(18)O values.
   Analysis of hematites spanning the Paleocene-Eocene transition reveals a roughly 4 parts per thousand decrease in the delta(18)O of surface water in very early Eocene time. This episode probably reflects a cooling event (perhaps as great as 6 degrees C) that started 0.7 m.y. after the terminal Paleocene delta(13)C excursion, which corresponds to a pulse of extreme marine warming, Following the cooling, which lasted similar to 0.6 m.y., temperatures rebounded to values close to those for late Paleocene time. The cooling episode coincides remarkably well with other indicators of environmental and climatic change from the basin, such as mammalian turnover events and mean annual temperatures estimated from leaf physiognomy.

AB  - 1, The identification of easy to use and cheap biomarkers is important as a means of determining whether animals are developing under stressful environmental conditions. Previous studies have indicated that the variance about the mean esterase activity in toxic environments increases in the absence of a significant shift in the mean value, suggesting that variance levels may have potential as a biomarker of toxicant-stressed or otherwise stressful environments.
   2. Several field and laboratory populations of the mosquito, Culex pipiens, were examined for esterase activities using a colorimetric assay and levels of polymorphism using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Some of these populations had been exposed to environmental toxicants (organophosphorus (OP) insecticides).
   3. The OF-stressed field population had lower levels of polymorphism as indicated by fewer electromorphs than the populations that had not been exposed to OPs. However, the mean level of esterase activity was higher in the OF-stressed populations.
   4. Despite having lower genetic variation, the OF-stressed populations showed much higher levels of variation about the mean enzyme activity, at least two orders of magnitude higher, than the unstressed populations. Knowledge of the genetics of OF resistance in these populations confirmed that the increase in variance was not due to the general switching on of genes in response to stress.
   5. One field population that had been exposed to heavy metal pollution had similar levels of esterase activity and variation about the mean as the unstressed populations, suggesting that variation only increases in characters directly affected by the environmental pollutant.
   6. The probable factors causing the increase in variance and the potential of this type of variation as a biomarker of stressful environments are discussed.

AB  - Building energy waste has become one of the major challenges confronting the world today, so specifications and targets for building energy efficiency have been put forward in countries around the world in recent years. The schematic design stage matters a lot for building energy efficiency, while most architects nowadays are less likely to make energy efficiency design decisions in this stage due to the lack of necessary means and methods for analysis. An integrated multi-objective multivariate framework for optimization analysis is proposed for the schematic design stage in the paper. Here, the design parameters of the building morphology and the design parameters of the building envelope are integrated for analysis, and an integrated performance prediction model is established for low-rise and medium-rise residential buildings. Then, a comparison of the performance indicators of low-rise and medium-rise residential buildings under five typical urban climatic conditions is carried out, and the change patterns of the lighting environment, thermal environment, building energy demand, and life cycle cost of residential buildings in each city under different morphological parameters and design parameters of the building envelope are summarized. Specific analysis methods and practical tools are provided in the study for architectural design to ensure thermal comfort, lighting comfort, low energy consumption, and low life-cycle cost requirement, and this design method can inspire and guide the climate adaptation analysis and design process of low-rise and medium-rise residential buildings in China, improve architects' perception of energy-saving design principles of low-rise and medium-rise residential buildings on the ontological level, as well as provide them with a method to follow and a case to follow in the actual design process.

AB  - Geothermal energy is a characteristic of widely distributed, high capacity factor, high reliability, and lower environmental impact potential values. And it will play an important role in achieving the goal of carbon neutral carbon peak. Nonetheless, geothermal energy presents its own particular challenges, i.e., the high investment cost and long payback period. The binary flashing cycle (BFC) system is proved to be a promising power generation technology due to the efficient and full utilization of a low-grade heat source. While the economic performance still needs further evaluation, in the present study, the thermo-economic comparison between organic Rankine cycle (ORC) and the BFC for geothermal energy has been investigated. R245fa has been chosen as the working fluid. Considering the thermodynamic and economic performance simutaneously, several evaluation indicators were selected including thermal efficiency, exergy efficiency, net power output per ton geothermal water, heat exchanger area, and heat recovery efficiency, and the system modeling and comparison were presented. The simulation results reveal that the BFC system obtains 32% more net power output than the ORC system under the working conditions investigated. The heat recovery efficiency of the BFC is 1.96 times as much as that of the ORC, which indicates that the BFC can realize the full utilization of low-grade energy. And more heat exchanger areas are required in the BFC system. What is more, the preliminary discussion of the economic feasibility of BFC system applied in the FengShun geothermal power plant is presented. The payback period of the BFC is just 6.0 years under the generation pressure of 600 kPa. It is indicated that the BFC system has obvious economic benefits, especially in a nonflowing geothermal well.

AB  - 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a genetic condition associated with a markedly increased risk for psychosis. Psychotic experiences are classically evaluated by clinical interviews that give little information about these symptoms' fluctuation in daily-life. The current study aims to investigate these phenomena using the Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), a structured diary technique that collects real-life measures in the everyday-life context, and to examine how these manifestations relate to a gold standard semi-structured assessment of psychotic experiences.
   Eighty-six individuals with 22q11DS as well as healthy controls (HC) aged 11-27 years were recruited. They completed a 6-day EMA protocol assessing momentary psychotic experiences as well as positive and negative affect. The presence of (attenuated) psychotic symptoms was assessed in 22q11DS participants with the SIPS interview.
   Participants with 22q11DS reported more intense (p = .005) and more frequent (p = .006) momentary psychotic experiences than HC. Significant associations between negative affect and momentary psychotic experiences were observed in both groups (p = .001). In participants with 22q11DS, more intense (p = <.001) and more frequent (p = <.001) momentary psychotic experiences measured by EMA were associated with the severity of SIPS positive symptoms. Participants with 22q11DS reporting at least attenuated positive symptoms of psychosis on the SIPS had more intense (p = .027) and more frequent (p = .023) momentary psychotic experiences than participants with 22q11DS without psychotic symptoms.
   This study highlights the validity of EMA to assess psychotic experiences in the context of daily-life and sets correspondence between EMA and the SIPS. Furthermore, it expands our current understanding of the associations between mood and psychotic experiences.

AB  - Mining areas are suffering from serious environmental hazards, such as soil erosion, water pollution as well as land degradation. In this study, two types of mining areas in Anhui Province, China-one a copper mining area and the other a coal mining area-were selected to compare the soil properties under different vegetation restoration conditions, which can be generally classified into reclaimed and non-reclaimed areas. Soil catalase and urease activities and soil chemical properties were chosen to be the main indicators of soil quality. Principal component analysis was used to evaluate the overall soil fertility in the copper and coal mining areas. Results showed that in the copper mining area soil catalase activity was between 12.36 and 19.17 mu g g(-1) h(-1) and urease activity was between 0.03 and 12.05 mu g g(-1) h(-1). And in coal mining area, soil catalase activity was between 3.52 and 9.72 mu g g(-1) h(-1) and urease activity was between 2.71 and 10.81 mu g g(-1) h(-1). Moreover, soil catalase and urease activities in degraded areas were lower than those in reclaimed areas. Soil catalase activity and soil urease activity were significantly correlated with total potassium and total nitrogen, respectively. Soil quality in land types with vegetation restoration was higher than in non-reclaimed areas and old subsidence areas, while soil quality in the copper mining area was generally higher than in the coal mining area. Thus, the optimum measure in this region to ameliorate these degraded soils is vegetation restoration, which helps not only to improve the environment, but also to enhance soil quality in these degraded lands.

AB  - In recent years, floods have acquired global importance due to their devastating nature that can cause massive damage to infrastructure and society. The Himalayan foothill is very susceptible to flood since time immemorial, and therefore, the present study tries to assess the flood risk of the sub-Himalayan Jalpaiguri region using a multi-criteria decision approach. Hitherto, a detailed assessment of flood in the Himalayan foothill region is not carried due to a comprehensive database limitation. However, for the first time, a multi-source data of about seventeen parameters including, flood conditioning factors (viz. altitude, distance from rivers, slope, drainage density, geomorphology, flow accumulation, rainfall, topographic wetness index, geology, and soil) and socio-economic and infrastructural indicators (viz. population density, household density, Landcover, road distance, proximity to flood shelter, proximity to hospital and literacy) were used to prepare the flood susceptibility, vulnerability, and flood risk map for the study area. Furthermore, an administrative-wise microlevel risk assessment was also carried out in the present study. The result indicates that about 38% of the area is susceptible to high and very high flood zones, while about 58% of the area is covered under high to very high vulnerability zone. In the final flood risk map, about 29% of the area is under a high threat level that seeks immediate consideration. Furthermore, the reliability of this work can be assessed by validating the model using AUC, which gives an accuracy of 0.862 or 86.2%. Thus, the overall approach of this study can be applied for mitigation strategy and to prepare a policy framework to alleviate future flood incidences.

AB  - In this paper, a novel dual-purpose green energy storage system with the aim of power and potable water production is proposed and investigated from the thermodynamic and economic points of view. The proposed system is based on an innovative combination of compressed air energy storage with solar heliostat and multieffect thermal vapor compression desalination units that provides power and clean water without any emissions. This system not only stores low price electricity as compressed air during off-peak times for peak shaving at high demand periods, but it also produces freshwater by recovering the waste heat that is a byproduct of the system at both charging and discharging periods. Exploiting solar energy for increasing the air turbine inlet temperature instead of using the conventional combustion chambers makes the system entirely environmentally friendly. Performing energy, exergy, and exergoeconomic analyses, an artificial neural network algorithm is developed to predict round trip efficiency and total cost rate as the leading indicators for energy and economic performance of the proposed system. Then, the obtained relations are introduced to the genetic algorithm for multi-objective optimization that considers both technical and economic aspects. The round trip efficiency and total cost rate are calculated to be 48.7% and 3056 $/h under the optimal design condition, respectively. Finally, utilizing the proposed system in the case study of San Francisco, United States of America, a total potable water production of 226,782 m3 and power generation of 27,551 MWh in a year with a payback period of 2.65 years were achieved.

AB  - This study was developed to carry out a comprehensive radiological assessment of natural radioactivity for river sediment samples from Calabria, southern Italy, and to define a baseline background for the area on a radiation map. In the studied area, elevated levels of natural radionuclides are expected, due to the outcropping acidic intrusive and metamorphic rocks from which the radioactive elements derive. To identify and quantify the natural radioisotopes, ninety river sediment samples from nine selected coastal sampling points (ten samples for each point) were collected as representative of the Ionian and the Tyrrhenian coastline of Calabria. The samples were analyzed using a gamma ray spectrometer equipped with a high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector. The values of mean activity concentrations of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 measured for the studied samples are (21.3 +/- 6.3) Bq kg(-1), (30.3 +/- 4.5) Bq kg(-1) and (849 +/- 79) Bq kg(-1), respectively. The calculated radiological hazard indices showed average values of 63 nGy h(-1) (absorbed dose rate), 0.078 mSv y(-1) (effective dose outdoors), 0.111 mSv y(-1) (effective dose indoors), 63 Bq kg(-1) (radium equivalent), 0.35 (H-ex), 0.41 (H-in), 0.50 (activity concentration index) and 458 mu Sv y(-1) (Annual Gonadal Equivalent Dose, AGED). In order to delineate the spatial distribution of natural radionuclides on the radiological map and to identify the areas with low, medium and high radioactivity values, the Surfer 10 software was employed. Finally, the multivariate statistical analysis was performed to deduce the interdependency and any existing relationships between the radiological indices and the concentrations of the radionuclides. The results of this study, also compared with values of other locations of the Italian Peninsula characterized by similar local geological conditions, can be used as a baseline for future investigations about radioactivity background in the investigated area.

AB  - Total phenolic compounds (TPC) and the chlorogenic acids content of potato by-product extracts of two hydro alcoholic solvents (methanol, ethanol) and two extraction methods (maceration and heating-assisted extraction) were studied. The content of TPC in the extracts was determined spectrometrically according to the Folin-Ciocalteu procedure and calculated as chlorogenic acid equivalents. Soluble phenolic acids, especially the chlorogenic acids, were performed by HPLC. The antioxidant activity of potato by-product extracts was determined by using the total oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) method. The highest content of TPC was found in raw and lyophilized red waters when using ethanol as a solvent around 57 mg/g fresh weight. Heating-assisted extraction enhances this quantitative increasing. At the given operating conditions, unpeeled potato samples exhibit a higher TPC than peeled ones, showing that TPC are accumulated in skin tissue. The greatest amount of chlorogenic acid (Caffeoyl-Quinic Acids, 3, 4, 5 CQA), mainly the 5-CQA (870 +/- 39.66 mu g/g WM for wet matter versus DM dry matter), was obtained in the pellets and lyophilized fresh peels (skin vs. flesh). In addition, the greatest amounts of chlorogenic acids were found when potato peels were extracted with methanol. Heating-assisted extraction improved the chlorogenic acid concentration of the potato peel extracts. The total ORAC amounts recorded in the different potato fractions varied between 1500 and 1650 mu M TE/g. They were higher than those of some fruits, vegetables, nuts, cereals, and sweet potato cultivar. The good correlation coefficient found between TPC, chlorogenic acids determination, and the ORAC capacity indicates that the TPC can be used as a good indicator of the antioxidant capacity of potato by-products.

AB  - Detecting reactive oxygen species (ROS) that play a critical role as redox modulators and signalling molecules in biological systems currently requires invasive methods such as ROS-specific indicators for imaging and quantification. We developed a non-invasive, real-time, label-free imaging technique for assessing the level of ROS in live cells and thawed cryopreserved tissues that is compatible with in-vivo imaging. The technique is based on autofluorescence multispectral imaging (AFMI) carried out in an adapted fluorescence microscope with an expanded number of spectral channels spanning specific excitation (365 nm-495 nm) and emission (420 nm-700 nm) wavelength ranges. We established a strong quantitative correlation between the spectral information obtained from AFMI and the level of ROS obtained from CellROX staining. The results were obtained in several cell types (HeLa, PANC1 and mesenchymal stem cells) and in live kidney tissue. Additioanly,two spectral regimes were considered: with and without UV excitation (wavelengths > 400 nm); the latter being suitable for UV-sensitive systems such as the eye. Data were analyzed by linear regression combined with an optimization method of swarm intelligence. This allowed the calibration of AFMI signals to the level of ROS with excellent correlation (R = 0.84, p = 0.00) in the entire spectral range and very good correlation (R = 0.78, p = 0.00) in the limited, UV-free spectral range. We also developed a strong classifier which allowed us to distinguish moderate and high levels of ROS in these two regimes (AUC = 0.91 in the entire spectral range and AUC = 0.78 for UV-free imaging). These results indicate that ROS in cells and tissues can be imaged non-invasively, which opens the way to future clinical applications in conditions where reactive oxygen species are known to contribute to progressive disease such as in ophthalmology, diabetes, kidney disease, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Transpiration is a crucial component in the hydrological cycle and a key parameter in many disciplines like agriculture, forestry, ecology and hydrology. Sap flow measurements are one of the most widely used approaches to estimate whole-plant transpiration in woody species; this is due to their applicability in different environments and in a variety of species as well as the fact that continuous high temporal resolution measurements of this parameter are possible. Several techniques have been developed and tested under different climatic conditions and using different wood properties. However, the scientific literature also identifies considerable sources of error when using sap flow measurements that need to be accounted for, including probe misalignment, wounding, thermal diffusivity and stem water content.
   This study aims to explore probe misalignment as a function of time in order to improve measurements during long-term field campaigns ( > 3 months). The heat ratio method (HRM) was chosen because it can assess low and reverse flows. Sensors were installed in four Pinus halepensis trees for 20 months. The pines were located in a coastal valley in south-eastern Spain (39 degrees 57 ' 45 '' N 1 degrees 8 ' 31 '' W) that is characterised by a Mediterranean climate. We conclude that even small geometrical misalignments in the probe placement can create a significant error in sap flow estimations. Additionally, we propose that new statistical information should be recorded during the measurement period which can subse-quently be used as a quality control of the sensor output. The relative standard deviation and slope against time of the averaged v(1)/v(2) were used as quality indicators. We conclude that no general time limit can be set regarding the longevity of the sensors, and this threshold should rather be determined from individual performance over time.

AB  - As an emerging soil amendment, biochar has attracted widespread attention worldwide. However, comprehensive research on the hydrothermal changes in biochar during natural freezing and thawing and the growth of crops after freezing and thawing has not yet been performed. The purpose of this study was to investigate the hydrothermal changes in biochar during freeze-thaw conditions and the variation in plant indicators in different biochar addition plots. Soybean was selected as the test crop via field experimentation. Biochar was applied to the soil at an areal density of 9 kg/m(2) in autumn, spring, autumn and spring mixed application to identify whether biochar could be widely beneficial. The results showed that after natural freezing and thawing, biochar could provide a good accumulated temperature for crop growth before sowing and effectively improve soil moisture, causing the soil in the root zone of each study site to change slightly. At the same time, biochar application promotes crop growth; however, the effects of different application methods vary. Compared with the control case, in the case of spring biochar application, the plant height and leaf area increased by 20% and 6.3%, respectively, while the stem diameter decreased by 6.1%. The leaf nitrogen content and leaf chlorophyll content basically remained the same. In addition, in the case of multiple biochar applications, we found that the difference between soybean stem diameter and leaf area was the greatest of all the application modes. In the case of application in spring and autumn mixed, the differences in the soybean indicators within the same experimental plot were the greatest. Compared with the control results, the autocorrelation of application in spring and autumn mixed is weak and does not affect actual production. Therefore, the difference caused by biochar application can be approximately ignored.
