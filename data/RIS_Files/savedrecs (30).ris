LA  - English
AB  - The effects of temperature and photoperiod on flower and inflorescence initiation during the autumn were investigated in the strawberry cv. Elsanta. The variation in starch under these environmental conditions was also recorded, to test whether this might provide a useful indicator of the onset of imposed and/or true dormancy. Photoperiod had no effect on the rate of flower initiation or final flower number in the primary, secondary or tertiary inflorescences. Temperature had little effect on the final flower number in the primary inflorescence. However, the rate of flower initiation increased linearly with increasing temperature in the secondary (r(2) = 0.98) and tertiary inflorescences (r(2) = 0.97), to an optimum of 18.6 degrees C in the secondary and 19.9 degrees C in the tertiary inflorescence, and declined at temperatures above these. The quantity of starch in the roots increased during the autumn, and the rate of increase was negatively correlated with temperature. This indicates that root starch concentration is determined by temperature and therefore is not a useful indicator of the onset of true dormancy in 'Elsanta'.

AB  - Recent regional cooling has impacted the natural systems of the Antarctic Peninsula (AP); however, little is known concerning the changes in the high parts of the glacial systems. Dry-snow line (DSL), situated in the high parts of glaciers, is the uppermost limit of frequent or occasional surface melt. We analyse dry-snow line altitude (DSLA) changes on the AP during 2004-2020 using C-band synthetic aperture radar time series data. We demonstrate that the DSLA in the eastern part of the AP is usually higher than that of the western part. Moreover, using simulated climatic variables from regional climate models, the lowering in altitude of DSL of glaciers in most areas is identified as a response to a decrease in snowmelt and an increase in precipitation. Furthermore, correlation analyses between simulated climatic variables and the DSLA are conducted. These results present the sensitive response of variations in DSLA to meteorological conditions, and the capability of DSLA being a proxy of polar local climate in high-altitude areas with no in situ meteorological observations.

KW  - environmental accounting information disclosure
AB  - The resource and environment problems have becoming increasingly serious these days. Under this condition, the traditional accounting methods are no long applicable to the actual situations of the manufacturing industry. Thus, it is of practical significance to explore the current status of environmental accounting information disclosure of the manufacturing industry in China and figure out the causes of these problems. Existing studies on environmental accounting information disclosure of the manufacturing industry in the context of a low-carbon economy mode generally give analysis and comparison from the perspective of the game theory, and there is not a comprehensive standard analysis framework yet. To fill in this research gap, this paper evaluated the environmental accounting information disclosure level of the manufacturing industry in the low-carbon economy environment, adopted the game theory to analyse the information disclosure problem of environmental accounting of Chinese manufacturing industry and research the disclosure level evaluation problem. Moreover, this paper built a hybrid-strategy static game model for government regulators and manufacturing enterprises, and the effectiveness of the proposed model was verified by experimental results.

AB  - This paper investigates a grid-connected rooftop home-based building attached photovoltaic (BAPV) system in Shanghai, China. A photovoltaic (PV) system has good economic and environmental benefits. In this study, the net present value and the payback period (PP) are adapted to determine the system profitability based on 3 years' measured data of the 3 kW BAPV system. Additionally, the indicators of the energy payback time, the energy return on investment, the greenhouse gas per kilowatt hour, the greenhouse-gas payback time and the greenhouse gas return on investment are applied to assess its sustainability by using life-cycle assessment. Meanwhile, this paper analyzes the comprehensive benefits under the impact of dust. Particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) has an adverse impact on PV systems. This paper presents a study explaining the impact of PM2.5 on the performance of PV panels in the same humidity season. Economic damage from PM2.5 should not be ignored. Three economic models under the condition of haze are presented.

AB  - With the current energy environment background and development of the electrification of the automotive industry, a comprehensive economic indicator, in which the battery aging is further considered on the basis of conventional energy consumption, is proposed to research the energy optimization problem of two-speed electric vehicles. Firstly, a battery life model that adapts to vehicles under high dynamic conditions is introduced. Then, the speed optimal control problem of the two-speed electric vehicles in the acceleration-cruise-deceleration process is established and solved. Finally, the simulation results of two different performance indicators are contrasted and the performance improvement of the two-speed gearbox to the electric vehicles is analyzed. The simulation results under various working scenarios and driving cycles demonstrate that, compared with the conventional economic indicator considering the energy consumption only, the proposed economic indicator can significantly improve the battery life. In addition, it can also be seen that, compared with the one-speed electric vehicles, the application of a two-speed gearbox provides better performance from the aspects of battery aging saving and energy consumption.

AB  - The assumption that the telecommunications industry has natural monopoly characteristics dominated industrial policy during the twentieth century, supporting the monopolistic structure of telecommunications markets all across the world, and still prevails in many views on the economy of this field. The high level of concentration of telecommunications markets is often considered as a natural way of its development and some claim that this is a necessary condition for innovations in the industry. Meanwhile, the evolution of telecommunications in Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union has shown quite the opposite. The industry in the country was able to demonstrate a relatively low level of market concentration, at least in some of the areas, to provide a high quality and a large variety of telecommunications services at significantly lower prices, in comparison with western countries, and shows one of the best indicators of network development in the world. While the Russian case poses quandaries for mainstream theories, the phenomenon fits the view of the Austrian school at the market process and exposes the benefits that the competitive order can bring to society.

AB  - The aim of this study is to assess the performance of anaerobic digestion against co-digestion systems during the start-up stages based on key process parameters and biological indicators. Two parallel experiments treating sewage sludge alone or co-digested with low concentration of pig manure (8% vol., 2-3% in COD basis) were carried out in two lab-scale CSTR at mesophilic conditions. Same inoculant and organic loading rate sequences were applied for two consecutive runs of 79 and 90 days. According to the removal efficiencies achieved, no significant differences were encountered amongst mono-digestion and co-digestion. This observation was reinforced with the analysis of the total/active microbiome, sequencing 16S rRNA genes and transcripts. The addition of a co-substrate at low concentration had a negligible effect on the total/active microbial communities; they evolved following the same pattern. This might be an advantage in order to upgrade existing wastewater treatment plants to become centralized biogas facilities.

AB  - The predictions for a warmer and drier climate and for increased likelihood of climate extremes raise high concerns about the possible collapse of dryland ecosystems, and about the formation of new drylands where native species are less tolerant to water stress. Using a dryland-vegetation model for plant species that display different tradeoffs between fast growth and tolerance to droughts, we find that ecosystems subjected to strong seasonal variability, typical for drylands, exhibit a temporal period-doubling route to chaos that results in early collapse to bare soil. We further find that fast-growing plants go through period doubling sooner and span wider chaotic ranges than stress-tolerant plants. We propose the detection of period-doubling signatures in power spectra as early indicators of ecosystem collapse that outperform existing indicators in their ability to warn against climate extremes and capture the heightened vulnerability of newly-formed drylands. The proposed indicator is expected to apply to other types of ecosystems, such as consumer-resource and predator-prey systems. We conclude by delineating the conditions ecosystems should meet in order for the proposed indicator to apply.

AB  - The existing analyses of the electricity gas systems generally do not regard the nodal gas temperature as a state variable. However, the temperature variations caused by the thermodynamic process are important because of the following two reasons: 1) gas temperature influences the pressure and gas flow; 2) gas temperature is an important indicator for hydrate formation in gas networks, which greatly jeopardizes the gas transmission. We herein propose a probabilistic energy flow method considering the thermodynamic process in gas networks. To build the energy flow model, the algebraic pipeline flow model under the non-isothermal condition is derived according to a set of partial differential equations reflecting the thermodynamic process. The models of pressure-regulating stations and compression stations considering the thermodynamic processes are presented in an electricity gas analysis for the first time. Risk indices are proposed to quantify the risks of hydrate formation and state variables that exceed the limits. The simulation results of two test cases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article will show that within well-defined error margins, carbon intensities and energy intensities are independent of the population and GDP of countries and thus can serve as a convenient parametrization of humanity on a sovereign level.
   The IPCC, in its fifth international report, states that the two leading contributions to changes in annual CO2 emissions by decade are the changes in population and changes in GDP/capita, which reflect changes in standard of living. This article will show that within well-defined error margins, carbon intensities, and energy intensities (both with respect to GDP) are independent of the population and GDP of countries and thus can serve as a convenient parametrization of humanity. With some imagination, these parameters can serve as input and output indicators that connect the physical environment with the human environment. The article will show that both indicators fit lognormal distribution well without any outliers. The data are based on the World Bank database. Comparing the global distribution with individual world-bank indicators of world-bank country grouping based on socioeconomic conditions quantifies the contributions of global income distribution.

AB  - It is essential to provide reliable localization results to allow mobile robots to navigate autonomously. Even though many state-of-the-art localization schemes have so far shown satisfactory performance in various environments, localization has still been difficult under specific conditions, such as extreme environmental changes. Since many robots cannot diagnose for themselves whether the localization results are reliable, there can be serious autonomous navigation problems. To solve this problem, this study proposes a self-diagnosis scheme for the localization status. In this study, two indicators are empirically defined for the self-diagnosis of localization status. Each indicator shows significant changes when there are difficulties in light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor-based localization. In addition, the classification model of localization status is trained through machine learning using the two indicators. A robot can diagnose the localization status itself using the proposed classification model. To verify the usefulness of the proposed method, we carried out localization experiments in real environments.

AB  - The response of bacteria in terms of abundance, production and community structure to changes induced by the discharge of primary treated sewage waters was investigated combining microbiological, chemical and molecular tools. The primary treatment did not affect substantially the bacterial community structure in wastewaters and did not reduce the concentrations of fecal indicators. The spatial distribution of the sewage plume was governed by vertical stratification and currents. Bacterial abundance and production in the sea receiving waste waters depended predominantly on environmental conditions. In the waters with the highest concentration of fecal pollution indicators the bacterial community was characterized by allochthonous bacteria belonging to Epsilonproteobacteria, Firmicutes, Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. The latter two taxa were also present in unpolluted waters but had a different structure, typical for oligotrophic environments. Although the impact of primary treated sewage waters was limited, a sanitary risk persisted due to the relevant presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Currently, a consensus has been reached to protect and restore cut-off meanders. Therefore, it is important to understand how these wetlands function. To our knowledge, the spatial and temporal distribution of both benthic diatoms and macroinvertebrates, associated with macrophytes communities, linked to the geomorphology, has not been studied extensively. In the upstream and intermediate zones, the low water temperature and the high conductivity revealed a connection with the groundwater. Moreover, the geomorphological riffle characterizing the intermediate zone created the same downwelling and upwelling processes as in running water, with a groundwater/hyporheic/surface water ecotone and produced physico-chemical differences between the upstream and the downstream zones and thereby modify the diatom, macroinvertebrate and macrophyte distribution. Downstream, water input from the main channel of the Allier River allowed the development of taxa observed in the River. All these hydrological connections and the sedimentation modified the physical, chemical and geomorphological characteristics, thereby, creating a gradient of water quality, influencing the distribution of the biotic communities.

AB  - Modeling depression in animals has inherent complexities that are augmented by intrinsic difficulties to measure the characteristic features of the disorder. Herein, we describe the PhenoWorld (PhW), a new setting in which groups of six rats lived in an ethological enriched environment, and have their feeding, locomotor activity, sleeping and social behavior automatically monitored. A battery of emotional and cognitive tests was used to characterize the behavioral phenotype of animals living in the PhW and in standard conditions (in groups of six and two rats), after exposure to an unpredictable chronic mild stress paradigm (uCMS) and antidepressants. Data reveal that animals living in the PhW displayed similar, but more striking, behavioral differences when exposed to uCMS, such as increased behavioral despair shown in the forced swimming test, resting/sleep behavior disturbances and reduced social interactions. Moreover, several PhW-cage behaviors, such as spontaneous will to go for food or exercise in running wheels, proved to be sensitive indicators of depressive-like behavior. In summary, this new ethological enriched paradigm adds significant discriminative power to screen depressive-like behavior, in particularly rodent's hedonic behavior.

AB  - Decay rates for sunlight inactivation of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) markers for total Bacteroidales, human-specific Bacteroidales, Escherichia coli, and Bifidobacterium adolescentis relative to cultured E. coli were investigated. The experiment used 100-L chambers of fresh water and seawater (paired with dark controls) seeded with human sewage and exposed to natural sunlight over three summer days. Culturable E. coli levels in sunlight-exposed chambers decreased by at least 3 logs on day 1, and by day 3 a total reduction of 4.5 to 5.5 logs was achieved in fresh water and seawater, respectively. In contrast, PCR detection of the four gene targets in sunlight-exposed chambers reduced by no more than 2 logs over the duration of the study (k(t) < 0.071 log(e) units h(-1)). Under these experimental conditions, PCR markers are considerably more conservative than culturable E. coli and can persist for extended periods of time following inactivation of E. coli.

AB  - LDM process is used for preparing three-dimensional scaffolds for tissue engineering rapid prototyping technologies. Because of its forming process is complex, influenced by a variety of factors caused by processing environment is not stable, the forming of scaffold pore size can not be guaranteed, forming precision is poor. So there is a need for forming parameters to optimize. Aim at LDM process characteristics, the paper determine the main process parameters that affect the bone scaffold forming quality. First, the influence degree of process parameters on one of indexes such as wire width precision and wire height precision is determined by orthogonal experiment. Then, in the problem of a number of process parameters optimization, using the degree of grey incidence method, the number of process indicators of the optimization problem is transformed into the single degree of gray correlation maximization problem, realizing multi-objective parameter optimization. The experiment results show that, using the combined optimization of technological parameters of preparation of bone scaffold, it's forming quality is good, and it can well meet the stem cell growth conditions.

AB  - Conservation often focuses on ecologically intact' habitats with little human influence. But where all such habitats have been lost or modified, identifying promising restoration targets is a key goal. We describe a direct approach to identify high conservation value targets using predictive distribution maps of taxa that, based on habitat affinity, ease of detection and abundance can be used to infer native species richness and prioritize conservation investment. We used 1169 avian point counts in a 1560 km2 study area, remote-sensed data and models incorporating imperfect detectability to predict habitat occupancy in 18 widely-distributed native birds; 12 of which were determined by experts to be positive indicators of old-forest conditions. Forest-association scores for these 12 species where then used as weights in a composite distribution map of the probability of community occurrence, which corresponded well with the occurrence of old forest stands mapped by aerial photography. Our results indicate that composite maps of widespread indicators improve site prioritization by incorporating the behavioural and demographic responses of a diverse range of indicators to variation in patch size, configuration and adjacent human land use.

AB  - Photo-acclimatisation by the algal endosymbionts of scleractinian corals to changes in environmental conditions may influence their density and/or the concentration of photosynthetic pigments, and hence coral brightness, on short time-scales. To examine coral pigmentation as a bioindicator of water quality, the brightness of massive corals was quantified using colour charts, concentrations of the pigment chlorophyll a and reflectance spectrometry in the field and with manipulative experiments. Along a water quality gradient, massive Porites became progressively lighter as nutrients decreased and irradiance increased. A laboratory experiment showed that Porites nubbins darkened within 25 days following exposure to reduced water quality. The results of a transplantation experiment of Porites nubbins in a manipulation incorporating multiple depths and zones of water quality confirmed colony brightness as a simple tool to monitor changes in marine water quality, provided effects due to other influences on pigmentation, e.g. seawater temperatures, are taken into consideration.

AB  - Four strains and 2 strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from the commercial yogurt and kimchi products in Korea, respectively. Based on the 16S rRNA sequencing data, strain A from a drink-type yogurt manufactured by dairy company S, was a Gram-positive, rod-shaped Lactobacillus helveticus, and both strain B (company N) and D (company H) were identified as L. casei ssp. casei, and strain C (company L) as L. paracasei. None of yogurt strain B and D was recovered from the samples exposed to the simulated gastric juice, pH 2.0 for 1.5 hr. Of the 6 isolates tested, strain YS93 from kimchi was the most resistant to acidic condition using the simulated gastric juice, pH 2.0. Moreover, it was shown that 2 kimchi isolates and yogurt strain D produced antibacterial substances, probably bacteriocin-like peptide, which was inhibitory against Staphylococcus aureus as an indicator. In an adhesion assay using a Caco-2 cell, the adherence activity of kimchi strains YS29 and YS93 was significantly higher than those of 4 yogurt starter strains tested.

AB  - Electrical kindling refers to the seizure-generating properties of brain stimulation. In addition to producing epilepsy, the reorganization of forebrain neurocircuitry associated with kindling contributes to psychiatric disturbances involving fear and anxiety. The amygdala is a limbic structure that kindles readily and regulates the complex neurocircuitry underlying emotional responding. Dopamine-containing ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons, known to be activated by threatening environmental stimuli, are an important component of the amygdala-based fear network. Using amygdala kindling as an indicator of sensitization development, we report here that repeated low-current, high-frequency stimulation of the VTA provoked afterdischarge in the central amygdala and enhanced kindling rate. By establishing a fundamental link between VTA activation and neural excitability in the central amygdala, the present results are consistent with the possibility of a common process underlying epileptogenisis and the fear motivational consequences of amygdala and VTA kindling. Considering the established role of the VTA and the amygdala in emotional responding, such a sensitization mechanism might mediate exaggerated fearfulness.

AB  - Two breeding groups of rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) housed in outdoor enclosures on Key Lois island were observed for 84 hours. Instantaneous scan sampling of a focal animal was used to gather data to test hypotheses concerning frequencies of agonistic and affiliative behaviors as well as differential use of pickle barrels as enrichment objects. Type of barrel used, behavior, and age/sex class of the animal were noted. Barrels were arranged three ways: unattached, on a swivel, and stationary. The behaviors of animals in an enriched environment were compared with control condition animals, which did not have pickle barrels. Animals in an enriched environment accounted for 60.8% (n = 56) of total affiliative contact, 62.2% (n = 399) of total social grooming, and 26% (n = 5) of total agonistic noncontact. A total of 134 scans of barrel use were observed. Analyses of the data showed that swivel and stationary barrels were used the most (55% of all scans of barrel use). Yearlings, juvenile females, and old males used barrels most often (82.8% of all scans of barrel use), although they constituted only 39% of the enriched environment population. In this study, pickle barrels provided enrichment for young and old animals of both sexes.

AB  - Purpose This paper presents a novel disturbance estimation-triggered control solution for the robust tracking problem of active suspensions. Methods A disturbance estimation-triggered mechanism based on a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) combined with a disturbance effect indicator (DEI) is introduced to reject detrimental disturbances while preserving beneficial disturbances. To simultaneously deal with the exogenous and endogenous uncertainties, an uncertain nonlinear model is adopted in the control design. Unlike previous results, which required a measure of the sprung mass vertical displacement, the proposed strategy requires only the measure of the suspension deflection and facilitates the practical implementation. A linear oscillator with high-static-low-dynamic stiffness is proposed to generate the dynamic reference trajectory. Results The proposed active suspension control system is rigorously proven to be input-to-state stable (ISS) by virtue of Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the proposed controller is used in experimental and numerical environments and compared with classical disturbance-rejection controllers. Conclusion Detailed results with various road conditions are provided to demonstrate the improved transient and steady-state tracking performances of the proposed control framework.

AB  - Infertility has become a global health issue, with approximately 50% of infertility cases generated by disorders in male reproduction. Spermatozoa are conveyed towards female genital tracts in a safe surrounding provided by the seminal plasma. Interestingly, this dynamically changing medium is a rich source of proteins, essential not only for sperm transport, but also for its protection and maturation. Most of the seminal proteins are acquired by spermatozoa in transit through exosomes (epididymosomes and prostasomes). The high number of seminal proteins, the increasing knowledge of their origins and biological functions and their differential expression in the case of azoospermia, asthenozoospermia, oligozoospermia and teratozoospermia or other conditions of male infertility have allowed the identification of a wide variety of biomarker candidates and their involvement in biological pathways, thus to strongly suggest that the proteomic landscape of seminal plasma may be a potential indicator of sperm dysfunction. This review summarizes the current knowledge in seminal plasma proteomics and its potentiality as a diagnostic tool in different degrees of male infertility.

AB  - Intestinal flora plays an important role in inflammatory response to systemic or local organs of its host. High calorie diet has been shown to aggravate the condition of pneumonia and delay recovery, especially in children. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study placed SPF rats in a conventional environment, high calorie diet or LPS atomization was performed respectively or combined. Analysis of high-throughput sequencing of intestinal content combined with animal weight, organ index, serum inflammatory factors indicators and bioinformatics found that after pulmonary infection combined with a high-calorie diet, rats showed significant changes such as weight loss and increased lung weight index, and their lung and intestinal tissues showed more obvious inflammatory changes. And its gut flora structure suggests, the abundance of Leuconostocaceae in significantly reduced; abundance of Staphylococcus, Planococcaceae, Staphylococcus, Staphylococcaceae, Bacillales, Gemellales and Aerococcus significant increased. The study showed that high calorie diet and LPS atomization synergistically promoted pneumonia process in rat pups, which is related to changes in structure of intestinal flora. It is worth noting that pneumonia rats fed by convention diet also causing intestinal flora imbalance.

AB  - Desertification is a complex phenomenon defined as the extreme degree of land degradation induced by human activities and climatic conditions. Climate change is accelerating and widening these areas.
   Previews analysis and studies assessed the vulnerability to desertification in Italy at national and regional level through a methodological approach based on integrating climate, soil, vegetation, and socio-economic data (ESA). The studies carried out by ISPRA aim to provide an update of the of land degradation assessment in Italy, based on Trends.Earth methodology and of the three UN-SDGs sub-indicators on Target 15.3.1 (land use/land cover, land productivity and soil organic carbon above and below ground status and trends), together with additional dimensions of land degradation considered crucial for national land characters. Final assessment of the percentage of degraded land is around 36% of national area. This exercise demonstrates the importance to consider a larger number of data and include information on other factors, such as climate, physical, chemical data. This integrated approach to the assessment of land degradation will allow to describe also of the loss of related ecosystem services.

AB  - Traffic visibility is an essential reference for safe driving. Nighttime conditions add to the difficulty of estimating traffic visibility. To estimate the visibility in nighttime traffic images, we propose a Traffic Sensibility Visibility Estimation (TSVE) algorithm that combines laser transmission and image processing and needs no reference to the corresponding fog-free images and camera calibration. The information required is first obtained via the roadside equipment which collects environmental data and captures road images and then analyzed locally or remotely. The proposed analysis includes calculating the current atmospheric transmissivity with the laser atmospheric transmission theory and acquiring image features by using the cameras and the adjustable brightness target. Image analysis is performed using two image processing algorithms, namely, dark channel prior (DCP) and image brightness contrast. Finally, to improve the accuracy of visibility estimation, multiple nonlinear regression (MNLR) is performed on the various visibility indicators obtained by the two methods. Extensive on-site measurements analysis confirms the advantages of TSVE. Compared with other visibility estimation methods, such as the laser atmospheric transmission theory and image analysis method, TSVE significantly decreases the estimation errors.

AB  - The potential application of olive mill wastewater (OMWW) and olive pomace (OP) extracts with lecithin (L) as antioxidants to enhance the stability of refined sunflower oil (SFO) during deep-frying (at 180 degrees C) was investigated. Changes in SFO during deep-frying conditions were evaluated according to some physical and chemical parameters. p-anisidine value (p-AV), conjugated dienes (CD), tocopherols, total polar compounds, free fatty acids (FFA), color (L*, a*, b*), viscosity and fatty acid composition were determined. According to the results, the addition of OMWW and OP extracts combined with lecithin inhibited lipid deterioration and retarded lipid oxidation. The oil containing extracts and/or lecithin showed a slight darkening as compared to the control. Profiles in the fatty acids were similar during deep-frying. The enrichment of SFO with OMWW and OP extracts is a beneficial application in the deep-frying oils and these extracts could be used with lecithin to retard lipid oxidation of oils during deep-frying.

AB  - Firefighters can suffer serious health problems and experience cardiac disorders derived from high pollutants inhalation. During experimental field burns, environmental and heart rate data from firefighters were collected and it was possible to observe that changes in heart rate were related with variations in pollutants inhalation. Therefore, detecting changes in heart rate may provide a good indicator to identify hazardous situations for firefighters. An automated method, based on the detection of changes in the heart rate, is proposed to prevent and to avoid serious undesirable side-effects in the health of firefighters due to pollutants inhalation. Within the experiments performed, a precision and a recall of 91.5 and 78.2%, respectively, were obtained. Furthermore, this approach can be part of a real-time decision support system for routine use in firefighting practice. Our results show the potential to provide effective support in real operational scenarios and that further research on the impact of environmental conditions in the well-being of firefighters is of utmost importance.

AB  - The paper demonstrates that the outcome of the robust and conditional directional distance version of the BoD model not only contains information on the overall efficiency score and rank, but also enables a region to identify its genuine peers, disentangle the overall effect of the background conditions on the performance and assess one's relative strengths and relative weakness vis-a-vis its most relevant peers when evaluating its municipal solid waste management. We illustrate how this information can be retrieved from the outcomes of DEA/BoD based efficiency and performance benchmarking studies by applying the methodology to the case of the Brussels Capital Region. The results show that Freiburg Hamburg and the province of Limburg are in general the most interesting peers for the Brussels Capital Region. In addition, the analysis reveals that Freiburg is identified as the most instructive peers if the region is interested in improving its composting and recycling rate.

AB  - A variant of established work on the demand for military expenditure is developed based on a practical concept of fiscal space from the perspective of short-term government choices concerning public expenditures. A new indicator, referred to as fiscal capacity, is defined and used as a candidate explanatory variable in an empirical model of European defence spending over the 2007-2016 period. Fiscal capacity is found to outperform simpler measurements of economic conditions, notably GDP growth forecasts, in explaining changes in defence spending efforts as a share of GDP. Regarding security environment variables, the results suggest that Russia has recently come to be seen as a potential military threat by European nations, leading to defence spending increases, the more so the shorter the distance to stationed or deployed Russian forces, and particularly so by those European nations that have a land border with Russia. A prospective exercise is then carried out in order to assess the capacity of EU member states that are also members of NATO to reach NATO's 2% goal for defence spending over a mid-term horizon.

AB  - Coal-based power generates large quantities of coal ash in South Korea. However, coal ash recycling is still inactive and most wasted coal ash is buried in landfills. Recently, beneficial uses of coal ash such as in mine reclamation sites has been increasingly considered; however, as a result of legal limitations due to environmental concerns, the utilization of coal ash at mine reclamation sites has procrastinated. Consequently, to resolve this issue, the relevant environmental impact of coal ash must be considered. Therefore, a leaching assessment framework to assess the environmental impact of coal ash utilization at South Korean mine reclamation sites is presented. The framework was used to identify leaching mechanisms and support an assessment of the environmental impact of coal ash usage at mine reclamation sites in South Korea. This framework could provide guidance with regard to designing more realistic leaching procedures appropriate for all mine conditions and could support the development of regulations and protocols for future environment-friendly coal ash usage.

AB  - Data collected between October 2015 and May 2016 at Environment and Climate Change Canada's Iqaluit research site (64 degrees N, 69 degrees W) have revealed a high frequency (40% of all days for which observations were available) of stratified wind layer events that occur from near the surface up to about 7.2 km above sea level. These stratified wind layers are clearly visible as wind shifts (90 to 180 degrees) with height in range-height indicator scans from the Doppler lidar and Ka-band radar and in wind direction profiles from the Doppler lidar and radiosonde. During these events, the vertical structure of the flow appears to be a stack of 4 to 10 layers ranging in vertical width from 0.1 to 4.4 km. The stratification events that were observed occurred predominantly (81%) during light precipitation and lasted up to 27.5 h. The integrated measurement platforms at Iqaluit permitted continuous observations of the evolution of stratification events in different meteorological conditions.

AB  - Overweight and obesity are highly prevalent conditions worldwide, linked to an increased risk for death, disability and disease due to metabolic and biochemical abnormalities affecting the biological human system throughout different domains. Biomarkers, defined as indicators of biological processes in health and disease, relevant for body mass excess management have been identified according to different criteria, including anthropometric and molecular indexes, as well as physiological and behavioural aspects. Analysing these different biomarkers, we identified their potential role in diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Epigenetic biomarkers, cellular mediators of inflammation and factors related to microbiota-host interactions may be considered to have a theranostic value. Though, the molecular processes responsible for the biological phenomenology detected by the other analysed markers, is not clear yet. Nevertheless, these biomarkers possess valuable diagnostic and prognostic power. A new frontier for theranostic biomarkers can be foreseen in the exploitation of parameters defining behaviours and lifestyles linked to the risk of obesity, capable to describe the effects of interventions for obesity prevention and treatment which include also behaviour change strategies.

AB  - Water transparency is an important ecological indicator for shallow lakes. The largest shallow lake, Poyang Lake, as well as the most typical river-connected lake in China was selected as the research area. In view of the complicated water-sediment conditions induced by its frequent water exchange with external rivers, the dominant factors driving water transparency were determined against the field investigated data from 2003 to 2013 and a specific driving function was established. A numerical model coupling suspended sediment, Chl-a and chemical oxygen demand was developed and validated, and the spatial water transparency distributions under three typical current structures in Poyang Lake, Gravity-style, Jacking-style and Backflow-style, were quantitatively estimated. The following results stood out: water transparency in the lake varied distinctly with the current status; Backflow-style current was basically characterized by the lowest water transparency, while that under Jacking-style was the highest due to the lower sediment carrying capacity. In some outlying regions in the lake, where the water current is hardly influenced by the mainstream, the water transparency was always kept at a stable level.

AB  - The adoption of the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting 2012: Central Framework as a UN statistical standard is a landmark in environmental accounting. The SEEA has the same authority and weight as the System of National Accounts in the pantheon of official statistics. The SEEA defines the unit value of depletion of an exhaustible resource to equal the average unit value of the asset (the total asset value divided by the physical stock of resource). By applying this definition to a non-optimal Dasgupta-Heal-Solow model of an extractive economy, we show that 'depletion-adjusted net saving' as defined in the SEEA supports a generalized version of the Hartwick Rule. This measure of saving can guide policies for sustainable development in extractive economies, in particular fiscal policies concerning consumption and investment expenditures funded by resource rents. The conditions required to support this finding are (i) that extraction declines over time at a constant rate, and (ii) that the marginal cost of resource extraction is constant. A less general result holds in the case of increasing marginal extraction costs.

AB  - The effects of benzo(a)pyrene (Bap) (0.03, 0.3 and 3 mu g L-1) and chrysene (CHR) (0.3, 2.1 and 14.7 mu g L-1) on the function of the immune system of juvenile white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei were determined under laboratory conditions. This included the total hemocyte count (THC) in the hemolymph, phagocytic activityand pro-phenoloxidase (pro-PO) activity of the hemocyte, phenoloxidase (PO) activity, alpha(2)-macroglobulin (alpha(2)-M) activity, bacteriolytic activity and antibacterial activity in the hemolymph. The results showed that BaP and CHR could inhibit the immune function of L. vannamei significantly under high concentration BaP and CHR exposure. The results of this study indicated that the immunotoxicity of PAHs in a descending order was BaP > CHR. Moreover, the results indicated the THC in hemolymph, pro-PO activity and phagocytic activity of hemocyte, and bacteriolytic activity in hemolymphcould be used as potentially suitable biomarkersfor early warning indication of PAHs toxicity, this could provide useful information for toxic risk assessment of environmental pollutants.

AB  - An integrated fisheries management tool based on a bio-economic model was applied to the demersal fishery in the Mar Menor coastal lagoon in SE Spain, with the objective of exploring solutions to ensure the sustainability of this activity. The hypothesis is that excess harvesting in recent years by fishers trying to offset growing production costs has led to the inefficient use of lagoon fishery resources. The authors established the basic bio-economic conditions of the fishery in 2012 by means of field sampling and personal interviews with producers, and analyzed the response of several biological and economic indicators (target species biomass and yield, fleet profits) to a management scenario based on limiting the fishing season of one of the main types of fishing gear (fish traps, locally known as 'paranzas'). Results show that a reduction in fishing mortality of two overexploited species (Sparus aurata and Lithognathus mormyrus) will help recover the biomass of these stocks by more than 40% as well as increase the economic value of the fishery, with profits increasing by 17% over a 4-year period.

AB  - Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is receiving a growing attention from both academic researchers and business managers. Prior research suggests that CSR, by its ability of building strong corporate image and reputation, effectively improves a firm's performance. However, few studies have explored the relationship between CSR and firm risk factors. In particular, although the ongoing financial crisis spurs scholars to seek new drivers that help a firm regain its well being, an important financial indicator of a firm, default risk, has been largely neglected. This research bridges this gap and empirically examines the relationship through which CSR helps firms reduce the risk of falling into default. In addition, this paper formulates the moderating effects between CSR and firm capability, environmental dynamism/complexity, and describes a more complete pattern of CSR's function under different internal and external conditions. The results confirm that CSR has a strong effect on default risk reduction, and this relationship is stronger on firms in high dynamism environments than in low dynamism environments.

AB  - Eutrophication is the most common water quality issue affecting freshwaters worldwide. Paleolimnological approaches have been used in temperate regions to track eutrophication over time, placing changes in historical context. Diatoms (Bacillariophyta) have a direct physiological response to changes in nutrients and are effective indicators of lake trophic status. Chironomids (Diptera) have also been used to track nutrient conditions; however, given that nutrients and oxygen are often tightly linked, it is difficult to disentangle which variable is driving shifts in assemblages. Here, we analyze chironomid and diatom remains in sediments from sewage-impacted ponds in the High Arctic. These ponds have the unusual characteristics of elevated nutrient and oxygen concentrations, unlike those of typical eutrophic lakes where deepwater oxygen is often depleted. Our data show that while diatom assemblages responded to changing nutrients, no concomitant changes in chironomid assemblage composition were recorded. Furthermore, the dominance of oligotrophic, cold stenothermic chironomid taxa, and lack of so-called "eutrophic" species in the eutrophic sewage ponds suggests that oxygen, not nutrients, structures chironomid assemblages at these sites.

AB  - Offshore oil & gas industry is moving exploration and production activities into Arctic and deep water regions. Governmental regulations require environmental impact assessments before operations to evaluate the possible effects of accidental oil releases. These are often performed by numerical fate models, like the Oil Spill Contingency and Response (OSCAR) model, which has become an industry standard in Norway. In this model, biodegradation rates are adjusted to local conditions by temperature compensation according to a Q(10) approach. Q(10) is the multiplier by which rates of enzymatic reactions increase at a 10 degrees C temperature rise. Herein, this Q(10) approach implemented in the OSCAR model is investigated based on published data and novel obtained. results. Overall, biodegradation rate predictions calculated by temperature compensation are found to be questionable, and choosing one universal Q(10) value is considered not feasible. The high variation in Q(10) values is herein attributed to indirect effects of temperature. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Microglial cells are not only sensitive indicators for pathology of the central nervous system (CNS), they are a key factor for neurotoxicity and degeneration in many diseases. Neuronal damage leads to reactive gliosis and to activation of microglia including cytoarchitectonic changes accompanied by alterations in surface receptor and channel expression. In this context, the release of neuroactive soluble factors like pro-inflammatory cytokines can result in increased cellular motility and a higher grade of phagocytotic activity. Ligands including glutamate, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), cytokines, superoxide radicals and neurotrophins released by microglia have in turn effects on neuronal function and cell death. The current review focuses on large pore and hemichannel function in microglial cells under different conditions of activation and elucidates the role of these channels in cytokine release, as well as putative targets for clinical intervention in case of inflammatory processes.

AB  - This paper examines the relevance of incorporating comprehensive life-cycle environmental data into the design and management of pedestrian pavements to minimize the impact on the built environment. The overall primary energy demand and global warming potential of concrete, asphalt and granite sidewalks are assessed. A design with a long functional lifetime reduces its overall primary energy demand and global warming potential due to lower maintenance and repair requirements. However, long-lived construction solutions do not ensure a lower life-cycle primary energy demand and global warming potential than for shorter-lived designs; these values depend on the environmental suitability of the materials chosen for paving. Asphalt sidewalks reduce long-term global warming potential under exposure conditions where the functional lifetime of the pavements is less than 15 years. In places where it is known that a concrete sidewalk can have a life of at least 40 years, a concrete sidewalk is the best for minimizing both long-term primary energy demand and global warming potential. Granite sidewalks are the largest energy consumers and greenhouse gas contributors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study tested the hypothesis that, during recent years, the benthic macroinvertebrate fauna of the large basin of the Swan-Canning Estuary has changed in ways consistent with deteriorating environmental conditions in that estuary. Between 1986/7 and 2003/4, the compositions of that fauna altered markedly at the species and even family levels. Thus, the densities and number of species of molluscs, and especially of crustaceans, which are particularly susceptible to environmental stress, declined, while those of the more tolerant polychaetes increased. However, taxonomic distinctness declined consistently only at one of the four widely-spaced sampling sites and the dispersion of samples did not differ markedly between periods, indicating that the benthic fauna has not undergone such extreme changes as in the nearby Peel-Harvey Estuary. It is thus proposed that benthic macroinvertebrates can act as important indicators of the severity of environmental degradation in microtidal estuaries in regions where such perturbations are increasing.

KW  - DESIGN
KW  - MODEL
AB  - Fouling in crude preheat trains in oil refineries causes additional fuel and production costs, operating difficulties, CO2 emissions, and safety issues. Crude oil fouling deposition mechanisms are still not well understood. Current exchanger design methodologies (based on empirical fouling factors), operating practices, and mitigation solutions (ranging from the use of chemical additives to tube inserts) do not prevent efficiency losses or disruption of operations. Moreover, current analysis and design methodologies neglect local effects and dynamics of fouling, in favor of lumped, steady-state, "averaged" heuristic models. In this paper, a dynamic and distributed model recently developed that accounts for localized fouling growth as a function of process conditions is used to simulate the dynamic behavior of the hot end of a refinery preheat train. The network is simulated by a simultaneous solution of all exchangers, combined according to a desired configuration, within gPROMS, a commercial dynamic simulation environment. The overall network model allows capturing some complex interactions within the network over time and enables the rigorous computation of several key indicators which are highly dependent on fouling. These include throughput reduction, additional energy requirements, and overall economic and CO2 emission impacts.

AB  - The objective of this study was to develop and validate a simple, field-portable, microarray system for monitoring microbial community structure and dynamics in groundwater and subsurface environments, using samples representing site status before acetate injection, during Fe-reduction, in the transition from Fe- to SO(4)(2-)-reduction, and into the SO(4)(2-)-reduction phase. Limits of detection for the array are approximately 10(2)-10(3) cell equivalents of DNA per reaction. Sample-to-answer results for the field deployment were obtained in 4 h. Retrospective analysis of 50 samples showed the expected progression of microbial signatures from Fe- to SO(4)(2-) -reducers with changes in acetate amendment and in situ field conditions. The microarray response for Geobacter was highly correlated with qPCR for the same target gene (R(2) = 0.84 Microarray results were in concordance with quantitative PCR data, aqueous chemistry, site lithology, and the expected microbial community response, indicating that the field-portable microarray is an accurate indicator of microbial presence and response to in situ remediation of a uranium-contaminated site.

AB  - Mechanization of industrial and agricultural production, increase of urban and rural traffic flows, modernization of domestic facilities cause a rapid expansion of acoustic discomfort zones. Since the noise level in any environment is one of the basic factors determining the human comfort indicator, investigation into noise processes is given special attention by researchers.
   Seaport freight discharge terminals are also connected with noise problems. Noise from AB KLASCO fertilizer discharge terminal of Klaipeda seaport cause great concern to local people. There is a noise barrier installed near the terminal. The present paper describes the efficiency evaluation of the noise barrier according to the noise level measurements performed, modelling of noise spread and mathematical calculations.
   The investigation was performed with noise measuring equipment Bruel&Kjaer mediator 2260. According to measurements, it is obvious that the noise level in the residential zone is 3-4 dBA above the limits (limits are given in HN 331:2003) in the daytime, and by 7 dBA at night. The modelling of noise spread was performed by CadnaA program which allowed to make different models according to variations of the noise level caused by changing conditions.

AB  - A regional modelling concept was developed for late Quaternary climate reconstructions and future climate impact assessments. Based on estimates of different climate parameters covering the entire Central and High Asia in a grid-cell spacing of 1 km(2), climatic determinants of the recent spatial distribution of climate-sensitive environments ( glacial and periglacial environments, forest) were explored. Simple climatic threshold functions were established, de. ning critical climate values for modelling the spatial extension of environments considered. Using palaeogeomorphological indicators as a basis, late Quaternary climatic conditions were modelled in a Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) scenario consistent with palaeogeomorphological and palaeoclimatological data. The results enabled a validation of LGM palaeoclimate simulations performed by the ECHAM GCM. To assess the magnitude of possible future climatic impacts on the spatial distribution of glaciers, permafrost and potential forest stands, two GCM-based IPCC-SRES climate change scenarios (IPCC special report on emission scenarios) for the time period 2070 - 2099 were considered. Assuming future climates to be perturbed for long enough to affect the environments, a distinct loss of glaciated areas and permafrost must be expected.

AB  - B v identifying the possibility that technologies with inferior performance can displace established incumbents, the notion of disruptive technologies, pioneered by Christensen (1997), has had a profound effet on the way in which scholars and managers approach technology competition. While the phenomenon of disruptive technologies has been well documented, the underlying theoretical drivers of technology disruption are less well understood. This article identifies the demand conditions that enable disruptive dynamics. By examining how consumers evaluate technology, and how this evaluation changes as performance improves, it offers new theoretical insight into the impact of the structure of the demand environment on competitive dynamics. Two new constructs-preference overlap and preference symmetry-are introduced to characterize the relationships among the preferences of different market segments. The article presents a,formal model that examines how these relationships lead to the emergence of different competitive regimes. The model is analyzed using computer simulation. The theory and model results hold implications for understanding the dynamics of disruptive technologies and suggest new indicators for assessing disruptive threats.

AB  - The effect of chronic exposure to lead (15.1 mg/L, 151 mg/L, 302 mg/L) on the salivary gland polytene chromosomes of the chironomid Glyptotendipes salinus was examined under controlled laboratory conditions. Exposure to lead resulted in a decrease in the activity of the nucleolar organiser (NOR) and the Balbiani Rings (BRs). Effects on the number and activity of chromosome puffs indicate changes in the functional activity of the polytene chromosomes in response to lead exposure. Increased incidence of asynapsis in chromosome G', and changes in the appearance of centromere and telomere regions of the chromosomes also occurred in response to lead. No morphological changes of the larvae were observed following exposure to lead but the rate of larval development decreased. A comparison of the sibling species G. salinus and G. barbipes indicates marked inter-specific cytogenetic differences in the response to lead exposure. Our results show that exposure to lead enhances the activity of the chironomid genome and the resulting changes in the polytene chromosomes provide a subtle indicator of environmental stress.

AB  - This paper describes and reflects on an initiative to develop environmental health indicators in Cape Town, South Africa. The project aimed to provide decision makers, environmental health professionals and the community with better information on the health impacts of environmental hazards. The paper summarizes the social, environmental and health conditions in the city and the organization of local government services, and then describes the participatory process used by the initiative including the qualitative approaches used to develop a situation analysis of environmental health information systems. Despite the use of participatory methods to involve planners and field staff from different municipal agencies, the initiative failed to develop the hoped for set of indicators. The primary reasons for this were difficulties in creating an "institutional space" for the project; on-going local government restructuring; and poor linkages to other initiative. The paper concludes that there is a need for planners, managers and academics to begin using a more structured approach to implementing policies and managing uncertainty in order to facilitate change in areas such as environmental health information systems. Policy instruments which can be used for. planning and managing change are discussed.

AB  - Tt was performed electrochemical treatment of a physiological solution (8,5 g/l sodium chloride) by direct electric current in the specially designed three-chamber diaphragm electrolyzer. There were studied changes of physicochemical parameters (pH, redox-potential, electroconductivity) of analytes at various treatment conditions. As a result of comparing of spectral and physicochemical parameters of the anolytes and solution treated in non-diaphragm electrolyzer, it was shown that cause of biological activity of treated solutions is oxidizer forming in the solution. The oxidizer depending on pH of solution may be as rr molecular chlorine (at low pH 2-3) a hypochlorous acid (pH 5-6) or sodium hypochloride (pH 8-9), Analysis of solutions and molecular chlorine determination were performed by spectra in visible region with methyl orange as an indicator. Quantitative determination and analysis of hypochlorous acid and sodium hypochloride solutions were carryed out by spectra in near-ultraviolet region. Heating of solutions removes completely the molecular chlorine and slightly decreases hypochloride content. Sodium thiosulfate decomposes sodium hypochloride completely. Physiological solution in sodium phosphate buffer the diaphragm and non-diaphragm electrolyzers treatment contains sodium hypochloride and hypochlorous acid ar the same lime, at pH 7,0-7,5.

In the United States, Japan, and Germany, the share of environmental patents in all patents varied between 0.6 and 3%, and as such was higher than the corresponding share of pollution abatement expenditure in GDP, Japanese environmental innovation rates were consistently high, Certain plausible connections between environmental regulation and innovation also emerge, Across these three countries and over time, innovation responded to pollution abatement expenditure, an indicator of the severity of environmental regulations. Environmental patenting rates in developing countries were also high, reaching 2% in many years in Brazil. Developing country innovators obtained a non-trivial number of patents, most of which appear geared towards adapting imported technologies to local conditions. However, domestic innovation was only one path to new technologies. 'Imports' of disembodied environmental technologies (foreign patents registered in developing countries) were substantial. Foreign patents were typically 'important' or generic patents; evidence also suggests that such patents protected intellectual property in equipment exported. Developing countries, especially in East Asia, often chose to obtain technologies embodied in pollution abatement equipment.

AB  - Slackwater sediments and palaeostage indicators record floods occurring prior to discharge gauging along the Fitzroy and Margaret Rivers. In upper Geikie Gorge along the Fitzroy River, preserved sequences record six floods ranging from 5000 to 30 000 m3s-1 during the last 2000 years. Approximately 13 floods between 2000 and 20000 m3s-1 are recorded in an unnamed gorge along the upper Margaret River during the last 4000 years. These floods are at the upper limit of world-wide discharge-drainage area curves.
   The length and resolution of the flood record preserved in slackwater deposits depend on the exposure of flood sediments to post-depositional weathering, the nature of flood sedimentation, channel geometry and stability, and the frequency of floods. Conditions along the Fitzroy and Margaret Rivers are well-suited to preserving long, fairly accessible sedimentary flood records, in comparison to sedimentary records described from similar bedrock channels in the tropical regions of Queensland and the Northern Territory. The Fitzroy and Margaret River flood deposits indicate that, similar to other rivers with highly variable hydrologic regimes, the relatively short-term systematic gauge records from these basins may not adequately represent extreme discharges.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study is to determine the therapeutic effects of boric acid cell proliferation, invasion, migration, colony formation, cell cycle and apoptosis mechanisms in ovarian cancer cell line under in vitro conditions. Methods: MDAH-2774 ovarian cancer cells were employed. Real-time PCR test was used to investigate changes in genes and proteins of cell cycle and apoptosis and identified miRNAs under the addition of boric acid. The apoptosis rates were calculated by TUNEL assay. Matrigel invasion, colony formation and Wound healing tests were used to determine invasion and migration. Oxidative stress index value was calculated for oxidative stress. Results: Boric acid inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, migration and colony formation, but induces apoptosis and oxidative stress. Also, the expression of miRNA-21, miRNA-200a, miRNA-130a and mi-RNA-224 (which are indicators of poor prognosis of ovarian cancer) decreased significantly. Conclusion: The potential of boric acid as a natural molecule may supports its effectiveness in reducing adverse effects arising from conventional ovarian cancer treatments.

TI  - Large-scale thermal unrest of volcanoes for years prior to eruption
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - Identifying the observables that warn of volcanic eruptions is a major challenge in natural hazard management. A potentially important observable is the release of heat through volcano surfaces, which represents a major energy source at quiescent volcanoes. However, it remains unclear whether surface heat emissions respond to pre-eruptive processes and vary before eruption. Here we show through a statistical analysis of satellite-based long-wavelength (10.780-11.280 mu m) infrared data that the last magmatic and phreatic eruptions of five different volcanoes were preceded by subtle but significant long-term (years), large-scale (tens of square kilometres) increases in their radiant heat flux (up to similar to 1 degrees C in median radiant temperature). Large-scale thermal unrest is detected even before eruptions that were not anticipated from other volcano monitoring methods, such as the 2014 phreatic eruption of Ontake (Japan) and the 2015 magmatic eruption of Calbuco (Chile). We attribute large-scale thermal unrest to the enhancement of underground hydrothermal activity, and suggest that such analysis of satellite-based infrared observations can improve constraints on the thermal budget of volcanoes, early detection of pre-eruptive conditions and assessments of volcanic alert levels.

AB  - In Latin America and elsewhere, large-scale infrastructure projects are routinely justified in terms of economic development and criticized for their ecological and social consequences. Debates over the wisdom of infrastructure thus focus on indirect impacts and often overlook direct impacts such as traffic volumes. We take up the case of the Inter-Oceanic Highway, a major infrastructure project in the Southwestern Amazon under the Initiative for the Integration of Regional Infrastructure in South America. We report traffic volumes of various types of vehicles among several road segments during and after paving, between woo and 2019. The analysis involves statistical models of traffic volumes featuring the effect of year of observation, controlling for a suite of other indicators of the conditions under which traffic was observed. The results show modest increases in traffic volumes over time, which confirms a positive effect of paving. This raises questions about the cost-effectiveness of such projects in promoting regional development in Latin America, despite the ecological and social consequences.

AB  - The research was carried out under Kirsehir ecological conditions in 2016 and 2017 vegetation period. The experimental layout was randomized blocks with three replications. In this study, 10 hybrids and one composite maize cultivars were evaluated for some yield and quality characteristics. Important yield and quality characteristics green herbage yield (tons ha(-1)), dry matter yield (tons ha(-1)), crude protein yield (tons ha(-1)), ADF (%), NDF (%), ADL (%) digestible dry matter ratio (%) and digestible dry matter yield (tons ha(-1)) were determined. Significant differences were found between cultivars in terms of yield and quality. The two-year mean values of dry matter yield, crude protein yield and digestible dry matter yield indicated that Kerbanis, Karadeniz Yildizi and Samada-07 were the high yielding cultivars. The ADF, NDF and ADL ratios which are the quality indicators, of high yielding cultivars were also low. The results revealed that the high-yielding cultivars are also prominent in terms of important quality criteria. Kerbanis, Karadeniz Yildizi and Samada-07 cultivars are suitable for silage maize production considering the yield and quality characteristics and can be recommended for Kirsehir and similar ecologies.

AB  - Chloramphenicol (CAP) is a micropollutant that resists to conventional residual water treatment. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess CAP biodegradability by five endophytic fungi strains isolated from Bertholletia excelsa collected in the Brazilian Amazonia. The fungi strains were screened in solid and liquid medium, and then experimental design was performed to optimize culture conditions. In addition, an environmental toxicology assessment was carried out using the algae Chlorella vulgaris. Results from fungi cultures in solid medium demonstrated that CAP affected the strains growth and interfered in the development of conidia and spores. The biodegradation in liquid culture medium showed that all strains increased the degradation of this antibiotic. The most efficient strain Trichoderma sp. (BIORG 7) was subjected to an experimental design (Box-behnken) consisted of 15 experiments, having as variables: pH, time, and CAP concentration, and reaching 30% biodegradation determined by HPLC-UV analyses (24 h, pH 7.0 and 150 mg L-1). The main metabolite 4-nitrobenzaldehyde was identified by GC-MS analyses and presented a higher ecotoxicity to green algae than CAP.

AB  - The impact climate and land-use changes have on the hydrological conditions in peat bogs and lakes is often complex, but of great importance for the carbon budget and biodiversity in these ecosystems. Links and feed-backs between raised bog water table depth, lake level, net precipitation, hydrometeorological indices, and radial tree growth have been studied and identified in the Rekyva wetland complex, Lithuania. Moreover, several statistically significant correlations between raised bog water table depths, lake level, local river runoff, and tree growth were observed. The changes of raised bog water table, lake level, and tree growth show synchronous trends despite variations in the absolute values. Our results show decreasing water table in the Rekyva wetland complex over the last 100 years, especially in the middle of the 20th century. This study also shows a potential for reconstructing water table fluctuations in wetland complexes using multi-indicator approaches. Our observations and reconstruction show consistency with several regional studies and reconstructions of moisture variations in Baltic raised bogs, at least for periods without strong anthropogenic influences.

AB  - Microbial carbon biomass (MBC) from soil is a bio-indicator that has the potential to show changes in the soil of ecosystems, it is conditioned by humidity. The objective of this research was to evaluate variation in MBC depending on water available on the ground from dry magallanic steppe in Santa Cruz, Argentina. The research consisted of three treatments: a) irrigation, 54% increase in precipitation compared to the annual average in the area, b) drought, 54% decrease in precipitation compared to the annual average in the area, c) Control, without variations in precipitation, used as reference soil. MBC was estimated by the fumigation- extraction method. Reference soil had most MBC content, it was 466,15 (+/- 27,2) mu g C/g dry soil, as compared to soil subject to drought, wich showed the lowest MBC content, it was 394,08 (+/- 29,8) mu g C/g dry soil. The soil under irrigation showed 462 (+/- 29,6) mu g C/g dry soil. These differences were not significant in this first year of measurement

AB  - Multiple benefit evaluation may become complicated due to varied and unquantifiable indicators. This study presents a multicriteria approach to evaluate Low Impact Development (LID) performance through an aggregation of principal component analysis and correlation analysis (PCCA). The approach is based on the rule of triple bottom line and complies with the China-specific planning land-use type and site-specific hydrologic and hydrologic condition. The quantitative indicators are coupled with the Stormwater Management Model (SWMM) software and filed investigation; the qualitative indicators are valued by a numerical unit system that converts the level of importance to numbers 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1. The results indicate that the PCCA approach could evaluate the LID performance with fewer dimensions of variables based on environmental, economic and social concerns comprehensively. The principal components concentrated on three streams: (1) runoff quantity and quality control; (2) minimize cost and improve robustness; and (3) improve system management and aesthetic enhancement. Taken together, these streams match the objective of sponge city construction with LID techniques. The PCCA approach is a multicriteria decision-aid tool that helps the decision maker choose the appropriate LID technique.

AB  - In power electronic applications, aging of the electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) is considered as a serious issue since it may lead to failure. Their degradation is usually evaluated by an increase of the internal resistance or a decrease of the equivalent capacitance. These aging indicators have a good correlation with the supercapacitor's state-of-health (SoH). Generally, SoH is measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). However, this technique must be performed offline and requires interruption of the system's operation. In this paper, a sliding mode observer is designed to estimate online the EDLC's aging indicators. Unlike several online estimators, the supercapacitor's parameters are considered as a nonlinear random distribution with external noises which yields accurate estimation. In addition, the relationship between the capacitance and the bias voltage is considered to be nonlinear. Lyapunov stability analysis is also provided. The proposed approach is validated experimentally using a standardized dynamic current profile. Furthermore, comparison against EIS is carried out for different aging phases and under different environmental temperature conditions.

AB  - Ourdays, the identification of friendly solutions in order to enhance physiological development of cereals is one of the main priorities of agriculture. This approach, also contributes to the promotion of the practices of the sustainable agriculture. A practice, which occupies more and more space is the use of endogenous type substances, as phytohormones, in order to increase cereals' physiological development, and nutritional traits. This is the context where the aim of our study is placed, meaning that we focused on determining the effects of GIBB A3 phytohormone on two maize hybrids content in macro-, and microelements, within specific environmental conditions of Transylvania. Two maize hybrids were studied, Turda Star, and Turda 200, respectively, and their elemental content was quantified by AAS, and raw data were processed with IBM SPSS Version 20. The results of our trial show the influence of GIBB A3 hormone upon the analyzed macro- (K, P, S, Cl, Mg, Ca), and microelemental (Fe, Mn, Zn) content of studied maize hybrids, mainly K, and P, which may also be considered as indicators of physiological status of the plant.

AB  - This paper provides a retrospective analysis of global environmental assessment (GEA) processes and their changing character, focus and political context over the past 40 years. We examine how and why elements of organizational design, objectives, and the evolving political landscape have interacted and changed, with a view of informing the design and conduct of future processes. We find that the historical genesis of GEAs is closely connected to the emergence of environmental multilateralism. However, the prevailing conditions and assumptions which originally gave rise to the GEA concept have changed significantly over time, giving rise to an increasing demand for a focus on response options and policies. We also find that the epistemic and process complexity of GEAs has increased substantially, without a corresponding expansion in the magnitude and composition of GEA management teams. We suggest that developing analytical capacities for policy assessment as well as ensuring sufficient resources and tools to manage increasingly complex GEAs is essential to ensure their future relevance and success. This article is part of a special issue on solution-oriented GEAs.

AB  - One of the most substantial tools that serve decision makers in their efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions includes energy efficiency measures that in most cases benefit from governmental assistance for achieving electricity consumption reduction goals. This paper examines five energy efficiency measures, defining a combined sustainability index. A multi-criteria analysis of five predefined indices was developed (economic, environmental, technology, social and political), providing a combined index for each measure and a tool for identifying the preferred measure within a specific situation, based on its total sustainability score. In this research, a case study was conducted and the preferred measure was found to be municipal street lighting systems, based on its high political and social scores, and its relatively high installation potential. The second choice would be replacement of chillers in the industrial sector, and the least favorable measure is the replacement of water pumps in the water sector. The methodology described brings into account the technological specifications of the measure implemented, and the specific national conditions under which it is implemented. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The eleven terpene ketones, thymoquinone, (R)-carvone, (S)-carvone, pulegone, dihydrocarvone, menthone, verbenone, ocimenone, camphor, alpha-thujone and piperitenone, were tested as contact and fumigant insecticides against adults of Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky under laboratory conditions. The results show that thymoquinone was found to be more toxic than the other ketones, with lethal doses values being LC50 16.5 mu g/cm(2) and LC50 13.8 mu L/L air (24h after treatment). These ketones were also subjected to multiple regression analysis and the results derived from the quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) model suggested two topological indicators, the Balaban and Randic indices, were the best descriptors of insecticidal activity of the ketones. However, orbital electronegativity of the carbonyl group was the main parameter that connected the inhibition activity of ketones on acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Thus, the insecticidal activity of terpene ketones was primarily explained by the shape of molecules and the branching of the carbon-atom skeleton, while inhibition of activity of AChE was mainly due to the electronic descriptors.

AB  - This paper revisits the utility of sodium (Na) content in aragonite and calcite mollusc shells as an indicator of palaeosalinity. The data come mainly from a related suite of Middle Pleistocene marine and freshwater fossils that have been subject to broadly similar diagenetic histories. Environmental salinity is re-affirmed as the primary factor in determining the sodium content of modern and ancient mollusc shells: values <2000 ppm Na are generally indicative of non-marine environments while values >2000 Na ppm are typically from marine shells. There is a positive relationship between Na (salinity) and Sr which is a helpful discriminator of palaeosalinity in the fossil data set. The Na and Sr data give confidence that the fossil shells have not suffered pervasive diagenetic alteration and that the marine fossils lived in fully marine conditions. Oxygen isotope values in the best-preserved, fully marine fossil shells, suggest Middle Pleistocene 'eastern England' seawater temperatures were broadly similar to those of the modern North Sea.

AB  - Climate action plans provide an increasingly important mechanism in climate change awareness, analysis, policy making, and implementation. Although recent efforts have initially analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of climate action plans, little research has empirically investigated the content of existing climate action plans in disaster risk management. This study developed thirty-two indicators to assess the plan content of twenty-four U.S. coastal states' climate action plans in managing the risks of extreme climate events and natural disasters. Correlation and regression analyses were conducted to detect the influence of contextual variables on plan content. The results indicate that these plans had a medium level of awareness, analysis, and action in regard to extreme climate conditions and disaster preparedness. Weak linkages were found between climate change and coastal disaster risk management. Large variations in indicators were found among the coastal states. The explanatory results show that none of the contextual variables significantly affected the plan content of these climate action plans. The policy recommendations provide insights for decision makers for mitigation of and adaptation to coastal climate change and disasters. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - National legislation mention thresholds for total soil potentially toxic elements (PTE) contents only, but there has been a high interest in following the fate of mobile PTE lately, because total concentration is a poor indicator of their lability, which is directly connected to the environmental risk. The scientific literature amply demonstrated that a more relevant assessment of the PTE contamination can be made by measuring their pseudo-total content in soil which can be totally mobilized in extreme environmental conditions. The main aim of this paper is to get an insight of the risk associated with PTE soil contamination in Balan mining area after activity was ceased for several years. The results show that copper and lead pseudo-total concentrations exceed both intervention and alert thresholds from the national legislation, while zinc, due to its higher mobility, has a labile concentration below intervention limit. Spatial distribution of studied PTE shows that the initial assumption, that the tailing pond and slag humidity decreased during summertime and the material could be carried by wind on its direction to the inhabited area, was correct and the environmental risk is high.

AB  - Natural productivity of a soil, under favourable climatic conditions, depends on its fertility level. By agro-phytotechnical measures, soil productivity may increase independently of its fertility, and that can be ameliorated or degraded by agro-technologies. Soil Biology, that appeared in the 20th century, has elaborated the theory of soil fertility maintenance and even of amelioration by some measures which could stimulate the life and biochemical processes in soil, as well as quantitative and qualitative increase in humus. The pedo-enzymic part in the circuit of chemical elements in soil is also known, in theory, but in agronomical practice even it is still neglected. Both the theory of plant mineral nutrition and the application of chemical fertlizers are maintained, therefore organic fertilization is rarely used (with stable compost or vegetal composted remains). The present paper deals with the study of some modification of pedo-amidase and pedo-phosphatase indices and of soil's chemical reaction in a reddish preluvosoil, in a stationary experiment of nineteen years.

AB  - Three microorganisms were assayed to evaluate the microbiological quality in the seawater at a resort on the Mexican Pacific coast, and to test for possible associations among the titers of the various bacteria, their possible correlations with environmental conditions, and with the location of potential wastewater outflows. Significant microorganism levels were found (at Caletilla beach, Hornos beach, and Papagayo beach, respectively: for Enterococcus 157, 153, and 149, for C. perfringens 35, 89, and 56, for S. aureus 244,137, and 279 CFU/100 ml), often in excess of the presently set guideline values. In general, bacterial titers were higher during rainy season than in dry season. For S. aureus, in both seasons, highest concentrations were found at 3 pm, the time of highest tourist presence at the beaches. Our results argue for the use of these three microorganisms as part of a set of indicators in the routine microbiological evaluation of Mexican beachwaters. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The characteristics of the faunal community in soil are closely related to soil quality. Using the soil faunal community as an indicator of soil quality is not cost-effective because of the complex taxonomic distinction and identification required, moreover; the power of the assessment is weak in relation to soil function. Recently, a functional method incorporating eco-morphological traits has been proposed, but it depends upon presence/absence data of soil arthropod community exclusively. To overcome the limitation, we designed a novel index using the diversity of the soil faunal community along with its functional traits, and the abundance of its members (Abundance-based Fauna Index, referred as FAI). The FAI method supports both the presence/absence data and its abundance. Using real and simulated data sets with eco-morphological and niche breadth traits, two taxonomic independent functional traits, we tested associations of FAI values with soil quality and found a good relationship. In addition to its usefulness for measuring soil quality, FAI may provide valuable information for linking functional traits of soil fauna and the belowground environmental condition.

AB  - Under the ambient temperature (25 degrees C) and pressure (one Standard Atmospheric Pressure) conditions, surface Volta potential of an austenitic stainless steel was measured using the Scanning Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (SKPFM) to study its stressed-related corrosion behavior in a 0.5 M chloride solution. In an oxygen and water regulated environment (using a glovebox), the steel shows a map of Volta potentials with high contrasts among the different grains and grain boundaries, which was then linked to the actual corrosion potential (w.r.t. a saturated calomel electrode) based on a rigorous calibration procedure. Corrosion behavior of the steel under tensile stress was then compared to that of the same sample under no tensile stress in light of the measured Volta potential, which was found to be sensitive to the level of applied tensile stress, although the tested stainless steel in general is known for its high corrosion-resident capability. According to this study, surface Volta potential measured by SKPFM can be used as a high-accuracy indicator for localized corrosion of steels.

AB  - Citric fruits - in natura, as frozen pulp or even as juice - are one of the most important Brazilian exportation products. They are a source of ascorbic acid - a potent antioxidant, and pectin, which is used in the food industry and is an important dietary fiber. This project aims to quantify ascorbic acid and pectin contents in citric fruits, commercial oranges and tangerines, comparing them in sizes and varieties. Ascorbic acid amount was measured in juice comparing sizes, varieties and storage conditions, using a tritimetric method with 2.6-dichlorobenzenoindophenol indicator. Total and soluble pectin in each part of the fruits (peel, albedo, pulp and juice) were quantified using the polygalacturonic acid as a standard. Differences were found between the sizes. The highest content of vitamin C was found in the oranges (Bahia variety). Comparing the storage temperatures, the biggest loss was at room temperature. Albedo presented the highest content of pectin in all fruits. In juice, the total and soluble pectin contents increased as fruits size decreased. Oranges and tangerines differed in the amount of pectin.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a growing increase of the cooling demand in many parts of the world, which has led to major energy problems. In this context, solar assisted absorption cooling systems have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional vapor compression air conditioning systems, given the fact that in many cases the cooling demand coincide with the availability of solar radiation. In this work, we present a decision-support tool based on mathematical programming for the design of solar assisted absorption cooling systems. The design task is formulated as a bi-criteria mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) optimization problem that accounts for the minimization of the total cost of the cooling system and the associated environmental impact measured over its entire life cycle. The capabilities of the proposed method are illustrated in a case study that addresses the design of a solar assisted ammonia-water absorption cycle considering weather data of Barcelona (Spain).

AB  - Two subspecies of Cistus incanus L. occurring in the southern Balkans were studied: C. incanus L. ssp. incanus and C. incanus ssp. creticus (L.) Heywood. After studying the morphological differences, the communities dominated by these two subspecies were sampled according to the central European method. The localities of the releves show the distribution pattern of the two subspecies. The typical subspecies can be found in the area of distribution of thermophilous deciduous forests of Carpinion orientalis, whereas the subspecies creticus grows in the area of the evergreen broad-leaved forests of Quercetea ilicis. The communities were classified as Diantho-Cistetum incani Micevski et Matevski ex Carni, Matevski et Silc ass. nova hoc loco and Calicotomo villosae-Cistetum cretici Oberdorfer 1954. Analyses of traits (life span, life form, proportion of certain families, bioindicator values and chorotypes) reveal that the harshest site conditions prevail within Diantho-Cistetum incani, which appears as an initial stage of the vegetation succession. Calicotome-Cistetum cretici is a subsequent stage of succession, since the extreme degradation of vegetation on these sites results in ephemeral communities dominated by Poa bulbosa assigned to Romulion.

AB  - Data collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) during the summer months of 2003 and 2004 at four US Great Lakes beaches were analyzed using linear regression analysis to identify relationships between meteorological, physical water characteristics, and beach characteristics data and the fecal indicator bacteria, Enterococcus. Water samples were analyzed for Enterococcus densities by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and membrane filtration (MF). This paper investigates the ability of regression models to accurately predict Enterococcus densities above or below a threshold value, using environmental data on a beach-by-beach basis for both methods. The ability to create statistical models for real-time water quality analysis would allow beach managers to make more accurate decisions regarding beach safety. Results from linear regression models indicate that environmental factors explain more of the variability in Enterococcus densities measured by MF than Enterococcus densities measured by qPCR. Results also show that models for both methods did not perform well at predicting occurrences in which water quality levels exceeded a threshold. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sixteen selections of Apocynum cannabinum (Indian Hemp) and nine of Asclepias syriaca (Common Milkweed) from midwestern USA were exposed to 40 or 80 ppb ozone under controlled conditions within greenhouse continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) chambers to evaluate their relative ozone sensitivity. The incidence and severity of ozone-induced symptoms on both species were directly related to ozone concentration and duration of exposure. The most common foliar symptom was classic, dark, adaxial stipple, similar to symptoms ascribed to ambient ozone in the field. Indian Hemp was more sensitive to ozone than Common Milkweed. Both species exhibited considerable intraspecific variation in ozone sensitivity. Variability in the data was too great to assign definitive ozone-sensitivity ratings within geographic regions from which seed was selected. However, two locations were identified as possible collection sites for ozone-sensitive selections of both species: Wabaunsee County, KS and Plattsmouth, NE for Indian Hemp; and Cloud County, KS and Swan Creek Lake Wildlife Area, NE for Common Milkweed. Plants derived from seed from these locations may serve as ozone-sensitive bioindicators.

AB  - Fish welfare, suffering and the perception of pain were debated, together with several factors reducing infra vitam welfare of farmed fish (genetic, environment, density, malnutrition, starvation, cataracts, deformities, vaccination side effects, transport, handling, confinement, crowding, harvesting, killing method). Behavioural and physiological stress responses were considered as indicators of welfare reduction. The effects of pre-slaughter management practices, and the most commonly used stunning/slaughtering methods on welfare and quality reduction of farmed fish were discussed. A number of indicators can be used to assess fish welfare-suffering, both in a scientific and practical context, such as behavioural, haematic, cellular, tissue post mortem fish stress and quality indicators, but none of them are optimal. The best strategy for a reliable assessment of fish welfare/suffering and their impact on product quality is a multidisciplinary approach that takes into account animal behaviour and the different biochemical and physiological ante mortem and postmortem processes involved: several components, all influenced in a similar way by the same condition, suggest real welfare and quality reduction.

AB  - Benzothiazoles distributional characteristics of crude oils and non-hydrocarbon fractions of source racks in Mangya depression of the Qaidam Besin, Lunnan oil field in the Tarim Basin, Kelamayi oil field in the Junggar Basin and the Tulufan Basin oil field were analyzed, It was found that the distributions of benzothiazole are remarkable diversity in different sedimentary environmental oils. The swamp crude oils contain high quantity of benzothiazole and relatively high quantity of alkylthio-benzothiazole and 2(3H)-benzothiazolone, But the quantity of the 2,2 '-dithiobisbenzothiazole is relatively low. The abundance of benzothiazole and 2,2'-dithiobis benzothiazole are relatively high in semi-brackish water lacustrine crude oils, but the quantity of alkylthio-benzothiazole and 2(3H)-benzothiazolone are relatively low. The benzothiazoles belong to weak acid and mild base compound, and their stabilization conditions relate to their environmental medium. The nitrogenous bases are in favor of alkalescence environment, while weak acid nitrogenous compounds are the main stable products under the weak acid environment. Benzothiazoles have great significance in identifying the oil- and gas-formed environment and the geochemistry study of non-hydrocarbon fraction in the future.

AB  - Analyzing stable isotopes deposited in fish otoliths can provide insights into the environmental variation that individual fish experience throughout their life history which, in turn, can indicate their home range, movements, and underlying stock structure, We investigated the use of stable delta C-13 and delta O-18 isotopes in haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus otoliths as indicators of environmental variation and stock structure in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. Samples were collected between 1995 and 1998 from individual spawning components on Georges Bank, the Gulf of Maine, and along the Scotian Shelf. Samples from 1 yr- and 4 yr-old haddock were analyzed from an integrated and chronological life history perspective, respectively. Annual, seasonal, and ontogenetic variation in otolith isotopes indicated that haddock undergo shifts in distribution throughout their life history, possibly as a means of compensating for variable environmental conditions; this underlines the difficulty of temperature reconstructions from mobile organisms with optimal temperature ranges.

AB  - The results of the extensive measurements of Cesium-137 (Cs-137) in virgin soils, plants, forest litter and lake bottom sediments of Altay Region in 1992-1995 are presented. Analyses of the vertical soil profiles indicate that Cs-137 is present in the upper 5-20 cm of the soil. Crops and the majority of wild plants show no signs of contamination with Cs-137 even in areas where soil is contaminated. A regional map of Cs-137 concentration is presented, which shows a highly irregular pattern of radio-cesium deposition from the nuclear tests on the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Polygon between 1949 to 1962. This kind of lateral distribution of Cs-137 in Altay virgin topsoils cannot be accounted for only by the distance from the nuclear testing site, on the contrary, it seems to be predominantly dependent on the weather conditions and a pattern of rainfall at the time of Semipalatinsk explosions. The article discusses the factors causing the post-precipitation redistribution of Cs-137 in the soil column and demonstrates that forest litter, lichen and lake bottom sediments can be used as sensitive indicators of the historical and current radioactive contamination.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to examine the extent to which the modernizing changes experienced in Greece in the postwar period are reflected in more equitable gender relations. The analysis indicates that although Greece has become one of the most progressive countries with respect to women's legal status, this is not necessarily reflected in behavioural changes at the interpersonal level. The influx of Greek women in the labour market is a necessary prerequisite, but not a sufficient condition, for the development of a new gender contract. Given the persistence of traditional economic structures within which the family retains a significant role, women's involvement in paid employment does not in itself signify a transformation of gender relations. For a large proportion of Greek women, therefore, work may he viewed as the result of a family strategy for collective income procurement and not necessarily as an indicator of more liberal gender-role ideologies. The article concludes that it is vitally important to establish the meaning that work carries for women themselves, as well as others in their social environment, by supplementing statistical information with qualitative in-depth analyses.

AB  - The nature and distribution of trace-fossil and microbenthic assemblages in Tethyan hemipelagic carbonates and marls of the Podzamcze Formation (Bajocian, Pieniny Klippen Belt) are studied. These analyses allow the identification of (1) recurring Planolites-Chondrites, Planolites-Chondrites-Zoophycos/Teichichnus and Chondrites ichno-assemblages, and (2) poor microbenthic assemblages dominated by agglutinated foraminifers and rich microbenthic assemblages dominated by diversified calcareous foraminifers as well as ostracods. A cross correlation of trace-fossil and microbenthic assemblages with the lithology and petrography of their host sediments suggests the presence of three different paleo-oxygen levels ranging from strongly dysaerobic, moderately dysaerobic to slightly dysaerobic (or aerobic).
   The stratigraphic distribution of these paleoecological and paleoenvironmental indicators points to the prevalence of strongly dysaerobic and temporarily stagnant bottom waters, under which carbonates accumulated, interrupted by short periods of improved benthic oxygenation related to the deposition of turbiditic silty marls. The origin and persistence of low oxygen levels during deposition of the Podzamcze Formation is attributed to the combination of (1) a silled basin with restricted water circulation, and (2) a density-stratified water column associated with warm and humid climatic conditions.

AB  - The late Paleozoic Palo Duro Basin evolved from a marine to nonmarine environment as it was infilled. The evaporitic part of the sequence (Leonardian through Ochoan) is composed of regressive carbonate-anhydrite-halite cycles that displaced open-marine environments toward the south during basin filling. Systematic vertical changes in evaporite geochemistry through the evaporite section include increasing Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios and decreasing (altered from marine) deltaS-34 in anhydrite, decreasing (recycled) bromide content of the halite, and increasing meteoric influence on the stable isotopic composition of fluid inclusions in halite. Geochemical changes correspond to changes in evaporite sedimentology and document the evolution from marine-dominated to partly nonmarine evaporites.
   Geochemical tracers, when used with sedimentological and facies analysis, provide reliable indicators of the sources of water and solutes in an anhydrite-halite facies tract. Perennial, intermittently stratified, and ephemeral brine-pool conditions affect the amount of synsedimentary recycling. Variable rates of reflux and marine recharge control residence times of brines in the depositional environment. These are two key processes in relating evaporite geochemistry to depositional environment.

KW  - STRUCTURAL MODEL
KW  - IMPACT
AB  - The methodology for the estimation of "the marine environmental capacity for coastal fisheries (E.C.)" is proposed. The characteristics of the methodology are as follows: 1) selecting and analyzing environmental factors affecting the growth and survival of fishery organisms at various developmental stages; 2) modeling the correlation of fishery organisms with their environmental factors on the basis of accumulated knowledge and experience; 3) estimating the fluctuation of fish population related to environmental conditions. For the above estimation, the environmental limits sustainable for the fisheries resources are determined by using models for the life cycle of fishery organisms. This methodology is applied to Osaka Bay. In this bay two factors are suggested to be essential to E.C. of marbled sole, Limanda yokohamae, which is representative of demersal fishes. One is the reclamation from the sea which makes narrower spawning and nursery grounds, and the other is the increased pollution load which results in a deficiency of dissolved oxygen in the bottom layer and reduces the biomass of benthonic organisms as food. The practical use of E.C. method as a tool for the environmental assessment is also discussed.

AB  - Deceit often occurs in questionnaire surveys, which leads to the misreporting of data and poor reliability. The purpose of this study is to explore whether eye-tracking could contribute to the detection of deception in questionnaire surveys, and whether the eye behaviors that appeared in instructed lying still exist in spontaneous lying. Two studies were conducted to explore eye movement behaviors in instructed and spontaneous lying conditions. The results showed that pupil size and fixation behaviors are both reliable indicators to detect lies in questionnaire surveys. Blink and saccade behaviors do not seem to predict deception. Deception resulted in increased pupil size, fixation count and duration. Meanwhile, respondents focused on different areas of the questionnaire when lying versus telling the truth. Furthermore, in the actual deception situation, the linear support vector machine (SVM) deception classifier achieved an accuracy of 74.09%. In sum, this study indicates the eye-tracking signatures of lying are not restricted to instructed deception, demonstrates the potential of using eye-tracking to detect deception in questionnaire surveys, and contributes to the questionnaire surveys of sensitive issues.

AB  - Introduction: Development of a new enzymatic kinetic-photometric method for analysis of Dequalinium chloride, based on the use of enzymatic hydrolysis of acetylcholine, for determine the amount of Dequalinium chloride in the vaginal tablets "Fluomizin" No 6.
   Method: The amount of Dequalinium chloride (DCh) was determined by the degree of inhibition of the enzymatic reaction, which was evaluated by the residual unreacted substrate - acetylcholine. Determination of the residual amount of acetylcholine in the reaction mixture was performed by a kinetic-photometric method using an indicator oxidation reaction of p-phenetidine with peracetic acid, which is formed during the auxiliary reaction of perhydrolysis with addition of excess hydrogen peroxide in the reaction mixture over a period of time.
   Results: Optimal conditions were determined: pH 8.35 was selected, influence of nature of buffer solution, concentration of acetylcholine (0.05 mg / ml), cholinesterase (0.4 mg / ml), hydrogen peroxide (10,0%) and p-phenethedine (1 %), the incubation time (10 min).
   Conclusions: The procedure for determination of Dequalinium chloride content in the vaginal tablets "Fluomizin" No 6 was developed. The kinetic parameters Km (Michaelis-Menten constant) and Vmax (maximal velocity) were determined.

AB  - Nature is an important source of inspiration for researchers to create better designs. In this study, graphene type multi-cell tubes is inspired by graphene due to its strong and lightweight mechanical properties. Peak crushing force (PCF), energy absorption (EA) and crushing force efficiency crashworthiness indicators have been taken into consideration under different loading angles, and the complex proportion assessment (COPRAS) which is a multicriteria decision-making method has been used to determine the best model. The best model is found to be GTMT5 (second-order and third-order hollow cylinders in the graphene type multi-cell tube) by the COPRAS selection method. The multiobjective optimization, whose objective is to minimize PCF and maximize EA, is applied on the GTMT5 using the multiobjective particle swarm optimization and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II methods, and the techniques are compared. The optimization study is carried out on the radial basis function metamodels. This study shows that circular structures placed in multi-cell tubes have a significant effect on the crashworthiness performance.

AB  - Spanish GDP indicator figures recover while the risk of poverty has not stopped increasing since 2007 given the continuous austerity policies adopted by Governments, while labour and welfare conditions have worsened. A new phenomenon is emerging: the flattening of the Spanish middle class.
   This study proposes a model to quantify the number of individuals according to their level of precariousness in Spain. The model allows us to predict the behaviour of society in Spain given the mimetic nature of humans by constructing a discrete finite epidemiological model that classifies and quantifies the population in Spain according to its risk of precariousness. Our results show a rise in the precariat of 3% (representing 39% of the total population at the end of the study).
   The relevance of this study lies in providing measures to governments that can mitigate the negative effects of this problem and stop its growth. Indeed tax measures to help firms to distribute their profits among employees and measures engaging a labour reform to establish limits to the rate of temporary jobs and working overtime should be considered.

AB  - Bulgarian oriental tobacco is characterized by the unique combination of strong pleasant aroma, beneficial substances and balanced chemical composition forming high-quality content. The aim of this study is to find the quality indicators determining the smoking and taste properties of oriental tobacco varieties cultivated in typical or untypical environmental conditions. The study was conducted with Bulgarian varieties of oriental tobaccos of Ustina ecotype and Dupnitsa ecotype. The tobaccos were grown in the typical and in the untypical regions for the varieties. The content of nicotine and sugars was determined as well as nicotine/sugars balance ratio, which is indicator for balanced tobacco smoke. Tobaccos grown in typical areas are characterized by typical for oriental tobacco content of nicotine and sugars and balanced tobacco smoke. The content of nicotine and sugars in tobacco varieties, grown in untypical region varied in wide ranges, which show a great difference in taste and physiological sensation of tobacco smoke. In order to show the full potential of the variety and its quality properties, it is necessary to cultivate the variety in the regions suitable for it.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the thermal effect on the behavioral and physiological changes of Girolando heifers by means of principal components analysis. The research was conducted in the Agreste region of the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. Three heifers submitted to the continuous grazing system were used. For the determination of the thermal effect on the animals, the variables dry bulb temperature and relative air humidity were recorded, which allowed to determine the temperature and humidity index and the specific enthalpy. The physiological variables monitored were the respiratory rate, rectal temperature and skin temperature. The quantified behavioral indicators were walking, drinking, eating, ruminating and leisure, to determine the percentage of time spent in each behavior. The variables of the study were submitted to exploratory and descriptive analysis, in order to infer the degree of association of the main components. The multivariate analysis allowed to establish the degree of pertinence between the physiological signs and behavioral patterns associated with the thermal environment, which indicated heifers adaptation to continuous grazing, even in critical meteorological conditions.

AB  - The objective of this study was to present psychological possibilities of information-communication technologies that activate the different ways of students' self-fulfillment in the learning process. The results of students' interviews about the opportunities and conditions for self-fulfillment in university education are presented. Based on the thesaurus-analysis, authors reveal the semantic indicators of self-fulfillment as subjective-significant factors of personal well-being. Summarizing the obtained data, the authors disclosed psychological resources of modern information technologies through a dual-circuit model of ICT potentials, which activate these factors in the process of studying at a university. The first contour of actual opportunities ICT consists of potentials such as: descriptive, representative, exhibiting, navigation-orientation, search-heuristic, imprinting, adaptive, interactive, structural-organizational, control-evaluative, logistic, diversification, catalyzing, facilitating, and innovative. The second contour of latent potentials ICT contains more deep resources and includes the following potentials: reflexive, constructive-modeling, personalizing, activating, limitlessness, temporal, integrating, motivating, exteriorizing, and amplifying. Together, both contours of potentials form the holistic informational-favorable environment for self-fulfillments of students in the learning process.

AB  - The concentrations and compositions of polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) in sediments and suspended particulate matters (SPM) in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River were investigated. The mean concentrations of PCNs were 7.15 +/- 19.3 ng/g dw in the sediment and 38.1 +/- 58.4 ng/g dw in SPM. Tri- and tetra-CNs were the dominant homologue groups in most samples. CN-23 was the predominant congener at all sites, and its presence may be attributed to coal combustion. Combustion indicators showed that local combustion source was the main contributor to the PCN concentrations. These sources were related to the energy structure of this region, where coal is the most important energy resource. Human activities, including industrial thermal processes and reservoir construction, were major factors affecting PCN levels and hydrological conditions, which strongly influenced the environmental fate of PCNs in the Yellow River.

AB  - Jarosite waste samples from Trepca Zinc Industry in Kosovo were subjected to two batch leaching tests as an attempt to characterize the leaching behavior and mobility of minor and major elements of jarosite waste. To achieve this, deionized water and synthetic acidic rain leaching tests were employed. A two-step acidic treatment in microwave digestion system were used to dissolve jarosite waste samples, followed by determination of Al, Ag, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, P, Pb, S, Si, Sr, and Zn by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The validation of the procedure was performed by the analysis of two geochemical reference materials, S JR-3 and S Jsy-1. Two toxicity leaching tests revealed a high metal releasing of Cd, Cu, Ni, Mn, Pb, Zn, and As, and the metal release risk for these elements is still very high due the low pH and acid rain. The statistical analysis showed useful data information on the relationship between elements in jarosite samples in two different extraction conditions (deionized water and synthetic acid rain).

AB  - The distribution patterns of foraminiferal assemblages in relation to trace metals, sediment grain size, and calcium carbonate were studied in 232 surface sediments collected from the northwestern Taiwan Strait. Multivariate analyses of biotic and abiotic data revealed a separation of near-shore, coastal, and deep-water zones. The modified degree of contamination suggested that the overall contamination was very low to low. Trace metals were enriched in the near-shore and outside bays. Their distribution was likely determined by sediment transport pathways and hydrodynamic conditions. High metal concentrations co-occurred with a low density and diversity of foraminiferal assemblages. Pb, Ba, organic carbon, Ga, Zn, Cu, and Co had a positive correlation with near-shore assemblage, whereas Cr and Ni positively related to the deep-water assemblages. Some calcareous foraminifera were favored by CaCO3, Sr, and sand. This study highlights species' responses that are specific to environmental variables. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The antiozonant ethylene diurea is proven to prevent growth reductions in forest trees induced by ozone. The community of mycorrhizal fungi could be useful indicator of environmental stress. In this study, response of mycorrhizal fungi and fine roots to a 4-year exposure to ambient ozone and treatment with antiozonant was investigated in ozone-sensitive poplar clone under field conditions. The community of ectomycorrhizal fungi and root length colonization with ectomycorrhizal, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and root endophytic fungi was analyzed in antiozonant-treated poplar plants and in poplar plants irrigated with water. In general, plants protected by antiozonant showed higher total number of fine roots, number of ectomycorrhizal types, Shannon-Weaver diversity index, and Species richness index compared to the plants treated with water. The ectomycorrhizal community shifted from contact exploration type in the trees irrigated with water to short-distance exploration type in ethylene diurea-treated trees. Ozone protectant may beneficially affect the belowground community of mycorrhizal fungi colonizing roots of ozone-sensitive poplar clone.

AB  - Modeling residential energy consumption survey (RECS) data is a complex socio-technical problem that involves macroeconomics, climate, physical characteristics of housing, household demographics and usage of appliances. A multilevel regression (MR) model is introduced to calculate the magnitude and significance of effects of environment indicators and household features on residential energy consumption (REC). MR helps construct a conceptual framework and organize explanatory variables. The benefit of this approach is that based on stratified sampling schemes, MR extracts area effects from total variations of REC and explains the remaining variations with manifest variables and their interactions. Using the US 2009 RECS micro data consisting of 10,838 unique cases, 26 primary determinants of REC are found to be division groups, housing type, house size, usage of space heating equipment, household size and use of air-conditioning, etc. MR helps to quantify 82% of area effects and 47% of household effects. Proportion of the overall explained variance proportion is 53% compared to <40% using OLS regression models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Calcium chloride-extractable (1:10 soil/solution ratio, w/v) nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), organic nitrogen (EON), and Ntotal fractions were measured in two long-term experiments. Both experiments are located in the Great Hungarian Plain. The first experiment was established on a Luvic Phaeozem soil and the second experiment was on a Calcic Chernozem soil. Researchers investigated the effects of long-term fertilization and irrigation on the amounts of nitrogen (N) fractions. Nitrogen rates caused significant increase in NO3-N and Ntotal fractions. These fractions were in close correlation (r = 0.87; r = 0.88) with nitrogen balance. The nitrate content of the 200-cm-deep soil layer of soils under different nitrogen-and water-supply conditions were also studied. As an effect of N overfertilization, the maximum nitrate accumulation on nonirrigated plots occurred in the 200-cm depth, whereas on irrigated plots a nitrate accumulation layer could not be observed in the 200-cm-deep soil layer.

AB  - The characteristic species of Hydrocharitetum morsus-ranae (Hydrocharis morsus-ranae and Stratiotes aloides) are used to determine the ecological condition of surface waters in many countries of the European Union. Aquatic and marshland plants play an important role in shaping the chemical composition of the littoral zone of eutrophic and mezotrophic water reservoirs. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of the extent of coverage of water surface by Hydrocharicetum morsus-ranae on the physicochemical and chemical properties of water inhabited by both plant species. Conducted field studies indicate that Hydrocharicetum morsus-ranae existed in reservoirs that are considered polluted due to the concentration of lead. The cumulation of mineral nutrients by plants inhabiting the studied reservoirs affected the chemical composition of the analyzed waters by limiting the influence of Hydrocharis morsus-ranae and Stratiotes abides on the quality of these waters. The ecological range of occurrence of Hydrocharis morsus-ranae relative to most chemical water quality indicators is wider than that of Stratiotes aloides.

AB  - Biotic indices have been developed to summarise information provided by benthic macroinvertebrates, but their use can require specialized taxonomic expertise as well as a time-consuming operation. Using high taxonomic level in biotic indices reduces sampling processing time but should be considered with caution, since assigning tolerance level to high taxonomic levels may cause uncertainty. A methodology for family level tolerance categorization based on the affinity of each family with disturbed or undisturbed conditions was employed. This family tolerance classification approach was tested in two different areas from Mediterranean Sea affected by sewage discharges. Biotic indices employed at family level responded correctly to sewage presence. However, in areas with different communities among stations and high diversity of species within each family, assigning the same tolerance level to a whole family could imply mistakes. Thus, use of high taxonomic level in biotic indices should be only restricted to areas where homogeneous community is presented and families across sites have similar species composition.

AB  - This paper develops a sociologically informed understanding of what influences the lives and life-choices of people living in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan (Central Asian Republics) and Armenia and Georgia (the Caucasus), four of the successor states of the Soviet Union that suffered significant social and economic changes following the collapse of the Union in 1991. The focus is on the nature of these societies for their citizens; ultimately we are concerned to understand what makes a society liveable for all, what type of society enables people to be generally satisfied with their lives. To do this we use the Social Quality model to derive indicators from which to model what makes for a liveable or at least tolerable society. The model is validated by reference to subjective satisfaction-how people feel about life in general-as the ultimate outcome indicator of individual well-being. The data we use were collected as part of a broader study of living conditions, lifestyles and health in eight of the successor states of the Soviet Union, the Confederation of Independent States (CIS).

AB  - Two practical issues are involved in asset life prediction using degradation indicators: (1) identifying uncertain failure thresholds of degradation indicators and (2) fusing multiple degradation indicators extracted from condition monitoring data. The state space degradation model provides an effective approach to address these two issues. However, existing research on the state space degradation model largely adopts a discrete time or states assumption which requires equal inspection intervals or discretising continuous degradation indicators. To remove the discrete time and states assumptions, this paper proposes a Gamma-based state space model. The Gamma process has a monotonically increasing property that is consistent with the irreversible degradation processes of engineering assets within a single maintenance cycle. The monotonically increasing property also makes the establishment of the likelihood function more straightforward when failure times are considered In this paper, parameter estimation and lifetime prediction algorithms for the Gamma-based state space model are developed. In addition, an effectiveness evaluation approach for indicators in degradation modelling is established. The proposed Gamma-based state space model and algorithms are validated using both simulated data and afield dataset from a liquefied natural gas company.

AB  - This study compares some etiological factors involved in the naturally occurrence of lamb scours in 18 Merino sheep farms randomly selected in the area of "La Serena" (Southwest Spain).
   A lack of influence of some variables (flock size, type of facilities, type of breeding, lambing percentage, isolation of Campylobacter jejuni, Rotavirus spp., Coronavirus spp. and Salmonella spp.) on lamb mortality rate was detected. The opposite was true for cleaning of the lambing areas, organization of lambing periods, accumulation of lambs in the pens, high content of fat, protein and lactose in milk and low serum gamma globulin and total protein in lambs and ewes. Cryptosporidium spp. and Escherichia coli isolation showed a trend to be linked to the presence of diarrhoea. A positive correlation was found between serum total protein in ewes and serum gamma globulin in lambs. Thus, the measure of serum total protein in ewes before lambing would be a valuable indicator of the risk of lamb scouring and it would be useful to establish an adequate programme to prevent this condition in the farms of this geographical area.

AB  - Short-term in vitro assays are arising in order to determine the toxicity of native Diesel aerosol particles, due to its association with adverse health effects. Estimation of the real quantity and characteristics of the particles deposition on the cells cultures in these assays becomes necessary to establish correlations between the particle deposition conditions and the biological indicators of toxicity of the exposed cells.
   On that basis, it is the aim of this paper to analyze the deposition of sub-micron particles in an air/liquid interface cells exposure system by means of a CFD (computational fluid dynamics) code. Some comparisons with experimental and modelled results are shown to probe the validity of the method and a detailed analysis on the deposition of particles and efficiency of exposure-cells systems, with perpendicular contact, is carried out.
   Furthermore, a parametric study on the effect of particle diameter, particle density and flow inlet velocity revealed the importance of such parameters in the efficiency and pattern of particle deposition. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Customer metrics are pivotal to assessing and monitoring how firms perform with customers and other publics. The authors contend that customer metrics used by firms today are predominantly rear-view mirrors reporting the past or dashboards reporting the present. They argue that companies need to and can develop "adaptive foresight" to be positioned to predict the future by exploiting changes in the business environment and anticipating customer behavior. They address the need for adaptive foresight by synthesizing and integrating literature on customer metrics, customer relationship management, customer asset management, and customer portfolio management. They begin by reviewing the metrics that have been and are currently being used to capture customer focus. Next, they discuss possible "headlight" or forward-looking customer metrics that would allow firms to anticipate changes and provide opportunities to increase the value of the customer base. They then identify the conditions under which the new metrics would be appropriate and offer a process for developing adaptive foresight. The authors close by discussing the implications of adaptive foresight for successful customer asset management that increases long-run business performance.

AB  - Forms of acidity and base buffering in KCI extracts and water suspensions from mineral horizons of podzolic and bog-podzolic soils have been studied. It is found that soil acidity increases at initial stages of hydromorphism. The main buffering reaction upon the titration of water suspensions is the deprotonation of functional groups of organic acids and OH- groups on the surface of the particles of Fe and Al hydroxides. The base buffering of water suspensions upon their titration to pH 8.0 correlates with the exchangeable acidity but exceeds it at the expense of participation of less acidic components; it is almost equal to the total soil acidity, as both phenomena have a common nature. All the soils studied are characterized by a common regularity in the buffer properties of water suspensions: their base buffering in particular pH intervals increases with an increase in the pH of a water suspension. When KCI extracts are titrated with the use of phenolphthalein as an indicator of pH conditions, the values of exchangeable acidity are overestimated in comparison with those obtained with the use of potentiometric control of pH values.

TI  - Federal reference and equivalent methods for measuring fine particulate matter
T2  - AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - In the national ambient air quality standards specified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in the Code of Federal Regulations, new standards were established for particulate matter on July 18, 1997. The new particulate matter standards specify mass concentration as the indicator for fine particulate matter (aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 mum or less). Ambient measurements for the new particulate standard must be performed by a new federal reference method as specified in the Code of Federal Regulations or by an alternative measurement method that has been designated by the Environmental Protection Agency as an equivalent method. The new particulate reference method is a 24 h integrated sample collected from the ambient air and analyzed gravimetrically. The reference method is explicitly specified using a combination of design- and performance-based criteria. Additional requirements listed in the Code of Federal Regulations address conditioning, handling, and weighing of the sample filter, which are performed manually. For alternative measurement techniques that do not meet the qualifications of the reference method, the Environmental Protection Agency defines three classes of candidate PM2.5 equivalent methods based on the measurement technique used and its degree of similarity to the reference method specifications.

AB  - The frequency of micronuclei (MN) induced by pentachlorophenol (PCP) in haemocytes of zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha Pall. and great ramshorn snail, Planorbarius corneus L. was determined over a 14 days of exposure (sampling after 4, 7 and 14 days) under laboratory conditions, PCP doses for zebra mussel ranged from 10 to 150 mu g/l, and for ramshorn snail from 10 to 450 mu g/l. Micronuclei were detected after bisbenzimide fluorescent staining. Positive responses were observed in both species. The mean MN frequencies in treated mussels ranged between 0.69 and 7.50 parts per thousand, and between 2.07 and 13.80 parts per thousand in treated snails. The spontaneous MN levels in mussels averaged from 0.5 to 2.75 parts per thousand, and in snails from 1.55 to 2.00 parts per thousand. Our results suggest that haemolymph of both species represent an appropriate test tissue in environmental genotoxicity assessment. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of this study was to compare the resistance of 73 cacao clones against Phytophthora palmivora by inoculating leaf disks with a zoospore suspension (3 x 10(5) zoospores/mL) mixture from seven isolates or by placing paper filter disks immersed in the zoospore suspension mixture, at two points on detached pods. Existing data from CEPEC/CEPLAC Germplasm Bank on clone natural infection under field conditions was correlated to artificial inoculation results. The in vitro assays were duplicated (A1 and A2) for leaf disks (8 replicates of 5 disks each/block/clone), and for pods with a variable number of replicates per clone. Data were transformed to disease severity index (ID) and lesion area (A). Results showed that all the evaluated clones were effectively infected by the pathogen in all tests, and mean ID and A values varied significantly. Although significant correlations were observed between A1 and detached pod infection, and between A2 and field natural infection, the latter showed the highest correlation coefficient.

AB  - Striving for excellence during the assembling process through incorporating the expectations of Industry 4.0 requires complex information management on issues of overall system status, especially the physical characteristics and position of the parts being assembled, as well as the assembling units and tools. This research introduces both an overall customized assembling system supervision model, which is based on a modified four-layer control system hierarchy that suits the specific requirements of such systems and the developed wireless sensor network technology for assembling process management with a particular focus on localization. The developed model highlights the localization problems of the system as well as other aspects required for overall system status determination. The localization of assembled parts is based on the fingerprint localization method by using the received signal strength indicator. The proposed localization algorithms are based either on artificial neural networks or on the weighted k-nearest neighbor method. The developed model has been tested both in laboratory conditions and in a simulated industrial environment. The research results offer a general solution to the problem of assembling system supervision, regardless of size and shape, with emphasis on the localization problem solution.

KW  - EU
AB  - Severe material deprivation, a dimension of the poverty and social exclusion index, one of Europe 2020 Strategy headline indicators, is defined as enforced lack of at least four of nine specific items. Proposals for modifications in the indicator include the Material and Social Deprivation indicator which is based on an updated set of thirteen items, whereas the choice of the threshold was data-driven. This paper proposes a simple, yet a rigorous methodology based on the Youden index to set a threshold to classify individuals into 'deprived' and 'non-deprived' groups. Applying the Youden index to 2014-2018 EU-Statistics on Income and Living Conditions data suggests an optimal cut-off point of the value of 5. This is in line with the suggestions of the Indicators Sub-Group of the Social Protection Committee. The estimated rates of material deprivation based on the new indicator are 2.2-times higher on average than the current rate. Assuming that the newly proposed definition better reflects the true nature of deprivation in the EU, the aggregate measure of 'at risk of poverty or social exclusion' has been underestimated, as material deprivation is one of its three dimensions.

AB  - Measuring the achievement of a sustainable development requires the integration of various data sets and disciplines describing bio-physical and socio-economic conditions. These data allow characterizing any location on Earth, assessing the status of the environment at various scales (e.g. national, regional, global), understanding interactions between different systems (e.g. atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, geosphere), and modeling future changes. The Group on Earth Observations (GEO) was established in 2005 in response to the need for coordinated, comprehensive, and sustained observations related to the state of the Earth. GEO's global engagement priorities include supporting the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement on Climate, and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. A proposition is made for generalizing and integrating the concept of EVs across the Societal Benefit Areas of GEO and across the border between Socio-Economic and Earth systems EVs. The contributions of the European Union projects ConnectinGEO and GEOEssential in the evaluation of existing EV classes are introduced. Finally, the main aim of the 10 papers of the special issue is shortly presented and mapped according to the proposed typology of SBA-related EV classes.

AB  - The vaginal microbiome of healthy women is a diverse and dynamic system of various microorganisms. Any sudden change in microbe composition can increase the vaginal pH and thus lead to vaginal infections, conditions that affect a large percentage of women each year. The most common fungal strains involved in infections belong to the yeast species Candida albicans. The main virulence factor of C. albicans is the ability to transform from planktonic yeast-form cells into a filamentous form (hyphae or pseudohyphae), with the subsequent formation of biofilm. The hyphal form, constituted by filamentous cells, has the ability to invade tissue and induce inflammation. Our hypothesis is that certain polyhydroxylated carboxylic acids, that may serve as an alternative carbohydrate source and at the same time lower the pH, function as an indicator of a nutrient-rich environment for C. albicans, which favors planktonic cells over hyphae, and thus diminish the formation of biofilm. We have shown that the biofilm formation in C. albicans and other Candida species can be significantly reduced by the addition of glucono-delta-lactone (GDL).

AB  - In order to explore physicochemical and biological effects on detachment and activity recovery of aging biofilm by enzyme and surfactant treatments, two kinds of biofilm processes, i.e. biological aeration filter (BAF) and moving bed biofilm reactor ( MBBR), and multiple indicators including water quality, biofilm morphology, activity and microbial community structure, were employed. Results showed that detachment of aging biofilm was mainly attributed by extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) solubilization and dispersion, and activity recovery of aging biofilm mainly depended on biological effects of dominant bacteria. Phosphorus metabolism related bacteria, such as Microbacterium and Micropruina, were responsible for BAF biofilm regeneration. More abundant microbial community structure of MBBR regenerated biofilm was found, and biofilm activity was not only related to phosphorus metabolism related bacteria, but also to denitrifying bacteria. Rhamnolipid performed best on aging biofilm detachment and regeneration, giving a clue for effective activation of aging biofilm in wastewater treatment systems.

AB  - Utilization of relatively simple devices fitted for the ring frames permits the realization of yarns with filamentary elastomer core. The aspect of yarns is similar with that of the classical yarns, but their structure and characteristics are very different. Depending on the core-sheath combination, filaments and fibers nature and characteristics, the quota of components participation, yarn twisting degree etc., the range of these yarns assortment is practically unlimited. Due to the large capacity of deformation and recovery of the elastomer filaments, the classical methodologies used to determine the classical yarns characteristics cannot be applied to the elastomer-containing yarns, and these yarns show specific indicators for characteristics assessment. This work presents a synthesis of some ample researches on the methods and characteristics of wool-type yarns with elastomer core, as well as the transfer of elastomer filament characteristics to the composite yarns that contain elastomer.

AB  - Spatial and temporal databases that integrate urban tree inventories and soil quality information are needed for modern-day sustainable urban forest management. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the usefulness of low-cost and widely-available technology, such as global positioning system (GPS)-enabled cameras to photo-document sites and cloud-based products and services (Google Picasa and Fusion Tables), to aid in developing sustainable street tree management programs. Google Fusion Tables provide a cloud platform to store, share and map urban tree and soil data over time using internet connected computers, tablets or mobile devices. Although indicators of urban soil quality and best methods to assess it are not yet standardized, we demonstrate here promising indicators that are both useful and easy to incorporate into spatial and temporal databases of trees managed in urban environments. By utilizing technology, we demonstrate that site-specific urban soil quality indicators can be used together with readily-available soil rating systems specific to different plant types as a means to better evaluate and manage conditions for optimal street tree growth and health.

AB  - Small spatial differences in field conditions can strongly influence plant growth and create difficulties in terms of defining optimal crop management practices. Precision agriculture (PA) is considered to offer an optimal solution since it can adapt cultivation measures to small-scale in-field heterogeneity. Furthermore, it can potentially create environmental benefits through more efficient use of inputs. Since research on decision support is lacking with regard to the economic consequences of PA implementation, the authors use this heterogeneity as an indicator for an assessment of the benefits of PA. A new approach for using a site-specific heterogeneity indicator (HEI) that is linked to economics is presented. The HEI is defined as the coefficient of variation in annual field yield. Based on a study in East Germany between 2005 and 2007, an HEI threshold value of 17% for profitable PA was identified based on individual and external benefits. Grounded in more detailed data, the HEI could serve as a useful decision-support tool for farmers in deciding whether or not to implement PA.

AB  - Approximately 57% of the Brazilian northeast region is recognized as semi-arid land and has been undergoing intense land use processes in the last decades, which have resulted in severe degradation of its natural assets. Therefore, the objective of this study is to identify the areas that are susceptible to desertification in this region based on the 11 influencing factors of desertification (pedology, geology, geomorphology, topography data, land use and land cover change, aridity index, livestock density, rural population density, fire hot spot density, human development index, conservation units) which were simulated for two different periods: 2000 and 2010. Each indicator were assigned weights ranging from 1 to 2 (representing the best and the worst conditions), representing classes indicating low, moderate and high susceptibility to desertification. The results indicate that 94% of the Brazilian northeast region is under moderate to high susceptibility to desertification. The areas that were susceptible to soil desertification increased by approximately 4.6% (83.4 km(2)) from 2000 to 2010. The implementation of the methodology provides the technical basis for decision-making that involves mitigating actions and the first comprehensive national assessment within the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification framework.

AB  - Most of the experimental testing in ecotoxicology takes place at the individual level, but the protection goals for environmental risk assessment are at the population level (or higher). Population modelling can fill this gap, but only models on a mechanistic basis allow for extrapolation beyond the conditions in the experimental tests. The life-history traits of individuals form the basis of population dynamics, and population modelling thus requires a proper understanding of the individual's behaviour. The dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory offers a flexible platform for the development of models at the individual level. Linking DEB models to population models can thus provide a mechanistic basis for extrapolation. Here, we provide a conceptual overview of DEB theory, with emphasis on its applications in ecotoxicology. Furthermore, we briefly review the applications in which a DEB-based individual model has been linked to structured population dynamics. Finally, we discuss some of the most important areas for further research in this context. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A cattle welfare index was estimated through 14 visual indicators in the cow-calf system in northern Mexico. The study was carried out at 25 ranches in Chihuahua, Mexico. The indicators were rangeland forage availability; rangeland plant diversity; ease of walking owing to terrain slope; ease of walking owing to presence of rocks; water availability; water distribution; water distance; water appearance; heat protection through vegetation; cold protection through vegetation; cold protection through topography; cold protection through management; cattle docility and cattle body condition. A score of 1 to 4 was given to each indicator, rated as poor, fair, good and excellent, respectively. Ranches under study were classified according to their dominant vegetation type. Noticeable differences were obtained among animal welfare indexes, depending on rangeland type. The lowest index of 2.82 was recorded for the desert shrublands, while indexes above 3.0 were observed for the shortgrass prairie and oak-bunchgrass rangelands. Indicators with high values were water availability and distribution. The lower cattle welfare scores were related to natural factors rather than to management indicators.

AB  - Within the framework of this paper, the traffic, environmental and energy impacts of large-scale infrastructure projects are examined and evaluated through the use of traffic simulation modelling techniques. In an effort to realise how such projects affect sustainable development, this study initially summarises the main idea of sustainability by integrating its respective goals, objectives and principles. The paper then briefly outlines the basic demographical and geographical characteristics of the case study area, i.e. Thessaloniki, where an external outer ring road is planned for construction. The results of the examination of various indicators such as average speed, travel time, travel distance, fuel consumption and pollutants emmited (CO, CO2, NOx, HC, Pb and PM10) after the implementation of the project are subsequently presented and discussed. The paper concludes that the feasibility of a large-scale project should be examined not only in terms of improving the traffic flow conditions but should also be related with the environmental sustainability of the greater area. The current research confirms the non straight correlation between traffic and environmental improvement.

AB  - Short- and long-term field experiments are necessary to provide important information about how soil carbon sequestration is affected by soil tillage system; such systems can also be useful for developing sustainable crop production systems. In this study, we evaluated the short- and long-term effects of conservation tillage (CT) on soil organic carbon fractions and biological properties in a sandy clay loam soil. Both trials consisted of rainfed crop rotation systems (cereal-sunflower-legumes) located in semi-arid SW Spain. In both trials, results were compared to those obtained using traditional tillage (TT). Soil samples were taken in flowering and after harvesting of a pea crop and collected at three depths (0-5, 5-10 and 10-20 cm). The soil organic carbon fractions were measured by the determination of total organic carbon (TOC), active carbon (AC) and water soluble carbon (WSC). Biological status was evaluated by the measurement of soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and enzymatic activities [dehydrogenase activity (DHA), o-diphenol oxidase activity (DphOx), and beta-glucosidase activity (beta-glu)].
   The contents of AC and MBC in the long-term trial and contents of AC in the short-term trial were higher for CT than TT at 0-5 cm depth for both sampling periods. Furthermore, DHA and beta-glucosidase values in the July sampling were higher in the topsoil under conservation management in both trials (short- and long-term). The parameters studied tended to decrease as depth increased for both tillage system (TT and CT) and in both trials with the exception of the DphOx values, which tended to be higher at deeper layers.
   Values of DHA and beta-glu presented high correlation coefficients (r from 0.338 to 0.751, p <= 0.01) with AC, WSC and TOC values in the long-term trial. However, there was no correlation between either TOC or MBC and the other parameters in the short-term trial. In general, only stratification ratios of AC were higher in CT than in TT in both trials. The results of this study showed that AC content was the most sensitive and reliable indicator for assessing the impact of different soil management on soil quality in the two experiments (short- and long-term).
   Conservation management in dryland farming systems improved the quality of soil under our conditions, especially at the surface layers, by enhancing its storage of organic matter and its biological properties, mainly to long-term. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Using electron microscopy, we identified Synura petersenii as a predominant planktonic blooming algal species in two small, shallow eutrophic water bodies in Korea in summer and autumn. We further investigated the in vitro growth characteristics at different temperatures, pH values and light intensities of three strains of S. petersenii (termed JC, JD, and WM strains) isolated from three water bodies in Kyungpook Province, Korea. The three strains of S. petersenii exhibited the highest growth rates at 15 degrees C. The maximum growth of S. petersenii occurred between pH 7.5 and 8.2 according to strain. JC and JD strains of S. petersenii exhibited the highest growth rates at a light intensity of 80 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), whereas the maximum growth rate of WM strain was at 112 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). The optimal light intensity of S. petersenii was affected by the temperature. The three strains of S. petersenii had different optimal growth requirements, suggesting that they exhibited strain-specific adaptation.

AB  - The state of the California Current System (CCS) between Ore.-on and Baja California is summarized in this report, covering spring 2006 to spring 2007, Observations reported here are based on contributions from various ocean observing programs along the West Coast of North America. Basin-scale indicators were variable or neutral over the last year. This indeterminate forcing was reflected in conditions in the CCS where no coherent patterns emerged, i.e., no single "state" could be ascribed to the system. Rather, regional or local processes dominated observed patterns. Similar to last year, delayed upwelling off Ore-on and central California dramatically affected higher trophic levels: euphausiid recruitment was delayed and as a likely consequence seabird productivity off Central California was extremely depressed. For example, Cassin's auklet had a complete reproductive failure, similar to 2006. Observations during the spring of 2007 demonstrate that these patterns were ephemeral since upwelling was normal and seabird productivity improved. Off southern and Baja California, upwelling-favorable winds were also weak or delayed during 2006, but biological consequences appear to have been relatively minor.

AB  - We tested the capacity of several published multispectral indices to estimate the nitrogen nutrition of wheat canopies grown under different levels of water supply and plant density and derived a simple canopy reflectance index that is greatly independent of those factors. Planar domain geometry was used to account for mixed signals from the canopy and soil when the ground cover was low. A nitrogen stress index was developed, which adjusts shoot % N for plant biomass and area, thereby accounting for environmental conditions that affect growth, such as crop water status. The canopy chlorophyll content index (CCCi) and the modifed spectral ratio planar index (mSR(Pi)) could explain 68 and 69% of the observed variability in the nitrogen nutrition of the crop as early as Zadoks 33, irrespective of water status or ground cover. The CCCi was derived from the combination of 3 wavebands 670, 720 and 790 nm, and the mSRPi from 445, 705 and 750 nm, together with broader bands in the NIR and RED. The potential for their spatial application over large fields/paddocks is discussed.

AB  - The North Water polynya is an area of open water that occurs year round between northwest Greenland and Canada. Oceanographic conditions differ between the western ('latent heat' polynya type) and extreme eastern ('sensible heat' polynya type) sectors of the polynya, and the effects of this variation on prey availability and foraging conditions for high trophic-level predators are unknown. Thick-billed murres Uria lomvia breed on both sides of the polynya, and we conducted inter-colony comparisons of their foraging ecology. We measured time allocation and foraging efforts of chick-rearing adults using electronic data-loggers which recorded dive profiles and flight activity. Murres on the western side of the North Water polynya foraged at relatively shallow depths and rarely (4.4% of dives) explored depths beyond 70 m. In contrast, murres on the eastern side searched for prey at >70 m in 23% of all dives, and spent a greater share of each trip actively diving. The Canadian birds made foraging trips of longer duration than the Greenland murres, but they also spent more time 'resting' at the sea surface. Rest time at sea was apparently the only time buffer available for increasing foraging effort. The Greenland birds had little room for increasing foraging effort, while the Canadian birds had spare capacity for additional work. Maximum potential foraging ranges were equal at the 2 colonies (75% within 50 km), and the murres had access to approximately equally-sized areas of open sea. We estimate that the density of foraging birds at sea within the 50 km of colonies would be 6.5 times higher on the Canadian side due to the large breeding colony at Coburg Island. Intra-specific competition for food should increase with increasing colony size because the predators may reduce food resources within their foraging range. Nevertheless, the Canadian birds worked less than Greenland murres, indicating a relatively good food availability in the western part of the polynya. However, the higher foraging effort by Greenland murres paid off in a higher chick growth rate, so it remains unclear why the Canadian birds did not also make use of their spare capacity to increase foraging effort. Since high-level zooplankton/fish stock interactions are seldom part of oceanographic studies in the Arctic, seabird foraging behaviour and breeding ecology serve as two of the few indicators of possible local variation within the polynya ecosystem.

AB  - Modern diatom assemblages were related to surface water chemistry from 42 lakes in the southwestern Yukon and in northern British Columbia. The lakes were alkaline (pH ranged from 7.5 to 9.4) with high specific conductance (mean = 379 muS cm(-1)). The lakes spanned a relatively wide range of trophic conditions, with the majority being oligotrophic or meso-eutrophic. Lake water depth, alkalinity, lake surface area, and Mg accounted for most of the variation in the diatom assemblages. Diatom assemblages most closely resembled those of the southern interior of British Columbia, where high conductance lakes are numerous, although many of the taxa were common to other northern regions, including Siberia, Alaska and other parts of the Yukon. These data may be used in conjunction with other data from northern regions, including the Yukon and Alaska, to provide broader descriptions of environmental preferences of diatom taxa by extending the range of environmental variables such as alkalinity and specific conductance.

AB  - The structure of the larval fish assemblages along an ocean-estuarine gradient in the St Lucia region on the northern KwaZulu-Natal coast of South Africa was examined using a combination of univariate, distributional and multivariate techniques. The data was comprised of a full annual set of ichthyoplankton samples taken from three types of environment: nearshore coastal waters, surf zone and within the St Lucia Estuary itself. The mean monthly densities of each species in each environment were used in the species matrix, and the mean monthly values of salinity, temperature and turbidity were used in the physical variables matrix. The mean species diversity and eveness index was significantly higher in the nearshore waters than the surf zone and estuary. The patterns of relative species abundances in each environment (K-dominance curves) showed that the estuarine environment was dominated by a few species in large numbers, the surf zone was intermediate, and the nearshore coast was the most diverse. Classification and multidimensional scaling (MDS) ordination analyses of larval fish densities grouped together into three main clusters based on the three different environments. The species similarity matrix (inverse analysis) clustered into four groups at the 10% similarity level. The MDS analysis of the same matrix showed that the groups separated out more or less according to the type of environment they occur in, and hence the level of estuarine dependence of the various species. Species belonging to each assemblage showed similarities with regards to their reproduction modes and/or preference to a particular physical condition. Some species were restricted to one environment, whilst others were common to two or all three environments. The occurrence of partially estuarine-dependent species in all three environments suggests that ocean-estuarine coupling is an important process for the recruitment success of these species. The 'best fitting' physical variable which explained the larval fish community patterns was turbidity on its own, with the relationship of larval densities to the physical variables being species-specific. The present study indicates that a number of factors must play a role in determining the structure and composition of larval fish assemblages occurring in different types of environments along an ocean-estuarine gradient. It is suggested that these distinct assemblages might be considered indicators for the different environments which they inhabit. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB  - We present the results of mineral magnetic measurements and geochemical analyses of late Glacial sediments from two marl-precipitating lakes in the Northwest of England. Mineral magnetic assemblages dominated by detrital and/or authigenic ferrimagnetic minerals, and enhanced delivery of metal elements, characterise a lower (Oldest Dryas) and an upper (Younger Dryas) phase of catchment instability, with detrital clay and silt sedimentation. Magnetic mineral assemblages with lower concentrations of finer ferrimagnetic grains characterise the authigenic carbonate sediments (marls). The marls indicate both enhanced lake productivity and catchment stability in response to prevailing warm conditions during the Bolling - Allerod Interstadial. The Bolling - Allerod marl phase contains two short-term, low amplitude shifts characterised by changes in the concentration and the size of ferrimagnetic grains. These shifts may represent the Older Dryas and the Amphi-Atlantic Oscillation, short-lived Northern hemisphere climatic deteriorations. Overall, the results suggest that marl lakes are sensitive indicators of Lateglacial climatic change, and that these changes are readily identifiable through the use of mineral magnetic measurements.

AB  - The characterization of fluoresceinphosphatidylethanolamine (FPE) as a real-timid indicator of the electrostatic nature of a membrane surface is described. The conditions appropriate for the labelling of membranes and the implementation of FPE as a tool to monitor the interactions of various peptides with model membranes are outlined. It is shown that of the membrane-active peptides studied, Naja naja kaouthia cardiotoxin and pyrularia thionin bind to certain model membranes without insertion. Whereas the leader sequence of the nuclear encoded subunit IV of mammalian cytochrome c oxidase (E.C. 1.9.3.1), known as p-25, and melittin appear to bind and then partially insert into the membrane. It seems evident also that melittin does not adopt a fully transmembrane configuration. Melittin is known to promote membrane! lysis and by employing a rapid-kinetic technique it is shown that the time-course of such lysis does not appear to correlate with peptide binding, but following binding a significant proportion of melittin must become inserted into the membrane before lysis appears to commence.

AB  - Parental care theory predicts that investment in current reproduction should be increased when the prospects of success in current reproductive effort are relatively high, and reduced when they are poor relative to expected success from future reproductive effort. A number of studies have shown that levels of postspawning parental investment (brood defence, parents' willingness to risk predation) increase when the brood is augmented. However, few studies have shown a change in prespawning (gonadal) investment in response to indirect indicators of reproductive success, such as nest site quality. Convict cichlids (Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum) are small freshwater fish that have biparental care of their young. Pairs of convict cichlids were required to spawn in either ''risky'' or ''secure'' spawning caves in the presence of potential egg predators. As predicted by parental care theory, females laid significantly more eggs in secure spawning caves than in risky spawning caves. The ability of this iteroparous fish to adjust gonadal investment in this manner would serve to optimize the use of its resources under varying environmental conditions and ultimately allow it to realize maximize lifetime reproductive success.

AB  - The interactions between groundwater depth and soil hydrological processes, play an important role in both arid and semi-arid ecosystems. The effect of groundwater depth on soil water variations were neglected or not explicitly treated. In this paper, we combine a simulation experiment and a water flow module of HYDRUS-1D model to study the variation in soil evaporation under different groundwater depth conditions and the relationship between groundwater depth and evaporation efficiency in Horqin Sandy Land, China. The results showed that with an increase in groundwater depth, the evaporation of soil and the recharge of groundwater decrease. In this study, the groundwater recharge did not account for more than 21% of the soil evaporation for the depths of groundwater examined. The soil water content at 60 cm was less affected by the evaporation efficiency when the mean groundwater depth was 61 cm during the experimental period. In addition, the evaporation efficiency (the ratio of actual evaporation to potential evaporation) decreases with the increase in groundwater depth during the experiment. Furthermore, the soil evaporation was not affected by groundwater when the groundwater depth was deeper than 239 cm.

AB  - The surface sediments from the Bohai Sea (BS) and the northern Yellow Sea (NYS) were analyzed for acidvolatile sulfide (AVS) and simultaneously extracted metals (SEM) to assess the sediment quality. The results indicated that>60% of the samples were found to have possible adverse effects on aquatic life in the BS based on the difference between the concentrations of AVS ([AVS]) and SEM ([SEM]), and the corresponding percentage in the NYS was<25%. Nevertheless, there was no indication of adverse effects for all the BS and the NYS samples when the total organic carbon (TOC) concentration was introduced in the sediment quality evaluation with [AVS] and [SEM]. The grain size composition, TOC, water content and pH all had significant influence on the distribution of [SEM] and the [SEM]/[AVS] ratios; while, in contrast, the distribution of [AVS] could be mainly determined by the redox condition of sediment.

AB  - The majority of interruptions in the network of a distribution system operator (DSO) occur at low voltage (LV) levels. Although the number of affected customers is less than that for medium voltage level interruptions, contribution to the annual customer minutes lost is considerable, and the yearly costs of solving the outages are high. Underground LV cables cannot be visually inspected, and monitoring systems are still experimental. In order to improve asset management (AM) for LV cables, it is beneficial for DSOs to be able to perform condition assessments using historical data, in combination with asset and environment data. In this paper, survival analysis is performed using the Cox proportional hazard model. The results of this analysis can be used to identify those variables that predict a relatively high failure probability and to estimate the relative risk of failure for cables. This enables the improvement of AM strategies, such as the preventative replacement of cables. The method presented in this paper shows promising results, allowing for greater insight into the causes of failures.

AB  - Boundary layer temperature inversion and mixing heights are important parameters in understanding the atmospheric dispersion of air pollution. Surface and elevated inversions were analyzed within the planetary boundary layer over Kuwait, a coastal urban city situated in a typical hot, arid climate. Temperature inversions constitute a natural hazard by trapping smog emitted from pollution sources. Temperature inversions were measured by the Meteorological Temperature Profiler version (MTP-5H) using a scanning microwave radiometer over the course of a complete year (2013). Remote continuous measurements (4 min interval) of temperature profiles were collected (total readings = 130,986). Daytime and nocturnal temperature inversion variations were presented. The effects of five atmospheric parameters, namely ambient temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, and precipitation on the surface and elevated inversion, were presented. In general, there was a significant correlation between surface and elevated inversions with four meteorological parameters (p value <= .01). Results show a weak correlation between the inversions analyzed by MTP-5H and the MH modeled by the WRF.

AB  - The chemical composition of tourmaline has been used as a host environment register as well as a potential exploration tool for mineral deposits. In this study, the textural and chemical composition of tourmalines associated with Zn-Pb mineralizations around the Murguia diapir (Basque Cantabrian Basin, N Spain) are examined to verify if they record the mineralizing events in the area. Petrographically, tourmalines have been differentiated between inherited and authigenic. Colorless authigenic tourmalines are present as halos partially around green and pleochroic detrital grains or as individual crystals. Inherited and authigenic tourmalines are also chemically distinct. Authigenic tourmalines show different X-site occupancies, a Mg/(Mg+Fe) ratio above 0.77, and are aluminum rich and plot to the right of the povondraite-oxidravite join, above the schorl-dravite join. Inherited tourmalines plot within the alkaline (Na+K) group field, and have a Mg/(Mg+Fe) ratio below 0.77. These data suggest that authigenic tourmalines grew under reducing conditions, compatible with the hydrothermal event responsible for the ore deposition and caprock formation during the diapir ascent.

KW  - CHEMISTRY
AB  - The content of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), organic carbon (C-org), and mineral nitrogen (N-min) in waters of Lake Baikal and its tributaries were analyzed. On the basis of these data, the indicators of the water composition, for Baikal Lake and its tributaries, were worked up for the first time. These indicatorsthe anthropogenic impact on the ecosystem (PAH/C-org) and the indicator of the capacity of the ecosystem to neutralize pollution (N-min/C-org)show a link between water pollution and the conditions of the watershed basin. It was established that (PAH/C-org) and (N-min/C-org) can be used simultaneously as tracers to calculate the tributary input into organic matter of the lake. It was also revealed that N-min/C-org is inversely proportional to the C-org concentration and directly proportional to N/C in the soil humus. On the basis of the indicators, the watershed areas and water area of the lake were distinguished. The areas are characterized by different levels of the pollution, self-purification capacity, and concentration of carbon in surface waters.

AB  - The Barekese reservoir has seen persistent degradation for decades through anthropogenic activities within its catchment. In spite of this, heavy metal pollution profile of fish species of the reservoir is not well studied. Total concentrations of Hg, Cd, Ni, and Cr were analyzed in muscle tissues of 45 edible fish species comprising (Tilapia zilli, Oreochromis niloticus, and Heterotis niloticus) from the reservoir. The examined fish species showed varying bioaccumulative factors for detected metals. A PCA biplot revealed that Cd showed association with all examined fish species used in the study indicating that Cd in the reservoir is biologically available for uptake by all examined fish species. A dendrogram of cluster analysis also revealed that Cd and Cr are in one cluster indicating their associations and similarities to a common anthropogenic source. The study suggests that anthropogenic activities are possible sources of heavy metal pollution in the Barekese reservoir and, hence, the examined fish species could be used to monitor the levels of Ni, Cr, Hg, and Cd in the reservoir.

AB  - Euendolithic marine fungi are ubiquitous bioeroders of calcareous skeletal substrates, even under the extreme environmental conditions of the polar regions. The new bioerosion trace fossil Saccomorpha guttulata isp. nov. is presumably produced by a marine fungus that is interpreted to be well adapted to low temperatures, based on the provenance of the studied fossil and recent material. Its trace may thus serve as indicator for cool- to cold-water (palaeo) environments. The microboring is diagnosed by a radiating and ramifying system of club-shaped segments that gradually widen from a thin filament into a distal node. Below the initial point of entry, a stalked central cavity of slightly larger dimension and depth of penetration is developed, from which several segments emerge. The segments are interpreted to reflect a regular temporal sequence in the formation of hyphal filaments that widen into sporangial cavities. While all Saccomorpha ichnospecies share this composition of presumed sporangial cavities and hyphal filaments, with a varying degree of segmentation and gradation between these two elements, different strategies with regards to the temporal pattern in the formation of the different functional elements have evolved.

AB  - In the present study a methodology for the evaluation of the environmental risk induced by accidental oil spills occurring from offshore installations was developed, addressing in particular the impact of spills on the sea and on the coastlines. The necessity of developing a risk assessment methodology for the environment derives from the poor attention reserved to this target by traditional procedures, which have addressed until now exclusively humans. Thanks to a recent increased environmental consciousness of institutions, industry and people, the new environmental policies more and more require the protection of the environment. In fact, Directive 2013/30/EU on the safety of offshore oil and gas operations has introduced more strict requirements for the protection of both the workers and the environment, that are the targets which could be involved and seriously damaged by incidents occurring on offshore installations. The methodology developed for the assessment of the risk for the sea water and the coasts produces specific quantitative risk indexes, based on credible spill events, wind and sea conditions and may support the implementation of remediation strategies.

AB  - This study examines the causal relationship between crude oil price, energy consumption and CO2 emissions in Ecuador over the period 1971-2013 incorporating indicators of economic performance. ARDL bounds testing approach to cointegration provides evidence of cointegration between the variables in the presence of structural break in the series. The long-run effect of energy consumption on CO2 emissions in the oil-dependent economy is found to be positive and statistically significant. The long-run and short-run causal effects of crude oil price on energy consumption and CO2 emissions in the economy are found positive and statistically significant, suggesting that higher crude oil prices create economic conditions that generate more energy consumption and CO2 emissions in the Ecuadorean economy. The direction of causality among the variables examined using Toda-Yamamoto Granger causality test procedure suggests that a unidirectional causality runs from crude oil price to energy consumption and economic growth, and bidirectional causality between energy consumption and CO2 emissions. A unidirectional causality that flows from CO2 emissions to economic growth through financial development is also observed in the economy.

AB  - Sparganothis sulfureana Clemens is a severe pest of cranberries in the Midwest and northeast United States. Timing for insecticide applications has relied primarily on calendar dates and pheromone trap-catch; however, abiotic conditions can vary greatly, rendering such methods unreliable as indicators of optimal treatment timing. Phenology models based on degree-day (DD) accrual represent a proven, superior approach to assessing the development of insect populations, particularly for larvae. Previous studies of S. sulfureana development showed that the lower and upper temperature thresholds for larval development were 10.0 and 29.9 degrees C (49.9 and 85.8 degrees F), respectively. We used these thresholds to generate DD accumulations specific to S. sulfureana, and then linked these DD accumulations to discrete biological events observed during S. sulfureana development in Wisconsin and New Jersey cranberries. Here, we provide the DDs associated with flight initiation, peak flight, flight termination, adult life span, preovipositional period, ovipositional period, and egg hatch. These DD accumulations represent key developmental benchmarks, allowing for the creation of a phenology model that facilitates wiser management of S. sulfureana in the cranberry system.

AB  - Power production by hydro-electric plants in response to short-term variations in the energy demand and market (hydropeaking) may lead to frequent and rapid fluctuations in flow and stage in rivers downstream of power plant outlets. We have developed a time series analysis tool designed to quantify these rapid fluctuations. They were identified by establishing river- and data-specific thresholds both for the rates of change in flow or stage, and for other peaking event parameters. In contrast to previous similar analyses, we separated peaking events into rapid increases and rapid decreases. We also analysed other parameters such as daylight conditions during peaking events, and calculated both mean and maximum rates of change in flow and stage. The results of such analysis in a Norwegian river were used to demonstrate outputs from the tool. Our tool may be useful with respect to environmental impact assessment and mitigation related to stream hydropeaking. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Levee, dike and earth embankment dam structures are difficult to assess because of their length and complexity. Managers often include geophysical investigations in the overall dike condition assessment and the DC-Electrical Resistivity Imaging (ERI) method is particularly applicable owing to its cost-effectiveness and its potential sensitivity to internal erosion. However, due to the truly 3D nature of embankment dikes, implementing inline longitudinal tomographies along with conventional 2D inversion is likely to yield image artefacts. 3D effects from external causes (geometry, water reservoir) can be predicted and therefore we present a new approach based on redefining the normalisation principle to derive apparent resistivities from the measured data. The aim is to provide a set of pre-processed apparent resistivities that are not contaminated by external 3D effects and that yield more reliable results when processed within a 2D conventional inversion scheme. The presented approach is successfully applied to synthetic and real data sets, proving superior to the conventional 2D approach, although data acquisition approach is the same thus keeping the same cost-effectiveness.

AB  - Situated in the dynamic institutional environment of China's transitional economy, this study investigates the intricate relationships among economic inequality, status perceptions, and subjective well-being. Empirical evidence is drawn from national survey data collected from urban China. Statistical analyses show that multiple indicators of economic well-being exert a significant effect on self-perceived social status and status change and on subjective well-being. Positive status perceptions further enhance one's subjective well-being. Some of these effects are also moderated by contextual inequality. This study advances the literature by moving beyond income-based measures to examine the consequences of economic disparity. It also shows that status perceptions are the key nexus to probe the impacts of economic well-being and the sources of life satisfaction. Findings further direct our attention to important interplays between the individual-level socioeconomic conditions and the contextual inequality in achieving a deeper understanding of the consequences of socioeconomic inequality.

AB  - This article deals with the design of a parametric eigenstructure assignment (PEA)-based multi-objective reconfigurable output feedback controller for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system against partial actuator failure. The significance of the PEA technique is that it provides more design degrees of freedom to obtain multi-objective functions, namely robust stability and improved transient response. Robust stability and transient response are ensured by a minimum condition number of the eigenvector and a minimum norm of controller gain. These two objectives are conflicting in nature, and, hence, the main aim is to minimize both objectives simultaneously by means of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA). In this study, a multi-objective optimization problem is formulated and is solved by non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm-II (SPEA-II). Four indicators are used to evaluate each algorithm performance: spacing, error ratio, generational distance, and hypervolume. Then a reconfigurable controller is designed using PEA against actuator failure, which guarantees closed-loop stability. The effectiveness of the proposed controllers is demonstrated by implementing them in an interacting three-tank benchmark system.

AB  - Environmental indicators from lake sediments provide excellent opportunities to improve understanding of forest disturbance processes and corresponding changes in forest composition. Our research provides a methodology for assessing recent, historic, and prehistoric disturbances using lacustrine sediment records. We collected sediment cores from Blue Lake, a small subalpine lake on the Wasatch Plateau in central Utah. These cores record environmental changes caused by both spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis Kirby) and human (logging and livestock grazing) modification. We observed deteriorated insect remains in the lake sediments. These remains correspond temporally with a historic spruce beetle outbreak, though alkaline conditions in the lake water may have inhibited preservation of bark beetle remains. Pollen data reveal that despite the unprecedented level of mortality among Engelmann spruce (Piece engelmannii Parry ex Engelm.) resulting from the spruce beetle epidemic, logging activities subsequent to Euro-American settlement appear to be the most severe disturbance to the Blue Lake watershed over the last 750 years.

AB  - This paper investigates local heating effects of the ear-skull region that handheld mobile phones can cause in humans. The goal is to visualize, quantify, and compare these thermal effects in various subjects using different commercial mobile phones in the normal contact position during standardized conversations. Thermal imaging is capable of measuring local temperatures directly, as opposed to other methods, which can only derive temperatures if the electromagnetic near-field pattern of the phone, the energy-absorbing tissue properties, and the blood-flow situation are exactly known. The strength of local temperature rises is an indicator of the total exposure related to radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation from the mobile phone. It is shown in this paper that different commercially available handheld mobile phones can cause very different thermal effects under identical experimental conditions. The measurement results are expected to help consumers in choosing those phones that cause the least thermal influences and biological effects. They might also help change the phone user's behavior in order to minimize the exposure to electromagnetic radiation.

AB  - Elongated outer tail streamers in Barn Swallows may play a functional role during the feeding activity, by enhancing manoeuvrability. Here we focus on the relationship between tail length and fat stores in adult male and female Barn Swallows captured during the post-breeding and pre-migratory periods. Fat score was higher among long-tailed males, but no such relationship was evident among females. However, the effect of tail on fat stores did not differ between the sexes. Hence, the relationship between fat and tail may be related both to naturally and sexually selected aspects of tail length, that is considered to be a sexually selected character and indicator of individual quality in males. Our results suggest that long-tailed males, due to their higher quality, may be able to raise their fat stores more than other individuals during the pre-migratory fattening period, and, at the same time, that long-tailed individuals of both sexes may be able to store food faster, according to the aeroelastic properties of outer tail streamers.

AB  - The aquaculture industry in Scotland is primarily located on the western and northern coasts of Scotland where geographical and hydrographic conditions suit the species cultured. The regulation and monitoring of the industry has adapted and grown with the industry. Over 10 years, production has increased 10-fold and the efficiency of the industry has improved along with husbandry and management techniques although major disease problems have occurred. Planning and siting controls have recently been reviewed incorporating new EC legislation on environmental impact assessment. Environmental protection and end product quality are achieved through complex legislation demanding licences to discharge waste products and the application of strict quality standards and targets to both the product and its growing and receiving environment. Monitoring programmes are well established to ensure compliance with the legislation The complexity of issues the industry now poses for regulation and monitoring have challenged traditional views and required new techniques to be developed, for example, mathematical modelling to set environmental targets for some medicines. A national approach has been needed which will benefit the industry and the regulators and allow focus to be brought to wider issues requiring research and development.

AB  - Odour pollution is traditionally categorised as a public health issue, controlled via statutory legislation with the emphasis on control rather than prevention. As society demands a higher quality environment, odour pollution increases in importance as an amenity issue. Planning authorities can refuse planning permission on the grounds that the odour nuisance from the proposed development will be detrimental to the amenity of the area. Planning authorities are therefore in the unique position of being able to prevent odour pollution. Potential odour polluters are under increasing pressure to demonstrate to planning authorities that odour has been minimised as far as possible. The communication of technical odour control data and assessments, through mechanisms such as Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA), is becoming an important part of the decision making process. The lack of specific odour policy and guidance within the planning arena is highlighted. The reconstruction of Derby Sewage Treatment works (STW) is used a a case study to highlight how a technical assessment of odour emissions, using the WRc Sewage Treatment Odour Production (STOP) Model can be successfully used within the planning arena to achieve planning permission with no additional conditions.

AB  - The pouched mouse, Saccostomus campestris, an African cricetid rodent with a solitary lifestyle, shows a wide range of litter sizes (1-13), both in the wild and in captivity. The occurrence of this species in areas ranging from dry semi-deserts to coastal dune forests as well as their unspecialised diet led us to suggest that it is a true opportunist. This is supported by their unique adaptation to respond swiftly to sudden environmental changes during pregnancy, by being able to resorb part or all of their foetuses as late as approximate to 72 hours prior to parturition. Partial resorptions may furthermore occur more than once during the same pregnancy. No correlation between litter size and rainfall - an indicator of resource availability - was recorded, but litter size was more predictable in dry and wet environments than in intermediate environments. Furthermore, pregnant females were recorded throughout the year. We suggest that pouched mice occupy and breed in a variety of environments. including unpredictable environments. by being able to breed throughout the year and adapt litter size through resorption of foetuses when environmental conditions are less favourable.

AB  - Modern beaches in McMurdo Sound can be divided into three process regimes. Beaches on Ross Island (eastern McMurdo Sound) are characterised by normal marine processes with little ice modification On ice-bound western McMurdo Sound, coastal orientation is of paramount importance. Ice thrust features are prominent on south facing beaches, which are open to the predominant wind direction, while more marine dominated beaches occur on north facing coasts where sea ice is blown offshore. In contrast to the modern beaches, raised beaches are similar all around McMurdo Sound. These are inferred to be storm ridges. The size and frequency of the ridges is a product of the local wave climate. The number of raised beaches at any site is a useful indicator of the paleo-wave climate. More ridges occur in sheltered south facing locations, because they are more protected from open marine conditions, than on beaches in ice-free or north facing locations. This is important for rebound reconstructions in the Sound as marine limits have been incorrectly identified in the past. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The international political economy of tropical rainforests related to their perceived role in global climatic change has to be set against real national and local political economies. These political economies involve socially driven biophysical responses with economic and social costs whose magnitude and distribution need to be known if policy formulation for improvement of living conditions is to succeed. Spatial linkages between changes and social costs, such as the downstream impacts of logging, need to be established, but before that can be done it is necessary to distinguish the effects of natural processes from those induced by people. In Malaysia logging or ground clearance increases river sediment yields by two to fifty times. Individual estimates may be unreliable indicators of the overall effects of change. However, the modifications to rivers as a result of raised sediment loads are increasing year by year. Site-based studies of the effects of both logging and shifting cultivation help to improve the data base for policy making and also indicate the efficiency of reduced impact logging and agroforestry techniques.

AB  - Body shape is an economically important trait in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) that directly influences consumer acceptance and farmer profitability. It is essential to incorporate shape traits into the ongoing breeding program, as this would be expected to achieve rapid growth and maintain a slender shape for cultured populations. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore a suitable morphological index for genetic improvement of shape traits in grass carp. The viscerosomatic index (VSI) was introduced as a quantitative indicator of individual slenderness for the evaluation of various morphological ratios. Then, based on correlation and path analysis among body measurements (BMs) and weights of 290 recorded individuals, nine representative ratios that can reflect body slenderness from different angles were employed in this study, including Fulton's condition factor (K), Richter's condition factor (B), and other length ratios of different BMs (S1-S7). The results showed that each of these ratios exhibited a favorable relationship with VSI, confirming that more slender individuals always have a lower VSI. Of these ratios, S1 (body height-to-body length ratio, BH/BL), S2 (body height-to-caudal peduncle height ratio, BH/CPH), and S3, calculated as (BH-CPH)/BL, had the top three correlation coefficients with VSI (r = 0.501, 0.558, and 0.591, respectively). Furthermore, the S3 index reached the highest correlation (r = 0.732) in the sample group (n = 50) of mean body weight of 1560.8 g, suggesting that a quantitative comparison of individual slenderness would be more accurate within this fish size range. In addition, 636 pedigreed fish from 21 full-sib families were used for estimates of genetic parameters via an animal model. In comparison with the low heritability of K, the three ratios showed moderate to high heritability (h2 = 0.47 +/- 0.14, 0.20 +/- 0.08, and 0.31 +/- 0.11, respectively), indicating significant potential for their genetic improvement. However, there were weak but undesired phenotypic and genetic correlations between body weight and the three ratios (0.13 < rp < 0.19; 0.23 < rg < 0.50), predicting that selection for rapid growth may slowly lead to the development of a rotund shape. In conclusion, the novel S3 index was suggested as the preferred candidate of shape traits for selective breeding in grass carp, especially because its expected relative genetic gain (4.07% at 10% selection intensity) was higher than those of the others (1.44%-3.99%).

AB  - The diatom Cylindrotheca closterium was exposed to transient light- and osmotic conditions as occur during its tidal emersion. The objective was to analyze how this simulated emersion contributes to the production of active oxygen species (AOS) and via this, to oxidative cell damage. Light- and salinity conditions were varied in factorial combination: low light (no UVB) or high light (unweighted UVB-dose rates of respectively 0.01; 0.07; 0.24; 1.03 W m(-2)) at normal (30 psu) or high salinity (60 psu). UVB (0.010.24 W m(-2)) and high salinity had a significant, negative effect on the photosynthetic efficiencies Gamma Delta F/F-m' (steady-state quantum yield) and F-v/F-m, (maximum yield). UVB at 1.03 W m-2 (15 kJ m(-2) d(-1)) almost arrested electron transport. At ecologically relevant UVB levels, i.e. below 0.24 W m(-2) (approximate to 3.4 kJ m(-2) d(-1)) with UVB:PAR < 0.4:100 (PAR photosynthetically active radiation) only dynamic photoinhibition was observed (protection via heat dissipation). Non-photochemical quenching was positively correlated with the de-epoxidation of diadinoxanthin (DD) to diatoxanthin (DT). A decreasing ratio DT/(DD + DT) after 4 h of UVB at > 0.07 W m(-2) and at 60 psu indicated a reversal of the diatom xanthophyll cycle (diminished photoprotection) which may be caused by an enhanced AOS production. Oxidative stress and -damage to C. closterium cells were assessed applying fluorescent indicator dyes, via confocal microscopy and quantitative image analysis. AOS production rates (cellular DCF fluorescence) were stimulated by UV, and were similar to 50% higher at 60 psu. AOS production decreased with an increasing pre-exposure (0-4 h) to normal UVB (0.24 W m(-2)), which indicated a stimulation of the antioxidative defence. Non-protein thiols (indicator CMF) and glutathione pools (HPLC-analyzed) decreased with UVB-dose rates (0.01-0.24 W m(-2)), most likely due to AOS-mediated thiol oxidation. Hypersalinity (60 psu) and UVB (0.01-0.24 W m(-2)) caused membrane depolarization (dye DIBAC(4)(3)) and phospholipid hydrolysis (phospholipase A(2) dye: bis-BODIPY FL-C-11-PC). AOS production may have diminished the membrane polarity, and peroxidized the membrane lipids (HPLC-analyzed malondialdehyde) which enhanced PLA(2) activity. The dyes indicated an increased oxidative (lipid) damage at a 15% inhibition of photosynthesis in this diatom, at UVB levels and salinities that can be expected in situ during its periodic tidal emersion.

AB  - In the current study, Chryseobacterium cucumeris strain MW-6 isolated from Arabian seawater exhibited broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against indicator bacterial pathogens. The partially extracted antibacterial metabolites with ethyl acetate revealed promising activity against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined against indicator strains that ranged from 65-90 mu g/ml. The genome size of C. cucumeris MW-6 is 4.81 Mbs containing 4227 coding DNA sequences, 74 tRNAs, 3 rRNAs, and 3 ncRNAs genes with 36.90% GC contents. The genome harbors nine putative biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) involved in the biosynthesis of lanthipeptide, NRPS-like, RiPPs-like, terpene, microviridin, T1PKS (hg1E-KS), resorcinol, and siderophore. Additionally, the strain encodes genes for sodium/proton antiporter, glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and cold shock protein to survive under stress conditions such as osmotic, oxidative, and cold shock. These putative BGCs and stress-related genes can be associated with in-vitro antibacterial activities and adaptation of this strain to the marine environment.

AB  - An advanced electroanalytical technique for the simultaneous assessment of environmental contaminant dihydroxybenzene isomers, catechol (CC), hydroquinone (HQ), and resorcinol (RC), has been investigated using palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) incorporated onto a poly(1,5-diaminonaphthalene) (DAN) matrix over a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). Concurrently, these types of phenols can be assessed by the PdDAN/GCE modified electrode employing square wave voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques under optimal conditions. This modified electrode has demonstrated linear responses for CC, HQ, and RC from 50.0 to 1000.0 mM; concomitantly, low detection limits of 0.22, 0.22, and 0.47 nM and low quantification limits of 0.740, 0.758, and 1.590 nM, have been, respectively, shown. Successfully, the simultaneous assessment of the three isomers in river stream water, tap water, and underground water has been implemented via the modified electrode under investigation. In comparison to reported studies, the PdDAN catalytic electrode has shown an effective sensitivity, leverage reproducibility, long-term stability, and excellent anti-interference capability for the determination of dihydroxybenzene isomers.

AB  - This Opinion Paper wishes to provide a summary of recent findings and solutions for a better understanding of the environmental and health problems associated with COVID-19. The list of topics covered is large: meteorology and air quality factors with correlation number of infections, sewage waters as a way to reveal the scale of COVID-19 outbreak, current hospital disinfection procedures and new eco-friendly technologies and list of drug therapies recommend waiting for the desired vaccine to come. During the last two months we did notice an increase in the scientific literature regarding COVID-19 with a partial vision of this problem. The current Opinion Paper is one of the first attempts, to my understanding, to summarize and integrate environmental and human health aspects related to the monitoring, fate and treatment solutions for COVID-19. That being said I believe that this Opinion Paper can serve as multipurpose document, not only for scientists of different disciplines but for social media and citizens in general.

AB  - Nitrate is among the important types of pollutant sources in drinking water worldwide, and there are a number of methods to remove it from water. New treatment methods are being developed as an alternative to traditional treatment methods. One of them is membrane capacitive deionization (MCDI). In this study, the removal of nitrate ions with MCDI system was investigated. Nitrate solutions were treated via MCDI at different operating conditions. The obtained nitrate removal efficiency reached 83.07% at a flow rate of 2.5 L/min and a potential of 0.8 V was applied. In addition, during the nitrate removal of the MCDI system, the environmental effects were evaluated by life cycle analysis. As a result of these analyses, MCDI system offered advantages of low energy demand and low-energy environmental effects during operation. The results showed that the improved MCDI technology holds a great potential to be an energy-efficient process for nitrate removal. Life cycle assessment was applied to the experimental study. According to the assessment, water consumption had the highest effect in all damage assessment categories.

AB  - Biosolids are regarded as a major source of pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in soil and may lead to their accumulation in plants and potential human risks through dietary intake. Using C-14 labeling, we explored the effect of biosolids on the uptake and tissue distribution of carbamazepine (CAB) by three ready-to-eat vegetables (i.e., carrot, celery, and pak choi) under greenhouse conditions. The C-14-CAB was consistently detected in vegetables and plant tissues with bioconcentration factors in a range of 1.28-37.69, and it was easily translocated from root to leaf and/or stem with translocation factors > 1. The inhibition on the uptake and accumulation of C-14-labeled carbamazepine from soil by the addition of biosolids was consistently observed, and such inhibitory effect was related to the biosolid amendment rates, the category of vegetable, and the plant growth stages. The influence of biosolids on behavior of CAB and other emerging pollutants in the soil-plant system should be considered in their environmental risk assessment.

AB  - Thermal maturity of six organic rich samples from Jurassic continental successions cropping out in the Holy Cross Mountains in Central Poland, has been characterized by classic thermal maturity indicators, micro-Raman spectroscopy and Palynomorph Darkness Index, in order to create a multi-method workflow for complex palynofacies thermal maturity assessment. Transmitted light observations on dispersed organic matter define a Hettangian lacustrine depositional environment, characterized by periods of reducing/oxidizing conditions and variable sedimentation rates. Thermal maturity detected by classical maturity indicators and PDI indicates an early maturation stage of hydrocarbon generation and is in agreement with spectroscopic analyses performed on phytoclast groups. Moreover, Raman parameters in the sporomorph group indicate a systematic shift toward a lower degree of aromatization compared to the phytoclast group. Finally, the multivariate statistical analysis performed on Raman spectra is found to be a promising tool to define and predict the heterogeneity of dispersed organic matter in sediments.

AB  - Taking full advantage of available traffic environment information, making control decisions, and then planning trajectory systematically under structured roads conditions is a critical part of intelligent vehicle. In this article, a lane-changing decision-making method for intelligent vehicle is proposed based on acceleration field. Firstly, an acceleration field related to relative velocity and relative distance was built based on the analysis of braking process, and acceleration was taken as an indicator of safety evaluation. Then, a lane-changing decision method was set up with acceleration field while considering driver's habits, traffic efficiency and safety. Furthermore, velocity regulation was also introduced in the lane-changing decision method to make it more flexible. Afterwards, the polynomial trajectory planning method was matched up with this lane-changing decision-making method and simulations based on Matlab/Simulink were finally conducted to verify the method presented in this article. As the simulation results showed, adopting the lane-changing decision-making method based on acceleration field, the lane-changing measurements such as starting position, span and driving speed can be optimized with driver's habits involved. At the same time, the vehicle safety can be well ensured.

AB  - Aim. It is known that free-living ciliates quickly react to the slightest changes in environmental conditions. This feature of physiological reactions on the basis of long-term studies made it possible to use some species of free-living ciliates to indicate the degree of organic pollution. Methods. In the period 2012-2016, with 9 stationary sample points in the Samur-Yalama National Park, with varying degrees of human influence has been collected and processed 870 soil samples. To ciliates study used silver impregnation methods. Analysis of soil ciliates community structure was carried out using conventional environmental options. Rezults. According to our data it has compiled a list of 83 species of ciliates saprobic indicators. Analysis of the results of the occurrence of species, as well as taking into account their quantitative development at various collection points enabled us to get an idea about the state of forest soils different parts of Samur-Yalama National Park, including areas with high human impact. Conclusions. The results showed the possibility and prospects of application saprobiological methods in soil zoology and a clear dependence of species indicators of the degree of influence of anthropogenic factors.

AB  - The article addresses the challenge of combining the very diverse fields of archaeology and fashion. The Museum of Copenhagen has carried out a number of major archaeological excavations that have contributed substantially to the museum's footwear collection, now consisting of approximately 6500 shoes and shoe parts. An ongoing PhD project aims to investigate aspects that affected Copenhageners' footwear in the period 1200-1800 AD, and to explore the relationship between craft and the functional and fashion-related aspects of how footwear developed, was designed and worn. The shoes themselves, written and iconographic sources, natural sciences and experimental collaborations with modern-day shoemakers and foot specialists shed new light on our understanding of footwear history. Footwear was originally invented to protect feet against natural and climatic conditions, but it also became an indicator of how we want to be seen by others-with fashion seemingly being a crucial aspect of how and why footwear developed the way it did. In the analysis of the choice and need dichotomy there are interesting approaches in the theory of human. thing entanglement and engaging archaeologically with the fashion phenomenon that can bring new perspectives on past, present and future.

AB  - Increasing the resilience of ecological and sociological systems has been proposed as an option to adapt to changing future climatic conditions. However, few studies test the applicability of those strategies to forest management. This paper uses a real forest health incident to assess the ability of forest management strategies to affect ecological and economic resilience of the forest. Two landscape scale strategies are compared to business as usual management for their ability to increase resilience to a climate-change induced mountain pine beetle outbreak in the Kamloops Timber Supply Area, British Columbia, Canada for the period 1980 to 2060. Proactive management to reduce high risk species while maintaining or increasing diversity through reforestation was found to be more resilient in terms of the metrics: post-disturbance growing stock, improved volume and stability of timber flow, and net revenue. However, landscape-scale indicators of diversity were little affected by management. Our results were robust to uncertainty in tree growth rates and timber value and show that adapting to climate change through improving the resilience of forested landscapes is an economically viable option.

AB  - A thermal two-dimensional model has been built for an air-breathing proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell that has been reported in the literature. The objective of the study is to investigate the thermal situation over the cathode surface of the fuel cell. The Joule heating was found to be significant and therefore it must be incorporated into the model, especially at high current densities. Such incorporation leads to a more accurate estimation of the heat transfer coefficient, which is a major performance indicator for air-breathing PEM fuel cells. The heat transfer coefficient was found to be less sensitive to the entropic heat of the fuel cell; however, this effect cannot be overlooked, especially at low current densities. Finally, the orientation was shown to have a significant effect on the thermal dissipation from the air-breathing PEM fuel cells: the heat is dissipated far more effectively if the fuel cell is oriented vertically or horizontally facing upwards than if it is oriented horizontally facing downwards.

AB  - Labor division in parental care and reduction of inter-sex competition by division of the foraging niche have been suggested as part of the evolutionary basis for reversed sexual size dimorphism in boobies (Sulidae). To test the potential viability of both hypotheses for the maintenance of dimorphism, we studied parental care and foraging behavior of the Blue-footed Booby (Sula nebouxii) in two colonies in the Gulf of California, Mexico. Proportion of time spent at the nest, feeding frequency, and time devoted to nest defense were used as indicators of parental care. Foraging ecology was evaluated through the number and duration of foraging trips, proportion of time dedicated to flight and to active feeding, rate and depth of diving, and diet. We found some inter-sex differences in foraging only under high demand conditions, such as food shortage or large broods. Inconsistent inter-sex differences seem to be part of a strategy to maximize chick rearing under a variable environmental regime.

AB  - This article examines the advantages of the use of biomarkers as environmental indicators by applying it to Paraiba do Sul watershed, one of the most important Brazilian water bodies, which is in a critical environmental situation. We use a multibiomarker approach in fish as an integrated strategy to assess the impact of pollution. It comprehends a general biomarker of fish health, the condition factor (CF), and specific biomarkers of contaminant exposure such as metallothionein (MT), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and biliary polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) metabolites. Our results revealed different effects in the fish from diverse locations with varying degrees of pollution. Furthermore. fish located just upstream of the water-treatment plant of the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro has shown to be affected by metals. This study indicates the usefulness of integrating a set of biomarkers to define the effects of anthropogenic inputs in aquatic bodies under complex polluted situations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Here we propose a new method for classifying aerial stems of woody plants by developmental stage, using the logarithmic reciprocal of relative growth rate (LRR) as an indicator of developmental stage.
   Stem analyses were conducted on naturally dead aerial stems of Lindera umbellata to clarify the changes in LRR over a lifetime. LRR, number of current-year shoots, and the recruitment and mortality rates of shoots of living stems were investigated.
   LRR was at a minimum value at age 1 yr and at a maximum just before each stem died. There was little difference between the ranges of stem LRR. The recruitment and mortality rates of shoots depended on LRR.
   LRR satisfied the necessary and sufficient condition for a variable as an indicator of stage better than either age or size. The LRR-structured model accurately demonstrates the real demographic processes in shoot populations over a lifetime of aerial stems. This result supports the utility of LRR as an indicator of stage. The method using LRR can be applied to analyses for other growth processes.

TI  - Monitoring of Kilum-Ijim forest bird communities: initial findings
T2  - BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL
LA  - English
AB  - The Kilum-Ijim forest is an excellent example of the ornithological riches of the Cameroon montane forest biome. The forest is also important to over 200,000 people who exert enormous pressure on the ecosystem. In 1995, the Kilum-Ijim Forest Project began systematic monitoring of birds, with the intention of using them as indicators of the overall condition of the forest, as well as monitoring the status of individual species. Analyses of data collected in 1999-2000 demonstrated some clear differences in habitat use, suggesting suites of bird species may be indicators of changes in vegetation. However, beyond this, little is known about the response of birds to habitat modifications, or the relationship between bird abundance and diversity of other organisms at Kilum-Ijim. It is argued that the objective of assessing changes in vegetation could be more satisfactorily pursued through direct measurement of structural changes in habitats. We highlight the necessity for a shift in the programme objectives to place greater emphasis on monitoring endemic and threatened bird species for their own status and on assessing changes in the bird community as a function of changes in the vegetation.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MOLLUSCAN STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - In south-eastern France, Trochoidea geyeri (Soos) today characterizes open upland environments from about 1000 m above sea level. At lower altitude it is replaced by Candidula unifasciata (Poiret)-another member of the Helicellinae-while the other members of the community remain almost the same. During the cold stages of the Quaternary, T. geyeri was also an important element of lowland gastropod communities in Provence, while it was always replaced by C. unifasciata during the interglacial stages. Thus, T. geyeri seems to be a valuable cold indicator species for palaeoclimatic reconstructions.
   Some anomalies in this pattern, however, show that each of these species can live in bioclimatic conditions which characterize the area of the other. This suggests a competitive dominance phenomenon from a threshold situated around 1000 m on the altitudinal gradient. The influence of competitive interaction is demonstrated using similar altitudinal gradients in which T. geyeri is missing because of historical factors: in such cases, C. unifasciata occupies the entire gradient, up to 2250 m. Quaternary climatic changes produced altitudinal shifts of the contact zone between T. geyeri and C. unifasciata, and, correlatively, repeated isolations of T. geyeri populations.

AB  - A piece of Kaidun III (EH5) meteorite has been studied by optic and scanning electron microscopy and microprobe analysis.The matter of apical part of the piece was shown to undergo a heavy alteration by hot fluids together with intensive migration of all the main components. Fluids formation is associated with the last accumulation shock event in the history of meteorite's parent body. Parameters of the fluids were changed with time from weakly acidic (pH<6.5) at the starting stages to alkaline (pH approximately 10). Temperature of the fluids was changed over a wide range and was higher than that of CM-hondrites alteration process. Metallic iron transforms to PSP by the action of fluids, whereas schreibersite transforms to a mixture of Ni disulfide (vaesite or vialorite) and Fe oxides (probably magnetite). Nonequilibrium conditions and unfinished state are the peculiar features of hydrothermal alteration process of Kaidun III ore phases. This fact together with relatively high temperature of fluids may be indicative of local nature of heating during shock event and of moderate power of the last accumulation event in the history of the Kaidun parent body.

AB  - The paper makes a modest attempt to provide some empirical evidence on innovation and technological change in Austria, based on a larger research project funded by the Jubilaumsfonds provided by the Austrian National Bank.  The data were obtained through interview surveys of senior executives of manufacturing establishments and enterprises in the Austrian metalworking and machinery, electrotechnical and electronic products, textiles and clothing industries.  Due to time and resource constraints, the interviews were limited to four Austrian regions only:  the core metropolitan area of Vienna, its immediate hinterland, a traditional iron-based industrial region (Upper Styria) and a peripheral region (Wald/Weinviertel) which represent a variety of historic and current economic trends and conditions within the Austrian economy.  185 interviews were conducted between November 1987 and February 1988 with senior industrialists who were manufacturing in the selected regions.
   The paper considers innovation activities in general, and Research and Development (R&D) activities, product and process innovations in particular, and relies on a system of input, throughput and output indicators to measure the complex and multivariate nature of the innovation process.  Special emphasis is laid upon regional, sectoral, size and organisational status specific differences in innovation behaviour.

AB  - The decline of relative chlorophyll contents during fruit ripening is considered to be an important indicator of fruit physiological condition. The recent availability of low-cost portable visible spectrum (VIS) spectrometers has spurred research interest towards optical sensing of chlorophyll changes in intact fruit, with many scientists attempting to link the shifts in optical signals, attributed to chlorophyll changes, to different maturity and quality parameters. One of the widely available portable devices for non-destructive estimation of relative chlorophyll contents is the DA meter, which provides a maturity index that is calculated as a difference between absorption at 670 nm (near the chlorophyll-a absorption peak) and 720 nm (background of the spectrum), abbreviated as IAD. In the present study, the evolution of IAD and its relation to starch pattern index (SPI) and fruit flesh firmness (FFF) was monitored in fruit of two cv. 'Gala' clones during maturation and storage, aiming to identify a potential existence of a usable IAD range for the assessment and prediction of the optimal harvest window and storage potential. In both clones, canopy positions, fruit sides, and seasons IAD, SPI, and FFF generally changed in a linear fashion over time, but with partially very different slopes, i.e., they were changing at different rates. What all of these parameters had in common was the presence of a very high biological variability, which is typical of apple fruit. Significantly powerful estimations of SPI (r(2) > 0.7, p < 0.005) and pre- and post-storage FFF (r(2) > 0.6, p < 0.005) were achieved. However, the very large biological variability could not be neutralized, which means that the predictions always included large confidence intervals of up to 0.46-0.59 units for SPI and 0.82-1.1 kgF FFF, which ultimately makes them unusable for practical applications. Experiments done under real-life conditions in a commercial fruit storage facility on several different fruit batches confirmed that IAD measured at harvest cannot be used indiscriminately for predicting post-storage FFF of cv. 'Gala' originating from different orchards. Nevertheless, mean IAD values that were obtained at optimal maturity from samples of the same orchards remained stable over seasons (0.8-1.2), which strongly suggests that, provided that the calibrations and validations are not only cultivar, but also orchard-specific, IAD has a potential for estimating maturity and storability of apple fruit. In this case, IAD could replace standard maturity indices, otherwise it would be suited for use as a supplementary index for determining fruits physiological maturity status.

AB  - Research Highlights: In this study, we found different regulatory mechanisms in two contrasting provenances of Norway spruce responding to progressive drought stress. Background and Objectives: In the context of climate and environmental changes, the following question of high importance in scientific studies is: How will Norway spruce, which forms a dominant component in European mountain and boreal forests, be able to cope with the increasing frequencies and intensities of drought periods? The aim of the study was to investigate the physiological responses of eight-month-old seedlings, as a most vulnerable phase of forest tree life, for different spruce provenances, to find out variable strategies in relation to controlled drought stress. Materials and Methods: We performed an experiment under controlled conditions with spruce seedlings from a climatologically warmer stand of 410 m above sea level (a.s.l.), and a moderately cool stand of 931 m a.s.l. The soil water content, leaf predawn water potential, the osmotic potential of needles, the relative water content of needles, and the photosynthetic performance and the contents of primary metabolites (proline and abscisic acid) were investigated as indicators of the spruce seedlings' responses to water stress. The status of the indicators was analyzed at different temporal intervals, using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), reflecting the seedlings' water conditions (early drought, drought, or recovery). On a daily basis, the differences among the indicators were tested with one-way ANOVA. A principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify the provenance-specific responses of tree drought indicators in a multi-dimensional data set. Results: The responses to drought stress differed between the provenances. Whereas seedlings of 'warm' provenance from a low altitude performed a conservation strategy, with high amounts of accumulated abscisic acid and closing the stomata faster, the reactions of 'cool' provenance seedlings from a higher altitude were not so sensitive and the plants' water supply and photosynthetic performance remained significantly higher. These findings indicate that a higher drought resistance in 'cool' provenance could be related to greater amounts of proline amino-acids, which are accumulated from the beginning of the drought simulation. Furthermore, proline accumulation resulting in increased stress tolerance is controlled through another mechanism than osmotic adjustment. Conclusions: The observed variations in the regulatory mechanisms used to develop adaptive strategies in different provenances are an important factor for seedling survival under a changing climate.

AB  - This study reports the results of the first investigation on the use of Qualitative Behaviour Assessment (QBA) in dairy goats, using a fixed-list of descriptors specifically developed for this species. It aimed to verify whether QBA can be reliably used by observers with different backgrounds to differentiate between the emotional states of goats kept under different environmental conditions. Two trained observers simultaneously assessed 16 dairy goat farms (8 "Housed" (H) farms, where animals were observed in free stall pens, and 8 "Pasture" (P) farms, where animals were observed in open ranges), using a list of 16 QBA descriptors that were based on literature studies and discussed within a focus group of goat experts. One H farm was removed from analysis due to procedural error. The QBA scores were analysed together using Principal Component Analysis (PCA, correlation matrix, no rotation). Observer agreement for farm scores on PCA Components (PCs) and on separate QBA terms was investigated using Pearson and Spearman correlations respectively. The effects of housing system and observer on PC scores were analysed using analysis of variance (treatments=observer, housing system, and their interaction; block=farm). PCA identified three main components explaining 60.87% of the total variation between goat farms: PC1 (29.04%) ranged from "content/calm" to "frustrated/aggressive", suggesting a relationship to the animals' general mood; PC2 (19.70%) ranged from "curious/attentive" to "calm/bored", suggesting a relationship to the animals' level of arousal, and PC3 (12.13%) ranged from "sociable/playful" to "alert/agitated". The two observers showed a good level of agreement on the three PCA dimensions (PC1: r = 0.75, P=0.001; PC2: r = 0.67, P=0.006; PC3: r = 0.69, P=0.004), and also on 7 out of 16 separate QBA descriptors (P < 0.05). Two additional descriptors showed a moderate level of agreement (P=0.10). These results indicate an integrated PCA approach to QBA to be more robust. There were significant effects of housing system on both PCI (ANOVA; P=0.05) and PC2 (P=0.02), indicating goats on P farms to be more "content/calm" and "curious/attentive" than goats on H farms. There was a significant observer effect on PC2 (P=0.04), and a significant observer by housing interaction on PC3 (P=0.009). In sum, these results suggest that QBA can be a reliable welfare indicator, used by observers with different backgrounds; however, further development of QBA training procedures is required to extend inter-observer reliability to all main expressive dimensions emerging from the analysis.

AB  - Lignites and fossil wood from two boreholes in the late Miocene Hausruck district (Alpine Foreland Basin, Austria) were investigated with respect to organic carbon and total sulfur contents, ash yields, maceral composition, organic geochemistry, and stable carbon isotope ratios.
   The lignites from the two sampled profiles differ in sulfur contents and petrography-based facies indicators (gelification index [GI], tissue preservation index [TPI]). The results point to drier and more acidic conditions in the part of the mire sampled at drill site Lukasberg, whereas the lignites from Kalletsberg formed under near neutral conditions due to a raised (ground) water table. The different depositional environments are supported by the paleogeographic positions of the boreholes: borehole Lukasberg is located within a paleo-valley, whereas borehole Kalletsberg is located at the deeper part of a basin situated south and southwest of the Hausruck area.
   Environmental changes with time within the mire are confirmed by the molecular composition of the soluble organic matter (SOM). Differences in pristane/phytane ratio, isomerisation of hopanes at position 17, concentrations of hopanes, and in the ratio of hopanes to hop-17(21)-enes are related to the extent of gelification of plant tissue, sulfur content and pH values, caused by differences in (ground) water table. The variable contents of individual terpenoid hydrocarbons derived from land plants indicate that angiosperms and conifers contribute to peat formation in the Hausruck district in variable proportions. Overall, angiosperm biomarkers slightly predominate. The tissue preservation index (TPI) within the Kalletsberg profile is probably governed by the proportion of decay-resistant conifers, as indicated by the correlation between TPI and biomarker composition of the coals.
   Correlations between delta(13)C values of the lignites (between - 24.9parts per thousand and - 27.4) and their non-hopanoid terpenoid composition indicate the major influence of changes in peat-forming vegetation on the carbon isotopic composition of the coals in the Hausruck district. Carbon isotope data of macrofossils are consistent with their taxonomical classification as conifers (delta(13)C between - 22.7parts per thousand and - 25.1parts per thousand) and angiosperms (delta(13)C between - 25.5parts per thousand and - 26.6parts per thousand), respectively. The delta(13)C data of the extracted cellulose reveal clear differences between fossil wood from gymnosperms (average delta(13)C= -21.0parts per thousand) and angiosperms (mean delta(13)C= -23.4parts per thousand).

AB  - In risk-based meat safety assurance system, the use of interventions is intended to accomplish the meat safety targets on chilled carcasses, particularly in situations when an abattoir is unable to sufficiently reduce risks arising from specific farms/animal batches by using process hygiene alone. Furthermore, interventions are considered whenever food safety authorities identify meat production processes associated with high risks for consumers. This paper overviews the role of beef interventions in a risk-based, meat safety assurance system. Cattle hide interventions (chemical hide washes and microbial immobilisation treatment with shellac) and beef carcass interventions (pasteurisation treatments with hot water and/or steam and organic (lactic) acid washes), show consistent reduction effects of aerobic bacteria and faecal indicators and reduced prevalences of naturally present VTEC and Salmonella. The review also identified interventions where there was a lack of data and further research was needed, and other contextual factors to inform the risk management decisions for further development of risk-based meat safety assurance system.

AB  - A rapid, sensitive and selective analytical method was validated for the determination of chlorantraniliprole residue in okra and soil using single quadrupole gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The analytical method showed good linearity in selected matrices and the limit of quantification was 0.01 mg/kg. Recoveries were ranged from 94.19-97.82% with the relative standard deviation (RSD) of 0.74-3.93%. Under the optimised parameters, the developed method was applied to analyse the dissipation kinetics of chlorantraniliprole residue from field samples. Field results showed that half-lives of chlorantraniliprole in okra and soil were 2.21 and 2.16 days, respectively and a harvest withholding period of one day suggested for safe consumption. The residue concentrations were reduced from okra fruit using simple decontamination processes and could remove residues in the range of 11-61%. The dietary risk assessment of chlorantraniliprole on okra was negligible depending on the RQ value of less than one and the ecological risk assessment was found to be less than one (RQ < 0.1) for earthworms and arthropods.

AB  - The frequency and duration of heatwaves are steadily increasing as climate change becomes more serious. These changes particularly endanger the health of those who must work outdoors in hot environments. This study introduces a novel approach to monitor the heat-health of airport outdoor workers using infrared thermography. The faces of airport workers who were refueling airplanes in extreme heat conditions were monitored using a thermal infrared thermometer during their work cycle throughout the day. Changes in temperature on their exposed faces (e.g., the ear, cheek, chin) were monitored throughout the day over a two-month period. In every test, the subject's face temperature increased, then suddenly dropped for a short time, and then continued increasing. Subjects were also asked to assess their thermal perception of the work each time they were tested throughout the study. They reported that they felt discomfort in terms of thermal comfort when the facial skin temperature went down temporarily before the temperature rose. These results show that the physical measurement criteria when outdoor workers' thermal health is in jeopardy can be based on the results of facial skin temperature measurements.

AB  - The assimilation of technologies and their adaptation to the territories, taking advantage of the scientific potential and resources available for the development of high value-added products that contribute to the substitution of imports, were the fundamental premises on which the insertion of the production processes of native and modified starches and other products based on Manihot esculenta Crantz (cassava) that were developed in this research is based. The technological impacts generated by the effective combination of process development and technological assimilation, applicable as a procedure to the agro-industry in general and validated for the processing technologies of the cassava assortments, were analyzed. The technical-economic feasibility studies were carried out, determining the necessary conditions for the achievement of positive profitability indicators. It was demonstrated the advantage that these products represent for the substitution of imported additives in the food industry, the possibility of the immediate introduction of the results in the productive processes and the environmental compatibility. The study is relevant to address the issue of substitution of stabilizing additives in food production.

AB  - The present days can be considered a crossroad in the history of our world because the economic, social, and environmental needs do not agree one another. The result is the present socio-economic difficulties, from which it seems very difficult to escape. A new viewpoint must be introduced, but it cannot be based on the usual economic indicators. So, a new viewpoint and a new related approach are required. In this paper we suggest three new indicators based on an engineering approach of irreversibility. They allow us to evaluate both the technological level and the environmental impact of the production processes and the socio-economic conditions of the countries. Indeed, they are based on the exergy analysis and on the irreversible thermodynamic approach, in order to evaluate the inefficiency both of the process and of the production systems, and the related consequences. Three applications are summarized in order to highlight the possible interest from different scientists and researchers in engineering, economy, etc, in order to develop sustainable approaches and policies for decision makers.

AB  - This paper investigates the impact of energy policy and the regulatory environment on the deployment of technologies based on renewable energy sources in Germany and presents a model to forecast future renewable energy technology diffusion. Our concept is based on the development of a composite indicator for renewable energy diffusion with a focus on wind energy (onshore) and photovoltaic. The approach has three major components: in-depth, semi-structured interviews with renewable energy developers and energy sector stakeholders to identify the major drivers and barriers (determinants) for renewable energy diffusion in the case study country; an EU-wide, questionnaire-based survey to understand the relevance (weights) of the individual determinants; and an analysis of past renewable energy diffusion patterns resulting in the deduction of a model for short-term renewable energy technology diffusion forecasts. Results demonstrate the substantial impact of economic and non-economic framework conditions on the diffusion of photovoltaic and wind energy in Germany. Furthermore, the use of composite indicators for renewable energy technology diffusion analyses proves to be a promising approach.

AB  - The aim of this research is to assess the sustainability of the Estonian housing market, which is characterized as owner-occupied, in comparison with other EU countries in the light of different socio-economic indicators. For this purpose a method of Multiple Criteria Complex Proportional Evaluation (COPRAS) was used. In order to perform integrated analysis of housing market sustainability the Decision Support System for Housing Sustainability Assessment (DSS-HS) was developed. This system enables the performance of multiple criteria assessment of housing market sustainability in selected countries according to six criteria groups (general economic, housing stock, housing affordability, population and social conditions, housing quality and environmental quality). The analysis of ranking and assessment results allows recommendations to be made for improving the indicators in order to increase housing market sustainability. A case study presents a practical application of the proposed methodology. It introduces the DSS-HS system, calculation results, conclusions and recommendations based on an assessment of Estonian housing market sustainability in comparison to other selected countries.

TI  - Predicting salinity in tomato using soil reflectance spectra
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
LA  - English
AB  - Soil salinity is one of the most common soil degradation processes, found particularly in both arid and semi-arid areas. Salt (Cl)- and sodium (Na)-affected soils impact vegetation and plant communities. Under these conditions, soil salinity can serve as an indicator of vegetation salinity. In this study, we explored whether spectroscopy could quantitatively assess foliar Cl and Na concentration as indicators to assess salinity in tomato plants. Reflectance spectra of soil samples were obtained in the 400-2500 nm region using a hyperspectral radiometer. The relationship between the Na and Cl contents of tomato plants growing in various saline environments and soil spectral reflectance was determined using partial least squares regression. The Cl-content model was more accurate for determining leaf salinity (R-2 = 0.92, root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) = 0.2%) than the Na-content model (R-2 = 0.87, RMSEP = 0.6%). We conclude that reflectance spectroscopy is potentially useful for characterizing the key properties of salinity in growing vegetation and assessing its salt quality. The results of this study can serve as a starting point in precision agriculture for salinity measurements in tomato fields and could be further upgraded for use by airborne/satellite remote-sensing modes.

AB  - This paper describes a fossil record from northeastern Poland of Sphagnum obtusum Warnst., a plant that has rarely been found in Holocene sediments. This species occurred circa 1710-1570 cal. BP on Mechacz Wielki peatland and was present in the transitional phase between a fen that developed on lake sediments and a bog. Sphagnum obtusum was a dominant species and was accompanied by such vascular plants such as Scheuchzeria palustris, Carex rostrata, Comarum palustre and Oxycoccus palustris. Using testate amoebae, we reconstructed the past habitat (water table and pH), with S. obtusum occurring in a moderately wet habitat (mean depth to the water table or DWT = 9.5, SD = 0.5) and under slightly acid conditions (mean pH = 5, SD = 0.1). A clear correlation was found between the distributions of the subfossil S. obtusum and those of the indicator testate amoebae Hyalosphenia papilio and Cyclopyxis arcelloides. The disappearance of S. obtusum is assumed to have been caused by a trophic shift and succession of a more acidophilic species, Sphagnum angustifolium.

AB  - Viral gastroenteritis and other waterborne diseases are a major concern for health in Brazil. Anumber of studies were conducted about the presence of viruses on water samples from Brazilian areas. However, the knowledge about the occurrence of viral contamination of drinking water sources in rural settings of the country is insufficient. On the present work, 15 samples from 5 dairy farms located at the municipality of Tenente Portela were collected and analysed for the presence of human adenoviruses (HAdV), as well as human enteroviruses (EV) and rotaviruses (RV). HAdV was present on 66.66% of the water samples, and have been found in all samples from artesian wells and springs, which are used as sources of drinking water for the individuals inhabiting those farms. EV and RV found only in one sample each. The detection rates of HAdV on the water from these dairy farms are alarming and point towards a situation of elevated environmental contamination by fecal microorganisms of human origin and poor basic sanitation conditions.

AB  - Plasma hydroperoxides (HPs) are widely accepted to be good indicators of oxidative stress. By means of the method proposed here, which uses diphenyl-1-pyrenylphosphine (DPPP) as a fluorescent probe, all types of plasma HP were determined. The limits of detection and quantification of the method were 0.08 and 0.25 nmol of cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) equivalents in 40 mu l of plasma, respectively. The method is satisfactory in terms of precision (5.2% for 14.5 mu M CHP eq., n = 8), and the recoveries were 91% and 92% after standard additions of 26 and 52 mu M CHP, respectively. The selectivity of the proposed method is higher than 96%. Moreover, optimization of the reaction conditions and the addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) disodium salt and 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT) prevented the formation of HP artifacts during the analysis. Therefore, the proposed method is useful for simple and quantitative determination of total plasma HPs. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study evaluated stress indicators in pacu exposed to ammonia in water under the following conditions: without NH4Cl (0.00 g/L); with 0.0078 g NH4Cl/L; and with 0.078 g NH4Cl/L (pH 8.3 and 27 degrees C). After the salt dilution the water flow was interrupted and reestablished in 24 hours. Sampling occurred prior to the addition of NH4Cl (control) and after 12, 24 and 48 hours. Glycaemia increased only in fish with the highest salt concentration when compared with group control, regardless of time, and at 24 hours, regardless of treatment. Plasma ammonia, highest in fish exposed to the highest NH4Cl concentration, decreased progressively up to 48 hours. Plasma chloride only decreased in fish not exposed to salt when compared with control and osmolality increased after 24 hours. Hematocrit (Ht), number and volume of erythrocytes and hemoglobin did not change when NH4Cl was added; Ht decrease was reported after 12 hours, but it was not followed by the other blood parameters. The results show tolerance of the pacu to ammonia in the environment.

AB  - Proton transfer reaction-time of flight (PTR-TOF) mass spectrometry was used to improve detection of biogenic volatiles organic compounds (BVOCs) induced by leaf wounding and darkening. PTR-TOF measurements unambiguously captured the kinetic of the large emissions of green leaf volatiles (GLVs) and acetaldehyde after wounding and darkening. GLVs emission correlated with the extent of wounding, thus confirming to be an excellent indicator of mechanical damage. Transient emissions of methanol, C5 compounds and isoprene from plant species that do not emit isoprene constitutively were also detected after wounding. In the strong isoprene-emitter Populus alba, light-dependent isoprene emission was sustained and even enhanced for hours after photosynthesis inhibition due to leaf cutting. Thus isoprene emission can uncouple from photosynthesis and may occur even after cutting leaves or branches, e. g., by agricultural practices or because of abiotic and biotic stresses. This observation may have important implications for assessments of isoprene sources and budget in the atmosphere, and consequences for tropospheric chemistry.

AB  - Spatial and temporal variability in zooplankton was studied at eight stations located in the Lesina Lagoon (South Adriatic Sea) Salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a (in the lagoon) at these stations were also assessed. The zooplankton community was characterised by clear seasonal oscillations and mostly represented by copepods and their larvae. The dominant copepod species were Calanipeda aquaedulcis and Acartia tonsa, which exhibited spatial-temporal segregation in the lagoon. C. aquaedulcis copepodites seemed to be better adapted to oligotrophic and oligohaline conditions compared with the A. tonsa population. The invasive species A. tonsa has completely replaced the formerly abundant Acartia margalefi. A positive correlation was found between abundances, total species numbers and trophic state. An increasing abundance trend was shown from the lagoon towards the sea. The highest diversity indices were recorded at the two channel inlets, during high tide due to the absence of a clear dominance of one or more coastal species and the co-occurrence of species of lagoon and marine origin.

AB  - Torrecilla Lagoon, part of the San Juan Bay Estuary system, is a moderately-polluted estuary on the northern coast of Puerto Rico. Foraminiferal assemblages from two 30 cm cores were dominated by Ammonia spp. and Quinqueloculina rhodiensis. The latter taxon exhibits a relatively high occurrence of deformed tests (up to 18%). Analyses for potentially toxic-element in bulk sediment samples of one core show concentrations below recognized toxicity levels except for copper. Copper concentrations (50-138 ppm) fall between previously established Effect Range Low and Effect Range Median values, representing potential for occasional detrimental effects to the aquatic environment. Organic matter content (loss-on-ignition) ranging from 10-23%, coupled with the presence of framboidal pyrite, indicate low oxygen conditions. Ammonia spp. showed no significant variation in size with depth in core. Ammonia-Elphidium index values, a previously established indicator of hypoxia, are 69-100, reflecting relative few Elphidium. Species diversity indices indicate temporal variability in abundance and distribution of foraminifers. Foraminiferal assemblages and organic matter in sediments indicate that Torrecilla Lagoon has undergone episodes of hypoxia.

AB  - The dramatic decline in Arctic summer sea-ice cover is a compelling indicator of change in the global climate system and has been attributed to a combination of natural and anthropogenic effects. Through its role in regulating the exchange of energy between the ocean and atmosphere, ice loss is anticipated to influence atmospheric circulation and weather patterns. By combining satellite measurements of sea-ice extent and conventional atmospheric observations, we find that varying summer ice conditions are associated with large-scale atmospheric features during the following autumn and winter well beyond the Arctic's boundary. Mechanisms by which the atmosphere "remembers'' a reduction in summer ice cover include warming and destabilization of the lower troposphere, increased cloudiness, and slackening of the poleward thickness gradient that weakens the polar jet stream. This iceatmosphere relationship suggests a potential long-range outlook for weather patterns in the northern hemisphere. Citation: Francis, J. A., W. Chan, D. J. Leathers, J. R. Miller, and D. E.

AB  - The investigations presented in this paper focus on studying the influence of excess soil copper levels in young tomato plants and their relationship to bacterial spot severity caused by Xanthomonas vesicatoria race T3. The plants were grown under greenhouse conditions in pots containing soil artificially contaminated with copper in concentrations of 250 and 400 mg kg(-1). Both stress factors were applied individually and in combination. Soil copper levels did influence bacterial spot severity. The copper doses applied restricted bacterial spot growth. Strongest responses were observed when the pathogen was infiltrated into seeds. Deformations of plant, as well as increased plastid synthesis inhibition occurred when the plants were exposed to copper and X. vesicatoria. The applicability of the investigation is related to the fight against bacterial spot caused by X. vesicatoria in tomatoes grown on copper-polluted soils. In this case, the remedial action should be carried out very carefully in order to avoid additional damage to plants.

AB  - Twenty samples of traditional fermented milk "Raib" were collected in eastern Algeria from individual household. They were evaluated for the presence of autochthonous bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria. From 13 of these samples 52 strains of lactic acid bacteria were isolated, and shown to exhibit inhibitory activity against the indicator strain Listeria monocytogenes. Five of these inhibitor-producing isolates were selected for further study on the basis of their relatively wide antimicrobial spectrum. The inhibitory spectra of activity of the selected strains were evaluated against a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative test organisms. Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus were the most sensitive indicator tested. All the antimicrobial compounds produced by the selected lactic acid bacteria were fully or partially inactivated by some of the proteolytic enzymes, but were unaffected by catalase which indicates their proteinaceous nature. The compounds were heat stable up to 120 degrees C for 20 min, and were active from pH 3.0 to 10.0. Highest bacteriocin activity was recorded under acidic conditions and activity decreased with increasing alkalinity.

AB  - Dinoflagellate cysts were studied in 42 samples from the surface sediments of the White Sea. The total concentration of dinocysts varies from single cysts to 25000 cyst/g of dry sediments, which reflects the biological productivity in the White Sea waters and the regional particular features of the sedimentation processes. The highest concentrations are observed in silts; they are related to the regions of propagation of the highly productive Barents Sea waters in the White Sea. Generally, the spatial distribution of dinocysts species in the surface sediments corresponds to the distribution of the major types of water masses in the White Sea. The cysts of the relatively warm-water species (Operculodinium centrocarpum, Spiniferites sp.) of North Atlantic origin that dominate in the sediments indicate an intensive intrusion of the Barents Sea water masses to the White Sea along with hydrological dwelling conditions in the White Sea favorable for the development of these species during their vegetation period. The cold-water dinocyst assemblage (Islandinium minutum, Polykrikos sp.) is rather strictly confined to the inner parts of shallow-water bays, firstly, those adjacent to the Onega and Severnaya Dvina river mouths.

AB  - This study presents quantitative, sociological models designed to account for cross-national variation in child mortality. We consider variables linked to five different theoretical perspectives that include the economic modernization, social modernization, political modernization, ecological-evolutionary, and dependency perspectives. The study is based on a cross-lagged effects regression analysis of a sample of 59 developing countries. Our preliminary analysis based on additive models replicates prior studies to the extent that we find that indicators linked to economic and social modernization have beneficial effects on child mortality. We also find support for hypotheses derived from the dependency perspective suggesting that multinational corporate penetration fosters higher levels of child mortality. Subsequent analysis incorporating interaction effects suggest that the level of political democracy conditions the effects of dependency relationships based upon multinational corporations. Transnational economic linkages associated with multinational corporations adversely affect child mortality more strongly at lower levels of democracy than at higher levels of democracy-that is intranational, political factors interact with the international, economic forces to affect child mortality. We conclude with some brief policy recommendations and suggestions for the direction of future research.

AB  - A simplified model system containing amorphous glucose and glycine was analyzed in a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) under airflow, nitrogen flow and in hermetically-sealed steel pans in order to study the effects of environmental conditions on its thermal behavior. DSC under nitrogen flow in open pans was chosen to analyze the enthalpy changes during the development of Maillard reaction in glucose-glycine model systems heated at 90C.
   While heating the glucose-glycine model system in the DSC open pans under dynamic nitrogen flow, the Maillard reaction was revealed by an endothermal enthalpy change (peak 1) occurring from 100C to 150C, followed, on further heating, by a second endothermal peak (peak 2) from 200C to 260C. DSC traces of samples previously heated for up to 24 h showed a third endothermal peak (peak 3) in the temperature range from 90C to 170C which was gradually detected while peak 2 tended to disappear.
   Results indicated that DSC performed under nitrogen flow in open pans allows the thermal behavior of a model system undergoing the Maillard reaction to be followed in real time and to differentiate between reaction phases.

AB  - Being small, mosses constituting part of the ground-cover vegetation in forests have difficulty at most sites in asserting themselves oner vascular plants. The exception is formed by highly acidic soils, on which they often assume a dominant status. The question of what significance is due in forest site mapping to the moss species occuring at acidic locations Tvas investigated by comparing the ecological behaviour of 24 macroscopically identifiable species, taking soil moisture and soil acivity as site factors.
   Only few mosses are confined strictly to dry soils. Often it is only those species with a preference for this condition yet with a relatively broad amplitude in terms of the moisture factor which are found at dry locations. Moss vegetation responds very sensitively to increasing ground moisture. There are, for example, several widespread species which permit a location to be classified very accurately as moist or wet. These are of outstanding value to site mapping, as moisture indicators among vascular plants are often absent from highly acidic soils.
   Most of the species of moss investigated are reliable indicators of acidity. Some of them, however, display a relatively broad amplitude in the:rr reaction to the soil.

AB  - Optimal yield and quality of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) depend to a large extent on the rate of nitrogen (N) fertilizer application, which may often be inadequate. Uptake and utilization of N by wheat plants are influenced by environment and variety, and consequently supplementary N may be needed during the growing season according to variations in these factors. Additional N can be applied at specific stages of plant development (phenology) for maximum effect. However, timing supplemental N application according to growth stage scales may not result in maximum yield as the scales do not provide sufficiently precise indication of spikelet and floret formation, which critically affect the sink capacity of the plant. In this review it is proposed that knowledge of apical development offers a means to identify the initiation and formation of those plant organs that are indicators of specific stages of plant development. Aspects of the general usage of apical development stages in timing N, and how they vary according to growing conditions, are discussed.

AB  - This paper shows signal processing techniques applied to experimental data obtained from a T100 microturbine connected with different volume sizes. This experimental activity was conducted by means of the test rig developed at the University of Genoa for hybrid systems emulation. However, these results can be extended to all advanced cycles in which a microturbine is connected with additional external components which lead to an increase of the plant volume size. Since in this case a 100 kW microturbine was used, the volume was located between the heat recovery unit outlet and the combustor inlet like in the typical cases related to small size plants. A modular vessel was used to perform and to compare the tests with different volume sizes. The main results reported in this paper are related to rotating stall and surge operations. This analysis was carried out to extend the knowledge about these risk conditions: the systems equipped with large volume size connected to the machine present critical issues related to surge and stall prevention, especially during transient operations toward low mass flowrate working conditions. Investigations conducted on acoustic and vibrational measurements can provide interesting diagnostic and predictive solutions by means of suitable instability quantifiers which are extracted from microphone and accelerometer data signals. Hence, different possible tools for rotating stall and incipient surge identification were developed through the use of different signal processing techniques, such as wavelet analysis and higher order statistics analysis (HOSA) methods. Indeed, these advanced techniques are necessary to maximize all the information conveyed by acquired signals, particularly in those environments in which measured physical quantities are hidden by strong noise, including both broadband background one (i.e., typical random noise) but also uninteresting components associated with the signal of interest. For instance, in complex coupled physical systems like the one it is meant to be studied, which do not satisfy the hypothesis of linear and Gaussian processes inside them, it is reasonable to exploit these kinds of tools, instead of the classical fast Fourier transform (FFT) technique by itself, which is mainly adapt for linear systems periodic analysis. The proposed techniques led to the definition of a quantitative indicator, the sum of all autobispectrum components modulus in the subsynchronous range, which was proven to be reliable in predicting unstable operation. This can be used as an input for diagnostic systems for early surge detection. Furthermore, the presented methods will allow the definition of some new features complementary with the ones obtainable from conventional techniques, in order to improve control systems reliability and to avoid false positives.

AB  - Romania is in a rather dishonorable position from the financial literacy perspective in the European Union, ranking last among countries. To increase the level of financial education of the Romanian population, public and private institutions, organizations, and companies have recently taken the initiative in this field, mostly after 2015. Our contribution builds on these recent developments and aims at testing the level of basic financial literacy of Romanian university students, enrolled in business and economics studies, using the OECD Financial literacy test. Data was collected through an online survey on a voluntary basis, and the responses were analyzed using statistical indicators. Results indicate a rather high level of financial literacy among students, but also significant differences among respondents that may be explained by several demographic characteristics and specific attributes. The most important characteristics that influence the degree of financial literacy of students are age, students' cycle of studies, the way the students live, property ownership and students' involvement in financial market transactions and contracts. We stress towards the need to act through concrete measures to improve young people financial literacy, as a necessary condition to navigate in an increasingly complex environment, where finance plays an essential role.

AB  - Urban forests are important hotspots of biodiversity in the environment of cities and their surroundings but may also stand out from neighbouring forests by greater tree species diversity, higher tree age and greater share of deciduous species. However, they are usually not connected with nesting of rare birds of prey, especially dietary specialists. Unexpectedly, I have found Honey Buzzard Pernis apivorus nesting in such a forest in a 300,000 -inhabitant city in North-Eastern Poland. The male of this pair was caught and fitted with a global positioning system logger. Using a tree cover density raster, I show that both for nesting and foraging, Honey Buzzards preferred dense canopies. Even with anthropogenic disturbance, the urban forest still offered the best conditions (greatest tree cover) for this specialist species in a 10 km radius. This finding shows that the advantages of some features of urban forests (deciduous character, dense canopy) can overcome disadvantages of the urban environment even for rare, large raptors. Also tree cover density seems a promising indicator of biodiversity in urban forests and should be tested in larger studies.

AB  - A chalcone, which is composed of two aromatic rings bridged by an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group, exhibits a variety of biological activities. With an objective to develop a novel chalcone-based functional dye, we have synthesized a chalcone diol CLN1, bearing two OH groups at the 2-positions on both phenyl rings, as well as reference compounds CLN2-6, and found that it serves as color indicators for pH and fluoride ions. CLN1showed a vivid color change from colorless to yellow (halochromism) in water at pH >= 10. Furthermore, it presented a selective color change from colorless to red upon the addition of TBAF in an organic solvent such as CH3CN. CLN1provided a strong red-shifted absorption band in the visible region under alkaline conditions in water and upon the addition of TBAF in CH3CN. The absorption spectral study together with TD-DFT calculations and X-ray crystallographic analysis revealed that the characteristic pi-resonant structures of CLN1caused by the ionization or OH-F(-)interactions and the planar conformation due to its intramolecular hydrogen bonding may provide a strong charge transfer (CT) absorption in the visible region.

AB  - The paleoenvironment conditions that existed in the Late Pleistocene at the archaeological-paleontological site of El Arenoso, Sonora, NW Mexico, were inferred using the carbon and oxygen stable isotopes from one bison, one mammoth, and thirteen horses as well as the pedological characteristics and the carbon isotopes of calcium carbonates from paleosoil. The values delta C-13 of the bison (-1.4 parts per thousand), the horses (-2.8 parts per thousand), and the mammoth (-4.3 parts per thousand) show that these animals fed mainly on C, plants and carbon isotopic values from profile horizons of locality 4Bgk (-3.4 parts per thousand), 3Ck (-3.4 parts per thousand), and 2Bgk2 (-5.7 parts per thousand) indicated the presence of C-3/C-4 vegetation mixed in El Arenoso. The oxygen isotopic ratios of the bison (-4.3 parts per thousand), the horses (-2.6 parts per thousand), and the mammoth (-5.1 parts per thousand) show that these animals inhabited an arid environment, consistent with the results from the analyses of paleosols.

AB  - Increasing seawater temperature affects growth, reproduction and development in marine organisms. In this study, we examined the effects of elevated temperatures on reproductive functions, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and nitrotyrosine protein (NTP, an indicator of reactive nitrogen species) expressions, protein carbonyl (PC, an indicator of oxidative stress) contents, cellular apoptosis, and coelomic fluid (CF) conditions in Atlantic sea urchin. Sea urchins were housed in six aquaria with control (24 degrees C) and elevated temperatures (28 degrees C and 32 degrees C) for a 7-day period. After exposure, sea urchins exhibited decreased percentages of gametes (eggs/sperm), as well as increased HSP70 and NTP expressions in eggs and spermatogenic cells, increased gonadal apoptosis, and decreased CF pH compared to controls. PC contents were also significantly increased in gonadal tissues at higher temperatures. These results suggest that elevated temperature acidifies CF, increases oxidative stress and gonadal apoptosis, and results in impairment of reproductive functions in sea urchins.

AB  - This study evaluated the genotoxic potential of atmospheric pollution associated with urbanization using the model organism Drosophila melanogaster and the Comet assay with hemolymph cells. Larvae were exposed to atmospheric compounds inan urban and a rural area in the municipality of Vitoria de Santo AntAo, Pernambuco, Brazil, for 6days (from the embryo stage to the third larval stage) in April 2015 and April 2017. The results were compared to a negative environmental control group exposed to a preserved area (Catimbau National Park) and to a negative control exposed to the laboratory room conditions. The Comet assay demonstrated significant genetic damage in the organisms exposed to the urban area compared with those exposed to the rural area and negative control groups. The evidences were supported by particulate matter analysis showing higher photopeaks of chemical elements such as aluminum, silicon, sulfur, potassium, calcium, titanium, and iron, associated to road dust fraction in urban environment. Once again, the results confirm D. melanogaster an ideal bioindicator organism to monitor genotoxic hazard associated with atmospheric pollution.

AB  - One of the most dramatic indicators of climate change is the reduction in the extent and thickness of Arctic sea ice that has resulted in an increase in wind-driven sea ice mobility. During April and May 2017, satellite observations indicated that the ice arch that forms between Nares Strait and the Lincoln Sea collapsed. Typically, this collapse occurs in July or August allowing multiyear ice to exit the Arctic through Nares Strait. Here we show that the period of the collapse was associated with the presence of a polynya in northern Nares Strait, thin ice in the Lincoln Sea, and an unusual wind regime characterized by strong northerly flow. We propose that these anomalous conditions resulted in the arch's early collapse. If the ice in the region continues to thin, early collapses may occur more frequently with implications for the regional as well as the downstream climate and ecosystems.

AB  - Seedbed preparation for crop establishment (sowing) is one of the most important agricultural works, as is done with high energy consumption and high costs. The quality of this work influences in large measure the germination of crop and the productivity that can be obtained per hectare. Therefore, at present, there is different equipment from the ones found in classical cultivation technologies, which in single pass can achieve tillage with minimum energy consumption, thus creating optimum conditions for sowing and higher yield without soil degradation. These devices are called combinators. Of all the existing combinators, most performant are the vibro-combinators. In order to carry out the research, we settled in six parcels in the plains of the West of Romania so that we could have three different types of soils which are representative for that specific area. From each profile were collected soil samples in three steps of 6, 12 and 18 cm. For each sample were performed six repetitions (N = 6) and we started by measuring the particle size distribution (granulometric composition) and the main physical properties of the soil (moisture, bulk density, total porosity and soil compression degree).

AB  - The quality of the soil cover due to the use of various agricultural technologies is the subject of this study. The large number of agricultural technological works that are executed under the conventional technologies can reduce the natural soil fertility by modifying the soil agrochemical indicators. These negative phenomena have led to the emergence and development of the concept called "system of agricultural works for soil conservation" [8], according to which the system of works needs to maintain or improve the productive potential of the soil. The paper presents the results of the researches carried out in order to know the effect caused by the long application of the various soil cultivation systems, on the chernozem type of Baragan Plain, soil with very high fertility potential, where the humus content is on average 3.8%. Having as comparison base the classical soil cultivation technology performed by classic plowing (conventional soil tillage), at a depth of 22 cm, various variants with low soil works were taken into consideration, namely the replacement of classical works with disc or chisel works (conservative soil tillage).

AB  - The viscoelastic-capillary model to predict approximately coating windows for the stable operations of viscoelastic coating liquids is derived using a lubrication approximation in slot coating processes. Pressure distributions and velocity profiles for viscoelastic liquids based on the Oldroyd-B and Phan-Thien and Tanner (PTT) models are solved in the coating bead region considering the Couette-Poiseuille flow feature and the pressure jumps at upstream and downstream menisci. Practical operating limits for the uniform coating of rheologically different liquids that are free from leaking and bead break-up defects are constructed under various conditions, incorporating the position of the upstream meniscus as an important indicator while determining limits. The shift of the uniform operating range shows different patterns for the Oldroyd-B liquid with a constant shear viscosity and the PTT liquid with a shear-thinning nature in comparison with the Newtonian case. The windows predicted by the simplified model are corroborated with experimental observations for one Newtonian and two viscoelastic liquids.

AB  - A vulnerability assessment frame is necessary from a holistic perspective that integrates the factors that affect a territory along with socio-cultural elements and timescales subsequent to the disasters. Such a frame has the potential to assess a territory's particular characteristics and generate local knowledge for prevention, mitigation, and response. Recent studies on the subject have focused on vulnerability analyses in a fragmented manner; therefore, it is appropriate to study the effects of natural disasters from a territorial perspective when considering risk. This study emphasizes identifying indicators for each factor in the territorial system and analyzes the datasets obtained for the case studies. In this article, stakeholder participation is highlighted as a transversal element that Voinov and Bousquet (2010) [58] have suggested contributes to an increased knowledge of the actors and system and the system's dynamics under various conditions, such as vulnerability. The analysis shows that the design of risk management public policies in Colombia should consider the different aspects of the territorial system. The results show that local knowledge can be used to estimate vulnerability and support plans that improve local resilience.

AB  - We examined diatom assemblages from 18 stream and pond samples in the Franz Josef Land Archipelago (FJL), the most northern land of Eurasia. More than 216 taxa were observed, revealing a rich circumpolar diatom flora, including many undescribed taxa. Widely distributed taxa were the most abundant by cell densities, while circumpolar taxa were the most species rich. Stream and pond habitats hosted different assemblages, and varied along a pH gradient. Diatoma tennis was the most abundant and ubiquitous taxon. However, several circumpolar taxa such as Charnaepinnularia gandrupn, Cymbella botellus, Psammothidium sp. and Humidophila laevissima were also found in relatively high abundances. Aerophilic taxa were an important component of FJL diatom assemblages (Humidophila spp., Caloneis spp. and Pinnularia spp.), reflecting the large and extreme seasonal changes in Arctic conditions. We predict a decrease in the abundance of circumpolar taxa, an increase in local (alpha-) freshwater diatom diversity, but a decrease in regional diversity (circumpolar homogenization) as a result of current warming trends and to a lesser extent the increasing human, footprint in the region.

AB  - In this paper, a novel integrated solar and wind energy-based system for electricity and hydrogen generation is examined. This system consists of the photovoltaic, solar pond, wind turbine, organic Rankine cycle (ORC), PEM electrolyser, PEM fuel cell, hydrogen and oxygen storage subsystems. Thermodynamic analysis, environmental impact assessment and also parametric studies are analysed to research the impacts of various working parameters on the exergy destruction rates and exergy efficiencies of the integrated system parts and whole system. The energy and exergy efficiencies for the renewable-based integrated system are found to be 46.9% and 36.5% at reference temperature and pressure condition, respectively. In addition, the results of this paper indicate that the primary sources of irreversibilities in the integrated system are the solar pond system and ORC system. Finally, environmental impact assessments show that the emissions of CO2 in kg per kWh for power generation are lower for the wind turbine and PV systems.

AB  - Some of the main electron carriers in the metabolism are mono- or dinucleotides and they play crucial roles in maintaining a balanced redox homeostasis of cells, and in coupling many anabolic and catabolic reactions. Altered cellular redox status can be an indicator of various metabolic disorders such as obesity, the metabolic syndrome, or type 2 diabetes and of other pathological conditions, which involve oxidative stress, such as cardiovascular diseases. Adequate NAD(+)/NADH and NADP(+)/NADPH ratios are fundamental for normal cellular functions, thus accurate measurement of these pyridine dinucleotides is essential in biochemical research. Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry has become the leading analytical technology in (targeted) state-of-the-art metabolic profiling. Main difficulties that hamper quantification of metabolites are chemical similarities, high polarity, and chemical and biological instability of the molecules to be measured. In this review, some critical steps of studying cellular redox status are described, in particular, different techniques of sample preparation and challenges in chromatographic separation.

AB  - The forest sector is important for the German Federal State of Baden-Wurttemberg (BW) and the Vasterbotten (VB) County in Sweden. Their forestry wood chains (FWCs) are of similar magnitude and supply forest industries. This study provides a regional comparison of the performance of FWCs from roundwood harvesting, including hauling, to mill gate concerning the factors that impact sustainability and assess different sustainability indicators for alternative supply chains, in particular fully mechanized chains in comparison to motor-manual operations. The harvest volumes are similar but operational conditions differ. Analysis of sustainability indicators demonstrated that the total costs for roundwood to industry are similar. Higher harvesting costs in BW are compensated for by lower transport costs to the mills. Employment per unit is higher in BW because of the high share of labour in felling. Due to smaller machinery and shorter transport distances in BW, energy use and greenhouse gas emissions per unit are lower than in VB. Areas for improvement are the technologies for logging in BW and the logistics of timber transport in VB.

AB  - Ponds are common property resources that allow users to obtain water on-demand because of their capacity to store rainwater and other surplus water close to users. Effective management of these ponds is crucial, especially with increasing water scarcity and decreasing water deliveries for agriculture that are taking place in many irrigation systems, including the Zhanghe Irrigation System (ZIS) in China. The purpose of this study was to determine the nature and performance of collective action in pond management, and to quantify the factors affecting that collective action. We used two different approaches to measure the performance of collective action: a performance indicator based on soil conditions, and farmer's perceptions based on their satisfaction with the current level of management activities. The results using the two approaches were consistent, and indicated that, among other variables, dependency on pond water, pond size, and household size were important variables affecting the performance of collective action. There was also limited evidence that clarification of property rights through the use of contractors for pond management improved outcomes for farmers. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - From the perspective of energy security and environmental sustainability, the use of currently underutilized residual heavy oil can increase the value and applicability of Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power generation systems. In order to utilize such fuel in IGCC applications reliably and effectively, it is essential to understand the phenomena within the gasifier. Therefore, the gasification characteristics of Orimulsion (TM) (registered trademark of BITOR Ltd) were studied using a 2.4 t/d research. The gasifier has many unique measurement devices, such as heat flux probes, sampling devices for hot gas and partially reacted solids, an optical gas analyzer (laser Raman), etc. The gasifier provides a range of performance indicators, such as calorific value of the product gas, cold gas efficiency, carbon conversion efficiency, and the vertical distribution of those results. Gasification reaction mechanisms and the vertical distribution of heat flux, which are required for effective modeling of gasification phenomena, were also studied under various operating conditions. These results are of the form that can be used in the design and operation of actual gasifiers for use with feedstocks like Orimulsion (TM). (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This review deals with the representation of the individual animal in herd scale models for cattle. One main problem in these models is to connect two levels of complexity: herd functioning at the farm level and functioning of the individual animal when physiological processes are considered. The text deals first with the representation of the animal and its physiological functions within existing models. Different physiological functions (i.e., growth, intake, lactation and breeding) are rarely modelled in a mechanistic way when used at the herd level, but mostly on an empirical basis, according to classic mathematical laws. The breeding function is the most important one ( since it allows for herd renewal) and is frequently modelled as a stochastic process. The body condition score is a relevant indicator of the cow's status, which requires a better representation in individual-based models. Some herd models are presented and discussed and some proposals are presented for a herd functioning model for beef cattle taking into account both animal performance and decisional processes.

AB  - Effects of temperature, humidity, temperature and humidity interaction and host on morphometric variability of Paratrichodorus rhodesiensis were studied. Nematode cultures were established in a glasshouse under controlled environments. Amongst the factors investigated, host was found to be the most influential on both sexes (P < 0.05) affecting all characters in females and eiaht out of I I characters in males. Ratios b and c were found to be highly variable and hence their use is not suggested. On the contrary, ratio a was found to be a good indicator of nematode condition, particularly in association with hosts. Vulva position (V) was found to be the most stable character. Paratrichodorus rhodesiensis was affected by higher temperatures of 34 and 36degreesC. Change in humidity did not show a demonstrable trend on morphometric characters in both sexes. Interaction effect of temperature and humidity resulted in a significant effect on body length and body diameter in females and on ratio b and c, pharynx, onchiostyle and tail length in males.

AB  - Expected values and standard deviations of the geometric means of independent positive random variables are useful indicators of the long-term, profitability of an investment, or survival of a biological population. Often these quantities cannot be evaluated in a closed form, or even if they can, there may be a choice between several probability models for the 'annual' growth factors. This paper formulates approximations for geometric means and standard deviations. It evaluates their performance and compares the best of them with the exact values for selected probability models of the annual factors. Among these is a new model for annual log-returns, called the expo-normal law. This is the law of log X, where X has a normal law conditioned on X > 0. Its properties are developed in some detail.
   It is found that for the ranges of annual means and standard deviations typically encountered in financial applications, the longer horizon values depend little on the choice of probability model, and that, where possible, exact evaluation is computationally simpler than using approximations.

AB  - The control of diffuse pollution is one of the major issues affecting the agricultural landscape. Policies of land use management are now being implemented as a means of improving water quality. The potential success of such policies is difficult to determine owing to the complex nature of the processes controlling the transport of diffuse pollutants such as nitrate, phosphorus and sediment. The use of buffer zones alongside water bodies in the agricultural landscape may offer a greater opportunity both for protecting the water and for increasing the habitat and amenity value of the landscape. The potential value of buffer zones in terms of water quality is dependent on landscape type and suitable design. The design of these features needs to consider the hydrology of both the buffer zone and of the landscape as a whole. In landscapes where the hydrology has been altered, additional measures may be required to establish suitable hydrological conditions. The implementation of a strategy of diffuse pollution control therefore needs to be approached on a landscape basis taking into account the nature of pollutant pathways and areas of high pollution risk.

AB  - Discoidal shaped garnets (Alm63 Prp33 Grs3 Sps1) occur in the foliation plane of lineated quartzo-feldspathic mylonites of the Morin shear zone located along the eastern boundary of the Morin anorthosite complex (Grenville Province, Quebec). The flattened shape of garnets records a component of coaxial strain (X = Y much greater than Z), different from the dominant rotational shear strain (X > Y > Z) in this mylonite. TEM observations indicate dislocation slip and recovery to be the main mechanism for the deformation of garnet. Extrapolation of available experimentally-determined flow laws to natural strain-rates shows an inversion of flow strength between quartz +/- feldspar and garnet: garnet, much stronger than quartz and feldspar at temperatures below 700-degrees-C, becomes weaker than quartz and feldspar above 900-degrees-C. The coaxial ductile strain recorded by the garnets could be produced by a local, uncharacterized deformation, under extremely high temperature conditions at the roof of the rising anorthositic diapir (approximately 1155 Ma). Subsequent, lower temperature rotational, deformation is related to strike-slip movement along the Morin shear zone (approximately 1020 Ma).

AB  - Traditionally and socially, the tourism in Constanta is considered to be important to the local economy. Sun and beach locations are both a draw for locals and tourists to the city, on the Black Sea. However, vacation-oriented activities in the city only have a seasonal cycle. In this paper, we proposed to analyze the mass tourist activity in Constanta, taking into account economic, social, and environmental conditions. Additionally, we attempted to build a model based on the data available. The model was developed using a PESTEL analysis to determine the supportability factor of the indicators identified. We also set out to create a projection of the activities proposed for analysis by 2050. To create a model for coastal areas, the data used in this research must be accurate and consistent. Furthermore, correctly identifying indicators and their relationships is a critical step in conducting a thorough study. Last but not least, finding the calculation coefficient for the activity in question is critical, as collecting data from various activities might be challenging when trying to find a feasible model.

AB  - There is no agreement regarding the role of fresh fruit and vegetables' affordability, accessibility and availability, or access in general, on obesity rates. In this article we investigated whether access to fresh fruit and vegetables is related to better biometric indicators such as weight and body mass index. Using mediation and matching methods and assuming that farmers and traditional market sellers have easy access to fruit and vegetables, we found that having better access is not associated to a reduction in weight or body mass index. Potential explanations for this result are that better access was not associated with fresh fruit and vegetables' consumption and fruit and vegetables' consumption was not associated with weight and body mass index. Also, fresh fruit and vegetables' sellers had a higher weight and body mass index compared to the rest of the population but, a similar weight and body mass index compared to people with their same educational level. Therefore, variations on weight and body mass index were more associated with educational level rather than with access. Access may not be the single story to explain fruit and vegetable consumption.

AB  - This research evaluated the carbon dioxide capture and use by Scenedesmus obliquus in a photobioreactor under different CO2 loads. Performance indicators, carbon and energy balances, sustainability indicators, and carbon credits on the photobioreactor were assessed. The results expressed that the CO2 loads of 384.9 kg/m(3)/d (15% CO2) provide the best trade-off for the process. For this condition, maximum biomass productivities of 0.36 kg/m(3)/d, carbon dioxide conversion rates of 0.44 kgCO(2)/m(3)/d, and oxygen release rates of 0.33 kgO(2)/m(3)/d were observed, reaching maximum CO2 removal efficiencies of 30.76%. Volatile organic compounds were the major products generated (80%). However, only < 3% was fixed in biomass. From the environmental and economic point of view, the net energy ratio was 3.44, while the potential carbon credit was of 0.04 USD per m3 of culture. Finally, the use of adequate CO2 loads was also proven to be determinant to improve the global performance of the system.

AB  - Management of spent nuclear fuel is a very important part in the whole cycle of nuclear energy generation. Ignalina nuclear power plant operated two RBMK-1500 reactors that are now being decommissioned. After careful consideration "dry" storage technology in casks was selected for the interim storage of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) for up to 50 years. SNF after pre-storage time in water pools for not less than 5 years is loaded into cast-iron or metal-concrete casks. In this paper decay heat removal was modelled from specific GNB (Gesellschaft fur Nuklear Behalter GmbH) metal-concrete (CONSTOR RBMK-1500) casks for the long-term storage period up to 300 years. The ALGOR code was used for the numerical modeling of the distribution of the heat fluxes and temperatures in a loaded cask placed in an open type storage facility in both summer and winter taking into account local environmental conditions. A local sensitivity analysis of the impact of fuel parameter uncertainties is also performed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Heat stress as an environmental hazard which can seriously affect productivity, health, or even survival of individuals has long been studied. Despite the endeavors that have been made to address the issue quantitatively with various heat stress indices, they are often measured at scatter sites. This research devotes to revealing human heat stress within continuous space with remote sensing technology. The study began with the retrieval of dry-bulb temperature from land surface temperature (LST) with empirical models. As wet-bulb temperature was calculated from dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity, discomfort index (DI) as an indicator of heat stress was revealed for the study area at 1 km spatial resolution for three summer days. Results indicated that DI can be derived within continuous space with remotely sensed data, and its spatial distribution can be dramatically affected by relative humidity. Further comparison between DI and LST indicated that LST as a widely utilized indicator of surface thermal condition fails to address human heat stress as environmental factors such as relative humidity are not taken into account.

AB  - A high penetration of Photovoltaic (PV) systems into power networks can alter the fault currents and negatively impacts on the operation of the protection systems. In this paper, a new analytical model of the fault contribution of a three-phase PV system equipped with a voltage source converter is proposed. Such a model extends the classical steady-state short-circuit analysis to balanced active power networks including PV systems, with the aim to analyze their impact on the breaking capacity of the interrupting devices. The proposed model: (i) takes into account environmental conditions and VSC current limits; (ii) includes the effects of reactive power injections by a detailed representation of different type of VSC control systems; and (iii) can be easily integrated in a software package for power system analysis. The proposed approach is validated by comparing analytical results with time-domain simulations of the IEEE benchmark PV system. Furthermore, it is used to evaluate the impact of a large penetration of PV systems on the fault currents. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Long-term monitoring of Gray-leaved Sagebrush (Artemisia herba-alba Asso.) steppe in southern Oran Region (Algeria): factors and indicators of change. The Gray-leaved Sagebrush (Artemisia herbs Alba Asso.) steppes in the Southern Oran region in Algeria are rangelands of great pastoral interest. 40 Years long-term dynamics of these steppes has been studied since 1975 using a diachronic monitoring (i) in permanent site considering five reference years and (ii) in 30 sites in the rest of the sagebrush steppe in 1975-76 and 2013-2015. Results generally show degradation with changes in the community composition and species dominance with appearance or extension of indicator species reflecting changes in land -use and environmental conditions. The increase in ephemeral species may explain the increase in the beta diversity, while the gamma diversity decreased underlying a trend toward banalization of the plant community composition. Unlike the rest of the pre-existing sagebrush steppe, in the monitoring site, following a series of rainy years, sand which had been fixed would have played an important role in the recovery of the vegetation cover.

AB  - The Neoproterozoic successions in the Aksu region, NW China, which lies unconformably on the Precambrian Aksu Group basement, comprises the Qiaoenbrak, Yuermeinak, Sugetbrak, and Chigebrak formations (from bottom to top). The two lowermost units include two distinct glacial diamictites, which indicate distinct episodes of glaciations. We report the major and trace element (including rare earth element) data for the Qiaoenbrak, Yuermeinak, and Sugetbrak formations to identify the paleoclimatic perturbations. The chemical index of alteration (CIA) values show variations from Qiaoenbrak to Yuermeinak, then Sugetbrak formations. The diamictites have relatively lower chemical index of alteration values (45.23-59.64) than inter-, post- and non-glacial sediments (48.28-66.96). This result supported the condition that the diamictites underwent relatively weak chemical weathering from a dry-cold sedimentary environment, which is associated with the sedimentary facies description. The lower Neoproterozoic successions recoded at least two glaciations, one is Qiaoenbrak glaciation and the other is Yuermeinak glaciation.

AB  - In England and Wales, steroid estrogens: estrone, estradiol and ethinylestradiol have previously been identified as the main chemicals causing endocrine disruption in male fish. A national risk assessment is already available for intersex in fish arising from estrogens under current flow conditions. This study presents, to our knowledge, the first set of national catchment-based risk assessments for steroid estrogen under future scenarios. The river flows and temperatures were perturbed using three climate change scenarios (ranging from relatively dry to wet). The effects of demographic changes on estrogen consumption and human population served by sewage treatment works were also included. Compared to the current situation, the results indicated increased future risk:the percentage of high risk category sites, where endocrine disruption is more likely to occur, increased. These increases were mainly caused by changes in human population. This study provides regulators with valuable information to prepare for this potential increased risk. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB  - In this study, the relative inactivation of faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) namely Escherichia coli, enterococci and sewage markers [Bacteroides HF183 and human adenoviruses (HAVs)] was assessed in sewage-spiked freshwater and seawater microcosms under ambient subtropical climatic conditions. The numbers of declining FIB were measured with culture-based methods, whereas the numbers of sewage markers were measured with qPCR assays. The T-90 inactivation times of E. coli, enterococci and the HF183 markers in both freshwater and seawater microcosms were <3.5 days, suggesting the suitability of the HF183 marker to identify recent sewage pollution events. The T-90 value of HAVs (9.4-13 days), however, was significantly higher than FIB and the HF183 marker in both freshwater (P < 0.001) and seawater (P < 0.05) microcosms. Therefore, we recommend that HAVs should be used as an additional marker to adequately assess the potential health risks associated with longer-term sewage-polluted environmental waters.

AB  - The Halahatang Depression in the Tabei Uplift of the Tarim basin is an active exploration area because it has substantial reservoir potential and contains or is near to many commercial oil fields. Geochemical analysis indicates that Halahatang oils were derived from marine carbonate source rocks deposited under anoxic reducing conditions. The maturities for Halahatang oils are corresponding to the peak of the oil window and slightly higher than the neighboring Tahe oils. The Halahatang oils feature low Pr/Ph, C-21/C-23 tricyclic terpane and, C-28/C-29 sterane ratios, high C-29/C-30 hopane and C-35/C-34 hopane ratios, a "V" shape in the distribution of C-27-C-28-C-29 steranes and light carbon isotope ratios, similar to the Tahe oils and correlate well with the Middle-Upper Ordovician source rock.

AB  - Peroxyacetilnitrates (PAN) is the most characteristic photoxidant of a range of secondary pollutants formed by the photochemical reaction of hydrocarbons with nitrogen oxides in the atmosphere: it is phytotoxic and shows an increasing role in human health effects due to ambient air exposure, especially in presence of high ozone concentrations. Because of the similarity of the conditions required for their photochemical production PAN is observed in conjunction with elevated ozone concentrations. PAN has very low natural background concentrations so it is the very specific indicator of anthropogenic photochemical air pollution. In this paper we report PAN concentrations determined in Rome urban area during winter- and summer-period. PAN measurements were carried out by means of a gas-chromatograph equipped with an Electron Capture Detector (ECD) detector. For identifying the acute episodes of atmospheric photochemical pollutants the relationship between PAN and the variable O-x (=NO2+O-3) which describes the oxidation process evolution is investigated. The role of Volatile Organic Compounds and PAN in the ozone formation is investigated as well the issue of taking in account the autovehicular emissions for checking the NOx fraction in fuel.

AB  - The last 7000 years of environmental history for Paoay Lake and its surrounding landscape is examined through the analysis of pollen, diatoms, charcoal, mineral magnetics and AMS dating. Basal sediments contain shells of Cerithiidae and the saline-tolerant diatom Diploneis indicating that this was an estuarine environment before becoming a freshwater lake after 6000 bp. Pollen analysis shows that submontane forests, characterized by Pinus pollen, underwent a major disturbance around 5000 years ago, recovering to previous levels by 1000 years ago. Charcoal as an indicator of fire is abundant throughout record, although the highest levels occur in the earlier part of the record, between 6500 and 5000 years ago. An aspect of the project was to examine whether there is evidence of land clearance and agricultural development in the region during the late Holocene. While a clear signal of human impact in the record remains equivocal, there appears to be a correspondence between submontane forest decline and mid-Holocene ocean data that depict warmer and possibly drier conditions for the region. The study highlights the vulnerability of these montane forests to forecasts of a warmer and drier climate in the near future.

AB  - The contaminant mass discharge crossing a control plane is an important metric in the assessment of natural attenuation at contaminated sites. For risk-assessment purposes, the mass discharge must be estimated together with a level of uncertainty. We present a conditional Monte Carlo approach that allows estimating the statistical distribution of mass discharge. The approach is based on conditioning multiple realizations of the hydraulic conductivity field on all data available. We jointly determine a first-order decay coefficient in each realization, leading to conditional statistical distributions of all estimated parameters and the total mass discharge. The resulting statistical distribution of contaminant mass discharges can be used in the assessment of risks at the contaminated site. The method is applied to data of hypothetical test cases, which gives the opportunity to compare estimation results to the true field. As concentration data, we account for pointlike measurements obtained in multi-level sampling wells. The obtained empirical distribution of mass discharge crossing the multi-level sampling fence could be well fitted by a log-normal distribution. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In field trials with four spring barley cultivars (Astor, Fran, Matej and Scarlett) during four years (2004-2007) at two localities (Osijek and Nova Gradiska) researches of grain yield, hectoliter weight, protein and starch content, extract content, friability of malt, Kolbach index and malt viscosity were carried out. Cultivar Matej (5.535 t ha(-1)) had significantly higher (P>0.05) grain yield in comparison with cultivars Astor (4.968 t ha(-1)), Fran (5.113 t ha(-1)) and Scarlett (5.150 t ha(-1)). The year of production had significant influence on grain yield as well as on all indicators of malt quality, and differences in grain yield between localities Osijek and Nova Gradiska were not statistically justified. Significant differences between localities Osijek and Nova Gradiska in extract content and friability were estimated. Based on extract content and parameters of malt modification the best scores had cultivar Scarlett which was followed by cultivar Fran. Cultivar Scarlett had grain yield at average level of the trial, but high interaction scores (IPCA1) indicated the high adaptability of this genotype to conditions of production.

AB  - A combined mathematical model for predicting heat penetration and microbial inactivation in a solid body heated by conduction was tested experimentally by inoculating agar cylinders with Salmonella typhimurium or Enterococcus faecium and heating in a water bath. Regions of growth where bacteria had survived after heating were measured by image analysis and compared with model predictions. Visualisation of the regions of growth was improved by incorporating chromogenic metabolic indicators into the agar. Preliminary tests established that the model performed satisfactorily with both test organisms and with cylinders of different diameter. The model was then used in simulation studies in which the parameters D, z, inoculum size, cylinder diameter and heating temperature were systematically varied. These simulations showed that the biological variables D, z and inoculum size had a relatively small effect on the time needed to eliminate bacteria at the cylinder axis in comparison with the physical variables heating temperature and cylinder diameter, which had a much greater relative effect.

AB  - Fiber-optic microprobes connected to sensitive light meters are ideal tools to resolve the steep gradients of light intensity and spectral composition that prevail in aggregates and surface-associated microbial communities in sediments, biofilms, and microbial mats. They allow for a detailed mapping of light fields and enable insights to the complex optical properties of such highly light-scattering and -absorbing microbial systems. Used in combination with microsensors for chemical species, fiber-optic irradiance microprobes allow for detailed studies of photosynthesis regulation and of the photobiology of microbial phototrophs in intact samples under ambient microenvironmental conditions of the natural habitat. Fiber-optic microprobes connected to sensitive fluorometers enable microscale fluorescence measurements, which can be used to map (i) diffusivity and flow; (ii) distribution of photosynthetic microbes, via their photopigment autofluorescence; and (iii) activity of oxygenic photosynthesis via variable chlorophyll fluorescence measurements. Furthermore, by immobilizing optical indicator dyes on the end of optical fibers, fiber-optic microsensors for temperature, salinity, and chemical species such as oxygen, pH, and CO2 can be realized.

AB  - Shellfish farming is an important economic activity around the world. This activity often takes place in areas subjected to various recurring pollutions. The recrudescent use of herbicides in agriculture including atrazine implies pollutant transfer towards aquatic environment in estuarine areas. Harmful effects of such substances on animals in marine environment, particularly on cultured bivalves, are poorly documented. Bivalve molluscs such as mussels and oysters have been postulated as ideal indicator organisms because of their way of life. They filter large volumes of seawater and may therefore accumulate and concentrate contaminants within their tissues. Moreover, development of techniques allowing effect analysis of such compounds on bivalve biology may lead to the development of diagnosis tools adapted to analyze pollutant transfer towards estuarine areas. In this context, influence of atrazine on defence mechanisms was analyzed in Pacific oysters, Crassostrea gigas. Atrazine was tested in vitro and in vivo on oyster haemocytes, and its effects were analyzed by flow cytometry. Haemocyte viability, cell cycle and cellular activities were monitored. Atrazine induced no significant effect in oyster under tested conditions except for peroxidase activity.

AB  - The public is becoming increasingly distrustful of hazardous waste management activities. However, public trust is a requisite condition for effective environmental management of hazardous waste sites. Without trust, it is unlikely that such institutions can effectively convince the public that a site is safe and can be reused. The authors of this article conducted a study of the social, economic, psychological, demographic, and political factors that may affect environmental risk assessment and communication at the U.S. Department of Energy's Savannah River Nuclear Weapons Site (SRS). Public trust was a central focus of this study. A population survey was conducted to evaluate the level of public mistrust and correlates of public mistrust among residents living near the SRS. In this sample, several groups of respondents demonstrated high levels of trust. Respondents Living upriver from SRS and respondents whose county was economically dependent on SRS voiced high levels of trust. Respondents who were predisposed toward accepting additional hazardous waste or accepting public health risks for economic gain also showed high levels of trust. Findings suggest that public trust is influenced by a variety of factors including personal traits, experiences, and economic needs.

AB  - The rates of CO2 production from soils amended with the D-and L-isomers of alanine, glutamine, glutamic acid, histidine, methionine and tryptophan have been determined in two soils with similar microbial biomass contents but contrasting qCO(2) (basal respiration/biomass C) values and ergosterol (indicator of fungi) contents. The L-amino acids used include representatives of all the main structural groups and some D-amino acids rarely encountered in nature. The L-amino acid SIRs were always greater than the D-amino acid SIRs, and in most cases the ratio of L-amino acid-to-D-amino acid SIR (L-to-D ratio) was greater for the soil with lower qCO(2) and smaller fungal biomass. The enhancements of both D-amino acid SIR and L-amino acid SIR following conditioning of the soils with the amino acid substrate for 7d were equally susceptible to streptomycin and less susceptible to cycloheximide. These observations indicate that the difference between D-and L-amino acid SIRs was not due to gross differences in the proportions of bacteria and fungi in the soils. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - In December 1990 and January 1991, primary (320) and secondary (697) pupils in 2 areas of Athens were screened to determine the rate of carriage of Neisseria meningitidis and to determine if the genetic and environmental factors associated with carriage of meningococci in Greece were similar to those observed for northern European populations. In 1 area, socioeconomic: indicators were significantly lower than in the other (p < 0.0005), but the isolation rates from pupils in the areas were similar, 5.3% and 6.3%. In contrast to studies in northwest Europe, carriage was not associated with lower socioeconomic conditions, sex, numbers of individuals per household, upper respiratory tract infection, or secretor status. By univariate analysis, carriage was associated with age (15-18 years) (p < 0.05) and mother's or other carer's smoking habits (p < 0.05) - but not father's smoking. Although the proportion of fathers who smoked was greater in the area where socioeconomic indicators were lower (61%) vs. (47%) (p < 0.0005), the proportions of women smokers were similar (33% vs. 38%). By multiple regression analysis, the only significant factors were age (p < 0.01) and carer's smoking (p < 0.05).

AB  - This study is a palynological and stratigraphical investigation of E1 and E10 core samples from the southern part of Lake Ercek (Eastern Anatolia, Turkey). Core samples were taken by a gravity corer from different water depths. Deposits in the core samples include mostly laminated rhythmic sediments, massive and graded layers and a tephra layer from E10 core, representing different time spans because of the faulted ground of the lake. Tentative time scales of the core samples are based on pollen and tephra correlation with Lake Van deposits. According to the palynological investigations, palaeovegetation of Greenlandian is represented by Amaranthaceae-dominant halophytic vegetation and semi-arid palaeoclimate conditions based on pollen analysis around Lake Ercek. The Meghalayan stage is mainly characterized by Poaceae-dominated steppe vegetation and increasing human impact according to anthropogenic pollen indicators. The Meghalayan palaeoclimate of Lake Ercek was more humid than Greenlandian and is represented by maximum deciduous Quercus expansion in recent times around the Lake Ercek area.

AB  - The study provides a useful tool to enable local decision makers to define territorial sustainable policies. For this purpose, using selected indicators, we analyse, at the municipal level, the behaviour of and interactions among the socio-demographic, environmental, economic, and accessibility dimensions in two northern Italian provinces in the Alpine Chain (NUTS3), which are identified by the EU as predominantly rural areas. We adopt the dominance-based rough set approach, which allows for the discovery of hidden patterns among the data by means of the generation of decision rules. The population variation over time and number of foreign citizens are the decision attributes considered together with condition attributes belonging to the socio-demographic, environmental, economic, and accessibility dimensions. Our selected areas (rural, mountainous, and peripheral) present various facets at the sustainability level, largely due to their complexity, which was confirmed by the rules we found. Moreover, the socio-demographic and accessibility attributes are more commonly present in the rules and a low interaction characterizes the four dimensions. Finally, economic growth is often at odds with environmental sustainability.

AB  - This work explores the extent to which urban integration is related to a better quality of life in the metropolitan areas of Santiago, Valparaiso and Concepcion. This challenge has not been addressed so far as a result of its methodological and interpretation complexities. Through the comparative analysis of the Urban Life Quality Index (ICVU) and Urban Integration indices raised from the System of Urban Development Indicators and Standards (SIEDU), three key dimensions are addressed: sociocultural conditions, connectivity and mobility, and housing and environment. The results confirm in the case of the three metropolitan areas of Chile that urban integration is not necessarily expressed as the result of a better quality of life, opening an important question about the scope that a good endowment of public and private goods and services may have in order to guarantee a greater degree of integration in neighborhoods and municipalities, at least at the metropolitan level. Additionally, the importance of the geography of the metropolitan areas is revealed, due to some conflicting results obtained, generating a significant contribution for the design of public policies before their next examination in Chile.

AB  - Energy-efficient retrofitting of buildings has become essential to achieve the environmental objectives of the European Union's (EU) strategies towards reducing carbon emissions and energy dependency on fossil fuels. When tackling retrofitting projects, the issue of scale becomes essential as sometimes this can determine the sustainability of the project. Therefore, a comprehensive approach is essential to ensure effective decision-making. A platform has been designed within the EU funded OptEEmAL project to support stakeholders in this process, providing functionalities that can automatically model and evaluate candidate retrofitting alternatives considering their priorities, targets and boundary conditions. A core element of this platform is the evaluation framework deployed which implements a multi-criteria decision-making approach to transform the priorities of stakeholders into quantifiable weights used to compare the alternatives. As a result, more informed decisions can be made by the stakeholders through a comprehensive evaluation of the candidate retrofitting scenarios. This paper presents the approach followed to develop and integrate this evaluation framework within the platform as well as its validation in a controlled environment to ensure its effectiveness.

AB  - The last few decades have stood out because of the improvements made in food processing under two axes: plurality (conventional technologies co-existing with new alternatives) and sustainability (jointly with efficiency, quality and safety). This article aims at discussing how these technological developments in food processing are addressed in life cycle literature, regarding case studies in which different food processing alternatives are compared. From the examined case studies some methodological aspects were underscored to improve the application of LCA in food processing: the functional unit, system boundaries, scale and data source issues, as well as the relevance of process water and wastewater composition. Furthermore, different findings have emerged with a direct impact on future developments: the (re)thinking of technological and operational conditions (with an emphasis on cleaner production techniques), the inclusion of scale decision and consumption, and the importance of incorporating nutritional, sensorial and socio-economic dimensions to assist decision making.

AB  - Underground contamination water by herbicides depends on the interactions between their molecules with physical and chemical soil characteristics and climatic conditions. Studies with columns can estimate the leaching potential of herbicides in soils. This study aimed to determine the effect of soil pH on tebuthiuron leaching, and capacity of bioindicators to detect tebuthiuron residues in three Brazilian soils. Cucumber plants (Cucumis sativus) were more negatively affected when grown in soils with lower amounts of organic matter and clay, and in these soils, the tebuthiuron levels reached greater depths in the column. There was a positive correlation between tebuthiuron concentration and cucumber intoxication, and a negative correlation between tebuthiuron concentration and dry matter cucumber in all soils. The tebuthiuron leached up to 50 cm depth even in soils with higher organic matter and clay content. The increasing of soil pH can affect the leaching of nonionic herbicides, and liming practice may elevate the environmental contamination risk by tebuthiuron. The bioindicator method using Cucumis sativus is viable and can be recommended to detect tebuthiuron concentrations above 0.2 mg kg(-1).

AB  - We re-examine the concept of beta-convergence in living standards across countries during the period 1980-2012. In this study, well-being is assessed using the Human Development Index (HDI) which considers income aspects as well as social indicators, thus reflecting the multidimensional nature of this process. The existence of sigma convergence is evidenced in this study and hence beta convergence, as a necessary condition, is also pointed out. However, the linearity of this process has been questioned. Therefore, we apply a semiparametric specification of this process to the HDI and each of its intermediate indices. These models allows for nonlinearities in the estimation of the convergence speed. Our results reveal that absolute convergence in human well-being is satisfactorily represented by the conventional linear specification. However the income and education indices show nonlinear patterns. We also include structural variables to capture differences in the steady-state (conditional convergence). Under this model, convergence speed of all indicators is higher and the convergence process seems to be linear only for the health index.

AB  - Five strains of heterotrophic nitrifying bacterial were isolated from Songhua River in northern China in winter. Through ammonia degradation experiment, the strain Y7 demonstrates the ability to convert ammonium to nitrogen under oligotrophic conditions at low temperature. The average ammonium removal rate was approximately 0.075+/-0.007 mg NH4+-N/L.h during the 48-hour observation period and 66.70+/-3.06% of ammonium removal was achieved in the end. The morphological and physiological characteristics and 16S rDNA sequence of strains were analyzed. The results showed that strain Y7 was belonging to Acinetobacter bacteria. Acute and chronic toxicity tests and Ames bacterial mutagenecity experiment were also conducted. No mortality occurred and none of the mice exhibited any clinical sign on cage-side observation. Blood and blood biochemical indicators of liver, kidney, spleen changed after contamination showed that various organs were not damaged and indicated that the strain Y7 is safe for animals. This study provided more information for the construction of nitrogen flora in the low-temperature oligotropic environment.

AB  - A time-domain topological derivative (TD) approach is developed for transient elastic-wave imaging of buried cracks. The TD, which quantifies the sensitivity of the misfit cost functional to the creation at a specified location of an infinitesimal trial crack, is expressed in terms of the time convolution of the free field and an adjoint field as a function of that specified location and of the trial crack shape. Following previous studies on cavity identification in similar conditions, the ID field is here considered as a natural and computationally efficient approach for defining a crack location indicator function. This study emphasizes the implementation and exploitation of TD fields using the standard displacement-based FEM, a straightforward exploitation of the relevant sensitivity formulation established here. Results on several numerical experiments on 3D elastodynamic and acoustic configurations are reported and discussed, allowing to assess and highlight many features of the proposed TD-based fast qualitative crack identification, including its ability to identify multiple cracks and its robustness against data noise.

AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated that accurate estimates of forest gross primary production (GPP) can be obtained by the use of a parametric model (C-Fix) which combines ground and remotely sensed data. A methodology is presented to convert these GPP estimates into values of net ecosystem exchange (NEE). It is based on the use of a process model, BIOME-BGC, which, after proper calibration, simulates all main functions of forest ecosystems at climax condition. The estimated photosynthesis and respirations are transformed into net carbon fluxes of actual forests by using a simplified approach which considers the difference between actual and potential woody biomass as an indicator of ecosystem distance from climax. The methodology was applied to all Tuscany forests for an eight-year period (1999-2006). Its validation was performed by comparing the NEE estimates to the ground data collected in San Rossore, a pine forest site for which eddy covariance measurements are available. The results obtained indicate the potential of the approach, which is finally applied to yield inputs for the analysis of forest NEE trends at regional scale.

AB  - Ochlerotatus (Finlaya) japonicus japonicus (Theobald; =Aedes japonicus; see Reinert 2000) (Diptera : Culicidae), is an introduced Asian mosquito species first detected in the northeastern United States in 1998. Since its initial discovery, this species has spread to many neighboring states and Canada. It was first identified in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia in 2003. Larval surveys were conducted during 2005 and 2006 in the Southern Appalachians, USA, on a variety of natural and artificial containers to determine extent of Oc.japonicus establishment and larval habitat requirements. Detritus amounts were measured in each container habitat, and co-occurring larval mosquito species were examined as indicators of potential interspecific competition. Data reveal that Oc. japonicus was the most abundant container-inhabiting mosquito species in this survey. It exhibits flexibility in its use of container oviposition habitats, it can persist in a wide range of conditions, and it co-occurs with a wide range of larval mosquito species. Its rapid and successful establishment warrants continued monitoring, because its potential role as a nuisance species or arbovirus vector remains unknown.

AB  - Isoprostanes are members of a family of prostaglandin isomers that are produced by free radical-catalysed mechanisms. They have become well-recognized indicators of oxidant-induced cell damage in a variety of pathophysiological conditions. Several isoprostanes have been shown to possess biological activity in whole-animal, isolated tissue and cell-based systems. Their actions include vasoconstriction, platelet aggregation and cardiac hypertrophy. Current evidence suggests that these effects are mediated by prostanoid receptors through a complex set of interactions that involve agonism, partial agonism, desensitization and co-operative behaviors. It is likely that other mechanisms of action are waiting to be discovered. Based on a consideration of these biological effects, we argue that isoprostanes are more than mere markers and may serve as active participants in promoting and exaggerating pathophysiological changes. To tease out their roles requires considerable more work and a willingness to suspend disbelief based on limited evidence.

AB  - Relationships between growth and milk production in dairy cows were reviewed. Some studies revealed a negative relationship between increased prepubertal growth intensity and subsequent milk production. Other studies did not confirm that relation. Growth intensity is highly variable, lowly heritable, and a poor indicator of milk production. First lactation milk yield is related to body weight, age, and body condition score at the first calving. Generally recommended optimal body weight and age at the first calving are 570 kg (i.e. 85% of mature weight) and less than 24 months, respectively. The costs of dairy replacement heifer rearing can be reduced by altering feeding programmes, accelerated growth intensity, and early breeding. Genetic variability in the shape of the growth curve can be used for improvement of an individual ability to mature at the early age. In selection for early maturity, decreasing mature size would be expected. Investigation of biological fundaments of growth and particularly its hormonal control is an opportunity for further studies of the relationship between growth and milk production in dairy cattle.

AB  - In a laboratory study the physiological response of 3 earthworm species, Aporrectodea caliginosa, Lumbricus terrestris and Lumbricus rubellus, to different pH values of their environment was investigated.  The environment consisted of solid agar mixed with various pH indicators:  methyl red (pH 4.2), bromothymol blue (pH 5.2) and m-cresol purple (pH 9.3).  In order to observe the burrow system the earthworms were kept in planar glass cuvettes.  To obtain information about the buffer capacity of the cutaneous mucus the colour change of the indicators in the drilosphere was evaluated over time.  The secreted mucus of all species neutralized the bromothymol blue and m-cresol purple media in less than 1 day.  A. caliginosa showed no colour change in methyl red but died after 4 days.  Both species of Lumbricus caused a colour change in methyl red after 5 to 6 days.  Furthermore, the pH of the mucus was measured:  pH 7.9 (A. caliginosa), pH 7.0 (L. terrestris) and pH 6.1 (L. rubellus).  The agar technique is suitable for identifying the ability of earthworms to induce drilosphere pH neutralization.

AB  - An integrated oil spill model MICROSS2 has been developed for simulating the fate and transport of spilled oil in rivers and is applied to the upper St. Lawrence river bordering the United States and Canada. This model considers the physico-chemical mechanisms of advection, horizontal diffusion, mechanical spreading, evaporation, dissolution, vertical mixing, and shoreline deposition in simulating the oil slick transformation. It can simulate the oil slick transformation on the water surface and in the water column, in transient flow conditions with varying wind and air temperature. The integrated model consists of the following modules: a) a menu based interface for interactive data preparation, and execution of other modules; b) flow model to compute the velocity distribution in the river; c) a two-dimensional two layer oil spill model; d) a graphics interface for visualizing the results from the flow model and the oil spill model. The integrated model is operational on a micro-computer, and can be used as a part of an oil spill response program to assist clean-up, environmental impact assessment, and contingency planning.

AB  - The bivalve Aulacomyella is described formally from Tithonian deposits of the Antarctic Peninsula region for the first time.  Two species are recognized.  A. willeyi Kelly sp. nov. was collected in situ from the Nordenskjold Formation, Longing Gap on the east coast of Graham Land, and in clasts reworked into Cretaceous glide block deposits on James Ross Island.  A. cf. problematica Furlani is recorded from the Himalia Ridge Formation, Fossil Bluff Group, Alexander Island.  These Antarctic records are the first published systematic descriptions of the genus from the Southern Hemisphere.  Together with Mexican and Turkish records, they represent the last known occurrences of this genus.  Globally the genus is particularly abundant during the Kimmeridgian and Early Tithonian stages and is therefore of value as a biostratigraphic indicator.  It was almost certainly an epibyssate suspension feeder, although the precise palaeoecological setting for Aulacomyella is uncertain.  It normally occurs in black shales or mudstones.  The most likely life habits were either living epifaunally on the sea floor, where it bloomed under episodic dysaerobic conditions in an otherwise anaerobic environment, or pseudoplanktonically infesting floating sea weeds etc.  Of these hypotheses the former is preferred here.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is the biggest problem facing the world nowadays. Each country in the world has its own characteristics, which means that its governments, at different rhythms, adopt identical measures to combat this new virus. This article aims to perform a comparative study between countries with a population similar to the Portuguese in number of inhabitants and to find out which factors may explain the numbers registered with the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show that the countries that carried out more population tests have higher values in tourism, security, innovation, competitiveness, and GDP per capita indicators. There is a significant and positive relationship between temperature and the daily cases of COVID-19 infections. The results found contribute to a greater knowledge of the behavior of this disease according to the characteristics of each country, making it useful for international business managers to compare and contrast different country environmental conditions in order to define alternative strategies to overcome this great period of disturbance more quickly.

AB  - A number of recent studies carried out in the education sector have revealed the incidence of burnout in school environments and have highlighted the principal psycho-social sources of burnout syndrome among teachers. This study attempts to look further at the results of a previous research carried out on a sample of 882 Italian teachers. Using advanced statistical techniques such as MIMIC modelling, it intends to verify whether the following psycho-social stress factors are significant as predictors: interpersonal relations, workload, organisational conflict, role ambiguity, perceived role image, work-home interface. Considering that in Italy the recent regulations regarding retirement are triggering new stressful conditions for teachers, this study also aims to assess the role played by age in relation to the sources of psycho-social stress and burnout. The scales we have adopted are the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI-ES) and the Cooper's Occupational Stress Indicator (OSI) specifically adapted for Italian schools. Results have shown the clear predictive role of factors such as interpersonal conflict and home-work interface in determining the onset of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization among teachers.

AB  - Many factors can affect the translation and interpreting process, but the quality of source texts has been explicitly identified as an issue in surveys of professional translators and interpreters as well as in recent workplace studies. If translators and interpreters encounter resistance in carrying out their tasks, for example by difficulties in extracting meaning from non-native English input, then flow can be interrupted and performance affected. In this paper, we explore how English as a lingua franca (ELF) input could potentially increase the cognitive load not only for translators and interpreters but also for other multilinguals. We describe the range of methods that can be used to measure the cognitive effort and stress associated with processing ELF input and explain the challenges that can be encountered when researchers are committed to using authentic ELF material to make comparisons under relatively controlled but ecologically valid conditions. One of the driving motivators for this type of research is to understand how interpreters and translators deploy their expertise to deal with ELF input in work settings in order to draw inferences about strategies for other segments of the population.

AB  - The potential health risks associated with sludge cake application to agricultural land are managed by controlling the levels of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria which indicate the risk of pathogen transfer. Analyses undertaken following post-digestion sludge dewatering have shown unpredictable levels of E. coli increase in stored sludge cake. Presently there is limited understanding on environmental parameters controlling the indicator bacteria density in storage and the contributory effects dewatering may have. This review aims to establish the state of current knowledge on innate and environmental factors influencing E. coli dynamics and survival in biosolids. A key factor identified is the effect of mechanical dewatering processes, which transform the sludge matrix environmental conditions through the increased availability of growth factors (e.g. nutrient and oxygen). Examples of storage practices from the agricultural and food industries are also discussed as successful methods to inhibit bacterial growth and survival, which could be extrapolated to the biosolids sector to regulate E. coli concentrations.

AB  - Measuring pavement roughness and detecting pavement surface defects are two of the most important tasks in pavement management. While existing pavement roughness measurement approaches are expensive, the primary aim of this paper is to use a cost-effective and sufficiently accurate RGB-D sensor to estimate the pavement roughness in the outdoor environment. An algorithm is proposed to process the RGB-D data and autonomously quantify the road roughness. To this end, the RGB-D sensor is calibrated and primary data for estimating the pavement roughness are collected. The collected depth frames and RGB images are registered to create the 3D road surfaces. We found that there is a significant correlation between the estimated International Roughness Index (IRI) using the RGB-D sensor and the manual measured IRI using rod and level. By considering the Power Spectral Density (PSD) analysis and the repeatability of measurement, the results show that the proposed solution can accurately estimate the different pavement roughness.

AB  - The microbiological and chemical study was conducted in 2014, with the aim to assess the water quality of Lake Ohrid and its tributaries. The following parameters were studied: number of heterotrophic bacteria, total number of coliform bacteria, enterococci, Escherichia coli, chemical oxygen demand, and ammonia. The presence and composition of the studied microorganisms had spatial and seasonal dynamics depending on the biotic and abiotic factors, the degree of eutrophication and anthropogenic impact. The lake parts, which are far from settlements and river inflows, were classified as pure waters. The worse water quality was registered in the area of Grashnica locality, where relatively high organic and faecal pollution was registered. This part of the lake is under the pressure of communal and industrial waste waters rich with pollutants and nutrients, which originate in the Velgoska River. This river was highly polluted, exclusively faecal pollution. Similar conditions were found in the Cherava River, while the rivers Koselska and Sateska were less polluted. In order to prevent further worsening of the ecological status of Lake Ohrid, certain preventive measures, mainly rehabilitation of the communal waste waters and regular monitoring of the water and sediments, are necessary.

AB  - Fingerprint localisation technique is an effective positioning technique to determine the object locations by using radio signal strength, values in indoors. The technique is subject to big positioning errors due to challenging environmental conditions. In this paper, initially, a fingerprint localisation technique is deployed by using classical k-nearest neighborhood method to determine the unknown object locations. Additionally, several artificial neural networks, are employed, using fingerprint data, such as single-layer feed forward neural network multi-layer feed forward neural network, multi-layer back propagation neural network general regression neural network, and deep neural network to determine the same unknown object locations. Fingerprint database is built by received signal strength indicator measurement signatures across the grid locations. The construction and the adapted approach of different neural networks using the fingerprint data are described. The results of them are compared with the classical k-nearest neighborhood method and it was found that deep neural network was the best neural network technique providing the maximum positioning accuracies.

AB  - Biofertilizers and biostimulants application to crops is a prioritized strategy to improve and preserve the physical, chemical and biological conditions of soils, increase the potential for agroproduction and substitute imports. The aim of this work was to determine the agronomic response of two white maize varieties (var. Chuco and Cariaco) to the application of three bioactive products. The experiment was conducted from April 1 to July 26, 2016, using a randomized block design with three replicates and four treatments for each variety [T1: (seeds sprayed with H2O), T2: (seeds embedded in a solution of QuitoMax), T3: (Seeds treated with Azofert) and T4: (seeds pelleted with a paste formed by Ecomic and water)]. A double classification variance analysis was performed. When the indicators showed significant statistical differences, the Duncan Multiple Mean Comparison test was used with a significance level of 5%. The three bioactive products surpassed the control treatment in the performance component indicators, with the maximum results from the QuitoMax treatment, obtaining yields of 2.84 and 3.2 (t.ha(-1)) in the Chuco and Cariaco varieties respectively.

AB  - Objective: Exposure to trauma-related cues has been associated with a prolonged decrease in heart rate variability (HRV) under laboratory conditions, however the relationship between PTSD symptoms and HRV has not been evaluated during everyday life. The present study sought to determine whether Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms reported during everyday life were related to reduced HRV.
   Methodology: Eighty-three young adults with PTSD underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring, during which PTSD symptoms were measured using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Multilevel modeling was used to examine the association between PTSD symptom severity and low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) HRV.
   Results: PTSD symptoms were associated with reductions in LF HRV, independently of age and activity level. There was no significant association between PTSD symptom levels and HF HRV.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that an association between momentary PTSD symptom severity and reduced LF HRV is significant and observable in young adults with PTSD. Findings highlight the need for cardiovascular screening in young adults with PTSD and early interventions that target physiological reactivity in PTSD. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cu(II) complexes of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) Meloxicam (H2MLX) was synthesized and characterized via spectroscopic and analytical techniques. The thermal behavior of the complex was also analyzed. The photoluminescence properties of the compounds were analyzed under different conditions. The electrochemical properties of both ligand and complex have been analyzed by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) using glassy carbon electrode. The biological activities of the compounds were evaluated through examining their capacity to bind to fish sperm double strand DNA (FSdsDNA) with absorption spectroscopy and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Absorption studies of the interaction of the H2MLX and its Cu(II) complex with FSdsDNA have indicated that these compounds could bind to FSdsDNA, and the binding constants were calculated. The morphology of the FSdsDNA, H2MLX, and Cu(II) complex were analyzed thanks to using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In the DPV technique, pencil graphite electrode was used as a working electrode. The decrease in the intensity of the guanine oxidation signals was used as an indicator for the interaction mechanism.

AB  - Markers of oxidative stress in the hepatopancreas and carotenoid and vitamin E content in the carapace of the invasive crab Percnon gibbesi and the native crab Pachygrapsus marmoratus were compared as indicators of their physiological condition and environmental adaptation. Crabs similar in size were collected from coastal waters of Portals Vells (Mallorca Island, Spain; 39 degrees 28' 18.79" N, 2 degrees 28' 19.63" E) at <1 m depth. Vitamin E levels were significantly higher in P. marmoratus than in P. gibbesi, whereas all carotenoid concentrations, except astaxanthin, were significantly higher in P. gibbesi. Catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase activities were significantly greater in P. marmoratus. Malondialdehyde concentration, a marker of lipid peroxidation, was higher in the hepatopancreas of P. gibbesi. The differences in carotenoid and vitamin E contents and in the antioxidant enzyme activities are a reflection of the different physiological activity of the two species and may suggest that P. gibbesi is not a potential competitor for the native crab P. marmoratus.

AB  - Paleoecological analyses and historical information were used to characterize pre-disturbance conditions in Swan Lake wetland of suburban Victoria, Vancouver Island, British Columbia, to provide a reference for restoration and management. Highly invasive reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea) dominates Swan Lake wetlands and inhibits restoration. Grass pollen presumably produced by Phalaris predominates only in the top 5 cm (south site) to 35 cm (north site) of sediment cores. Below these levels assemblages are variously dominated by taxa including Salix, Alnus, Lysichiton, Cyperaceae, and Rosaceae. Pollen grains of agricultural disturbance indicators, such as plantain, liguliflorate Asteraceae, and cereals occur to depths of 35 cm. The results strongly suggest that Phalaris communities arose in historical times following agricultural disturbance and have no pre-European equivalent. Pollen assemblages below the Phalaris zone, corroborated by historical documentary references, show diverse original wetland types. Disturbance and crop species pollen indicators may be useful indicators of intensity and depth of disturbance. Pre-agricultural plant communities are a guide for restoration, provided that ecologically limiting factors are managed.

AB  - The present study was conducted to assess the potassium (K) status of soil, forage, and blood plasma of male sheep (rams) at Livestock Experimental Station, Khizerabad, Sargodha, Pakistan. Soil, forage, and blood samples were obtained on monthly basis and analyzed after wet digestion to determine the sampling period effect on K in these variables, in addition to the transfer of K in soil, forage-animal system during this investigation period. The K levels of soil, forage and blood plasma were significantly influenced by the sampling periods and these were found to be above the critical value established for these markers. The forage was deficient in K particularly in the beginning of the growth stage. Plasma had adequate level of K for the normal requirement of rams being reared at this livestock farm, but deficiency of K may be expected during the early season because of deficient level of K in forages. Occasional supplementation of K with locally accessible feed sources and mineral mixture having high availability of this element may alleviate the deficiency if occurs at any time at this animal farm.

AB  - We studied the long-term changes in the flora in the archipelago of SW Finland by comparing historic plant species lists from 331 islands surveyed in the 1930s to 1940s, to lists compiled in 1996-2004. We used plants as indicators to indirectly detect changes in the environment based on changes in species frequencies. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) was used to examine if there was a change in species composition during this 60-70 yr period. More species increased in frequency (180, 31.1%) than decreased (77, 13.6%). The number of species occurrences increased by 10.6%. Species of shores, mires, wetlands, and woods increased, while species of shore meadows, pastures, and heaths decreased. For the non-shore species the interpretation of the DCA and the comparisons of plant indicator values between the old and the new data indicate lower cultural impact, decreased light conditions, a higher level of moisture and nitrogen, and a higher proportion of perennials on the new data islands. The shore plants indicate that productivity has increased over the study period, probably reflecting the eutrophication of the Baltic Sea.

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in ornamental characters may reflect developmental stability in the translation from genotype to phenotype. Antlers of reindeer show FA, are visually conspicuous ornaments and are important in intraspecific assessment. We show that there is a negative relationship between size and asymmetry in visual antler characteristics (i.e., antler length and number of tines) among free-ranging male reindeer in rut. This indicates that individuals that develop large ornaments are better able to buffer developmental stress than individuals that develop small ornaments. There is no relationship between asymmetry in antler length and asymmetry in jaw length, suggesting that symmetry in antlers does not reflect overall body symmetry. This difference may be caused by trait-specific sensitivity to developmental stress. Such stress may partly be caused by parasites, which show a positive association with asymmetry in antlers, but no relationship to asymmetry in jaws. Our results indicate that antlers may be exposed to directional selection in a visual signaler-receiver system and that information about parasite burden may be obtained from evaluation of asymmetry in antlers developed under exposure to a multitude of environmental stresses.

TI  - MODELING URBANISM - ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL-STRESS IN CITIES
T2  - SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - The time has come for urban social indicator research to converge with the basic substantive efforts of urban researchers. Such a convergence may propel both basic and applied researchers toward more fruitful outcomes. This paper argues that the traditional model of urbanism provides the medium for the convergence. When urbanism is conceptualized to be multidimensional, seemingly discreet indicators of demographic, economic, social, and environmental conditions in cities may be incorporated into a more general model of urban structure and change. Specifically, using social indicators for 195 cities from ZPG's Children's Stress Index and the 1990 U.S. Census, we show empirically: (1) Urbanism is a complex factor with four distinct dimensions: demographic scale, economic stress, social stress, and environmental stress. (2) These four dimensions of urbanism may be reliably measured with standard composite variables used in today's social indicator research. (3) Within the Urbanism factor there are causal connections among the separate dimensions, the most basic of which is that asserted by arguments from the traditional theory of urbanism; specifically, that population size, density, and social heterogeneity are causally linked to stress in economic, social, and environmental systems of the city.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
LA  - English
AB  - Harpacticoids made up 19 and 30% of the meiobenthos proper by number and 39 and 55% by biomass at maximum depths and a depth of 20 m, respectively, in Lake Paijanne. Harpacticoids accounted for higher proportions of the total meiobenthos in oligotrophic and unpolluted areas than in polluted areas. Seven species were identified, with Canthocamptus staphylinus confined to semi-lotic areas influenced by organic pollution from a pulp mill. Other species exhibited somewhat different distributions in oligotrophic and mesotrophic areas. Harpacticoid densities were most closely correlated with oxygen content and phytoplankton biomass, and correlations with environmental values were closer at maximum depths than at 20 m. Attheyella crassa densities in the deepest zone had most marked negative correlation with total phosphorus, phytoplankton biomass, dissolved organic matter and organic sedimentation, while Paracamptus schmeili had the closest positive correlation with oxygen content. High densities of these species could be classified as an indicator of oligotrophic conditions. Similar correlations, although weaker, were evident for Bryocamptus minutus and still weaker for Bryocamptus echinatus and Moraria brevipes. Clustering of the stations based on harpacticoid abundances gave a similar result to clustering based on environmental data, particularly in the 20 m zone.

AB  - A study has been conducted examining the thermal fatigue characteristics of an alpha-2/SiC composite; in particular, SCS-6 reinforced Ti-24Al-11Nb (at. pct).  The effort included the investigation of the effect of the environment by cycling coated and uncoated specimens in air and in an inert environment.  Damage assessment was determined by postcycling room-temperature tension testing as well as by microstructural examination, including both optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  Significant reductions in postcycling tensile strength were observed for coated and uncoated specimens thermally cycled in air from 150-degrees-C to 815-degrees-C for 500 cycles, while no measurable loss of strength was found for specimens cycled in a low-pressure inert environment under otherwise identical conditions.  The synergistic effect of residual stresses due to a coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch and environment on the degradation of tensile properties of the thermally cycled composite is found to be the critical damage evolution mechanism for both coated and uncoated composites cycled in air.  Residual stresses alone were found not to be critical in creating damage that could be tracked by a loss in residual strength.

AB  - The release of liquid effluent of nuclear power into aquatic system increases with the rapid development of nuclear facilities in coastal and inland regions. Aquatic model animals are very important for the study of the radiation hazards to non-human biota in water environment and its extrapolation of dose-effect relationship to human models. However, the study of the radiation dose rate calculation model of the aquatic animal zebrafish is still on the homogeneous isotropic model used for the protection of the environment. A series of zebrafish models (including adults, larvae and embryos, named zebrafish-family: ZF-family) with multiple internal organs are established in this study to investigate the mechanism of radiation damage effect in order to protect non-human species. The internal and external dose coefficients (DCs) of the whole body, heart and gonads of zebrafishes are calculated in water environment with the combination of the real experimental culture condition, using Monte Carlo application package GATE (Geant4 Application for Emission Tomography) and eight nuclides, i.e., H-3, C-14, Sr-90, Co-60, (110)mAg, Cs-134, Cs-137, I-131, which are commonly found in the liquid effluent of nuclear power plants, as the source items, The results show that the level of nuclide gamma energy determines the external DCs (DCext), and Sr-90 plays the most important role in internal DCs (DCint). The comparison between the external DCs of the heart and gonad and that of the whole body shows that DCs (DCext) of heart and gonad for females are 80% and 43% lower than that of whole body, respectively, while for males, the DCs (DCext) of heart is 44% lower than that of the whole body, and DCs (DCext) of gonad is slightly higher than that of the whole body for most nuclides (up to 25%).The dose of internal radiation makes greater contribution than that of external radiation to pure beta emitter (H-3, C-14, Sr-90). This internal DCs of ZF-family model with complex internal structure turns out to demonstrate more sensitive DCs change trend and higher calculation values compared with the internal DCs of the simple ellipsoid model. In this model, the photon emitter with strong penetrating power has higher internal DCs, while the low-energy pure beta nuclide does not alter much. In conclusion, it is vital to carry out refined systematic modeling for model organisms, and the determination of DCs of model organs can promote the evaluation of the radiation effects on non-human species.

AB  - The cosmopolitan, potentially toxic dinoflagellate Protoceratium reticulatum possesses a fossilizable cyst stage which is an important paleoenvironmental indicator. Slight differences in the internal transcribed spacer ribosomal DNA (ITS rDNA) sequences of P. reticulatum have been reported, and both the motile stage and cyst morphology of P. reticulatum display phenotypic plasticity, but how these morpho-molecular variations are related with ecophysiological preferences is unknown. Here, 55 single cysts or cells were isolated from localities in the Northern (Arctic to subtropics) and Southern Hemispheres (Chile and New Zealand), and in total 34 strains were established. Cysts and/or cells were examined with light microscopy and/or scanning electron microscopy. Large subunit ribosomal DNA (LSU rDNA) and/or ITS rDNA sequences were obtained for all strains/isolates. All strains/isolates of P. reticulatum shared identical LSU sequences except for one strain from the Mediterranean Sea that differs in one position, however ITS rDNA sequences displayed differences at eight positions. Molecular phylogeny was inferred using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference based on ITS rDNA sequences. The results showed that P. reticulatum comprises at least three ribotypes (designated as A, B, and C). Ribotype A included strains from the Arctic and temperate areas, ribotype B included strains from temperate regions only, and ribotype C included strains from the subtropical and temperate areas. The average ratios of process length to cyst diameter of P. reticulatum ranged from 15% in ribotype A, 22% in ribotype B and 17% in ribotype C but cyst size could overlap. Theca morphology was indistinguishable among ribotypes. The ITS-2 secondary structures of ribotype A displayed one CBC (compensatory change on two sides of a helix pairing) compared to ribotypes B and C. Growth response of one strain from each ribotype to various temperatures was examined. The strains of ribotypes A, B and C exhibited optimum growth at 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C and 20-25 degrees C, respectively, thus corresponding to cold, moderate and warm ecotypes. The profiles of yessotoxins (YTXs) were examined for 25 strains using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The parent compound yessotoxin (YTX) was produced by strains of ribotypes A and B, but not by ribotype C strains, which only produced the structural variant homoyessotoxin (homoYTX). Our results support the notion that there is significant intra-specific variability in Protoceratium reticulatum and the biogeography of the different ribotypes is consistent with specific ecological preferences.

AB  - The late Cenomanian-early Turonian deposits in Tunisia recording the OAE2 event are commonly attributed to the Bahloul Formation. These deposits are composed of dark clayey limestone and organic-rich black shales with abundant planktic foraminifera. At the Bargou area, Oued Kharroub section, these organic-rich deposits include siliceous beds with abundant radiolarians recalling the "Livello Bonarelli". A total of 25 radiolarian species are identified with a maximum of 18 species per sample. Moreover, the species skeleton preservation is usually poor to moderate in the most studied samples [estimated preservation index (PI) values ranging between 4 and 6]. Two successive assemblages are distinguished. The oldest one (R-I) is dominated by nassellarians, which includes mainly Stichomitra, Pseudodictyomitra and Rhopalosyringium genera. It is included within the upper part of foraminiferal Rotalipora cushmani Zone and lower part of Whiteinella archaeocretacea zone. In contrast, the youngest assemblage (R-II), which belongs to the upper part of the W. archaeocretacea zone and the earliest Turonian Watinoceras ammonite assemblage, is dominated by spumellarians and includes mainly Archaeocenosphaera, Cavaspongia, Pseudoeucyrtis and Pyramispongia genera. In addition, major and trace elements are analysed to test whether the geochemical record was synchronous to the biotic event or not. Thus, selected crossplots, Al2O3 vs. SiO2 and Al2O3 vs. TiO2, are used to evaluate the detrital input, and V/Cr vs. V/(V + Ni) and U/Th vs. V/(V + Ni) are used to evaluate the bottom redox conditions and the primary productivity within the Bahloul Formation. A strong Si/Al increase is marked in the lower part of the siliceous and organic-rich Bahloul Formation that could be explained by a local increase in upwelling-related biogenic SiO2 (silica-secreting organisms). Relative low abundance of terrigenous-related Ti/Al and K/Al ratios and enrichment of some productivity proxies such as Ba (organic matter related trace elements) suggests that the Bahloul was of relatively elevated primary productivity and minimal detrital input. Enrichments in redox-sensitive trace metals U and V in the Bahloul Formation deposits and redox indices, such as V/(V + Ni), U/Th and V/Cr, indicate that oxygen-restricted conditions prevailed during the late Cenomanian-earliest Turonian times and correlate well with relative abundances of some radiolarian and foraminiferal paleo-environmental indicators. In addition, indicators of detrital flux variations are used. Al2O3 shows a slight positive correlation with TiO2 and a less distinct correlation with SiO2.

AB  - Piston cores from Lake Steisslingen, a small hard water lake situated 20 kin west of Lake Constance and mainly supplied by submerged springs, reveal a record of the environmental history going back to 15 600 cal yr BP. From the Bolling to ca. 9800 cal yr BP the sediments are partly seasonally laminated. From then on up to the Middle Ages the lamination is mostly undisturbed providing a high resolution time scale by varve counting, a detailed pollen profile and 13 AMS C-14-analyses. All investigated sediment sections show evidence of exceptionally high sulphate concentrations in the lake water, which lead to the fixation of all reactive iron as pyrite. The high sulphur content can only be attributed to S-rich water supplied by the submerged springs, thus indicating the Miocene 'Obere Meeres Molasse' as the dominant aquifer. Since soil erosion is strongly reduced due to increased forest density in the Preboreal/Boreal, the submerged springs are the main nutrient source for the lake. Mixing or stable stratification of the waterbody mostly depends on nutrient availability and bioproductivity in the epilimnion. The controlling external factors are wind, and changes in water level and/or temperature. At the end of the Younger Dryas and during the Preboreal low water levels and precipitation rates are assumed. The water column mixing was regular, bioproductivity high, and high degradation activity of organic matter led to a redissolution of calcite. The hydrological separation of a northern shallow lake (Secried) probably fell into the period of this low lake level. Around 10 450-10 300 cal yr BP the lake level rose, but never again reached the former level. Between 10000 and 7200 cal yr BP, non-glacial varves are even found in shallower parts of the lake, indicating a stable anoxic monimolimnion with a rising chemocline. Bioproductivity was low. Wind protection provided by the now dense forestation and favourable climatic conditions (e.g. high summer temperatures and low winter temperatures) seem to be the responsible factors. Fluctuating human impact is identified from about 7400 cal yr BP until permanent settlement by the Alemanni about 1500 cal yr BP. Strong human influence is observed from 2000 cal yr BP onwards, when agricultural activity and clearing of the shoreline vegetation by man caused high soil erosion rates and thus eutrophication. At about 800 cal yr BP the recent hydrological conditions were established by implementing an artificial drain, thus lowering the lake level.

AB  - In Vertisols, organic matter contributes to soil colour by formation of organo-mineral complexes and affects morphological, physico-chemical, biological and biochemical properties. Turbation may affect the chemical and structural composition of the most stabilised fractions of soil organic matter (SOM), i.e., humic substances (HS). The objectives of this study were to: (1) characterise SOM in two Vertisols (V1 and V2) developed under Mediterranean climate in Italy, using some HS characteristics as indicators of SOM turnover in Vertisols, and (2) explore possible differences related to the pedomorphologic conditions of the area under which two soils have formed. SOM evolution along the soil profile was investigated by applying different techniques to chemically extracted HS. Humification parameters, thermal methods, such as Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermogravimetry (TG) together with isoelectric focusing (IEF) were used. The results showed a significant difference in the chemical characteristics of SOM in the considered Vertisols. A higher amount of total and humified carbon was found in pedon V2. In particular, the results indicated an accumulation of humified. compounds in deeper horizons of V2: this effect is particularly significant since both soils were under the same agricultural management and the same climatic conditions, but were different in physiografic position, slope and colour. The higher amount of not humified SOM in the pedon VI could explain the differences found in the shape and size of soil structure between the two pedons. The different SOM evolution occurring in the two Vertisols apparently influenced the structure and composition of the HS fraction. Thermal analysis and isoelectric focusing data provided evidence of a different level of stabilisation of HS from the two Vertisols. The HS from pedon V2 have a higher molecular weight structure, which would imply a higher level of SOM stabilisation. Conversely, HS in the pedon V1 appeared to be richer in aliphatic and phenolic structures, which may imply the presence of less stabilised HS fractions. These findings agree well with the different water dynamics occurring in the two sites, which confirmed the influence exerted by water on chemical and structural composition of HS and, consequently, their effect in determining Vertisols colour. In conclusion, thermal and isoelectric focusing characterisation of HS appear to shed some light in understanding the structural complexity of Vertisols. The results obtained in the present study, if confirmed on a larger number of Vertisols, suggest the possibility of using HS as indicators of SOM turnover in relation to pedomorphology, use and management of soils.

AB  - A question of economic, social, and land-use importance in the predominantly steep South Island high country tussock grasslands of New Zealand is whether these lands can be sustainably farmed by oversowing introduced grasses and legumes and using fertilisers. To help answer this question, we compared vegetation and soil chemical, biochemical, and biological properties on Brown soils (Dystrudepts) on adjacent land areas which have been differently managed since 1978. One area had never been fertilised or oversown. The other had been oversown with grasses and clovers and received about 1100 kg/ha of sulfur-superphosphate between 1979 and 1997.
   Oversowing and fertilising reduced the amount of bare ground and transformed the vegetation to a species composition dominated by the introduced adventives Anthoxanthum odoratum and Agrostis capillaris. Fertilising raised soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content, increased A-horizon thickness, and raised exchangeable cation values. All of the phosphorus (P) applied to the fertilised area was accounted for in the top 15 cm of soil, but has accumulated in the relatively unavailable organic form. Oversowing and fertilising significantly (P < 0.05) increased microbial biomass C, N, and P relative to values in unfertilised soils. The microbial biomass C: N and C: P ratios were significantly (P < 0.05) lower in fertilised soils. Fertilised soils had significantly more (P < 0.05) mineralised N than unfertilised soils.
   Populations of 5 groups of soil fauna (Scarabaeidae, nematodes, enchytraeids, rotifers, tardigrades) were higher in fertilised soils. Nematode species parasitic or pathogenic for clovers were present in greater numbers on fertilised soils. A combination of fertility decline (in particular, P immobilisation as organic P) and nematode damage may be the reason for the low clover cover on fertilised sites, and may explain the widely observed clover 'flush' and decline common to oversown high country.
   We conclude that there is no simple measure of 'soil quality' that can be used as a sustainability indicator in moist New Zealand high country. Nor can sustainability be judged purely on biological, biochemical, and chemical critieria. Although many of the erects associated with oversowing and fertilising, such as increased organic matter content of A horizons and increased biological activity, are positive, these erects must be balanced against the economic risk associated with being committed to a high-input farming system, the loss of low-producing but resilient native species, and increase of plant-pathogenic nematodes.

AB  - Alluvial fan sediments contain valuable information on environmental change and anthropogenic influences, and function as an archive of landscape development. The purpose of this paper is to describe the analysis of the sedimentary information from core samples taken from two alluvial fans in the Saskatchewan prairies. The analysis assessed grain size, organic matter content, and microfossil presence to identify periods of accumulation and stabilization. Parker, Beavers, and Product weathering indices were used to analyze the modern source soil samples and the borehole cores to determine weathering/leaching conditions. The bed-load transport sediments showed a higher leaching intensity whereas lower leaching was revealed for periods of stability, silt sheet flows, and sand sheet flows. The Beavers Index was not only a strong indicator of a bed-load transport layer, but also of calcium accumulation zones marking alluvial fan surface stability. The large Dolomite/Calcite ratio marking the calcium accumulation zones was used for correlation between the two alluvial fan sites on a regional scale. A comparison of the stratigraphy of the two alluvial fans documents that a relationship exists between agriculture and an increase in erosion.

AB  - Offshore drilling operations face technological and operational challenges combined with harsh environmental conditions. The well blowouts are the most feared offshore process operational accident. Many methodologies have been proposed to assess the blowout risk. Most of these studies consider the risk factors' independence and focus on a specific drilling life cycle stage. This study presents an integrated methodology that considers the interaction among the drilling risk factors and assesses the blowout risk throughout the deepwater drilling operation's lifecycle. This integrated methodology is developed based on the index-based risk evaluation system, which comprises hazard identification, interaction analysis, indices weights, and risk evaluation. The Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory method is used to identify and assess risk factors' interaction. The uncertainty associated with the data is addressed using the Z-numbers method. The risk indices are dynamic to capture the hazards during the lifecycle of the drilling operation. The application of the methodology is tested on a deepwater drilling operation. The application demonstrates the methodology's effectiveness in assessing and evaluating blowout risk during the drilling operation lifecycle.

AB  - Current ecological risk assessments of pesticides on pollinators have primarily considered only laboratory conditions. For the larvae of solitary bees, ingestion of provisions contaminated with pesticides may increase the mortality rate of the larvae, decrease the collection rate and the population of adult solitary bees in the next year from a demographic perspective. But there are limited studies on the effects of pesticides on the larvae of solitary bees. Therefore, understanding how pesticides influence the larvae of solitary bees should be considered an integral part of pesticide ecological risk assessment. This study presents a method to expose the larvae of solitary bee, Osmia excavata, to lethal or sublethal doses of pesticide, tracking larval weight gain, developmental duration, eclosion ability, and food consumption efficiency conversion of ingested food. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, the larvae of O. excavata were fed with provisions containing acute lethal and sublethal doses of chlorpyrifos. Then, the above indexes of the treated larvae were investigated. This technique helps to predict and mitigate the risk of pesticides to pollinators.

AB  - Stakeholders' understanding of water quality influences how they approach water policy problems and their support for potential solutions. This study explores how resource policy in the United States accounts for different water quality meanings held by recreational users. In-person surveys were conducted along the shoreline in Rhode Island (USA) to examine how recreational users make sense of coastal water quality. Findings indicate that recreational users' understanding of water quality is constructed from an array of environmental conditions (e.g., chl a, phosphates) and attitudinal factors (e.g., perceived problems associated with sewage, algae, or trash), and the meanings ascribed to water quality extend beyond the biophysical indicators typically employed by water resource managers. Potential management strategies based on these findings include expanding current definitions of water quality and monitoring a broader suite of factors, conducting research that captures nuanced meanings of water quality held by different users, and developing outreach programs that clarify the potential impacts of water quality components on human health and well-being.

AB  - Oil/chemical tanker ships carry a large volume of liquefied chemical cargoes in bulk condition. Chemical cargoes can be hazardous and most of them being flammable and/or toxic. It may pose acute dangers for human life and maritime environment. Risk assessment is of paramount importance to enhance operational safety and to protect environment for oil/chemical tanker ships. This paper aims at conducting an extensive risk analysis for oil/chemical tanker pollution due to leakage since the consequences can be fatal for human and marine environment. To accomplish this, fault tree analysis (FTA) is used. The failure occurrence probabilities of basic event (BE) of FT are calculated under fuzzy logic. The extended CREAM (Cognitive reliability and error analysis method) approach is used to determine human-oriented errors in FT since human error contributes the most to various types of maritime accidents. The outcomes of the paper can be helpful to minimize chemical leakage pollution risks and to improve operational safety in cargo loading/discharging process in oil/chemical tankers.

AB  - This paper proposes the indicator systems and integrated desirability framework for comprehensive evaluation towards the operating speeds of high-speed railway (HSR). Speed is a crucial piece in the characterization of the HSR system. The debate about what is the most appropriate operating speed continues. The established indicator systems and integrated desirability framework can comprehensively evaluate the HSR operating speeds from stand points of the economic efficiency, operational efficiency, track capacity, operational security, and environment impact. Moreover, the integrated desirability framework, which is a combination of entropy-analytical hierarchy procedure (EAHP) and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), can output some references for selecting the most suitable speed regimes of HSR. The application of the desirability framework to the case of China high-speed railway (CHSR) is demonstrated concretely. Based on the case study of CHSR, the comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of the indicator systems on HSR operating speeds is carried out. The case study shows that the proposed indicator systems and integrated desirability framework can be used to evaluate comprehensively the HSR operating speeds under various conditions.

AB  - Groundwater contamination by stray gas (mainly methane) in areas of shale-gas development has captured publics, political and scientific attention. However, the sources and potential mechanisms of groundwater contamination are still debated. Noble gases can provide useful information on fluid migration for discerning the scale, conditions, and physical mechanisms. In this study, details about analytical technology and theoretical approach of noble gases in tracing groundwater contaminations are presented. In addition, applications of noble-gases isotopes for determining contamination sources and potential pathways are explored and reviewed. Recent developments are discussed and highlighted with focusing on new utilities of noble-gas isotope parameters in evaluating groundwater contamination. Some usages of indicators (He-4/Ne-20, CH4/Ar-36, He-4/CH4, etc.) are discussed through specific research articles. And it is a new trend to make comprehensive use of multiple geochemical parameters to determine the occurrence, source, and process of methane pollution in groundwater.

AB  - Droughts continue to affect ecosystems, communities and entire economies. Agriculture bears much of the impact, and in many countries it is the most heavily affected sector. Over the past decades, efforts have been made to assess drought risk at different spatial scales. Here, we present for the first time an integrated assessment of drought risk for both irrigated and rainfed agricultural systems at the global scale. Composite hazard indicators were calculated for irrigated and rainfed systems separately using different drought indices based on historical climate conditions (1980-2016). Exposure was analyzed for irrigated and non-irrigated crops. Vulnerability was assessed through a socioecological-system (SES) perspective, using socioecological susceptibility and lack of coping-capacity indicators that were weighted by drought experts from around the world. The analysis shows that drought risk of rainfed and irrigated agricultural systems displays a heterogeneous pattern at the global level, with higher risk for southeastern Europe as well as northern and southern Africa. By providing information on the drivers and spatial patterns of drought risk in all dimensions of hazard, exposure and vulnerability, the presented analysis can support the identification of tailored measures to reduce drought risk and increase the resilience of agricultural systems.

AB  - Behavioural differences among social groups can arise from differing ecological conditions, genetic predispositions and/or social learning. In the past, social learning has typically been inferred as responsible for the spread of behaviour by the exclusion of ecological and genetic factors. This 'method of exclusion' was used to infer that 'sponging', a foraging behaviour involving tool use in the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) population in Shark Bay, Western Australia, was socially transmitted. However, previous studies were limited in that they never fully accounted for alternative factors, and that social learning, ecology and genetics are not mutually exclusive in causing behavioural variation. Here, we quantified the importance of social learning on the diffusion of sponging, for the first time explicitly accounting for ecological and genetic factors, using a multi-network version of 'network-based diffusion analysis. Our results provide compelling support for previous findings that sponging is vertically socially transmitted from mother to (primarily female) offspring. This research illustrates the utility of social network analysis in elucidating the explanatory mechanisms behind the transmission of behaviour in wild animal populations.

AB  - Fault diagnosis of rolling bearing has been research focus to improve the productivity and guarantee the operation security. In general, traditional approaches need prior knowledge of possible features and a mass of labeled data. Due to the complexity of working conditions, it costs a lot of time to label the monitoring data. In this paper, Categorical Adversarial Autoencoder (CatAAE) is proposed for unsupervised fault diagnosis of rolling bearings. The model trains an autoencoder through an adversarial training process and imposes a prior distribution on the latent coding space. Then a classifier tries to cluster the input examples by balancing mutual information between examples and their predicted categorical class distribution. The latent coding space and training process are presented to investigate the advantage of proposed model. Classic rotating machinery datasets have been employed to testify the effectiveness of the proposed diagnosis method. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieved satisfactory performance and high clustering indicators with strong robustness when environmental noise and motor load changed.

AB  - The present paper presents the evolution of dairy cows holdings dimensional structure during 2010-2016, based on the operational statistical information, also comparing the economic indicators of the farms of different sizes. Romania's agriculture is one of great diversity in terms of farm structure, production methods and technologies used. This diversity reflects climatic conditions, topography and the evolution of socio-economic environment. The results of the study indicate that total number of dairy cows increased by about 1% during the study period, while the number of cows' holdings decreased by 20.6%, demonstrating a higher concentration of the flocks. At structural level, most holdings are represented by 1-2 head households, and the farms with 100 heads are the fewest. Structural dynamics is positive, because the holdings with 1-2 heads decreased from 87.27% in 2010 to 83.72% in 2016, while farms with more than 100 heads increased from 0.04% to 0.07%. At the level of economic indicators, the farms with larger flocks get higher economic outcomes than the small ones, due to the possibility of using high-tech technologies, access to various support programs, stronger position on the market, and capitalization of economic results.

AB  - Environmental change can alter both species distribution range patterns at a regional scale and their feeding habits at a local scale. While several studies have highlighted the mechanisms driving such changes separately, little is known on their combined effect on the local communities. In this manuscript, we used both feeding and distributional traits of macro-benthic species and examined their combined response across an environmental gradient induced by an aquaculture unit. Our results mainly suggest that specialized predators with narrow geographic distributions and niches were more sensitive to environmental change than the less specialized groups. Moreover, under harsh environmental conditions, predatory species with a wide dispersion capacity can sustain viable populations through niche generalization. In contrast, in areas of low environmental disturbance, predatory species with a more restricted dispersal capability (i.e. some endemic species) can coexist via niche differentiation. In this context, our findings contribute towards a better understanding of benthic communities' functional response to environmental change and may be of use in environmental impact assessment.

AB  - We analyzed a large amount of high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data of dry-fallen intertidal flats on the German North Sea coast with respect to the imaging of sediments, macrophytes, and mussels. TerraSAR-X and Radarsat-2 images of four test areas acquired from 2008 to 2013 form the basis for the present investigation and are used to demonstrate that pairs of SAR images, if combined through basic algebraic operations, can already provide indicators for morphological changes and for bivalve (oyster and mussel) beds. Multi-temporal analyses of series of SAR images allow detecting bivalve beds, since the radar backscattering from those beds is generally high, whereas that from sediments may vary with imaging geometry and environmental conditions. Our results further show evidence that also single-acquisition, dual-polarization SAR imagery can be used in this respect. The polarization coefficient (i.e., the ratio of the difference and the sum of both co-polarizations) can be used to infer indicators for oyster and blue-mussel beds. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The seasonal succession of diatom species in the epipelon of shallow, mesotrophic pond OMU Pond I (Turkey) with special attention to diatoms (particularly Navicula) is described. The composition of epipelic algal assemblages changed over time in both higher taxonomic groupings and species representations. September month was characterised by a dominance of Navicula hungarica var. capitata. The occurrence of diatom species also correlated with water temperature. However, although the growth of some species was restricted to a particular month, other species or species complexes had more extended growth periods. Navicula cryptocephala and Amphora ovalis species have been selected to demonstrate variation in temporal distribution within species complexes.
   Using the epipelic diatoms as indicators of environmental conditions, OMU Pond I was characterised with regard to their water chemistry. Samples were collected, species richness and diversity (Shannon-Wiener, H) were measured monthly. The results of analysis have supported the results of the counting method. Multivariate analyses indicated that both the regional distribution and seasonal variation of benthic diatoms are mainly driven by nutrient concentration. Diatoms are predominantly affected by geochemical characteristics including temperature and dissolved oxygen levels.

AB  - Vulnerability is expected to differ based on climatic conditions as well as socio-economic attributes of farming households. In this regard, attention toward vulnerability assessments is increasing within policy-making processes, to assist in selecting suitable coping strategies and policies to reduce farmers' vulnerability. Through identifying the main vulnerability indicators from a sustainability perspective (including social, economic, and environmental dimensions) among wheat farmers, this study is seeking an inclusive conceptual framework to assess their vulnerability to both socio-economic and environmental changes. Taking the main elements (i.e., sensitivity, exposure and adaptive capacity) of vulnerability into account, this paper tried to develop an inclusive systemic framework to understand the most important indicators of vulnerability for wheat farmers at various spatial and temporal scales. It is supposed that the framework is a useful guide for policymakers in identifying the vulnerable groups of wheat farmers and zones so that they can decide about proper coping strategies to effectively deal with adverse effects of climate and undesired socioeconomic changes in the wheat farming system.

AB  - The environment of the northern taiga to tundra transition is highly sensitive to climate fluctuations. In this study from northeastern European Russia, stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios (C-13, O-18) in -cellulose of Sphagnum fuscum stems subsampled from hummocks and peat plateau profiles have been used as climate proxies. The entire isotope time series, dated by lead (Pb-210), caesium (Cs-137) and AMS-radiocarbon (C-14) dating, spans the past 2500 years. Plant macrofossil analyses were used as an aid in single species selection, but are also helpful in identifying past surface moisture conditions. The most significant relationships were found between the recent C-13 record and summer (July-August) temperatures (R-2 = 0.58, p < 0.01), and the recent O-18 record and winter (October-May) precipitation anomalies in the tundra region (R-2 = 0.36, p < 0.01). The study demonstrates that stable isotopes preserved in northern peat deposits are useful indicators for summer temperature and winter precipitation at decadal to millennial timescales.

AB  - Myofibroblast contraction is fundamental in the excessive tissue remodeling that is characteristic of fibrotic tissue contractures. Tissue remodeling during development of fibrosis leads to gradually increasing stiffness of the extracellular matrix. We propose that this increased stiffness positively feeds back on the contractile activities of myofibroblasts. We have previously shown that cycles of contraction directly correlate with periodic intracellular calcium oscillations in cultured myofibroblasts. We analyze cytosolic calcium dynamics using fluorescent calcium indicators to evaluate the possible impact of mechanical stress on myofibroblast contractile activity. To modulate extracellular mechanics, we seeded primary rat subcutaneous myofibroblasts on silicone substrates and into collagen gels of different elastic modulus. We modulated cell stress by cell growth on differently adhesive culture substrates, by restricting cell spreading area on micro-printed adhesive islands, and depolymerizing actin with Cytochalasin D. In general, calcium oscillation frequencies in myofibroblasts increased with increasing mechanical challenge. These results provide new insight on how changing mechanical conditions for myofibroblasts are encoded in calcium oscillations and possibly explain how reparative cells adapt their contractile behavior to the stresses occurring in normal and pathological tissue repair.

AB  - At public beaches, it is now common to mitigate the impact of water-borne pathogens by posting a swimmer's advisory when the concentration of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) exceeds an action threshold. Since culturing the bacteria delays public notification when dangerous conditions exist, regression models are sometimes used to predict the FIB concentration based on readily-available environmental measurements. It is hard to know which environmental parameters are relevant to predicting FIB concentration, and the parameters are usually correlated, which can hurt the predictive power of a regression model. Here the method of partial least squares (PLS) is introduced to automate the regression modeling process. Model selection is reduced to the process of setting a tuning parameter to control the decision threshold that separates predicted exceedances of the standard from predicted non-exceedances. The method is validated by application to four Great Lakes beaches during the summer of 2010. Performance of the PLS models compares favorably to that of the existing state-of-the-art regression models at these four sites. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Over the recent years, several research efforts investigated the impact of climate change on water resources for different regions of the world. The projection of future river flows is affected by different sources of uncertainty in the hydro-climatic modelling chain. One of the aims of the QBic(3) project (Quebec-Bavarian International Collaboration on Climate Change) is to assess the contribution to uncertainty of hydrological models by using an ensemble of hydrological models presenting a diversity of structural complexity (i.e., lumped, semi distributed and distributed models). The study investigates two humid, mid-latitude catchments with natural flow conditions; one located in Southern Quebec (Canada) and one in Southern Bavaria (Germany). Daily flow is simulated with four different hydrological models, forced by outputs from regional climate models driven by global climate models over a reference (1971-2000) and a future (2041-2070) period. The results show that, for our hydrological model ensemble, the choice of model strongly affects the climate change response of selected hydrological indicators, especially those related to low flows. Indicators related to high flows seem less sensitive on the choice of the hydrological model.

AB  - To assess the long-term anthropogenic load of the Bilina River (Czech Republic), the concentrations of heavy metals and specific organic compounds in different river ecosystem matrices (water, biofilms, and sediments) were determined. Although the current concentrations of pollutants in surface water are low, frequently below the limits of the quantitative analytical methods used, the river ecosystem is still heavily loaded by anthropogenic pollution, mainly from the chemical and mining industries. This was demonstrated by analyzing biofilms and sediments. These matrices are more accurate representatives of the actual situation in the river and do not depend on hydrological conditions or random variability in water quality. The results indicate that the middle and the lower parts of the river are heavily polluted by mercury, arsenic, vanadium, polychlorinated biphenyls, hexachlorobenzene, and dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane. As a tributary of the Elbe River, the Bilina River represents a significant risk for the development of quality in this major European river.

AB  - This paper discusses the development of an advanced iterative learning control (ILC) scheme for the filling of wet clutches. In the presented scheme, the appropriate actuator signal for a new clutch engagement is learned automatically based on the quality of previous engagements, such that time-consuming and cumbersome calibrations can be avoided. First, an ILC controller, which uses the position of the piston as control input, is developed and tested on a non-rotating clutch under well controlled conditions. Afterwards, a similar strategy is tested on a rotating set-up, where a pressure sensor is used as the input of the ILC controller. On a higher level, both the position and the pressure controller are extended with a second learning algorithm, that adapts the reference position/pressure to account for environmental changes which cannot be learned by the low-level ILC controller. It is shown that a strong reduction of the transmitted torque level as well as a significant shortening of the engagement time can be achieved with the developed strategy, compared to traditional time-invariant control strategies.

AB  - Activity of two enzymes of thiol-disulfide cell metabolism, lipoxygenase (LOX, EC 1.13.11.12) and disulfide-reductase (TPDO, EC 1.8.4.2) was studied in recombinant inbred lines of bread wheat ITMI. Their activity in the caryopsis may be connected with the gluten quality, one of the most important traits significant for breeding. The activity of lipoxygenase under favorable and droughty environmental conditions was shown to be associated with the quantitative trait locus (QTL) located on chromosome 4BS near the structural gene of a subunit of this enzyme. However, no QTL common to this enzyme and any characteristic of gluten quality have been found. Four loci responsible for the activity of disulfide reductase were identified on chromosomes 4A, 5D, 6A, and 7D. Previously, indicators of grain and flour properties, such as elasticity, flour strenght, and grain hardiness were mapped at the same loci. This indicates that the given enzyme participates in the formation of the protein complex upon maturation of wheat grain. The detected QTL can be involved in further genetic studies designed to establish the regularities of gluten formation.

AB  - We analyzed fisher interview data collected in the Raja Ampat archipelago of Eastern Indonesia to demonstrate a perceived decline in the abundance of living marine resources targeted by commercial and artisanal fisheries. The decline appeared ubiquitous among all tested species and a clear trend emerged in which older fishers recall greater past abundance than younger fishers. This provides evidence for the shifting baseline syndrome, a dangerous cognitive condition in which each generation of fishery stakeholders accepts a lower standard of resource abundance as normal. We used a fuzzy expert system to standardize and quantify the anecdotal evidence, and combine it with additional depletion indicators to produce a decadal time series of resource abundance from 1970 to present. Using governmental catch-per-unit-effort data from more recent years we hindcasted to establish an absolute scale with which to interpret the perceived decline. The interview information suggested that some exploited species may have declined by as much as an order of magnitude since 1970. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Models simulating gastric conditions of mammalian (eastern cottontail, Sylvilagus floridanus; short-tailed shrew Blarina brevicauda) and avian (American robin, Turdus migratorius) receptors were used to investigate the proportion of lead (Pb) mobilized into the digestive juices (the bioaccessible fraction) from soil, earthworms, and vegetation collected at a rifle and pistol (RP) range in eastern Ontario, Canada. Pb concentrations averaged 5044 mg kg(-1) in RP range surface soils, 727 mg kg-1 in earthworm tissue, and 2945 mg kg(-1) in unwashed vegetation. For mammalian gastric models, the biciaccessible fraction of Pb in soils was 66 +/- 22%, in earthworm tissue was 77 +/- 14%, and in unwashed vegetation was 50 +/- 37%. For the avian gastric model, the bioaccessible fraction of Pb in soil was 53 +/- 43% and in earthworm tissue was 73 +/- 13%. The incorporation of soil and food web intermediate bioaccessibility data into standard risk calculations resulted in predicted risk being reduced for all receptors. The inclusion of bioaccessibility during ecological risk assessment affords a more realistic estimate of contaminant exposure, and is a valuable tool for use in contaminated sites management.

AB  - The variability of species sensitivity distribution (SSD) due to contaminant bioavailability in soil was explored by using nickel as metal of concern. SSDs of toxicity test results of Avena sativa L. originating from different soils and expressed as total content and available (0.01 M CaCl(2)) extractable concentration were compared to SSDs for terrestrial plants derived from literature toxicity data. Also the 'free' nickel (Ni(2+)) concentration was calculated and compared. The results demonstrated that SSDs based on total nickel content highly depend on the experimental conditions set up for toxicity testing (i.e. selected soil and pH value) and thus on metal bioavailability in soil, resulting in an unacceptable uncertainty for ecological risk estimation. The use in SSDs of plant toxicity data expressed as 0.01 M CaCl(2) extractable metal strongly reduced the uncertainty in the SSD curve and thus can improve the ERA procedure remarkably by taking bioavailability into account.

AB  - A deterministic and dynamic model to simulate a cow-calf dual-purpose production system is described. The model was used to estimate effects on gross margin by changes in production levels generated by genetic improvement of biological traits involved. This model is composed of two major articulated drafts. The descriptive draft consists in structure characterization of a cow-calf dual-purpose production system, located at 'Lago de Maracaibo' basin, whose biological and economical variables constitute a referential theoretical scheme. The other one draft is related to several mathematical equations which allow the analysis and simulation phases. Model validation was realized with data supply by "Sistema de Registros e Informacion para la Ganaderfa de Doble Proposito", coming from Sucre municipality. The experimentation phase confirmed that, under the conditions that simulation was carried out, traits that would may integrate selection objective in dual purpose system are mature weight and milk yield. The definition of the breeding plan will be to determine the most appropriate indicators needed to generate the greatest impact on the previously mentioned traits.

AB  - Miscanthus x giganteus is a potential crop for biomass. In order to evaluate the tolerance of the species to low soil water availability, which in the Mediterranean environment occurs during the warm and dry summertime, a 2-year research experiment was carried out in the field on the eastern coast of Sicily (Southern Italy), comparing the physiological responses of the crop to three levels of ETm restoration (25%, 50% and 100%). All the studied plant indicators (pre-dawn and midday leaf water potential, leaf transpiration and stomatal conductance) were affected by soil water deficit according to a relationship described by an asymptotic curve. However, the pre-dawn leaf water potential was more strictly related to soil water content, among those tested, due to its relative independence from weather conditions and thus may represent a valid indicator of plant water status for irrigation scheduling. Indeed, the variations in leaf water potential, transpiration and stomatal conductance, measured during the warmest hours of the day, were related to the air vapour pressure deficit in the well-irrigated treatment (100% of ETm restoration).

AB  - The authors present extracts from the experimental results obtained from 493 roedeer from 3 forestry offices in the eastern part of Lower Saxony with a view to establishing future criteria for roedeer as a bioindicator within the environmental specimen bank. The organs examined included liver, kidneys, kidney fat and brain of animals that had been shot but had an undamaged abdomen. In the relevant organs 20 organic substances and 15 inorganic ones were examined of which 22 detectible environmental chemicals were evaluated via a PC with SPSS programme from different groups. Good accumulation properties, adequate size and a good distribution pattern point to the liver as target organ. There are definite variations in the constituent substances in the months from June to September, whereas from October to December the values level out to some extent. Regional conditions also affect the level of contamination. Animals from < 18 months from relatively narrowly circumscribed biotopes should be used for sample collection from October to December or in May for the environmental specimen bank. Individual preservation of samples is preferable to sample pooling.

AB  - The retailers within a supply chain management are the most important player as it has direct contact with the customers. Customers are the source of the money and information for the entire supply chain management. The equilibrium condition of the forward and backward supply chain is tight until it is reliable. But sometimes the retailers hide information from the manufacturer and this unreliability starts to propagate to the entire supply chain management. Blockchain technology is one of the secure decentralized systems to prevent unreliability. This study eliminates the unreliability of the system. A mathematical model is derived where the vendor-managed inventory policy is used by the single manufacturer to deal with multiple unreliable retailers. The entire process of manufacturing emits carbon. The carbon emission is controlled by the cap and trade policy and by paying the carbon tax. The results are found by the classical optimization technique and the numerical studies open up a way to the blockchain to deal with unreliable retailers. The decentralized system is a probable choice to prevent unreliability and thus the blockchain.

KW  - EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Background Brazil, as many other countries, have been heavily affected by COVID-19. This study aimed to analyze the impact of Primary health care and the family health strategy (FHS) coverage, the scores of the National Program for Improving Primary Care Access and Quality (PMAQ), and socioeconomic and social indicators in the number of COVID-19 cases in Brazilian largest cities.
   Methods This is an ecological study, carried out through the analysis of secondary data on the population of all Brazilian main cities, based on the analysis of a 26-week epidemiological epidemic week series by COVID-19. Statistical analysis was performed using Generalized Linear Models with an Autoregressive work correlation matrix.
   Results It was shown that greater PHC coverage and greater FHS coverage together with an above average PMAQ score are associated with slower dissemination and lower burden of COVID-19.
   Conclusion It is evident that cities with less social inequality and restrictions of social protection combined with social development have a milder pandemic scenario. It is necessary to act quickly on these conditions for COVID-19 dissemination by timely actions with high capillarity. Expanding access to PHC and social support strategies for the vulnerable are essential.

AB  - Diversity indices are commonly used to measure changes in marine benthic communities. However, the reliability (and therefore suitability) of these indices for detecting environmental change is often unclear because of small sample size and the inappropriate choice of communities for analysis. This study explored uncertainties in taxonomic density and two indices of community structure in our target region, Japan, and in two local areas within this region, and explored potential solutions. Our analysis of the Japanese regional dataset showed a decrease in family density and a dominance of a few species as sediment conditions become degraded. Local case studies showed that species density is affected by sediment degradation at sites where multiple communities coexist. However, two indices of community structure could become insensitive because of masking by community variability, and small sample size sometimes caused misleading or inaccurate estimates of these indices. We conclude that species density is a sensitive indicator of change in marine benthic communities, and emphasise that indices of community structure should only be used when the community structure of the target community is distinguishable from other coexisting communities and there is sufficient sample size.

AB  - The planetary gearbox is one of the critical mechanisms in the main transmission system of a rotorcraft. The condition monitoring techniques of a planetary gearbox, including incipient damage detection, fault diagnosis, degradation state recognition and fault prognosis, are the kernel compositions of any health management system. The traditional fault detection approaches based on vibration signals may be weakened by the multi-interface transmission paths and are strongly interrupted by the environment noise. Therefore, a novel fault indicator based on the analog tachometer signal is presented in this paper to detect the incipient faults in a planetary gearbox. A feature based on statistical parameters of the analog tachometer signal is extracted to detect incipient faults of a planetary gearbox. The simulation signals and experimental data sets are utilized to validate this feature. The results show that the proposed feature has better classification ability in fault detection compared with the traditional features based on vibration signals. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Saltmarshes are vulnerable morphological units, while their edges serve as an important indicator for regional sediment budget. The relation between three forms of saltmarsh edges and the vegetation characteristics was explored. Saltmarsh quadrats as well as their associated hydrodynamics were analyzed on the tidal flat of the Yancheng Nature Reserve in the middle Jiangsu coast, China. Results indicate that different marsh-edge morphologies were associated with different vegetation parameters, i.e., density, mean diameter, and dry biomass. These parameters showed different spatial variational trends and certain phase differences existed between these trends. However, the mean plant height presented a comparable spatial variational trend in different marsh-edge forms, indicating that the plant height was likely controlled by tidal range which was nearly the same in different sites. A transitional zone was defined between the smooth section and the cliff section, where the young seeding marsh showed a cyclic growth-erosion-regrowth behavior. Therefore, the hydrodynamic condition in this transitional area may be considered as a probe of the critical state between the cliff form and the smooth form.

AB  - This study evaluated seed rain in different forest formation soil uses in the Serra do Sudeste region, Pampa biome. Four area were selected: active restoration (Area 1), passive restoration (Area 2), eucalyptus commercial plantation (Area 3) and native forest (Area 4). Ten permanent collectors of 1 m(2) each were installed in each area, being suspended 1 meter above the soil surface. Collections were made monthly for twelve months in 2018. The analyzed variables were: the number of morphospecies, number of individuals, the indices of Margalef richness, Pielou evenness, Shannon diversity, Jaccard floristic similiarity, and possible correlations by detrended correspondence analysis (DCA). Total number of seeds sampled during the period was 239,988, distributed across 116 morphospecies. The area under active restoration (Area 1) did not differ statistically by the Kruskall-Wallis test (p < 0.05) of the native forest (Area 4) for the number of seeds. Area 1 presented a higher number of morphospecies and greater diversity of species, followed by Area 4. Seed rain can be a promising ecological indicator for the conditions of the present study.

AB  - Fenugreek is one of the oldest medicinal plants known by mankind. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of environmental conditions on the saponin contents of the plant. The amount of diosgenin in different samples of fenugreek was estimated by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC). The developed method was validated, in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines for precision, accuracy, and robustness. HPTLC was carried out using hexane-acetone (8: 2%, v/v) on 20 cm x 10 cm glass coated silica gel 60 F-254 plates. The developed plates were scanned and quantified densitometrically at lambda = 430 nm. Linear regression analysis revealed a good linear relationship between the area under the peak and the amount of diosgenin in the range of 50-400 ng per band. The amount of diosgenin which reflects the total saponin contents varied according to the country of origin. The sample obtained from Yemen showed the highest amount of diosgenin followed by the Saudi sample. Both locations represent areas with the highest altitude (Yemen) and the highest temperature (Saudi).

AB  - 2,3,5-Triphenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride (TPT) has been proposed as a redox indicator for determination of 1,1-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) which is used as a rocket propellant. It has been found that TPT is a sensitive chromogenic reagent due to its potentiometric and spectral characteristics. Products of the reaction between DMH and TPT have been characterized by mass spectrometry and EPR spectroscopy. In the EPR studies, C,N-diphenylnitrone (DPN) has been used as the radical trap and the obtained data indicate the radical nature of the reaction. The EPR spectrum of a mixture containing DPN and DMH has been recorded and calculated, whereas the spectrum of a three-component mixture containing DPN, TPT, and DMH is measured but it is complex for interpretation. A passive chemical dosimeter as a paper indicator strip with a polymer substrate impregnated with TPT has been manufactured and tested for continuous monitoring and determination of DMH in air in out-of-laboratory conditions at a concentration as low as 0.006 mg/m(3) (warehouse operation area) and 0.5 mg/m(3) (a warehouse box).

AB  - Fish stocking is a serious threat to originally fishless mountain lakes. We used non-chemical eradication methods (i.e. gillnetting and electrofishing) in four high mountain lakes in the Gran Paradiso National Park (Western Italian Alps) to eradicate alien brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis. Data of amphibians, macroinvertebrates, zooplankton, chlorophyll-a, nutrient concentrations, and water transparency were used as indicators of the recovery process. All treated lakes were returned to their original fishless condition in spite of their different sizes and habitat complexity, without permanent negative side-effects for native species. Several ecological indicators showed that many impacts of introduced fish can be reversed over a short time period following eradication. The present study adds to a still growing body of specialized literature on the recovery of habitats after the eradication of alien species and provides further evidence that physical eradication methods are effective and can be part of a more general strategy for the conservation of high mountain lake biota.

AB  - Evaluation, for example of chemicals, results mainly in a data matrix, where appropriate indicators are forming the columns and the chemicals the rows. Such a data matrix can be represented by a partial order and from a statistical point of view many insights are possible. However, if the data matrix should support decisions, then there appears the requirement to transform a poset until a linear order is obtained. This transformation often is performed just by calculating weighted sums of the (normalized) indicators, with weights, representing some knowledge beyond the data matrix. The question thus arises, i.e., as to how far weights can be determined as well- defined numbers? In the present study the condition of finding weights as unique numbers is declined. An alternative method is suggested and applied to a set of chemicals, where three indicators describe the environmental hazard of 13 substances. Consequences, concerning the environmental hazard of these chemicals are discussed. A result is that a systematic evolution of uncertainty about weights can be defined and that there appears to be a useful equation, which relates uncertainty (in weight determination) with the resulting ambiguity, measured as a posetic quantity, namely as number of resulting incomparabilities.

AB  - Deforestation causes the formation of forest fragments and edges, changing the biotic and abiotic conditions of a forest ecosystem. The edge effects in a forest can be assessed by soil indicators. The objective of this study was to evaluate the litter stock and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal community as edge effect indicators in a fragment of a seasonal forest in Vitoria da Conquista, Bahia state. Sampling was carried out at the end of each season. Four sampling ranges were established in the edge-interior direction (edge: 0-10 m, range 1: 40-50 m, range 2: 80-90 m, and interior: 400 m). The accumulated litter was collected four times using a wooden template (area 0.25 m(2)). The soil samples (layer 0-5 cm) for extracting the spores of mycorrhizal fungi were collected from the same litter collection areas. The edge effect in areas of a seasonal forest can change the litter stock, showing a mass reduction closer to the edge. The community of mycorrhizal fungi shows the occurrence of unique species in the gradient of edge-interior fragment.

AB  - A truthful snapshot of horse welfare conditions is a prerequisite for predicting the impact of any actions intended to improve the quality of life of horses. This can be achieved when welfare information, gathered by different assessors in diverse geographical areas, is valid, comparable and collected in a harmonized way. This paper aims to present the first outcomes of the Animal Welfare Indicators (AWIN) approach: the results of on-farm assessment and a reliable and harmonized data collection system. A total of 355 sport and leisure horses, stabled in 40 facilities in Italy and in Germany, were evaluated by three trained assessors using the AWIN welfare assessment protocol for horses. The AWINHorse app was used to collect, store and send data to a common server. Identified welfare issues were obesity, unsatisfactory box dimensions, long periods of confinement and lack of social interaction. The digitalized data collection was feasible in an on-farm environment, and our results suggest that this approach could prove useful in identifying the most relevant welfare issues of horses in Europe or worldwide.

AB  - In a case study of a Norwegian heavy-duty truck transport company, we analyzed data generated by the online fleet management system Dynafleet The objective was to find out what influenced fuel consumption. We used a set of driving indicators as explanatory variables: load weight, trailer type, route, brake horsepower, average speed, automatic gearshift use, cruise-control use, use of more than 90% of maximum torque, a dummy variable for seasonal variation, use of running idle, use of driving in highest gear, brake applications, number of stops and rolling without engine load. We found, via multivariate regression analysis and corresponding mean elasticity analysis, that with driving on narrow mountainous roads, variables associated with infrastructure and vehicle properties have a larger influence than driver-influenced variables do. However, we found that even under these challenging infrastructure cOnditions, driving behavior matters. Our findings and analysis could help transport companies decide how to use fleet management data to reduce fuel consumption by choosing the right vehicle for each transportation task and identifying environmentally and economically benign ways of driving.

AB  - Heterogeneous catalysis, flow chemistry, continuous processing, green solvents, catalyst immobilization and recycling are some of the most relevant, emerging key technologies to achieve green synthesis. However, a quantification of potential effects on a case to case level is required to provide a profound answer, whether they can lead to a superior process compared to the industrial standard. To do so, holistic environmental assessment approaches are very useful tools providing insights and decision support during the process development phase. Herein, novel heterogeneous nanoparticulate ruthenium catalysts immobilized on hyperbranched polystyrene (HPS) and nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT) were investigated with respect to their potential environmental impacts and improvements if utilized in an industrially highly relevant process, namely glucose hydrogenation to sorbitol. The results of a comparative Life Cycle Assessment of the alternative catalytic systems under consideration of RANEY (R) nickel as benchmark catalyst revealed that in particular Ru nanoparticles on porous HPS beads processed under flow-chemistry conditions have the potential to improve the greenness of the overall synthesis, but the concentration of glucose in the reaction mixture is in fact the most influential parameter.

AB  - Sheep breeds which are indigenous to arid and semi-arid regions are known for their ability to adapt to rustic environments, to climatic variations as well as to shortages in resources. Water scarcity, often combined with heat stress, is a common challenge facing these animals, causing physiological perturbations and affecting the animal's productivity. This review reports the effect of different forms of water stress on physiological indicators, blood parameters, thermoregulation and immunological status in sheep. Although the breed effect may be significant, the following are generally observed common responses: drop in feed intake and weight loss, increase in evaporative cooling through panting, production of a small volume of highly concentrated urine, haemoconcentration, high blood osmolality, and immunosuppression. Prolonged water shortage may affect lamb birth weight and survival, and lead to a decrease in milk production, especially in non-adapted breeds, which could lead to important economic losses, as reported in heat-stressed sheep husbandries. Novel stress alleviation approaches are also presented, such as vitamin C supplementation.

AB  - Combinations of multiple, related projects into interdependent programs are becoming common in the field of information technology. However, little work exists to study the impact of interdependence in the program environment to achieve collective success. Social interdependence theory provides a structure to examine whether collaborative efforts promote behaviors that result in higher levels of success. Using resource interdependence as an indicator of collaboration, a model of promotive behaviors is developed using the lens of social interdependence. Expectations are that resource interdependence conditions will promote more mutual support, effort, and communication. In turn, these behaviors will lead to an improvement in the business objectives and operational efficiency of the organization. A survey of program and project managers in information system vendors located in India support the model. The results provide support for the argument that programs are effective organization structures that capitalize on interdependencies and that the social interdependence theory provides a consistent model to explain the benefits of resource interdependence.

AB  - Diagnostic rock-magnetic characteristics of Miocene sequences from the western part of the Chinese Loess Plateau are used to confirm the eolian nature of sections the origin of which has been a matter of recent dispute (Alonso-Zarza et al., 2009, 2010; Guo et al. 2010). The key magnetic properties include (i) detailed correlation of both the orbitally timed and supra-orbital variations in magnetic properties between widely separated sections, (ii) the bi-modal distribution of magnetic properties with respect to particle size, reflecting in situ neoformation alongside the deposition of detrital minerals derived from the source areas, (iii) the consistent presence, in the clay fractions, of fine ferrimagnetic grains close to the superparamagnetic/stable single domain transition, all within the size range characteristic of those formed by weathering and pedogenesis under at least partially aerobic conditions, and (iv) absence of evidence for lacustrine indicators such as bacterial magnetosome assemblages, sub-oxic diagenesis or greigite formation.

AB  - The Pb mining and metallurgy activities in Adrianopolis (PR) caused impacts to the environment. Pb, Cu, Ni and Zn total contents (HF) and extracted with 0.5 mol L-1 HNO3 and some physical and chemical characteristics (fertility, field capacity and texture) were determined to assess the area soil quality, through the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The maximum Pb-HF and Pb-HNO3 contents were, respectively, 25,930 and 15,370 mg kg(-1). It were identified two environmental with high contamination risks: surface water by erosive process - soil 5, with higher total Pb content, associated to the site height and the area pronounced declivity; underground water by leaching - soil 3, with higher HNO3 Pb contents, associated with the proximity of the site to Ribeira River's. The soil 5 samples were grouped (PCA) due to the low fertility and clay content. In the other side, the soil 3 samples were grouped in response of your higher nutrients contents. Higher physical and chemical soil conditions allowed better plant growth, reducing the erosion and improving phytoextraction practices in the area.

AB  - We used standard mark-recapture techniques to investigate ecological characteristics of populations of Peromyscus leucopus (white-footed deermice) inhabiting two locations within a site contaminated by heavy metals, Tar Creek Superfund Site, and reference sites, Lake Carl Blackwell and Oologah Wildlife Management Area, in northeastern Oklahoma. Basic demographic parameters such as size of population, rate of survival, rate of recapture, mean minimum longevity, number of reproductively active females, reproductive success, and incidence of infestation by but flies (Cuterebra fontinella) were not significantly different between contaminated and reference sites. However, adult, non-reproductive P. leucopus inhabiting contaminated sites had, on average, a larger body mass than those front reference sites. Other indicators of overall individual health, dental condition and prevalence of botfly infestations were significantly different among populations. Instances of extensive mottling of the tipper and lower incisors, a reliable indicator of exposure to contamination by heavy metals, were only noted in individuals inhabiting contaminated sites. Unfortunately, no direct link between contamination and alterations to some population parameters could be established.

AB  - Cavitation in a kinetic pump reduces delivery head and efficiency of the pump. It also causes mechanical damage and an increase of vibrations and noise. Therefore, it is important to detect inception and development of a cavitation phenomenon in the pump. This article deals with signals of vibration and noise, which will be used for detection and monitoring of the cavitation in kinetic pumps, and also to prevent the effect of the cavitation in the pump and pumping system. When the cavitation is increasing, the flowing conditions are changing, which leads to an increase of vibrations of the pump and emitted noise in the surroundings. Because vibrations and noise are transferred from the pump through its casing, the signal is non-uniformly distorted due to transfer losses and structure of the casing surfaces. Noise and vibrations are increasing steadily, but in some specific frequency ranges the signal is more pronounced than in other parts of the spectrum. Experimental results have shown that vibration and noise in the audible spectrum can be successfully used for cavitation detection and its prevention.

AB  - Limestone aquifers in Southern Italy are often affected by bacterial contamination produced by pasture and agriculture. The main goals of this study were (1) to analyze the role of land use and environmental factors on microbial contamination and, (2) to identify, at field scale, the most suitable indicator of fecal pollution, by comparing fecal coliforms and fecal enterococci. Analyzing surface and spring water, it was noted that both fecal indicators showed a significant decrease during the period characterized by freezing and/or freeze-thaw intervals. The data analysis shows that fecal coliforms are characterized by a significant decrease in population (3 orders of magnitude, at least) during the freezing period, while fecal enterococci are temporarily inhibited. A taxonomic classification of fecal enterococci detected in spring water samples was performed by the API 20 Strep system and by sequencing of the ribosomal 16S DNA genes. The results showed that freezing conditions did not cause any significant change on the set of enterococcal species.

AB  - Growth of a range of 14 common food spoilage fungal species was evaluated along time as a function of both colony diameter and ergosterol content on malt extract agar. Growth was assessed under different environmental conditions following a central composite design. The suitability of using either linear, Gompertz's or Baranyi's models for primary modelling of the results was tested. Regarding colony diameters, using either linear or asymptotic Baranyi's function gave better estimations of growth rate and lag phase when no asymptotic trend was observed. When a decrease in growth rate was observed with time, standard Baranyi's model was chosen, although the search for new mechanistic models specific for moulds would probably improve the estimations. The use of Gompertz equation led, in general, to overestimated parameters. Ergosterol showed good performance as a fungal growth indicator for the whole range of species. Finally, significant correlation coefficients were found between ergosterol and colony diameters, suggesting that both parameters may be useful for primary modelling and thus for subsequent secondary modelling.

AB  - An attempt has been made in this paper to develop simple and easily understandable thermodynamic parameters related with the formation of activated complex and sorption process at equilibrium. The overall scenario represented by thermodynamic parameters was found to be a better indicator of understanding the process. Because it gives a general idea whether the process is exothermic or endothermic and also whether the process is stable or unstable. Sorption of 2,4-dichloro-phenoxy-acetic acid (2,4-D) and 2-chloro-4-ethyalamino-6-isopropylamino-s-traiazine (atrazine) on rubber granules followed second order reversible kinetic equation. 2,4-D-rubber granules system showed endothermic nature while atrazine-rubber granules showed exothermic nature. The values of E-a (associated with formation of activated species) were in the range of 3.49 kcal/mol and -2.40 kcal/mol for 2,4-D and atrazine, respectively. During equilibrium condition, both the systems showed negative Gibb's energy, which indicates stability of system. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ten hydroponically grown processing tomato cultivars were characterized, in order to identify the most appropriate cultivar for direct consumption and processing for NASA's Advanced Life Support (ALS) Program. Tomatoes were grown under semi-controlled environmental conditions at a Rutgers University greenhouse. The performance of each cultivar was evaluated using growth and yield indicators, physical/chemical indexes and sensory testing. Most quality indexes showed significant differences between cultivars, although their values remained in the typical ranges for processing tomatoes. The primary use of this information is to assist NASA in the decision on the most appropriate processing tomato cultivar for ALS use. The cultivar selected was SUN 6177, which ranked best in growth/yield and physical/chemical characteristics and in sensory attributes, and was second in consumer liking. The data generated in this study is of equal interest for comparing hydroponically grown fresh consumption and processing tomatoes, as well as for evaluating the effects of hydroponic growth on processing tomatoes.

AB  - Meadows are often managed by mowing to prevent succession and brushwood encroachment. This management practice is efficient to maintain plant diversity, but the effect on arthropod groups is less well known. We sampled spiders in the Grande Caricaie (Switzerland), a site of nature conservation importance, in two types of wet meadows, an unmanaged site and one 2-years-old mown conditions. Numbers of individuals for the most abundant families, diversity measures, and indicator taxa were compared among vegetation and treatment types. The results indicate that the less mobile spiders and species linked to litter or dead reeds, including rare species, are reduced by mowing. Present management consists in triennial mowing of 2-4 ha non-contiguous sectors. We investigate the conflict between the need to mow the meadows to maintain them, and the negative effect of mowing on spider communities. We therefore propose a new management scheme aimed at maintain the vegetation while lessening its negative effects on spider communities by providing refuges. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - 1 We tested the hypothesis that competitive hierarchies are invariant with respect to changing nutrient supply.
   2 The competitive performance of 26 shoreline plant species was determined experimentally as the relative ability to suppress the growth of a common indicator (phytometer) species, Penthorum sedoides. Each species was grown with the phytometer under each of two nutrient treatments created with different concentrations of a modified Hoagland's solution (n = 5 replicates per species/treatment), for two growing seasons.
   3 Although shifts in ranking of relative competitive performance were apparent between nutrient levels, competitive performance under high and low nutrient conditions was significantly correlated in both year 1 (r = 0.65) and year 2 (r = 0.76), when all species were considered.
   4 At the broad community scale, the outcome of competitive interactions thus appears to be relatively predictable and independent of the environment, and therefore provides a useful tool for exploring and understanding community pattern. These results cannot address questions related to the outcome of competitive interactions between similar species or the effects of fine-scale pattern.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyze the scientific environment in which research in Chemistry is carried out in Brazil. This was done scrutinizing the answers given by 168 researchers to a questionnaire distributed by the Brazilian Chemistry Society.
   The survey is intended to find how the research evaluated their activities. The results were aggregated by institutional ties, geographical regions and also by research fields in Chemistry.
   The researchers' evaluation of the positive and negative factors conditioning the scientific development of Chemistry was correlated to peer review trials on the distribution of fellowships and grants as well as on the assessment of graduate programmes.
   The linkages that emerged from that analysis, together with scientific indicators, enabled us to make proposals for strategies as well as recommendations to be considered by the government, enterprises and the academic community itself. In particular, these suggestions intend to overcome the constraints that pervade Brazilian Chemistry in general and thus improve its indigenous development. Presently, this is of key importance due to the relationship between chemical knowledge and intensive knowlelge technologies such as fine chemicals, biotechnology, new materials, among others.

AB  - Stomatal closure of plants in flooded soil, as determined by leaf gas exchange, has been recognized since 1973, and for simple hypoxia since 1975. At least 58 species have been shown to close stomata with hypoxic or flooded conditions. Various factors interact to affect the relationship between rhizosphere oxygen availability, as measured by soil oxygen diffusion rate (ODR), and degree of stomatal closure. These factors include root temperature, species, plant growth stage, plant mineral nutrition, and duration and nature of hypoxia. Soil water content, bulk density, and temperature also influence ODR. Abscisic acid accumulation in leaves appears to induce stomatal closure, as a stress response to root hypoxia, through its effect on potassium ion regulation of guard cell turgor. Stomatal closure generally persists well beyond actual soil hypoxia. Photosynthesis is reduced by root hypoxia, both by reduction of leaf gas exchange and by a lowering of the photosynthetic rate at a given leaf gas exchange rate. This phenomenon deserves greater attention in evaluating and modelling of crop response to soil hypoxia and as a sensitive indicator of severity of soil hypoxic stress.

AB  - A climate profile of Nothofagus cunninghamii (Hook.) Oerst. generated by the bioclimatic prediction system (BIOCLIM) is applied to fossil pollen data from eight sites at different altitudes in the Central Highlands of Victoria, Australia, to derive palaeoclimatic estimates.
   Altitude-related changes in the distribution of N. cunninghamii over time, with peak distribution between c. 4000-7000 years BP, earlier at the lower altitude sites and later at the higher altitude sites, suggest that summer temperatures were c. 2-degrees-C lower and winter temperatures slightly higher than present, and with higher effective precipitation.
   Some reassessment of the above estimates may prove necessary as the model does not take into account the effects of factors such as microtopography, short-term climatic conditions, fire, and the ecological and ecophysiological characteristics of a taxon.
   The results of Victoria are generally similar to BIOCLIM predictions obtained from northeastern Queensland and Tasmania, but differ from climate estimates derived from certain fossil pollen assemblages. Identification of pollen, particularly of key indicator taxa, to lower taxonomic levels may help resolve this disparity.

AB  - The blue mussel, Mytilus edulis is often used in marine biomonitoring programs. In this paper two different genotoxicity tests are considered as possible indicators for genotoxic pollution in the marine environment. One is focusing on micronucleus (MN) analysis in the blood cells of mussels and the other on the detection of DNA-adducts in the whole mussel tissue. The induction of MN has been studied in short-term laboratory experiments, during which mussels were exposed to standard genotoxins or waste water. Both genotoxicity tests have been applied in a study where mussels were exposed to contaminated sediment under controlled mesocosm conditions. These studies indicate that the MN mussel test may be used as a sensitive indicator of genotoxic pollution, although the inducibility of MN in the blood cells appears to be limited and to some extent seasonally dependent. The detection of DNA-adducts is still under development, but the preliminary result seems promising for its application as a biomonitoring tool.

AB  - Nitrate reductase (NR) activity in Pinus sylvestris needles showed seasonal fluctuations, being very low (0.1-0.5 nkat x kg-1 protein) during the summer months (June-August) and reaching its maxima (1-2 nkat) during the autumn and winter (September-March).  Winter time activity was highest in the youngest needles, and became lower the older the needles were, while there were no differences in summer time activity.  The NR activity of the needles was greatly dependent on frost and temperature conditions.  In 1987 the summer was cold and the frost melted from the ground slowly, which meant that foliar NR activity was low throughout the year, an imbalance which continued into 1988.  The growth of the pines also suffered a serious setback during this period and many trees died.  One reason for this could have been an imbalance in nitrogen metablism, due to the exceptionally low activity of at least one key enzyme of nitrogen metabolism, NR.

AB  - This paper demonstrates the advantages of three-dimensional (3D) analysis and visualization of weather radar data for studies on the inner structure of eruption columns and their 3D ash-fall distributions. The 3D data were collected using an operational X-band polarimetric radar located similar to 11 km from the Showa vent of Sakurajima, Japan. Three eruption cases were chosen for the analysis to study the effect of environmental wind conditions on the inner structure of an eruption column and horizontal ash-fall distributions at 1000 m height: a 3677-m-high eruption on 13 June 2013 under calm winds (Case 1), a 3982-m-high eruption on 7 October 2013 under strong winds (Case 2), and a 4520-m-high eruption on 18 August 2013 under moderate winds (Case 3). The Analytical Tools for Three-dimensional Weather Radar Data (ANT3D) package was developed and used for the construction of 3D constant altitude plan position indicator (3D CAPP1) data from eruption columns. The quantitative ash-fall analyses of 3D CAPPI data revealed that the total ash-fall amounts of the Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3 eruptions were 6.24 x 10(7), 9.99 x 10(7), and 6.71 x 10(7) kg, respectively, and the total ash-fall areas at the 1000-m height were 29.7, 151.3, and 107.7 km(2), respectively. It was shown that the area of the maximum ash-fall amount at the 1000-m height depends on the environmental conditions. The accumulated ash-fall distribution area was limited to over and around the vent in the Case 1 eruption, whereas the ash distribution pattern was elongated to the downwind direction and multiple ash concentration maxima were formed in the Case 2 eruption probably due to the multiple eruptions. The accumulated ash-fall distribution was also elongated to the down wind direction in the Case 3 eruption but a single maximum concentration which was larger than that in the Case 2 eruption was found inland of Sakurajima. The 3D CAPPI data were visualized using techniques such as surface rendering, volume rendering, bird's eye viewing, and cross-sectional analysis. The 3D visualizations suggest that vertical size-sorting and aggregation occurred in the buoyancy-driven regions of the eruption columns in all three cases. The results of this study will contribute to the understanding of volcanic eruption column dynamics and horizontal ash-fall transportation. <b>(C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Planned forest management is carried out based on the forest management planning (PUL) operations prepared for a 10-year economic period. The economic expertise may omit a detailed organizational analysis of the company, as well as indications regarding the search for strategic solutions. The following study aims to present a method for analysing the economic consequences of forest management activities by the forest district in the context of selected forest districts. A new element, in relation to the content of the forest management plan, is the inclusion in the economic expertise (EEN) of the economic analysis of the forest district in the context of other forest districts (benchmarking). Due to the fact that economic data are sensitive data, information about the name of the forest district under analysis and comparator districts are not given in the publication. The most important management and economic indicators for the forest district should be presented against the background of the results of similar and extreme units in the Regional Directorate of the State Forests (RDSF) in the relation to the district inspected. It was assumed that the forest district, for which EEN will be developed, will be compared with the four forest districts of RDSF. Data and the scope of the EEN must provide the possibility of its updating in any period of validity of the PUL, especially in situations when phenomena occur that fundamentally change the planned scope, time, place and size of economic tasks. The forest district, analysed in the context of comparison units, should pay special attention to the proportions between the costs of the core activity, and thus the main part of the activity, and the administrative costs. Analysing the economic efficiency of forest management, apart from the quantitative dimension of obtaining timber, it is necessary to pay attention to the value dimension. Costs incurred by the superintendences for employment of employees constitute the main group of administrative costs. It should be incur in mind that the structure of costs and revenues in the superintendence depends largely on natural conditions. Irrespective of the specific character of the forest district, the main revenue group is revenue from the sales title acquired in the forest district. In turn, a significant group of costs are employment costs of employees and other administrative costs. Revenues do not depend only on the quantity of timber harvested and sold, but also on its quality and species. Administrative costs should be limited by adjusting them to tasks in the field of forest management, sales of timber and local specificity of the unit. The costs of forest management depend mainly on the conditions under which forest management is carried out.

AB  - Many coastal states of the United States restrict harvest of shellfish from select areas based on some environmental trigger. Such areas are classified as being conditionally approved. In Maryland, the trigger is an inch or more of rainfall that has fallen in the last 24 h. This study used 11 years of monitoring data to test the relationship between daily rainfall totals and densities of fecal indicators in Maryland shellfish harvest waters. Precipitation and fecal coliform (FC) water monitoring data from 2004 to 2014 were matched by date and watershed. The influence of antecedent rainfall conditions (i.e. rainfall in the preceding days or weeks) and the distance of each monitoring station to land were compared to the percent of samples exceeding the FDA criterion for managing shellfish harvest areas. Sample stations beyond 1000m from land had FC densities consistently below the FDA criterion and were excluded from further analysis. Rainfall events greater than an inch tended to result in significantly elevated FC for the following two days, followed by lower levels thereafter. The total amount of rain in the last three weeks was positively related to the proportion of samples with FC greater than the FDA criterion. Bay-wide, the percent of samples exceeding the FDA criterion rose from seven percent for rainfall less than an inch to 37% following one or more inches of rain. Watersheds were classified based on the percent of FC densities over the criterion when rainfall was an inch or more, with 41 of 81 watersheds showing FC responses indicative of potential conditionally approved areas, those shellfish growing areas where the one inch precipitation trigger may be applied. These areas largely overlapped the current conditionally approved areas defined by Maryland. The percent of open water, wetlands, and poorly drained soils explained a significant amount of the variability (R-2 = 0.72) in the difference in percent of samples exceeding the FDA criterion when rainfall was greater than an inch and when it was less than an inch. Logistic regression analysis showed that the current trigger of one inch of rain in 24 h is predictive of FC densities over the FDA criterion, though the appropriate threshold will most likely depend on how far the particular shellfish growing area is from land and antecedent rain conditions. In watersheds with relatively high percentages of open water to total watershed size, higher rainfall thresholds might be appropriate. The approach taken in this study could be applied to individual stations and sub-watersheds, potentially allowing the reclassification of some shellfish harvest areas. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper reports a detailed study of the calcrete and silcrete proffies in the Miocene detrital deposits in the western area of Madrid, at the boundary of two main sedimentary units. The aims of this work were to better understand the pedogenic and diagenetic environments in which these profiles formed and to determine the cause(s) of their enrichment in uranium. Calcrete and silcrete duricrusts are characteristic features of closed continental basins in semiarid climates; this paper discusses the significance of duricrusts as indicators of important change in such basins.
   The detailed macromorphological, micromorphological, and geochemical study of three duricrust profiles revealed the sequence of pedogenic, vadose, and groundwater processes responsible for their formation. During the rust stage of their development, carbonate laminae formed a white "grill-like" structure within the detrital parent materials. The microstructure and macrostructure of the carbonate, which includes alveolar septal structures and needle-fiber calcite, indicates the important role of roots and their associated microorganisms in calcrete formation. Early silicification occurred in the pedogenic-vadose environment affecting the detrital parent material, roots, and calcretes, forming an early silcrete defined by opaline glaebules and silica rhizoliths. The detailed preservation of the cells in the silicified roots denotes the early replacement of root organic matter. The green or green-yellowish fluorescence of the silicified root structures under short-wavelength UV shows their preferential enrichment in uranium. Calcitization and silicification coexisted in the pedogenic vadose environment, leading to several reversible replacements of calcite and silica. Later, the rise of the water table promoted silicification under phreatic conditions, as indicated by the good preservation of the texture of the detrital host rocks and calcretes. Other silcrete textures, such as ovoidal opaline accumulations, intraclasts produced by autobrecchification, and vadose silica cements, indicate later vadose environments, and consequently variations in the water table.
   The geochemical features of the calcretes and silcretes (major, minor, and rare earth elements) were inherited from their parent materials. The rare-earth-element patterns of some silcretes show them to have a positive Ce anomaly, suggesting that oxidizing conditions reigned during their formation. The good correlation between silica and uranium suggests that the silica phases acquired uranium through the direct silicification of roots that had fixed uranium from organic matter.
   This study shows that cakrete-silcrete duricrusts provide detailed information regarding the processes occurring in semiarid continental basins. In the studied basin, roots played a key role in both the development of the duricrust profiles and their enrichment in uranium. These duricrusts provide important information for understanding the overall stratigraphy of the studied basin and its large-scale sequential evolution.

AB  - The recent development of technologies for recycling carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRPs) leads to the need to evaluate the mechanical response of recycled carbon fibres. As these fibres are likely to be degraded during the recycling treatment, it is very important to determine their tensile residual properties so as to evaluate their ability as reinforcement for new composite materials. Carbon fibres reclaimed by a steam-thermal treatment applied to degrade the epoxy resin matrix of a CFRP are here analysed. Two conditions were chosen so as to reach two degradation efficiency levels of the steam thermolysis. Several carbon fibre samples were selected for mechanical testing carried out either on single filaments using single fibre tensile tests or on fibre tows using bundle tensile tests. It is shown that the single fibre tensile test leads to a wide variability of statistical parameters derived from the analysis. Bundle tensile tests results were able to indicate that fibre strength of recycled carbon fibre is similar to corresponding as-received carbon fibres thanks to a statistically relevant database. Wide number of tested filaments enabled indeed to obtain low scatters.

AB  - It was shown that the contents of Ni, Mo, and Co in the siliceous clay black shale rocks of the normal sections of the Bazhenov Formation are several times higher than the global mean contents of these elements in black shales. These rocks have the highest contents of pyrite and organic carbon and show evidence for strongly reducing formation conditions at the slowest background rate of sedimentation of their material. A transition from the siliceous clay rocks to the mudstones of normal section, which are considered as turbidites, and further to the mudstones and clayey silt rocks of the so-called anomalous sections (deposits of submarine deltas and canyons) is accompanied by sequential depletion in pyrite and organic carbon, a decrease in indicators of the reduction level of the sedimentation environment, and an increase in sedimentation rate and clay material content. Simultaneously, the contents of the elements of interest decreases in the sequence Mo > Ni > Co. In the rocks of anomalous sections, the contents of these elements decrease to the level of their mean abundances in clays.

AB  - Long-term settlement magnitude is influenced by changes in external and internal factors that control the microbiological activity in the landfill waste body. To improve the understanding of settlement phenomena, it is instructive to study lysimeters filled with MSW. This paper aims to understand the settlement behavior of MSW by correlating internal and external factors that influence waste biodegradation in a lysimeter. Thus, a lysimeter was built, instrumented and filled with MSW from the city of Campina Grande, the state of Paraiba, Brazil. Physicochemical analysis of the waste (from three levels of depth of the lysimeter) was carried out along with MSW settlement measurements. Statistical tools such as descriptive analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) were also performed. The settlement/compression, coefficient of variation and PCA results indicated the most intense rate of biodegradation in the top layer. The PCA results of intermediate and bottom levels presented fewer physicochemical and meteorological variables correlated with compression data in contrast with the top layer. It is possible to conclude that environmental conditions may influence internal indicators of MSW biodegradation, such as the settlement.

AB  - The purpose of this study is the examination of the concept of 'Quality of Life' as well as a thorough analysis of the relevant approaches for evaluation in an urban environment. It is a complex approach of the quality of life (Quality of Life) that is pursued, as it is combined with multi-criteria decision-making methods, for a full investigation of the urban lifestyle in the urban area of Thessaloniki. From the great variety of multi-criteria methods, the Analytical Hierarchy Process was chosen, which can easily be applied nowadays, as an indispensable tool in the decision making process. The model of Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) is an effective way for an interactive exploration of decision-making strategies, with citizen participation, attempting to classify the aspects of quality of life. An integrated approach is proposed, combining the two approaches into a single model, able to be implemented as a planning tool to capture the conditions of living and the degree of residents' prosperity, using both objective indicators and subjective criteria.

AB  - This study presents a comparative analysis between jatropha seed production systems to generate bioelectricity versus production of biodiesel under current and optimised conditions. An LCA (life cycle assessment) has been developed, comprising both upstream and downstream processes, encompassing the farming, collection, fuel processing and usage phases. The following energy and environmental indicators were assessed: fossil depletion, GWP (global warming potential), TAP (terrestrial acidification potential), and PMF (particulate matter formation).
   The rural electrification based on the JCO (latropha crude oil) system is more environmentally friendly compared to generation of biodiesel, in terms of TAP and PMF indicators. Under current practices, two out of the four evaluated indicators score positive benefits, when compared to the generation of marginal diesel-based electricity. The optimisation of the expelling pressing process and the power generation engine could bring further improvements in terms of fossil depletion, GWP and PMF indicators. The biodiesel route, on the other hand, presents a limited local environmental performance, showing only gains in terms of fossil depletion and GWP. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Dinoflagellate cysts acquired from sediment cores were analyzed in order to reconstruct historical nutrient levels in Gamak Bay, Korea and Ariake Bay, Japan. Dinoflagellate cyst assemblages in Gamak Bay were characterized by high proportions of heterotrophic cysts such as Brigantedinium spp., Protoperidinium americanum and Polykrikos cysts, which suggested that nutrients levels may have already been high before 1970s, and then increased further to the hypertrophic conditions of the 1990s. In contrast, dinoflagellate cyst assemblages in Ariake Bay were characterized by high relative abundances of Lingulodinium machaerophorum and Spiniferites spp., which suggested that nutrient levels in Ariake Bay had increased gradually since the mid 1960s, and may have been significantly enhanced by the mid 1980s. Dinoflagellate cyst assemblages reflecting environmental changes in the two bays are contrasting, perhaps due to different nutrient enrichment mechanisms. This suggests that the indicators of nutrient levels encoded in dinoflagellate cyst assemblages may exhibit site-specific information. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Toxicity of naphthalene was carried out on Metapenaeus affinis (H. Milne Edward, 1837) to investigate its effects on growth, metabolic index and biochemical constituents. Growth rate in terms of weight gain was 32.13% in control, 12.12% in 0.125 ppm and only 5.22% in 0.25 ppm. Metabolic index assessed in terms of oxygen consumption showed a reduction in respiratory rate up to 44.4% in prawns exposed to naphthalene. Activity increased initially but reduced subsequently. Protein content and organic carbon of the body tissue of juveniles showed reduction on exposure to naphthalene. Inhibitory effect was dose dependent and duration of exposure. However, the lipid content increased after exposure to naphthalene. Changes in the growth and respiratory rate and other biochemical constituents resulting from exposure to naphthalene indicate some adaptive response and recovery during detoxification in the prawns exposed to pollutant. Study revealed that the physiological and biochemical parameters could be used as indicator of stress condition in aquatic organisms and the use of naphthalene should be regulated because of its toxic nature.

AB  - Wastewater treatment facilities have become sin quo non in ensuring the discharges of high quality wastewater effluents into receiving water bodies and consequence, a healthier environment. Due to massive worldwide increases in human population, water has been predicted to become one of the scarcest resources in the 21(st) century, and despite large advances in water and wastewater treatments, waterborne diseases still pose a major threat to public health worldwide. Several questions have been raised on the capacity of current wastewater treatment regimes to remove pathogens from wastewater with many waterborne diseases linked to supposedly treated water supplies. One of the major gaps in the knowledge of pathogenic microorganisms in wastewater is the lack of a thorough understanding of the survival and persistence of the different microbial types in different conditions and environments. This therefore brings to the fore the need for a thorough research into the movement and behavior of these microorganisms in wastewaters. In this review paper we give an overview of wastewater treatment practices with particular emphasis on the removal of microbial pathogens.

AB  - Pathogens of the Straminipile genus Phytophthora cause significant disease losses to global cocoa production. P. megakarya causes significant pod rot and losses due to canker in West Africa, whereas R capsici and R citrophthora cause pod rots in Central and South America. The global and highly damaging P. palmvora attacks all parts of the cocoa tree at all stages of the growing cycle. This pathogen causes 20 to 30% pod losses through black pod rot, and kills up to 10% of trees annually through stem cankers. P. palmivora has a complex disease cycle involving several sources of primary inoculum and several modes of dissemination of secondary inoculum. This results in explosive epidemics during favorable environmental conditions. The spread of regional pathogens must be prevented by effective quarantine barriers. Resistance to all these Phytophthora species is typically low in commercial cocoa genotypes. Disease losses can be reduced through integrated management practices that include pruning and shade management, leaf mulching, regular and complete harvesting, sanitation and pod case disposal, appropriate fertilizer application and targeted fungicide use. Packaging these options to improve uptake by smallholders presents a major challenge for the industry.

AB  - The inoculation and acclimatization of activated sludge (AS) is one of the vital components to provide preferably suspended aerobic growth and desired treatment mechanism for a treated wastewater using MBR. The performance of a floating media biofilter-submerged membrane bioreactor (FMB-SMBR) and a submerged membrane adsorption bioreactor (SMABR) were investigated during the acclimatization. It was observed that the duration of sludge from wastewater treatment plant in Sydney acclimated to synthetic wastewater was about 25 days for FMB-SMBR system, while SMABR took around 12 days to reach the stabilization. The acclimatized FMB-SMBR (without membrane operation) resulted in significant high dissolved organic removal of 94%. The acclimatized FMBR-SMBR system showed more than 20% TOC removal efficiency than that of the acclimatized SMABR system. Meanwhile, the results of oxygen uptake rate (OUR) measurement suggested that OUR is an accurate and simple indicator to biological process acclimatization. Membrane fouling study of the FMB-CFMF system was also carried out. The results indicate that the acclimatized FMB could be used as a pretreatment unit prior to SMBR in order to minimize membrane fouling when the FMB-SMBR system operates under sub-critical flux condition.

AB  - A flow injection-catalytic spectrophotometric method using a serial flow cell was proposed for the successive determination of trace amounts of copper and iron. This method is based on the oxidation coupling of p-anisidine with N,N-dimethylaniline in the presence of hydrogen peroxide to form a dye, which has an absorption maximum at 740 nm. In this indicator reaction, ligands such as 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) and diphosphate were achieved to improve the sensitivity and selectivity. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the determinable ranges were 0.05 - 5 ppb for copper and 0.5 - 100 ppb for iron, respectively. The RSDs (n = 10) were 0.78% for 0.5 ppb copper(II) and 0.5% for 200 ppb iron(III). The sample throughput was 30 h(-1). The present flow-injection method was applied to the determination of copper and iron in standard river water, tap water, and other natural water samples, and also to the analysis of labile and inert complexes in synthesized samples containing humic acid with copper(II) or iron(III).

AB  - The use of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria for improved food fermentation processes seems promising. However, lack of fundamental knowledge about the functionality of bacteriocin-producing strains under food fermentation conditions hampers their industrial use. Predictive microbiology or a mathematical estimation of microbial behavior in food ecosystems may help to overcome this problem. In this study, a combined model was developed that was able to estimate, from a given initial situation of temperature, pH, and nutrient availability, the growth and self-inhibition dynamics of a bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus sakei CTC 494 culture in (modified) MRS broth. Moreover, the drop in pH induced by lactic acid production and the bacteriocin activity toward Listeria as an indicator organism were modeled. Self-inhibition was due to the depletion of nutrients as well as to the production of lactic acid. Lactic acid production resulted in a pH drop, an accumulation of toxic undissociated lactic acid molecules, and a shift in the dissociation degree of the growth-inhibiting buffer components. The model was validated experimentally.

AB  - Female penduline tits preferably choose males with relatively bigger nests. Nest size is a reliable indicator of thermal nest insulation capacity and hence nest quality. In this study we investigate possible benefits for females choosing larger nests. Possible benefits of choosing well insulated nests could be a) increased time-off the eggs, i.e., more time for food gathering and activities for self maintenance, and b) increased hatching success due to maintenance of a stable thermal environment. Field observations and results from aviary experiments revealed that females adjust their attentive period according to ambient temperature, whereby time-off increases with higher ambient temperature. Data corrected for ambient temperature and clutch size demonstrated that lime-off during incubation is positively correlated with nest size. However, body condition of incubating females did not increase with time-off Despite increased time-off hatching success is higher in larger nests. Thus, female mate choice for larger nest size may evolve from decreased incubation requirements with no loss in hatching success.

AB  - The value of the milk of the European Holstein cows kept under the conditions of the modern dairy complex with the loose systems in the adaptation period has been reported taking into consideration the comprehensive FAO/WHO requirements. A complete range and a rather high concentration of the amino acids in all the milk samples are revealed. Among the essential amino acids, the highest amounts of leucine (LEU), phenylalanine + tyrosine (PHE + TYR), and lysine (LYS) and the lowest amounts of tryptophan (TRP), methionine + cysteine (MET + CYS), and histidine (HIS) are contained in the proteins, despite the animal genotype. The lowest tryptophan (TRP) concentration is recorded in the Holland cow milk samples. With respect to the non-essential amino acids, the glutamic acid + glutamine (Glu+GLN) and arginine (Arg) were found in the high concentrations, while glycine (Gly) and alanine (Ala) were at the lowest concentrations. The total non-essential amino acid concentration in the milk samples (58.6-58.9 %) was significantly higher, than that for the essential amino acids (41.1-41.4 %). Therefore, the amino-acid index comprised only 0.69-071. The measurements of the biological value of the analyzed milk samples with the use of the DIAAS method (amino acid score of the essential amino acids with taking into consideration their absorption) can prove that the total digestible amino acid set number is higher than the number in the ideal protein for the entire breed and its genotypes. However, the amino acid score of certain amino acids varied in a rather wide range of 56 % for tryptophan (TRP) in the samples of the Holland cow milk to 190 % for phenylalanine + tyrosine (PHE + TYR) in the samples of the German cow milk, which can indicate their imbalance. The limiting amino acid in the analyzed milk was tryptophan, since its DIAAS indicator was in the range of 56 to 86 %. This is exactly tryptophan, which determines the level of the milk essential amino acids in the analyzed population. In addition, this indicator is lower in the milk samples taken from the Holland cows, while it is expressed at the highest level in the Hungarian cows. Therefore, the biological value of the Holstein cow milk proteins is caused by the animal genotype. However, the produced cow milk, which includes the complete amino acids number set present in high summarized concentration, is characterized by the low biological value, because of the tryptophan limiting amino acid, in case of keeping the high-performance animals fed with the imbalanced diets under the conditions of the modern dairy complex with the loose systems.

AB  - The use of municipal wastewater in agriculture requires a careful monitoring of a range of hygiene parameters. Yearly hygienic impact assessments on soil and fruit were made between 2000 and 2006 in an olive (Olea europaea L.) grove established near a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Southern Italy (Ferrandina-Basilicata region, 40 degrees 29' N, 16 degrees 28' E). The experimental grove was managed in two plots. The first plot, non-tilled, was drip irrigated daily with reclaimed wastewater. The second plot was unirrigated (i.e. rainfed) and subject to conventional management for the region. Samples of wetted soil from different depths and of treated wastewater were analysed for Escherichia coli, enterococci, sulphite-reducing Clostridium spores and Salmonella spp. Fruits were collected both from the canopy and from nets spread on the ground and analysed for faecal contamination. The average annual quantity of wastewater distributed was 293 mm. E. coli concentration in the wastewater varied considerably, being frequently above the stringent Italian mandatory limit of 10 CFU 100 mL(-1) and also the WHO limit of 1000 MPN 100 mL(-1). Salmonella was never detected in the wastewater, the soil or on the fruit samples. Slight increases in the other bacteria were observed in the wastewater-irrigated soil during the irrigation season and especially in the top 10 cm. Soil resilience and bacterial mortality/inactivation probably explains the seasonal decrease of soil bacteria content over the 7 years of the study. Because of their high resistance to disinfection treatments and to environmental conditions, the spores of the sulphite-reducing bacterium Clostridium could be useful as an indicator of contamination in future guidelines that might be enacted for the use of wastewater in agriculture. No significant microbial contamination was recorded on fruit harvested directly from the canopy of the wastewater-irrigated trees. Contaminations on fruits sampled from the ground in the wastewater-irrigated plot were always low and usually similar to, or lower than those observed on drupes collected from the rainfed plot. In the rainfed plot, the recorded occasional contaminations were probably due to a number of factors, such as grazing of farm stock, presence of wild animals and surface water runoff from adjacent agricultural areas. This work confirms that, under suitable conditions, low-quality wastewater can be useful as an additional water resource for olive irrigation in water-scarce Mediterranean environments.

AB  - Visual methods are commonly used to estimate physiological maturity (PM) in sunflower crops. These methods, while simple and less laborious than following grain dry weight dynamics, are subjective and results can be affected by environmental conditions. The objective of the present work was to study the relationship between the dynamics of dry matter and water concentration (WC) of sunflower fruits, with the aim of identifying the timing of physiological maturity on the basis of fruit WC. The effects of brief periods of high temperature stress (lasting 4 or 6 days) during grain-filling were also explored. Eight different sunflower genotypes (inbred lines and hybrids) were studied in four separate experiments conducted under different growth conditions (greenhouse and field) and contrasting dates of sowing (autumn, spring and summer), generating a broad range of grain-filling durations (28-41 days) and final fruit weight (30-105 mg fruit(-1)). In these experiments the evolution of fruit fresh and dry weights were followed in fruit from the peripheral and intermediate positions on the capitulum from anthesis to harvest maturity. Tri-linear functions were fitted to the relative (to final) fruit dry weight (RFDW) to fruit WC relationships (R-2 from 0.94 to 0.99). Across experiments, genotypes and fruit positions on the capitulum, PM in non-stressed plants was attained when fruits exhibited 38% WC. This model was validated against independent data, successfully simulating the dynamics of fruit dry weight based on fruit WC (r=0.99; P < 0.001). Verifications against published data generated by other authors also proved satisfactory. High temperature stress that caused a shortening of grain-filling and reductions in final fruit weight > 20% with respect to controls, raised fruit WC at PM to ca. 50%. Simulations were performed to explore the effects of variations in timing of anthesis that occur between positions on the capitulum and among plants in a crop on fruit WC at maximum yield. At a crop level, 38% WC in these simulations corresponded to grain yield > 95% of the maximum attainable when harvest was delayed until last growing fruits reached 38% WC. Simulations also showed that in crops exposed to high temperature during grain-filling, there would be no risk of shortfall with respect to potential yield using 38% WC as an indicator of PM. We conclude that this simple, fast and non-subjective method based on fruit WC would be useful to determine PM in sunflower. (c) 2006, Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The long-term effects of nitrogen (N) fertiliser and slurry management practices in agricultural systems has been simulated using event driven physically based models. The Swedish soil water model SOIL and its associated nitrogen cycle model SOILN has been used to simulate the long-term impacts (over 12 years) of 360 management scenarios; three slurry applications with 10 spreading dates (involving single and split applications) for surface spreading and injection of slurry, and three fertiliser applications with two spreading dates. The effects of the N management scenarios on NO3-N drainage flows, total gaseous N losses and crop yields for grass, winter and spring cereals is investigated. Furthermore, seven soils with varying degrees of drainage efficiency and three climatic conditions (East and West coast Scotland and Southern Ireland) are studied.
   The aim of this work is to produce N-budget tables for an expert agricultural decision system (ADS) which deals specifically with N best management practises for fertiliser and slurry applications. Simulations conducted in this study were based on input parameters calibrated for specific sites in previous studies on hydrology and NO3-N transport to subsurface drains with associated crop growth.
   The results of this study show that increasing rates of N applications (in the form of slurry and fertiliser) resulted in a non-linear increase in both the N leached through subsurface drains and the N harvest yield. Surface spreading and injection of slurry gave similar trends. The most important decision about slurry spreading concerns the selection of spreading date and the selection of fields which are likely to produce only moderate leaching effects. Application of slurry in autumn (as a single or split loading), invariably leads to large losses through N leaching, with a single application always resulting in the highest loss. Significant differences are evident for N leaching from the seven soil types. Climatic variation as exemplified in the three meteorological data sets, produces noticeable and significant differences in both N leached and harvest crop totals. This study also aims to identify that a field environmental risk assessment (ERA) using a physically based model such as SOILN can be determined such that strategic agronomic decisions involving N management can be made. In practice this is so provided that a farm manager can recognise and match the actual soil type and drainage condition of the fields on which spreading is to occur with the simulated field types within a similar climate region.

AB  - In Shushufindi canton, cocoa (Theobroma cacao) has become an important part of the economy, and the most representative crop within the productive systems of families. Given the economic dependence created, this condition confers a greater risk in the face of environmental disturbances. The objective of this investigation is to evaluate the climatic resilience of the cocoa production systems through the methodology of evaluation of resilience and climatic variability in agroccosystems. Ten production systems, five monocultures (MN) and five agroforestry (AF) were analyzed. Forty-six resilience indicators were evaluated, grouped into 11 evaluation criteria. The production systems and all their components were georeferenced by means of GPS control points on aerial photographs. A 24x24m sampling plot was selected per system for collecting data on plant diversity and soil organic matter. Each indicator was initially scored on a scale of 0 to 5 and then multiplied by a weighting coefficient. AF systems showed greater resilience than MN in 10 of the 11 criteria analyzed, however, in both types of systems there is a need to potentialize key aspects that improve their capacity to adapt and transform to climate change.

AB  - Adult Chrysoperla sinica Tjeder is a common pollen feeder in maize fields. They are thus directly exposed to insecticidal proteins by consumption of genetically engineered maize pollen containing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) proteins. Here we assessed the potential effects of Cry1Ab/2Aj- or Cry1Ac-containing Bt maize pollen on the fitness of adult C. sinica via a dietary-exposure assay under laboratory conditions. Survival, pre-oviposition, fecundity and adult dry weight did not differ between adult C. sinica consuming Bt or the corresponding non-Bt maize pollen. The stability of the Cry protein in the food sources and uptake of the Cry protein by adult C. sinica during the feeding experiment were confirmed by ELISA. These results demonstrate that adult C. sinica are not affected by the consumption of Cry1Ab/2Aj- or Cry1Ac-containing maize pollen, suggesting that production of Bt maize expressing cry1Ab/2Aj or cry1Ac genes will pose a negligible risk to adult C. sinica.

AB  - This is the first effort to construct a multidimensional index of child well-being in Iran. This index is composed of 26 indicators which cover the following aspects of child well-being: health, material well-being, education, risk and safety, family, personal well-being, and housing and the environment. Indicators were aggregated in special components, and these components eventually construct a single well-being index. The macro data was retrieved from national data centers to compute the province-level child well-being index for Iran. Results show that child well-being and its domains are distributed unequally among the provinces. Southern and eastern provinces have the worst condition while northern and central provinces have the best. Generally, Iranian children have made significant progress in recent years in education (such as literacy rate and high school graduation rate) and health (such as infant mortality rate and underweight children under 5years of age). However, there are growing problems in the country, including child labor, high levels of exclusion from high school, a shortage of preschool education, and child abuse.

AB  - This paper uses both objective and subjective indicators to investigate the impacts of coal mining on the wellbeing of host communities. It also looks at the relationship between these two measurements of wellbeing. Both objective and subjective indicators show that coal mining has no obvious impact on family income, but negative impacts on air quality. Subjective wellbeing indicators also reveal the negative impacts of coal mining on water safety, inflation rate, price of necessities and income disparity. The only positive impact associated with coal mining is the improvement of housing conditions, revealed by only objective indicators. Some objective indicators are good predictors of subjective wellbeing indicators (e.g. income and air quality) using both aggregated data and individual data, others not (e.g. housing and education). The inconsistency between objective and subjective indicators might be attributed to scope issues, scale discordance etc. This paper empirically confirms both sets of indicators are needed when measuring wellbeing, and illustrates approaches to examine the relationship between objective and subjective wellbeing indicators.

AB  - An accumulating body of literature has shown the influence of neighborhood environment on wellbeing. This study investigated the relationship between perceived neighborhood environment and subjective well-being and the mediating effect of a sense of community among Chinese elderly. Subjective well-being included four indicators: life satisfaction, meaning in life, positive affect, and negative affect. The Perceived Residential Environment Scale assessed physical and functional aspects as material conditions of neighborhood. The Sense of Community scale was drawn from the Community Social Capital survey based on urban residents of China. Seven hundred and twenty community-dwelling older adults participated in this investigation. The results showed that the neighborhood environment related positively to life satisfaction, meaning in life, and positive affect but negatively to negative affect; sense of community partially mediated the relationship between the neighborhood environment and life satisfaction and fully mediated the relationship between neighborhood environment and meaning in life and positive affect.

AB  - This study presents an additional important case clarifying the role of accounting in reconciling the dilemma faced by Japanese special companies in choosing between pursuing profits as a private entity and responding to the national interest under the conditions of the Second World War. The focus is placed on the transformations that occurred in the accounting practices adopted by the South Seas Development Company (SSDC), a special company heavily committed to Japan's territory management in Micronesia during the inter-war period. The study demonstrates that the SSDC's management initially used accounting information, such as segment profitability, to make economic decisions for the purpose of selecting its business centres, in response to the 'South Construction Project' requested by the Japanese army. However, subsequent to the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941, the nature of accounting information used was transformed in order for the SSDC to be able to manipulate accounting income to secure an acceptable level of dividends to respond to the demands of shareholders.

AB  - Animals display diverse means of producing and provisioning offspring, from eggs to embryos and juveniles. While external development predominates, many forms of embryonic incubation have evolved, including placentation in mammals and a number of understudied variants in basal metazoans that could help understand evolutionary diversification. Here we studied the brooding sea anemone Aulactinia stella, using behavioural, morphological and biochemical indicators of offspring phenotype to characterize gestation and elucidate parental and sibling relationships. The pronounced variance in juvenile weight within broods was not strongly related to any of the typical external predictors (adult weight, clutch size, sampling date, environmental conditions). Lipid concentration was significantly higher in the tissues of the small juveniles than in those of large juveniles or adult, and fatty acid profiles tended to set small juveniles apart. Finally, intra-brood feeding on external resources was documented in larger juveniles. These results are consistent with ontogenetic shifts in nutrition, from vitellogenic provisioning to post-zygotic nourishment to a prenatal form of nursing upon acquisition of feeding organs, highlighting matrotrophic and conflict-driven mechanisms acting on offspring phenotype during gestation.

AB  - Proteins have several measurable features in biological fluids that may change under pathological conditions. The current disease biomarker discovery is mostly based on protein concentration in the sample as the measurable feature. Changes in protein structures, such as post-translational modifications and in protein-partner interactions are known to accompany pathological processes. Changes in glycosylation profiles are well-established for many plasma proteins in various types of cancer and other diseases. The solvent interaction analysis method is based on protein partitioning in aqueous two-phase systems and is highly sensitive to changes in protein structure and protein-protein- and protein-partner interactions while independent of the protein concentration in the biological sample. It provides quantitative index: partition coefficient representing changes in protein structure and interactions with partners. The fundamentals of the method are presented with multiple examples of applications of the method to discover and monitor structural protein biomarkers as disease-specific diagnostic indicators.

AB  - This study describes the groundwater quantity and quality conditions in the Damghan aquifer in Iran. The quantitative analysis of data obtained from observation wells indicates overexploitation of groundwater during recent years, which has resulted in deterioration of water quality. The mean water level has declined about 7.4 m between years of 1966 and 2010. The hydrochemical facies of water collected from sampling wells were investigated though Piper and Chadha diagrams, and the general dominant type of water in the study area was determined as Na-Cl. The quality assessment examined the suitability of groundwater for drinking and irrigation purposes. Compared to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for drinking water, all regions were found to have unpotable groundwater. Furthermore, unsuitability of groundwater for agricultural applications due to high salinity was observed through analysis of major quality indicators. The saltwater intrusion was investigated by ionic ratio analyses and was determined to be the main factor contributing to high salinity and deterioration of the groundwater quality in the Damghan basin.

AB  - This work analyses a 30 year water quality data set collated from chemical analyses of Kuwait's marine waters. Spatial patterns across six sites in Kuwait Bay and seven sites located in the Arabian Gulf are explored and discussed in terms of the changing influences associated with point and diffuse sources. Statistical modelling demonstrated significant increases for dissolved nutrients over the time period. Kuwait marine waters have been subject to inputs from urban development, untreated sewage discharges and decreasing river flow from the Shatt al-Arab River. Chlorophyll biomass showed a small but significant reduction; the high sewage content of the coastal waters from sewage discharges likely favouring the presence of smaller phytoplankton taxa. This detailed assessment of temporal data of the impacts of sewage inputs into Kuwait's coastal waters establishes an important baseline permitting future assessments to be made as sewage is upgraded, and the river continues to be extracted upstream.

AB  - While occurrences of wavelike motion in the stable boundary layer due to the presence of a significant restoring buoyancy force are rarely disputed, their modalities and interaction with turbulence remain a subject of active research. In this work, the characteristics of gravity waves and their impact on flow statistics, including turbulent fluxes, are presented using data collected above an Antarctic Ice sheet during an Austral Summer. Antarctica is an ideal location for exploring the characteristics of gravity waves because of persistent conditions of strong atmospheric stability in the lower troposphere. Periods dominated by wavelike motion have been identified by analysing time series measured by fast response instrumentation. The nature and characteristic of the dominant wavy motions are investigated using Fourier cross-spectral indicators. Moreover, a multi-resolution decomposition has been applied to separate gravity waves from turbulent fluctuations in case of a sufficiently defined spectral gap. Statistics computed after removing wavy disturbances highlight the large impact of gravity waves on second order turbulent quantities including turbulent flux calculations.

KW  - FEATURES
AB  - It has been conjectured that reservoirs differ in the rate at which they manifest senescence, but no attempt has been made to find an indicator of senescence that performs better than chronological age. We assembled an indicator of functional age by creating a multimetric scale consisting of 10 metrics descriptive of reservoir environments that were expected to change directionally with reservoir senescence. In a sample of 1,022 U.S. reservoirs, chronological age was not correlated with functional age. Functional age was directly related to percentage of cultivated land in the catchment and inversely related to reservoir depth. Moreover, aspects of reservoir fishing quality and fish population characteristics were related to functional age. A multimetric scale to indicate reservoir functional age presents the possibility for management intervention from multiple angles. If a reservoir is functionally aging at an accelerated rate, action may be taken to remedy the conditions contributing most to functional age. Intervention to reduce scores of selected metrics in the scale can potentially reduce the rate of senescence and increase the life expectancy of the reservoir. This leads to the intriguing implication that steps can be taken to reduce functional age and actually make the reservoir grow younger.

AB  - We inferred the temperature and environmental conditions of Smreczynski Staw Lake in the Tatra Mountains, southern Poland, from a sediment record covering the last 1,500 years. Paleobiological methods (cladocera, chironomid, and diatom analyses) were used together with sedimentological analysis and dating. These studies provide new information about the timing and character of climate fluctuations during the Little Ice Age (LIA). The Medieval Warm Period ended in the Tatra region at the beginning of the thirteenth century, followed by the first episode of the LIA. The LIA was a relatively long but unstable period. The first part of the LIA was cold in the Tatra Mountains, without evidence of increasing precipitation, while the second part, after AD 1540, was cold and humid. The LIA terminated in the Tatra Mountains at the beginning of the twentieth century, although some aspects of its climatic and sedimentological regime continued until the 1920s. We also found some evidence of warming and acidification during the twentieth century.

AB  - Extended persistence of enteric bacteria in coastal sediments and potential remobilization of pathogens during natural turbulence or human activities may induce an increased risk of human infections. In this study, the effect of sediment characteristics such as particle grain size and nutrient and organic matter contents on the survival of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) including total coliforms, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus was investigated. The experimentation was carried out for 50 days in microcosms containing lake water and different contaminated freshwater sediments in continuous-flow and batch conditions. Results of this study revealed: (1) extended FIB survival in sediments up to 50 days, (2) higher growth and lower decay rates of FIB in sediments with high levels of organic matter and nutrients and small (mainly silt) grain size, and (3) longer survival of Enterococcus sp. compared to E. coli and total coliforms. FIB survival in sediments and possible resuspension are of considerable significance for the understanding of permanent microbial pollution in water column and therefore human risk during recreational activities.

AB  - This work is a contribution to a large project, aimed at the development of an advanced environmental assessment modelling system to be used in Japan. The modelling system here considered consisted of the RAMS and HYPACT coupled models. The RAMS code was modified to properly simulate local scale phenomena using a fine mesh size of 250 m. In this direction, the main aim here was to investigate the effect of the choice of the turbulence closure scheme on the dispersion of pollutants. Our modified version of the RAMS/HYPACT model chain was validated using field experiments which were carried out by the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI) in the area of Mt. Tsukuba (Japan). The mean flow, turbulence and concentration fields obtained using two alternative turbulence closure schemes are compared. A discussion on the different performances of the turbulence closures is presented and the influence of the closure schemes over the plume dispersion is investigated. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A Simple Method to Account for Natural Selection When Predicting Inbreeding Depression

AB  - It has been widely appreciated that natural selection opposes the progress of inbreeding in small populations, thus limiting the actual inbreeding depression for fitness traits. However, no method to account for the consequences of this process has been given so far. I give a simple and intuitive method to predict inbreeding depression, taking into account the increase in selection efficiency against recessive alleles during inbreeding. It is based oil the use of a "purged inbreeding coefficient" g(t) that accounts for the reduction of the probability of the deleterious homozygotes caused by the excess d of detrimental effect for deleterious alleles in the homozygous condition over its additive expectation. It is shown that the effect of purging call be important even for relatively small populations. For between-loci variable deleterious effects, accurate predictions call be obtained using the effective homozygous deleterious excess d(e), which call be estimated experimentally and is robust against variation of the ancestral effective population size. The method can be extended to any trait and it is used to predict the evolution of the mean viability or fecundity in a conservation program with equal or random family contributions.

AB  - A H-2-based, denitrifying and sulfate-reducing membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR) was effective for removing 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA) and chloroform (CF) by reductive dechlorination. When either TCA or CF was first added to the MBfR, reductive dechlorination took place immediately and then increased over 3 weeks suggesting enrichment for TCA- or CF-dechlorinating bacteria. Increasing the H-2 pressure increased the dechlorination rates of TCA or CF, and it also increased the rate of sulfate reduction. Increased sulfate loading allowed more sulfate reduction, and this competed with reductive dechlorination, particularly the second steps. The acceptor flux normalized by effluent concentration can be an efficient indicator to gauge the intrinsic kinetics of the MBfR biofilms for the different reduction reactions. The analysis of normalized rates showed that the kinetics for reductive-dechlorination reactions were slowed by reduced H-2 bio-availability caused by a low H-2 pressure or competition from sulfate reduction.

AB  - Late Campanian-Maestrichtian Haymana Formation of the Salt Lake Basin, Turkey was deposited in a forearch Basin. This formation has been studied by a combination of organic geochemical methods (LECO/Rock-Eval, sulphur, gas chromatography), light microscopy, and bulk combination method (elemental analysis) in order to assess the hydrocarbon source potential of the abundant and extensive shale intervals presents in the formation.
   The shales have an organic carbon content (TOC) up to 1.69% and hydrogen index (HI) values up to 380. Pyrolysis yields (TOC, S-2, and HI) and organic petrography (kerogen type, amount%) indicate that the shales are dominantly gas potential, containing Type III and II organic matter. Thermal maturity, assessed from Spore Colour Index and T-max, indicates that late Campanian-Maestrichtian Haymana Formation in the Salt Lake Basin range from diagenetic to over mature with respect to oil generation and may produce gas and oil.
   The values for the V/Cr ratio of shales vary from 0.29 to 3.20, indicating dysoxic and anoxic conditions for bottom water.

AB  - We have proposed a new application of an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) for a compact planar spectroscopic sensor to meet both conditions for miniaturization and high wavelength resolution of subnanometer order. In a preliminary experiment, the concentration of the sodium acetate solute was determined with an average deviation of 0.25 wt %. Following this, we designed and fabricated a compact spectroscopic sensor using an AWG with an insertion loss of 4 dB in the visible wavelength range. To improve the sensitivity of the visible AWG spectroscopic sensor, the optimum design of multiple grooves for the liquid sample was carried out using the refractive index and transmittance of chlorophylls a and b as various environmental indicators. We succeeded in discriminating chlorophyll solutions using the AWG sensor. We also obtained a transmittance difference of 1.4 dB, which is two times higher than that in the conventional scheme (0.7 dB) by an absorbency change of 1.0 (optical path: 1.0 mm). Relying on these theoretical and experimental investigations using a visible AWG, we can confirm that a compact AWG-based spectroscopic sensor is effective in bio-medical fields.

AB  - Recent research suggests that environmental or habitat specialization among plants may be less common than previously thought. These findings need to be reconciled with interpretations of community-level similarity analyses that emphasize a strong role for specialization. Here we examine specialization within a taxonomic group that, owing to their widespread use as environmental indicators, should provide ample supportive evidence of specialization: freshwater sediment diatoms. Using an ideal, 239-lake survey data set that reliably represents the environmental conditions among c. 9500 north-eastern US lakes (encompassing a c. 405 000 km(2) region), we show that only 29 and 14% of 401 species (those occurring in at least two lakes) exhibited narrower pH and total phosphorus niche breadths, respectively, than expected from the random occupation of lakes. These rates increase slightly using more stringent species-inclusion criteria. Highly significant correlations between compositional and environmental resemblance matrices are shown to reflect a balance between a strong signal generated by the minority specialists, and noise generated by the majority generalists.

AB  - In the framework of a project aimed at the study of the catchment basin of the Tiber River (Latium Region, Italy), a pilot survey was conducted in order to assess the presence of selected toxic trace elements, namely As, Cd, Hg and Pb, in muscle tissues of fish caught in different tracts of Tiber River (urban area of Rome and different rural areas upstream and downstream). The analysed species were Leuciscus cephalus (Ciprinidae) and Anguilla anguilla (Anguillidae). Determinations were carried out by means of Sector Field Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (SF-ICP-MS). Preliminary data (ranges of concentration in mug g(-1), freeze-dried mass: As, 0.73-3.62; Cd, 0.0002-0.001; Hg, 0.18-0.31; Pb, 0.02-0.09) revealed no significant differences among the sets of results relevant to the various sampling stations. The total content of each element seems to be related with a general condition of low-level pollution of the area under study. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Digestive glands of the mangrove mussel Mytella guyanensis, collected at one non-polluted site (site 1) and two polluted sites (sites 2 and 3), were analysed for different antioxidant defenses, lipid peroxidation and DNA damage. Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine levels were enhanced at the polluted sites. With the exception of superoxide dismutase, the activities of catalase and glutathione peroxidase were also higher at the polluted sites. Greater increases were observed in glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase and etoxyresorufine-o-deethylase activities at the polluted sites. Conversely, reduced glutathione content was higher at the control site. Trace metal contents in mussels collected at polluted sites were increased compared to the control site, and there were strong positive correlations between TBARS and Cu and Pb contents. M. guyanensis is routinely exposed to an oxidative stress condition at both polluted sites, and considering xenobiotic bioaccumulation in bivalve molluscs, the mangrove mussel represents an excellent bioindicator for environmental monitoring studies.

AB  - For the first time, we monitored time-resolved conformational changes inherent in bacteriorhodopsin's reaction cycle as well as the H+-release events directly at the surface of bacteriorhodopsin (bR) at room temperature. Signals of optical pH-indicators in the aqueous bulk phase were compared with those of probes covalently linked to bR. The kinetics of H+-translocation and the correlation of the photocycle with the pumping cycle can only be determined with indicators bound to bR. The proton appears at the extracellular surface during the L550 to M412 transition. Upon short photoexcitation, diffraction patterns were obtained from both guanidine hydrochloride-treated wild type bR and an Asp96Asn mutant with millisecond time resolution by x-ray synchrotron radiation. The measured time course and location of the structural changes confirm and extend our previous static neutron diffraction study at -180-degrees-C. The temporal correlation of photocycle intermediates and proton translocation steps with structural changes in the protein under similar environmental conditions strongly contribute to the understanding of the pumping mechanism.

AB  - Severe drought conditions contributed to three mass fish mortality events in the Darling River near Menindee, part of the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, during the summer of 2018-19. An independent assessment recommended the need for improved modelling approaches to identify when sections of rivers may be more susceptible to fish kill events. We present a geographic information system (GIS)-based tool that combines meteorological forecasts with river flow and algal biomass datasets to identify river reaches where additional stresses on fish health may produce an increased risk of mass fish deaths. At present the tool is still in development and will require the addition of extra datasets and testing using historical datasets to further validate its accuracy. Despite the tool being in its development stage, the decision support tool has been widely accepted and provides natural resource managers with a rapid way to understand and communicate risks to fish health, supporting improved water management options across the Murray-Darling Basin that may ultimately help reduce the frequency and severity of large-scale fish mortality events.

AB  - The environmental surface contamination by radioactive elements following a nuclear research reactor hypothetical accident is evaluated employing the hotspot code, IAEA safety guide, and NRC guidelines. Gaussian plume depositions of radioactive contaminants are calculated under very conservative assumptions for a worst-case accident scenario, and site most probable wind speed and metrological conditions. Results reveal that the contamination strongly decreases with distance, dropping seven orders of magnitude from 2.2+09 kBq/m(2) at the reactor site to 9.5+2 kBq/m(2) 60 km from the reactor at the plume centerline. In rainy weather, the wet deposition is depleted to 6.0+2 kBq/m(2) after 50 km, limiting the spread of contaminants to a much smaller area. Although the results of this work tend to overestimate the surface deposition of radionuclides, they present a clear insight into the radiological consequences of nuclear accident worst-case scenario. Thus, it assists with the development of a comprehensive emergency preparedness program by identifying all areas with potential risk to contamination.

AB  - In this study, the extraction of carrot seed oil is carried out using supercritical CO2. Screening design was applied on operating parameters such as pressure, temperature, solvent flow rate, particle size and co-solvent to study the contribution of each parameter on extraction yield. Central composite design is employed on reduced parameters with operating ranges: 20-40 MPa (pressure), 50-70 degrees C (temperature), 5-15 g/min (solvent flow rate) and 0-10 wt% (co-solvent). Extraction yield is varied from 2.8 to 12.9 wt% of carrot seed. Experimental data are fitted well in the least-square regression model where optimized conditions are found as 40 MPa, 70 degrees C, 8.53 g/min and 5.87 wt% corresponding to the maximum yield of 13.5 wt%. Analysis of oil reveals the presence of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Principle fatty acid of carrot seed oil, i.e., oleic acid, is also optimized to maximize its extraction. The industrial-scale economic assessment is performed to study the feasibility of the supercritical fluid extraction of carrot seed oil.

AB  - Urban spatial segregation in developing countries is related to the social and economic differences of its population. This study presents an index of urban spatial segregation based on socioenvironmental and demographic data and performs statistical tests to evaluate its consistency. The index is presented with values between 0 and 1, with the highest values indicative of greater urban spatial segregation, thematic classes were derived and mapped at the level of census tracts based on data from the Brazilian census of 2010 and from images of Sentinel 2A and 3 to the urban areas of Uberlandia. The result shows less segregation indices in the South and high indices in the Southeast, North and West portions of the urban spot. The variables of urban infrastructure, economic and demographic conditions explain the groupings of the less segregated classes, on the other hand, the more segregated classes are directly influenced by the income variable. It was concluded that the urban spot shows a behavior of urban segregation of the center-periphery model and that the developed index presented a pattern of consistency.

AB  - While sewage pollution is contributing to the global decline of coral reefs, its offshore extent and direct reef impacts from water column mixing and benthic seeps are poorly documented. We addressed this knowledge gap on a Hawaiian coral reef using sewage indicator and benthic cover measurements, macroalgal bioassays, and a pollution scoring tool. Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and nutrient concentrations were spatially variable in surface and benthic waters, with shoreline values being highest. Shoreline macroalgae delta N-15 and %N indicated high nitrogen loads containing sewage, while offshore surface and benthic values suggested lower nitrogen loads from environmental sources. Coral cover was negatively correlated with FIB, macroalgal delta N-15, and nutrient concentrations. Benthic salinity and temperature measurements detected daily tidal groundwater pulses which may explain these associations. While pollution scores revealed that sewage was largely concentrated along the shoreline, results showed some reached the reef and may be contributing to its declining condition.

AB  - This article presents a new measure of family-driven age- and gender-related inequalities. This composite measure, which we call the Patriarchy Index, combines a range of variables related to familial behavior that reflect varying degrees of sex- and age-related social inequality across different family settings. We demonstrate the comparative advantages of the index by showing how 266 historical populations from the Atlantic coast of Europe to Moscow scored on the patriarchy scale. We then compare the index with contemporary measures of gender discrimination, and find a strong correlation between historical and current inequality patterns. Finally, we explore how variation in patriarchy levels across Europe is related to the socioeconomic and institutional characteristics of the regional populations, and to variation across these regions in their degree of demographic centrality and environmental conditions. The results confirm previous findings that family organization is a crucial generator of social inequality, and point to the importance of considering the historical context when analyzing the current global contours of inequality.

AB  - Genotoxic agents may exert damage that may be active through following generations. Micronuclei are cytoplasmic chromatin masses outside the main cell nucleus, indicators of chromosomal damage. This study applied micronuclei test to evaluate genetic damage of fish in three breeding and nursery areas of commercially important fishes exposed to differing degrees of anthropogenic impact: Pando, Solis Chico and Solis Grande sub-estuaries. The micronuclei test revealed differences in the presence and concentrations of genotoxic components in these sub-estuaries. Fish in the urban and industrialized Pando sub-estuary presented the highest percentages of micronuclei. The absence of seasonal changes in micronuclei in Pando fish could be explained by physical characteristics of the sub-estuary and by regional weather conditions. Odontesthes argentinensis (Valenciennes, 1835) was the species most susceptible to genotoxic components. It is recommended the use of a battery of biomarkers to better explain the health of organisms in that important nursery area. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper aims to evaluate a methodology for training food handlers using a didactic material (booklet) developed to be used as a tool in further training sessions in the hotel sector. Microbiological indicators, such as mesophilic aerobic bacteria, coliforms at 35 and 45C were tested in utensils, adornments, food handler hands and ready-for-consumption foods, in adverse conditions and routine tasks in an industrial kitchen environment. The results of the microbiological analyses clearly demonstrated the need for constant vigilance in order to obtain safe food, besides providing examples to be inserted into teaching materials, such as a guidebook, focusing on handlers who work in hotels, with the advantage of approaching examples of the routine of these establishments. Practical Applications Food handler education in hotels should be compulsory part of a food safety program. In this study, presented are the development of a methodology using practical examples from daily activities of the employers and results of laboratory analysis. Easy understanding was observed among all the food handlers and improvements were observed after the implementation of the method. The methodology can be adopted in any hotel food service, without any extra economical cost.

AB  - The Finnish fish-based lake assessment system EQR4 was updated using more extensive lake data with tighter reference criteria. The updated EQR4 (EQR4(new)) had significant and tighter pressure (eutrophication) relationship compared to the previous version (EQR4(old)). The EQR4(new) separated impacted and reference lakes with lower misclassification risk compared to the EQR4(old). All the variables within the multi-metric index EQR4(new) (total biomass, total number of individuals, cyprinid biomass %, and indicator species) were found to be relevant. The classification output in relation to eutrophication was higher in the northern part of the country compared to the southern lakes which was probably due to the climate-dependent reduction in productivity. Despite the clear pressure response and the ability to separate reference and impacted lakes, the accuracy of the EQR4(new) values is relatively modest. Including regional patterns in the composition and variability of lake fish communities in Finland would increase the accuracy of the assessment method and, moreover, contribute to the excellence of fish community ecology of boreal lakes.

AB  - The genome of the fungal model organism Aspergillus nidulans harbors nearly 30 polyketide synthase genes, yet the majority of these genes remain silent in the absence of particular stimuli. In this study, environmental conditions such as low specific microbial growth rate as well as nitrate, orthophosphate and glucose limitations were simulated under a continuous cultivation regime to induce the expression of silent polyketide synthase genes. In addition to offline and online bioprocess parameters, the physiological equilibrium was defined at the transcript level in terms of indicator gene expression. The different cultivation parameters resulted in a differential expression of two polyketide synthase genes coding for the biosynthesis of a variety of phenolic compounds, such as orsellinic acid, lecanoric acid, emodins, chrysophanol, shamixanthone, and sanghaspirodin. Further investigation of the metabolome revealed the formation of a novel prenylated benzophenone derivative designated as pre-shamixanthone. Our data indicate that employing chemostat fermentations in combination with genome mining, transcriptome analysis and metabolic profiling represents a valuable approach for triggering cryptic biosynthetic pathways.

TI  - Spillway-Induced Salmon Head Injury Triggers the Generation of Brain alpha II-Spectrin Breakdown Product Biomarkers Similar to Mammalian Traumatic Brain Injury
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Recent advances in biomedical research have resulted in the development of specific biomarkers for diagnostic testing of disease condition or physiological risk. Of specific interest are alpha II-spectrin breakdown products (SBDPs), which are produced by proteolytic events in traumatic brain injury and have been used as biomarkers to predict the severity of injury in humans and other mammalian brain injury models. This study describes and demonstrates the successful use of antibody-based mammalian SBDP biomarkers to detect head injury in migrating juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) that have been injured during passage through high-energy hydraulic environments present in spillways under different operational configurations. Mortality and injury assessment techniques currently measure only near-term direct mortality and easily observable acute injury. Injury-based biomarkers may serve as a quantitative indicator of subacute physical injury and recovery, and aid hydropower operators in evaluation of safest passage configuration and operation actions for migrating juvenile salmonids. We describe a novel application of SBDP biomarkers for head injury for migrating salmon.

AB  - A new method for assessing coastal environments using the reproduction potential of corals has been developed and examined in situ. Six assessment racks were deployed before the full moon of May 2006 at three sites located around a river outlet in Nagura Bay, Ishigaki Is. and at one control location in Sekisei Lagoon. Each rack was equipped with two marine blocks (MB) containing 378 holes, two cases of coral settlement devices (CSDs), each containing 120 CSDs, and a water temperature logger. Assessment was based on recruitment of Acropora due to mass spawning. After 4 months of deployment, the surface of assessment racks showed apparent biofouling depending on sites mainly by algal settlement on the surfaces. Almost all the holes of the MBs were partly occupied, mainly by turf algae. Nagura Bay was thought likely to be an "unhealthy" coral reef due to runoff from land. However, our assessment showed that there were 0.85 corals per CSD in the Bay, compared with 0.51 in Sekisei Lagoon, indicating that coral larvae supply is not the cause of the unhealthy condition of corals in the Nagura Bay.

AB  - Nitrogen content and delta N-15 (nitrogen stable isotope ratio) were measured in different parts of the sporophyte of Undaria pinnatifida (Harvey) Suringar from two bays in the northeastern Japan. There were clear differences between the thalli collected in winter and in summer: high nitrogen content and low average delta N-15 were observed for the thalli collected in winter, while the opposite pattern was found for the thalli from summer. In addition, the pattern of internal delta N-15 distribution in the thallus changed with season. It is possible that the cause for these seasonal differences in the algae was the seasonal change in environmental conditions, because in winter water is normally rich in nitrogen, while in summer it is poor. U. pinnatifida sporophyte may be useful as an indicator of nitrogen sources in coastal waters, but consideration must be given to the effect of isotope fractionation on delta N-15 of the plant, especially in winter. Potential may exist for the use of different parts of the thallus to indicate nitrogen sources at different periods, but more investigation is necessary to accomplish this.

AB  - This article revisits the debate about the processes of coastal dune initiation in Australia. A review of the dates published so far on coastal dunes in Australia indicates that these belong to identifiable process regions. Those to the north and northeast seem to be largely derived from the deflation, at low sea levels, of exposed deltaic sediments, which are subsequently reworked by episodes of active transgressive dune development. In the southeast, the dunes, like other coastal depositional features, are largely derived from the alongshore sediment transport system, which is active along this coast at times of higher sea level. Apart from during glacial maxima, episodes of dune transgression, where a source is identifiable, seem to be initiated along the shoreline, strongly suggesting that marine disturbance is the trigger. Although, in many cases, these are also at times when climate is favourable to active transgressive dune development, the eastern Cape York dune fields make it clear that this is not a necessary condition.

TI  - A fluviarium with controlled water quality for preference - avoidance experiments with fish and invertebrates
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS
LA  - English
AB  - The effect of environmental variables on movement of aquatic organisms can be examined using preference-avoidance behaviors. Fluviariums have been used to examine such preference-avoidance behaviors in fish, including choices associated with various water quality variables. The sharp gradient in fluviariums provides aquatic organisms with a choice of ( usually) two water qualities, sharply demarcated at a relatively narrow boundary zone. A detailed description of a recently constructed and up-dated fluviarium, however, is missing from the literature. The fluviarium described in this paper integrates hydrodynamic design and extensive control of water quality to provide consistent experimental conditions, while at the same time being affordable. The system described was designed and used to examine acid avoidance behavior in juvenile fish and prawns, as part of a larger study on migration barriers in aquatic environments. An assessment of the fluviarium with juvenile snapper, Pagrus auratus, showed that the system worked as desired. The design described here, however, can be used or modified to study behavioral responses of aquatic biota to a wide variety of environmental variables, including habitat quality or combinations of two or more environmental variables.

AB  - Various analytical techniques (C-13-NMR, FTIR, elemental analysis) have been used to study the structures of humic compounds present in the sediments of Martignano lake located 50 km from Roma city (Italy). The total amount of humic compounds present in the upper layer of sediments is practically constant; instead, considering humic (HA) and fulvic acids (FA) separately, it can be noticed that while HA increase remarkably from A, to A,, FA diminish, probably as a result of the continuous transformation of algal debris, present in large amount in A,, from compounds which are in an early stage of decomposition to more highly degraded organic matter. In deeper layers the percentage both of HA and FA is constant and slightly lower than that found in the upper layer. except for two sampling points. In these stations the amount of both HA and FA are very high and the carbohydrate peak areas of HA and FA increase along with the depth, reflecting the presence of a well localized source of organic carbon or different environmental conditions.

AB  - The origin process of manganese ores remains unsolved worldwide. Exploring the origins of stromatolites that contain manganese may be a key to deciphering the sedimentary environments and metallogenic processes of these deposits. However, only a few manganese stromatolites have been discovered and described until now. Microbialites are well developed in the manganese deposits, located near the top of the Ediacaran Doushantuo Formation in Chengkou area of Chongqing, northern Yangtze Craton, but has not been explicitly studied; and whether they are true stromatolites or Epiphyton microbialites remains controversial. Based on field and core observations and thin section microscopy, the characteristics of five types of manganese stromatolites and their growth modes are described in detail in this study. The results show that these stromatolites grew in a biostrome in shoal and lagoon environments and were syngenetic with oncolites and oolites on a carbonate ramp behind the shoal. Manganese stromatolites can be categorized into three forms: (1) stratiform; (2) columnar, which includes branched and columnar types; and (3) stratiform-columnar, which is a transitional type. Based on a criterion that the diameter is less than or greater than 1 mm, columnar stromatolites are further divided into micro-columnar (<1 mm) and columnar (> 1 mm) columns, which display synchronous growth and are similar to Pseudogymnosolenaceae. Their shapes are mainly controlled by water depths and hydrodynamic strengths. The greater the water depth, the more columnar the columns tend to be. Excessively strong hydrodynamic conditions decrease the growth rate of stromatolites, and they even stopped growth due to wave damage. Furthermore, pillared laminar textures (not Epiphyton), which consist of dendritic, micro-branched and microcolumnar stromatolites, are a common feature of the larger stratiform, stratiform-columnar and columnar stromatolites. The alternations of laminae with different internal textures record subtle fluctuations in water depths and hydrodynamic strengths, which indicate that stromatolite growth is controlled by tidal cycles at the lamina level. Therefore, it is possible that the vertical evolution of the stromatolites could reveal the changing characteristics of both local and regional sedimentary environments, i.e., stromatolite shape changes from columnar to stratiform can represent the onset of shallower environments with weak hydrodynamic conditions. In addition, as important reef builders in shallow carbonate ramps, micro-stromatolites accelerate the development from ramp to platform. Indicators of microbial control on stromatolite shapes and manganese sedimentation processes include the fabric of stromatolite laminae, organic rhodochrosite with a micritic texture that is usually clotted, spherical, tubular, fibrous or dendritic, which suggests that the laminae resulted from microbially induced in situ precipitation.

AB  - Massive corals provide a useful archive of environmental variability, but careful testing of geochemical proxies in corals is necessary to validate the relationship between each proxy and environmental parameter throughout the full range of conditions experienced by the recording organisms. Here we use samples from a coral-growth study to test the hypothesis that Sr/Ca in the coral Siderastrea siderea accurately records sea-surface temperature (SST) in the subtropics (Florida, USA) along 350 km of reef tract. We test calcification rate, measured via buoyant weight, and linear extension (LE) rate, estimated with Alizarin Red-S staining, as predictors of variance in the Sr/Ca records of 39 individual S. siderea corals grown at four outer-reef locations next to in-situ temperature loggers during two, year-long periods. We found that corals with calcification rates<1.7 mg cm(-2) d(-1) or<1.7 mm yr(-1) LE returned spuriously high Sr/Ca values, leading to a cold-bias in Sr/Ca-based SST estimates. The threshold-type response curves suggest that extension rate can be used as a quality-control indicator during sample and drill-path selection when using long cores for SST paleoreconstruction. For our corals that passed this quality control step, the Sr/Ca-SST proxy performed well in estimating mean annual temperature across three sites spanning 350 km of the Florida reef tract. However, there was some evidence that extreme temperature stress in 2010 (cold snap) and 2011 (SST above coral-bleaching threshold) may have caused the corals not to record the temperature extremes. Known stress events could be avoided during modern calibrations of paleoproxies.
   Plain Language Summary Coral skeletons are used to decipher past environmental conditions in the ocean because they live for centuries and produce annual growth bands much like tree rings. Along with measuring coral growth rates in the past, coral skeletons can be chemically sampled to get even more detailed information, like past seawater temperatures. In this study we tested the validity of the strontium-to-calcium (Sr/Ca) temperature proxy in the Massive Starlet Coral (Siderastrea siderea) by sampling 39 corals that were grown in the ocean right next to instruments recording underwater temperature. We found that, as long as corals with very slow growth rates are avoided, the proxy performed well across an extensive region in the western Atlantic.

AB  - The present study was undertaken over two consecutive years under sub-temperate climatic conditions in the mid-hill region of Himachal Pradesh (30 degrees 52'N, 77 degrees 11'E; 1,175 m as') on loamy sand Inceptisols. The aim was to investigate the effects of irrigation and mulch material on the growth, flowering, fruiting behaviour, relative leaf water content (RLWC), yield, and quality of strawberry (Fragaria X ananassa L. 'Chandler'). The drip irrigation treatments included irrigation with 100, 80, or 60% (coded 1.0, 0.8, and 0.6 V) of the total water requirement. Both mulches increased the minimum soil temperature to a depth of 5 cm. The drip and surface irrigation treatments raised the minimum soil temperature by 3.0 degrees - 5.4 degrees C, and lowered the maximum temperature by 2.2 degrees - 5.8 degrees C compared to the rainfed control. Hay mulch was more effective in raising the minimum temperature and lowering the maximum soil temperature than black polyethylene mulch. Moisture conservation increased by 2.8 - 12.8% under the black polyethylene mulch compared to the no-mulch treatment. Drip and surface irrigation methods, as well as mulching, were found to be effective for enhancing the growth, irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE), fruit yield, and quality of strawberry plants. However, the number of crowns per plant, the percentage berry set, the RLWC, root length density (RLD), and fruit yield were highest under treatment M3I3 [i.e., black polyethylene mulch plus drip irrigation (1.0 V)] by 565.5%, 94.5%, 32.8%, 394.5%, and 549.6%,respectively, compared to the no mulch plus rainfed control. The maximum IWUE values for plant biomass [1.39 metric tonnes (MT) ha(-1) m(-1)] and fruit yield (2.79 MT ha(-1) m(-1)) were recorded under treatment M3I5 [i.e., black polyethylene mulch plus drip irrigation (0.6 V)]; whereas, the lowest values (0.39 and 0.68 MT ha(-1) m(-1), respectively) were observed using treatment M1I2 (i.e., without mulch, plus surface irrigation). Fruit size, weight, sugar content, and anthocyanin content increased significantly under treatment M2I3 [i.e., hay mulch, plus drip irrigation (1.0 V)] compared with all other treatments. Total soluble solids (TSS) contents and total acidity (TA) were highest under treatment M1I1 (i.e., no mulch, plus rainfed). A linear regression model could describe the variations in quality parameters of strawberry plants grown under sub-temperate climatic conditions. Root density was found to be the best indicator with which estimate fruit quality.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the growth, photochemical reflectance, and antioxidant properties of P. frutescens species in response to temperature- and water-stress conditions. Two independent experiments were carried out in growth chambers and an environmentally controlled greenhouse for periods of five weeks in each experiment. Pots of red and green Perilla cultivars were planted under day/night temperatures of 15/10 degrees C, 20/15 degrees C, 25/20 degrees C (control), 30/25 degrees C, and 35/30 degrees C. Moreover, plants were subjected to four irrigation levels as measured by volumetric water content (VWC): 65 % (control), 40 %, 30 %, and 15 %. Changes in plant height and fresh and dry weights of shoots and leaves indicated that those at 10 degrees C suffered more severely than at 35 degrees C. When plants were treated with 15 degrees C and 15 % VWC stressing for five weeks, all plants exhibited harmful effects to their leaves compared to 25 degrees C and 65 % VWC treatments (control). The maximal quantum yield of PSII photochemistry values of all plants displayed significant decreases in severe-stress treatments (35 degrees C, 15 degrees C, and 15 % VWC) compared to controls, indicating that this parameter is suitable for evaluating the growth of these plants under temperature and water stressing sufficient to result in photoinhibitory effects. The normalized difference vegetation index values of all plants in 35 degrees C and 15 % VWC treatments were significantly lower than controls. In addition, red Perilla plants exhibited better temperature and drought tolerance than green plants due to their higher soil-plant analysis development values under the same temperature and VWC treatments. Therefore, these indices can be used as indicators to characterize the physiology of these plants. The increases in 2,2-diphenyl-1- picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity and total phenolics (TP) content of green Perilla leaf extract (PLE) were clearly manifested with 35 degrees C treatment compared to controls. However, there were clear increases in the TP content of all PLE with 15 % VWC treatment compared to controls. Thus, Perilla plants subjected to heat and water stresses can be used as a health food and for medicinal purposes due to high TP content, but the use of stressed plants for food purposes would be limited due to low marketability. Green- and red-leaf Perilla contained higher rosmarinic acid (RA) and caffeic acid (CA) content, respectively, in each VWC treatment, implying that their genotypes exhibited different abilities and specificities of photosynthetic metabolites.

   A risk assessment framework that supports Arctic voyage planning and real-time operational decision-making through assignment of operational criteria based on the likelihood of ice-induced damage and the potential consequences.
   Abstract The International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters (Polar Code) was adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and entered into force on 1 January 2017. It provides a comprehensive treatment of topics relevant to ships operating in Polar regions. From a design perspective, in scenarios where ice exposure and the consequences of ice-induced damage are the same, it is rational to require the same ice class and structural performance for such vessels. Design requirements for different ice class vessels are provided in the Polar Code. The Polar Operational Limit Assessment Risk Indexing System (POLARIS) methodology provided in the Polar Code offers valuable guidance regarding operational limits for ice class vessels in different ice conditions. POLARIS has been shown to well reflect structural risk, and serves as a valuable decision support tool for operations and route planning. At the same time, the current POLARIS methodology does not directly account for the potential consequences resulting from a vessel incurring ice-induced damage. While two vessels of the same ice class operating in the same ice conditions would have similar structural risk profiles, the overall risk profile of each vessel will depend on the magnitude of consequences, should an incident or accident occur. In this paper, a new framework is presented that augments the current POLARIS methodology to model consequences. It has been developed on the premise that vessels of a given class with higher potential life-safety, environmental, or socio-economic consequences should be operated more conservatively. The framework supports voyage planning and real-time operational decision making through assignment of operational criteria based on the likelihood of ice-induced damage and the potential consequences. The objective of this framework is to enhance the safety of passengers and crews and the protection of the Arctic environment and its stakeholders. The challenges associated with establishing risk perspectives and evaluating consequences for Arctic ship operations are discussed. This methodology proposes a pragmatic pathway to link ongoing scientific research with risk-based methods to help inform recommended practices and decision support tools. Example scenarios are considered to illustrate the flexibility of the methodology in accounting for varied risk profiles for different vessel types, as well as incorporating input from local communities and risk and environmental impact assessments.

AB  - The Black Woodpecker Dryocopus martius excavates nesting holes in big trees and use dead wood for foraging. It is considered as a key and an indicator species in the protection of biodiversity of forest ecosystems, because its cavities condition the possibility of breeding the biggest secondary cavity-nesters, bats, and some species of wasps. We studied preferences of the Black Woodpecker towards the nesting trees in the Augustow Forest (NE Poland). It is an extensive forest complex covering 114 000 ha, dominated by fresh and mixed fresh coniferous forest sites. Scots pine Pinus sylvestris occupies 78% of forest area. Stands older than 100 years cover about 18% of the study area. We searched for trees with cavities of the Black Woodpecker in stands older than 60 years. We identified tree species, their age and health condition. The breast height diameter and height of trees and height of the cavities above ground were measured. Additionally, cavity entrance orientation were estimated. We found a total number of 150 nesting trees with 229 cavities excavated by the Black Woodpecker. Pines constituted 95% of nesting trees. Cavities were found also in Betula pendula and Populus tremula. Live trees predominated among trees with cavities. Dead trees (only pines) constituted 12% of all. More than one (form 2 to 6) cavity entrances were recorded in almost 30% of nesting trees. Woodpeckers excavated cavities in pines in age from 92 to 222, 159 years old on average. Taken together, 90% of cavity pines were older than 110 years. The height of nesting trees varied from 21 to 37.5 m (30.5 m on average), and its breast height diameter was 32-96 cm with mean of 54 cm. Over 90% of trees with woodpeckers' cavities had dbh larger than 40 cm, and almost 50% between 50 and 60 cm. The mean height of cavity entrances was 12.8 (6-27) m. There was no dependence between the height of cavities and the thickness of trees. The entrance orientation was dominated by east and north (together 58%). Birds selected the least often an entrance in southwest (only 2.3%). The Augustow Forest is the only study plot in Europe, where so strong domination of pines among nesting trees of the Black Woodpecker was recorded. The preferred tree species in south and west part of the continent is Fagus sylvatica. The Black Woodpecker uses for nests mainly the oldest pines, but it is related to the thickness, and not directly to the age of these trees. The maintenance of pine dominated stands older than 120 years is necessary for the Black Woodpecker protection in the Augustow Forest.

AB  - A controlled fish propagation is nowadays the fundamental prerequisite for well-managed aquaculture production. However, despite practices aimed at creating equal conditions during the spawning, the share of males giving offspring is highly diversified. In traditional pond aquaculture, the fish are exposed to various environmental factors that may affect their fertility through immune activation, among which parasites are one of the most influential. It is highly feasible that in conditions of sperm overload and short sperm-egg distance, the differences in fertilization success between males are related to sperm characteristics determined by male fitness. The present study aimed to investigate if mounting an immune response through parasitic infection affects common carp (Cyrpinus carpio L) sperm quality and reproductive success.
   Mature carp males were experimentally infected with a dose of 1 ? 109 blood parasites Trypanoplasma borreli by intraperitoneal inoculation. Control fish were PBS-injected. Parasite number was determined at weekly intervals using a B?rker counting chamber. The level of parasitaemia developed within four weeks post-infection served as the criterion to classify each individual either as parasite susceptible or resistant. On day 24 postinfection, carp males were engaged in controlled spawning. Equal volumes of quantified semen, obtained by gentle abdominal massage, were used to fertilize the egg portions obtained from four females of different genetic origin. The calculated hatchability rate was used as the indicator of the males? reproductive success. The parasite-infected males demonstrated average hatchability rates of 14.18 ? 4.83%, while the control males demonstrated 11.29 ? 3.93% rates. Parasites induced a robust adaptive antibody response, but individual antibody levels were not associated with hatchability rate. A significantly higher number of spermatozoids with damaged DNA was detected in parasite-susceptible males than in the resistant ones. The 11-ketotestosterone and most CASA parameters did not differ between parasite-infected and control fish except beat cross frequency (BCF), which was higher in infected fish (57.45 ? 18 Hz in infected vs 43.64 ? 9 Hz in controls). This CASA parameter, alongside the percentage of motile spermatozoa (MOT), was positively associated with the hatchability rate.
   Our study shows that in artificial spawning, a mild level of parasitaemia does not negatively influence common carp males? reproductive success. The only sperm characteristic altered by immune activation is BCF, which was correlated with hatchability in infected fish. However, the mechanism by which the activated immune system can alter BCF values and how this sperm parameter affects hatchability remains unknown and requires further investigation.

AB  - Cattle vocalisations have been proposed as potential indicators of animal welfare. However, very few studies have investigated the acoustic structure and information encoded in these vocalisations using advanced analysis techniques. Vocalisations play key roles in a wide range of communication contexts; e.g. for individual recognition and to help coordinate social behaviours. Two factors have greatly assisted our progress in developing an understanding of animal vocal communication. Firstly, more rigorous call analysis methods allow us to describe the variation in the vocal parameters in unprecedented detail. Secondly, the adoption of the "source-filter theory" of call production links the acoustic structure of vocalisations to the morphology and physiology of calling animals. Using these approaches, it is possible to quantify the potential for each acoustic component to carry information. In this study, we examined naturally occurring contact calls produced by crossbred beef cows and their calves-under free-ranging-conditions. Our main aims were-to identify vocal parameters, which can be used to characterise cow and calf contact calls, and to describe variation in these parameters under relatively undisturbed conditions. Additionally, we aimed to provide information for future studies on potential acoustic indicators of animal welfare in cattle. We identified two different types of cow contact calls associated with different behavioural contexts, and with differing acoustic structures. Low frequency calls (LFCs) were produced by cows when they were in close proximity to their calves, in the first three or four weeks postpartum, and they were made with the mouth closed or only partially open (fundamental frequency (F0) = 81.17 +/- 0.98 Hz). By contrast, high frequency calls (HFCs) were produced by cows when they were separated from their calves (e.g. not in visual contact) and preceded nursing (F0 = 152.8 +/- 3.10 Hz). Calf calls were produced when separated from their mothers and preceded suckling (F0 = 142.8 +/- 1.80 Hz). A detailed analysis of cow LFCs and HFCs, and of calf calls, showed that all three types of calls are individually distinctive. We also show that calf calls encode age, but not sex. Although it has previously been suggested that cattle contact calls are individually distinctive, to our knowledge, our study is the first to use the most rigorous, modern methods to analyse their calls. This study represents an important advance in our knowledge cattle contact vocalisations, which is essential for future work on cattle communication and welfare. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The conversion of even-aged Norway spruce (Picea abies (L) H. Karst.) stands into more site adapted mixed stands is the main silvicultural goal in Germany and many other European countries. The conversion will primarily be achieved with the help of selection cutting, removing single target diameter trees and creating small gaps. At sites highly susceptible to windthrow, however, small scale clear cutting (up to 1 ha) might be an appropriate alternative. Both selection and clear cutting will affect the understorey vegetation, an important component of forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Thus, with the help of a BACI-experiment (before-after/control-impact), the short-term effects of selection and small scale clear cutting on the herb and shrub layer vegetation were studied at two sites in the Solling Hills (Lower Saxony, Germany). Both treatments led to an increase in herb and shrub layer species numbers, due to persistent and invading (mainly pioneer tree species and indicators of disturbance) species and to a shift in plant traits. Most responsible for the changes in vegetation was a higher light availability, and to a lesser degree soil disturbance. The number of annuals and ruderals, however, increased only immediately after clear cutting, whereas on selection cutting plots the numbers remained high. Gaining in number and coverage were competitive perennials (Epilobium angustifolium, Juncus effusus, Rubus idaeus) especially on the clear cuttings, fulfilling a nutrient retention function. The competitives did not deter tree species from regenerating in the clear cut plots, whereas on selection cutting plots the large expansion of R. idaeus appeared to be hindering tree colonisation. Suffering under clear cut conditions were predominantly shade-tolerant, closed-forest species, but no loss of these species could be detected. This indicates the potential for a fast recovery of these forest species, as soon as, pioneer trees expand.
   Although the vegetation changed in similar directions at both study sites, differences in species numbers and composition were found, indicating the importance of site conditions in the beginning of succession.
   In conclusion, our study shows no overall negative effects on shrub and herb layer biodiversity and trait composition after clear cutting. It is suggested that small scale clear cutting may be considered an appropriate alternative to silvicultural methods which cause a moderate rate of disturbance, to reach the goal of Norway spruce forest conversion.

AB  - There are plans to do away with firing coal at the Kashira State District Power Plant (SDPP). In 2018, its coal-fired power units nos. 1 and 2 were decommissioned. Power unit no. 3, whose boiler can operate both on coal and natural gas, is being shifted to operate fully on natural gas, and fuel oil is supposed to be used as backup fuel. According to the design, the P-50R boiler, which is part of this power unit, can use fuel oil only as startup fuel during operation at loads up to 30%. In the article, the possibility of boiler operation on fuel oil in the entire working range of loads is substantiated. The boiler's adaptive model has been developed using the Boiler Designer software and the experimental data obtained in the course of experiments on firing fuel oil. The results from numerical investigations have shown the possibility to use fuel oil as backup fuel in the P-50R boiler without modernizing its heating surfaces and draft equipment. It has been determined that it becomes possible to obtain a noticeably lower temperature of medium downstream of the middle radiant part, divided waterwalls, and further along the high-pressure path by admission of recirculation gases in an amount of around 180 000 m(3)/h (approximately 15% in the nominal mode). An analysis of the temperature operation conditions of radiant heating surfaces in firing fuel oil with such flowrate of recirculation gases has shown that reliable operation of all boiler heating surfaces is secured taking into account the scale formation condition and sufficient mechanical strength safety margin in the load range 100-60%. It has been determined that an essentially larger flowrate of medium goes through the steam-to-steam heat exchanger (SSHE) bypass in the entire design range of loads during operation with recirculation of gases. Therefore, the reheat steam temperature at a level of 545 degrees C can be achieved even at decreased loads. The use of gas recirculation as a technological method for suppressing the generation of nitrogen oxides in the P-50R boiler makes it possible to keep the NO. concentrations in the fuel oil combustion products in compliance with the relevant regulations (less than 250 mg/m(3)). It has been determined from the calculation results that admission of recirculation gases in an amount of 180 000 m(3)/h does not have a significant influence on the economic indicators of boiler operation.

AB  - Background: Self-control in childhood has been linked to long-term and cascading effects on health, academic, criminality, wealth and parenting outcomes. Hence it is important to target self-control deficits early in life. Self-control deficits are a hallmark of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Even after receiving care-as-usual (CAU) for ADHD, impaired self-control often remains. Pharmacotherapy can be hampered by side-effects, low adherence and short-term effectiveness. Other limitations of CAU are decreased effectiveness when parents have ADHD and little effect on parental well-being. Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBIs) are an emerging non-pharmacological approach with potential to improve self-control and well-being in both children and parents. However, there is a lack of sufficiently powered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to establish their effects in families with ADHD. This study protocol describes an RCT to investigate the effectiveness of a family MBI as an add-on to CAU in treatment of youth with ADHD, and is described in accordance with Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT).
   Methods/design: An RCT will be conducted in N = 100 children (aged 8-16 years) with ADHD and their parents. The experimental condition will consist of a family MBI (MYmind): 8-week group-based MBI for youth combined with parallel group-based Mindful Parenting for their parents, as an add-on to CAU. The control condition will consist of CAU-only. Assessments will take place at baseline, end of treatment (3 months later), 2 and 6 months' follow-up. Primary outcome measure will be an ecologically valid assessment of child self-control with the parent-rated Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF). Secondary child outcome measures will be teacher-rated BRIEF, computerised self-control tasks and questionnaires on psychological symptoms (e.g. ADHD, symptoms of autism), well-being and mindfulness. For parental outcomes, secondary measures will be self-rated BRIEF, computerised self-control tasks and questionnaires on psychological symptoms, well-being and mindful parenting.
   Discussion: The proposed RCT will take account of methodological limitations of previous studies on MBIs in child ADHD populations. The current study will provide valuable information on family MBI as a potential effective intervention in targeting self-control deficits for youth with ADHD and their parents.

AB  - Present day oceans are well ventilated, with the exception of mid-depth oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) under high surface water productivity, regions of sluggish circulation, and restricted marginal basins. In the Mesozoic, however, entire oceanic basins transiently became dysoxic or anoxic. The Cretaceous ocean anoxic events (OAEs) were characterised by laminated organic-carbon rich shales and low-oxygen indicating trace fossils preserved in the sedimentary record. Yet assessments of the intensity and extent of Cretaceous near-bottom water oxygenation have been hampered by deep or long-term diagenesis and the evolution of marine biota serving as oxygen indicators in today's ocean. Sedimentary features similar to those found in Cretaceous strata were observed in deposits underlying Recent OMZs, where bottom-water oxygen levels, the flux of organic matter, and benthic life have been studied thoroughly. Their implications for constraining past bottom-water oxygenation are addressed in this review. We compared OMZ sediments from the Peruvian upwelling with deposits of the late Cenomanian OAE 2 from the north-west African shelf. Holocene laminated sediments are encountered at bottom-water oxygen levels of <7 mu mol kg(-1) under the Peruvian upwelling and <5 mu mol kg(-1) in California Borderland basins and the Pakistan Margin. Seasonal to decadal changes of sediment input are necessary to create laminae of different composition. However, bottom currents may shape similar textures that are difficult to discern from primary seasonal laminae. The millimetre-sized trace fossil Chondrites was commonly found in Cretaceous strata and Recent oxygen-depleted environments where its diameter increased with oxygen levels from 5 to 45 mu mol kg(-1). Chondrites has not been reported in Peruvian sediments but centimetre-sized crab bur-rows appeared around 10 mu mol kg(-1), which may indicate a minimum oxygen value for bioturbated Cretaceous strata. Organic carbon accumulation rates ranged from 0.7 and 2.8 g C cm(-2) kyr(-1) in laminated OAE 2 sections in Tarfaya Basin, Morocco, matching late Holocene accumulation rates of laminated Peruvian sediments under Recent oxygen levels below 5 mu mol kg(-1). Sediments deposited at >10 mu mol kg(-1) showed an inverse exponential relationship of bottom-water oxygen levels and organic carbon accumulation depicting enhanced bioirrigation and decomposition of organic matter with increased oxygen supply. In the absence of seasonal laminations and under conditions of low burial diagenesis, this relationship may facilitate quantitative estimates of palaeo-oxygenation. Similarities and differences between Cretaceous OAEs and late Quaternary OMZs have to be further explored to improve our understanding of sedimentary systems under hypoxic conditions.

AB  - Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) seedlings were planted in soil originating from two localities with different background levels of nickel and copper. In addition, some of the seedlings were exposed to additional nickel (20.5 mg Ni/l of soil) or copper (63.5 mg Cu/l of soil), or a combination of both Ni and Cu, via soil without direct shoot exposure during their second growing period. The seedlings were either irrigated with spring water (pH 6) or got only natural rain during the whole field experiment. All seedlings were inoculated with conidia of a shoot-pathogen Gremmeniella abietina during their third growing season, and harvested the following spring. Lengths of shoots of different year-classes were used. growth estimates. In roots, the proportion of fun 1, (assumedly mycorrhizal) biomass was estimated by measuring ergosterol concentration. Guajacol peroxidase activity was measured. Short roots were classified into two groups according to their condition and the composition of the mycorrhizal community was expressed as a proportion of morphotypes in the roots. The seedlings exposed to additional Ni had higher shoot growth than the seedlings in the other treatments. The mean Ni concentration in the roots of seedlings exposed to additional Ni was 79 p.p.m. and in other seedlings 16 p.p.m. Additional Ni also decreased the frequency of clearly senescent short roots and the proportion of the mycorrhizal morphotype with the thinnest mantle. These results indicate that the Ni exposure levels used in this experiment had some positive effects on the seedlings. The relative fungal biomass was about 6% lower (p = 0.0981) in the fine roots of seedlings treated with additional Cu. The mean Cu concentration in the roots of seedlings exposed to additional Cu was 256 p.p.m. and in other seedlings 29 p.p.m. Peroxidase activity, which was used as a general stress indicator in this study, was not affected by any of the treatments. The shoot growth and the relative biomass of fungi in the fine roots were positively correlated in all seedlings, and this correlation was stronger in seedlings exposed to additional Ni that were not irrigated compared with seedlings not exposed to additional Ni that were irrigated. The frequency of asymptomatic infections of G. abietina was positively correlated with the proportion of senescent short roots in the irrigated seedlings but not in not-irrigated seedlings. The general condition of seedlings may be an important factor for infection by G. abietina when moisture is high enough for the fungi to infect seedlings by conidia.

AB  - It is only recently that life cycle-based indicators have been used to evaluate products from a water use impact perspective. The applicability of some of these methods has been primarily demonstrated on agricultural materials or products, because irrigation requirements in food production can be water-intensive. In view of an increasing interest on life cycle-based water indicators from different products, we ran a study on a hand dishwashing product. A number of water assessment methods were applied with the purpose of identifying both product improvement opportunities, as well as understanding the potential for underlying database and methodological improvements. The study covered the entire life cycle of the product and focused on environmental issues related to water use, looking in-depth at inventory, midpoint, and endpoint methods. Traditional water emission driven methods, such as freshwater eutrophication, were excluded from the analysis. The use of a single formula with the same global supply chain, manufactured in 1 location was evaluated in 2 countries with different water scarcity conditions. The study shows differences ranging up to 4 orders in magnitude for indicators with similar units associated with different water use types (inventory methods) and different cause-effect chain models (midpoint and endpoint impact categories). No uncertainty information was available on the impact assessment methods, whereas uncertainty from stochastic variability was not available at the time of study. For the majority of the indicators studied, the contribution from the consumer use stage is the most important (>90%), driven by both direct water use (dishwashing process) as well as indirect water use (electricity generation to heat the water). Creating consumer awareness on how the product is used, particularly in water-scarce areas, is the largest improvement opportunity for a hand dishwashing product. However, spatial differentiation in the inventory and impact assessment model may lead to very different results for the product used under exactly the same consumer use conditions, making the communication of results a real challenge. From a practitioner's perspective, the data collection step in relation to the goal and scope of the study sets high requirements for both foreground and background data. In particular, databases covering a broad spectrum of inventory data with spatially differentiated water use information are lacking. For some impact methods, it is unknown as to whether or not characterization factors should be spatially differentiated, which creates uncertainty in their interpretation and applicability. Finally, broad application of life cycle-based water assessment will require further development of commercial life cycle assessment software. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2013;9:633-644.

AB  - Fish embryos were used to evaluate the interaction among common environmental and chemical stressors found in urban coastal environments, namely hypoxia, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonists, and estrogenic compounds. At the molecular level, the systems responding to these stressors share common response factors, and evidence exists for cross-talk between them. Biomarkers of exposure to these stressors, cytochrome P4501a (Cyp1a), estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha), brain cytochrome P450 aromatase (Cyp19a2 or AromB), and hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (Hif-1 alpha) mRNA expression were examined using qRT-PCR simultaneously in embryos of two well studied species, the Atlantic killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, and the zebrafish Danio rerio. Embryos of both species were exposed to the model Cyp1a inducer beta-naphthoflavone (BNF) or 17-beta estradiol (E2) under either normoxic or hypoxic (5% oxygen atmosphere) conditions and harvested prior to hatch at 9 days post fertilization (dpf) for the killifish, and 48 h post fertilization (hpf) for the zebrafish. BNF significantly induced Cyp1a expression in embryos of both species with killifish embryos being more responsive (700-fold >control) than zebrafish embryos (7-100-fold > control). AromB was also significantly influenced by treatment, but to a lesser extent, with mean expression levels increased by less than two-fold over control values in response to E2, and in one case upregulated by BNF. ER alpha and Hif-1 alpha were constitutively expressed in embryos of both species, but expression was unaffected by exposure to either BNF or E2. Hypoxic conditions downregulated AromB expression strongly in killifish but not in zebrafish embryos. The impact of hypoxia on expression of other genes in either species was inconsistent, although an interactive effect between hypoxia and BNF on several of the genes evaluated was observed. These data are the first to examine expression patterns of these important environmental response genes together in embryos of two important model fish species. The results support the use of Cyp1a expression as a biomarker of AhR agonists in fish embryos, and indicate that AromB may be more responsive than ER alpha to estrogenic chemicals at this stage in development. Hif-1 alpha expression was not found to be a good biomarker of hypoxic exposure in either killifish or zebrafish embryos. The interaction observed between BNF and co-exposure to hypoxia warrants further investigation. Finally killifish embryos are generally more sensitive than zebrafish embryos at this stage of development supporting their use in environmental assessments. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Bromide redistribution as influenced by landscape morphology and pedogenic properties in a variable glacial till landscape: A quantitative examination. Can. J. Soil Sci. 88: 491-499. The spatial and temporal variability of soil properties with depth in the profile and across landscape positions results in diverse patterns of water and Solute distribution over the landscape. Vertical and lateral movement of soluble nutrients within the soil profile influences the availability of nutrients required for crop growth, and the entry of nutrients into groundwater and surface water systems. However, commonly used geomorphic concepts such as crest and depression are not rigorously, quantitatively defined. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of quantitative topographic variables and zones of relative surface flows oil vertical and lateral redistribution of a bromide tracer under field conditions in a variable glacial till landscape under zero tillage agricultural management. Tracer plots were established on three representative soil-slope associations and digital terrain models (DTM) were produced for determining slope gradient (G), horizontal curvature (Kh), vertical curvature (Kv), mean curvature (H) and accumulation curvature (Ka). Models of accumulation, transit and dissipation (ATD) zones of surface flows were produced for each digital elevation model (DEM) using data oil mean and accumulation curvatures. Topographic variables and soil properties had mixed ability to predict bromide redistribution parameters. Soil profile development indicators were negatively correlated with bromide recovery, indicating that increased profile development resulted in more redistribution and lower recovery rates. Pedogenic indicators were significantly different between ATD zones, with depth to calcium carbonate, A horizon thickness, solum thickness and profile development indicator all significantly greater at accumulation zones relative to dissipation or transit zones, indicating that profile development was greatest at accumulation zones. However, the concept of ATD zones did not correlate significantly with bromide redistribution parameters. The utility of ATD zones as a predictive tool for static soil properties is limited by differing hydrologic regime and pedogenic processes Occurring at lower slope positions, as a result of near-surface, dynamic water tables. Previous research, however, has shown that topographic variables and concepts of landscape element complexes have some utility in determining spatial variability of deep Solute percolation and determination of potential for groundwater impacts. This study indicates that increased N application in convergent portions of the landscape may result in higher rates of deep percolation and removal of N from the crop rooting zone, in areas of depression-focused recharge, when environmental conditions are favourable for such.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the response of native plant species to changed growing conditions, especially increased shade, following establishment of exotic Pinus radiata plantation on cleared native eucalypt forest. in the Northern Hemisphere, species tolerant to shading are typically herbaceous perennials, with large seeds, no obvious mechanism of seed dispersal, and spread by clonal means. We investigated whether life form, mode of seed dispersal, leaf area, specific leaf area (SLA), nutrient uptake strategy, seed mass, fire response, plant height, and clonal spread differed between understorey species of pine plantation and native forest. Further, we asked whether plant functional traits that confer tolerance to stress through shading differ from those in other floras. The study was conducted on the Delatite Peninsula in north-eastern Victoria, Australia. Vegetation of adjacent native forest and pine plantation were surveyed using eight 7 m x 7 m plots per site, randomly located within five paired sites. Differences in plant traits between land-use types were tested by Non-metric Multi-dimensional Scaling (NMDS), analysis of similarity (ANOSIM)and paired t-tests. Cluster analysis of the nine plant traits was used to define emergent groups, with differences between land-use types examined by ANOSIM and indicator species analysis. There was a significant change in the composition of understorey vegetation following conversion to pine plantation that included a decline in the richness of native species. NMDS of plant attributes showed a clear separation of native forest from pine plantation with land use strongly correlated in ordination space (r(2) = 0.611). Cluster analysis produced seven emergent groups of plant functional traits for 78 identified plant species. Phanerophytes split into two groups (myrmecochorous trees and shrubs; myrmecochorous shrubs), perennial herbs into four groups (upright herbs, myrmecochorous herbs, barochorous herbs, flat rosette herbs) with one group representing therophytes and anemochorous perennials. Perennial herbs with intermediate SLA and clonal spread were tolerant of the shaded conditions in pine plantation while the two groups of phanerophytes and the myrmecochorous herbs were largely excluded. Shared traits of excluded emergent groups included those that provided an over-riding adaptation to mineral nutrient stress. including myrmecochory, low SLA, ectomycorrhizal and ericoid mycorrhizal associations and N-2-fixation. These plant traits could not provide tolerance to stress through shading, which is better explained by the open canopied nature of the native forest. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Czech Republic is more or less unique in its dual system (official and market price) of agricultural land prices. In the case of the market price, there are several studies and approaches that assess the impact of individual variables on the market price of land. If we focus on the official price of land, its value in the Czech Republic is influenced by the evaluated soil ecological unit (ESEU) price. The ESEU price expresses the production potential of the land on the basis of soil quality indicators, which include the climatic region, the main soil unit, slope and exposure and, last but not least, the depth of the soil profile and skeletonisation. Climate change also means that the current values of the definition (e.g., for a climatic region, this refers to the average temperature or average precipitation) do not correspond to reality. No studies have looked in detail at the impact of soil quality indicators or climate change on the price of ESEUs. New and more accurate measurements of soil characteristics are increasing the number of ESEU codes, and prices have not yet been set for some codes. For this reason, we proposed the use of a hedonic method to determine shadow prices, which reflect the intensity and direction of the effect of each input variable on the price of an ESEU. A heteroscedastic corrected linear regression model was used to determine the coefficients, which presents in detail the effect of all included parameters on the final price of an ESEU in the results section. From the results, it was obvious that the shadow price coefficients themselves corresponded to basic generally accepted assumptions regarding the direction of effect. In the conditions of the Czech Republic, a significant influence on the price of an ESEU was mainly the slope with exposure and the depth of the soil profile with skeletonisation. These factors affected the productive capacity of the soil, which, in turn, translated into lower profitability of agricultural entities. The high explanatory ability of the hedonic model, with a high parametric significance for most of the used variables, was an important factor determining the robustness of the model as a repricing tool. The model set according to the prices of the applicable price decree can be used to set the prices of new or not-yet-valued ESEU codes under the conditions in the Czech Republic, or shadow prices can be used during climatic changes in the event of the transfer of the given soil unit to another climate region according to the general specification. It is therefore an important tool for the needs of the public administration.

AB  - Purpose Environmental impacts of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and internal combustion engine vehicles have been broadly studied and compared. However, there is scarce evidence of studies analyzing the potential effect of evolution key factors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate what would be the environmental impact of manufacturing BEVs and battery electric buses (BEBs) in Brazilian southeast, whereas vehicle mass reduction, material switching, energy consumption, battery improving, geographic adaptation of life cycle inventories, and electricity mix evolution effects are considered.
   Methods The methodology was based on adapting a representative number of global Ecoinvent V.3.2 datasets to better represent local conditions and subsequently to include evolution parameters for a 2030 scenario. Thus, we were able to establish a comparison for BEVs and BEBs in 2015 and 2030 for Brazilian and global conditions. This study compared BEV and BEB production (one vehicle as comparison unit) and also well-to-wheel (WTW) stage (1 km as functional unit). The research envisioned mass reduction configurations for cars and buses in 2030. BEV analysis in 2030 includes two material switching scenarios: plastic and aluminum prototypes.
   Results and discussion For one BEV as comparison unit, ozone depletion, human toxicity, metal depletion, and ecotoxicities displayed larger impacts for Brazilian cars, mostly due to material switching in the new prototypes, in spite of total mass reduction. In fact, neither the BEBs nor BEVs made in Brazil displayed a consistent environmental advantage over the global reference; and in fact, low production plants might cause larger impacts.
   Conclusions Life expectancy increase is suggested to be more effective in reducing impacts than mass or energy consumption reduction. For the 2030 BEV, an unexpected burden shifting result appears. Ozone depletion increases for the Brazilian aluminum prototype since emissions arising from scrap treatment do have a significant impact, even though mass reduction was considered. Bus results portrayed a tendency for Brazilian bus to perform better than its global counterpart except for metal depletion, ecotoxicities, and ozone depletion. A large environmental contribution from treatment of mining residues is common for human toxicity and freshwater eutrophication, the most concerning categories. Large contributions from mining residues led us to conclude that in order to manufacture environmentally competitive BEBs and BEVs, either reduction of impacts on metal extraction, e.g., copper, magnesium, etc., or metal use decrease must be prioritized. Negative consequences of vehicle evolution are especially concerning for human health and bodies of water, and impact decrease will be unlikely, at least until 2030.

AB  - An understanding of the quantitative relationship between watershed non-point source (NPS) pollution and lake nutrient enrichment is essential for the environmental management of water bodies. However, a lack of data availability and integration limit our understanding of this relationship. The most critical bottlenecks are the lack of adequate support for watershed-lake integrated data, a lack of data of the nutrient loading from watersheds into a lake as NPS, and the long-term time series data of lake nutrient concentrations. Since lake sediment is the ultimate destination of watershed nutrients, this study aimed to reveal the relationship between watershed phosphorus (P) concentrations that are transported into lakes and lake P concentrations by using inlet sediments as an indicator. Three typical sub-basins within Hongze Lake, China were selected as the study site, and 30-year dataset was calculated using the technology integration of remote sensing, sediment chemical analysis and SWAT model assessment. It can be concluded that, first, the Mineral-P (Min-P) accounted for nearly 65% of the watershed Total P (TP) loss, which varied over different basins and temporal periods. Second, the relationship between watershed P loss into lakes and sediment P concentrations represented obvious variation among different basins, sediment depths and P states. With respect to different basins, the highest correlation appeared in Basin 1, which had a R-2 value of 0.65 for Min-P. With respect to different P states, the Inorganic-P (IP) showed a closer relationship between watershed and lake P than Organic-P (OP), and the correlation coefficient (r) was higher than 0.6 in Basin 1 and Basin 3 for IP. In addition, the calcium-phosphorus ratio (Ca-P), which is largely sourced from watershed rock detritus by eroded runoff, played the most critical role among different Min-P states in the relatively ideal relationship of IP. With respect to different sediment depths, a stratification phenomenon existed in Basin 2 and Basin 3, which differed at specific depths. In particular, the ideal relationship only existed within the 7 cm depth from the bottom in basin 2, and this value expands to 10 cm for basin 3. This diversity was influenced by the integration roles from external and endogenous sources. All the findings indicated that lake surface sediment can be used as a proxy to represent NPS P loading under specific conditions. The relationship between watershed P loss and lake sediment P concentration was largely decided by land use/cover change (LUCC), meteorological conditions, and lake resuspension.

AB  - In forest ecosystems, assessment of evapotranspiration fluxes (ET) and distinction of its components, i.e. tree transpiration (T), rainfall interception (I), and soil plus understory evapotranspiration (ETu), are a major issue. At the Vielsalm Terrestrial Observatory in Belgium (VTO, Integrated Carbon Observation System network, ICOS), covered by a mixed forest of broadleaved (mainly Fagus sylvatica L.) and coniferous species (mainly Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco), the water vapor fluxes have been continuously measured by eddy covariance since 1996, without distinction of its components. Widely validated for CO2 fluxes, water vapor fluxes measured by eddy covariance still lack validation, particularly in mixed and/or heterogeneous stands. During 2010-2011, three other methods to assess ET were implemented, in order to inter-validate them and to disentangle species specific ET into its components. These methods were: (i) the analytical method which relies on measurement of each elementary flux, i.e. tree transpiration, interception loss and evapotranspiration of soil plus understory (ETA); (ii) the soil water budget method (ETS) and (iii) modeling of stand ET (ETM).
   Our results showed that during dry foliage conditions, stand T + ETu estimated by the analytical method or model were in very good agreement with eddy covariance ET measurements. Interception loss measured was 14% and 30% of rainfall (P) for beech and Douglas-fir respectively, leading to 19% for the whole stand. Beech interception being quite low, ETA for the stand is probably slightly underestimated. Over 2010 and 2011, the mean seasonal value of ET was 1.9 mm d(-1), considering all the methods. The four methods gave close estimates, with maximum deviations from the mean being of 12%, and uncertainties, while remaining acceptable (maximum 26% with analytical method) overlap between methods. Regardless of methods, flux measurements during rainy conditions were more complex to characterize. A slight underestimation of ET by the eddy covariance method was observed at different time step, in comparison to the others implemented methods. On an annual scale, the forest water balance model estimates (BILJOU(C); ETM) were similar in beech (68% of potential evapotranspiration, PET) and Douglas-fir sub stands (72% of PET), despite their differences in phenology and water use patterns. Low differences were also observed between species in the water flux, partitioning, with modeled ET composed of ca. 58%, 33% and 9% of T, I and ETu respectively on the annual timescale (2010-2011).

AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate production traits, egg quality parameters and welfare indicators of two strains of layers (Hisex White and Hy Line Brown) kept in different housing systems. In each housing system both strains of layers were housed and that made 6 treatments in 2 x 3 factorial design (2 genotypes x 3 cage types). A) conventional battery-cages with 5 hens per cage providing 500 cm(2) of floor space per bird (n = 180 (90 white and 90 brown layers), 36 cages in total, 5 hens/cage, floor space = 500 cm(2)/hen); 13) enlarged battery-cages with 5 hens per cage providing 650 cm(2) of floor space per bird (n = 120 (60 white and 60 brown layers), 24 cages in total, 5 hens/cage, floor space = 650 cm(2)/hen); C) enriched cages with 60 hens per compartment providing 750 cm(2) of floor space per bird (n = 360 (180 white and 180 brown layers), 6 cages in total, 60 hens/cage, floor space = 750 cm(2)/hen). Examination of egg quality parameters was carried out in 8 lour-week periods, starting from 32 weeks of rage on the random sample of 30 eegs per treatment. Condition of feathers ware evaluated by scoring system at the end of the production cycle (70 weeks of age), and at the same time duration of tonic immobility was measured. The results showed that white layers in conventional cages achieved the best production results. The highest number of eges was achieved with white layers in B and the lowest with the brown layers in C. White layers laid considerably more eggs compared to brown layers and had the best shell quality in all of the three housing systems. The birds in enriched cages laid significantly less eggs compared to other two cage types. The worst feather condition at the end of the production cycle was noticed in conventional cages (A) in both hybrids. Generally, brown layers suffered from more severe feather damage in all cage types compared to the white layers. The results showed a significant effect of cage type (p<0.01) and hybrid type (p<0.05) on duration of tonic immobility (TI) indicating that fearfulness of the birds was highly affected by, housing system and genotype. Birds from both genotypes kept in conventional cages showed a shorter duration of TI than the birds kept in enriched cages and the white layers showed longer duration of TI than the brown layers.

AB  - This paper describes a case of unexpected weak cyclogenesis over the northwestern Gulf of Mexico from 16 to 19 September 1984 based upon manually prepared and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) gridded analyses. Noteworthy aspects of the case include: 1) upward of 50 cm of rain along the extreme southern coast of Texas and 2) the brief occurrence of minimal strength tropical-storm conditions in a weak baroclinic marine environment. A crucial antecedent condition to rainstorm formation was the creation of a low-level baroclinic zone over the northwestern Gulf of Mexico due to the southward advance of drier and slightly cooler air behind a cold front that penetrated into northeastern Mexico. Four factors were responsible for rainfall concentration along the coast: 1) a northward-moving 700-mb trough and embedded vorticity maximum in the easterlies over the western Gulf of Mexico, 2) an eastward-propagating upper-tropospheric disturbance in the midlatitude westerlies over the southern United States to the north of a subtropical ridge line over Texas and Louisiana, 3) the formation of a weak midtropospheric baroclinic zone over the extreme north-western Gulf of Mexico, along which cyclonic-vorticity advection by the thermal wind contributed to a favorable environment for deep convection and cyclogenesis, and 4) the existence and maintenance of a weak north-south-oriented baroclinic zone along the Mexican coast in the lower troposphere.
   The coastal baroclinic zone was associated with a quasi-stationary axis of ascent that maximized at 700 mb and lay 200-300 km to the east of a persistent band of frontogenesis along the Sierra Madre Oriental Mountains of Mexico. Frontogenesis (approximately 2-4 X 10(-10)-degrees-C m-1 s-1) was dominated by the twisting term as relatively cool air over coastal Mexico was forced to ascend in the 700-mb easterly flow, favoring the northward movement of an area of cyclonic vorticity along the coast.
   The results from this study are compared and contrasted with a similar September (1979) heavy-rain event that also occurred in southern Texas. In both cases, cyclogenesis occurred in a weakly baroclinic environment with embedded convection concentrated along the boundary of the surface baroclinic zone. The paper concludes with a discussion of tropical-storm formation in a baroclinic environment. It is speculated that the apparent, but short-lived, minimal strength tropical-storm development in this case could not be sustained because of the absence of a significant upstream cyclonic-vorticity maximum aloft, despite otherwise favorable indicators for tropical cyclogenesis.

AB  - Core HU2008029-12PC from the Disko trough mouth fan on the central West Greenland continental slope is used to test whether an ice shelf covered Baffin Bay during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and at the onset of the deglaciation. We use benthic and planktic foraminiferal assemblages, stable isotope analysis of planktic forams, algal biomarkers, ice-rafted detritus (IRD), lithofacies characteristics defined from CT scans, and quantitative mineralogy to reconstruct paleoceanographic conditions, sediment processes and sediment provenance. The chronology is based on radiocarbon dates on planktic foraminifers using a Delta R of 140 +/- 30 C-14 years, supplemented by the varying reservoir estimates of Stern and Lisiecki (2013) that provide an envelope of potential ages. HU2008029-12PC is bioturbated throughout. Sediments between the core base at 11.3 m and 4.6 m (LGM through HS1) comprise thin turbidites, plumites and hemipelagic sediments with Greenlandic provenance consistent with processes active at the Greenland Ice Sheet margin grounded at or near the shelf edge. Abundance spikes of planktic forams coincide with elevated abundance of benthic forams in assemblages indicative of chilled Atlantic Water, meltwater and intermittent marine productivity. IRD and IP25 are rare in this interval, but brassicasterol, an indicator of marine productivity reaches and sustains low levels during the LGM. These biological characteristics are consistent with a sea-ice covered ocean experiencing periods of more open water such as leads or polynyas in the sea ice cover, with chilled Atlantic Water at depth, rather than full iceshelf cover. They do not support the existence of a full Baffin Bay ice shelf cover extending from grounded ice on the Davis Strait. Initial ice retreat from the West Greenland margin is manifested by a pronounced lithofacies shift to bioturbated, diatomaceous mud with rare IRD of Greenlandic origin at 467 cm (16.2 cal ka BP; Delta R = 140 yrs) within HS1. A spike in foraminiferal abundance and ocean warmth indicator benthic forams precedes the initial ice retreat from the shelf edge. At the end of HS1, IP 25 , brassicasterol and benthic forams indicative of sea-ice edge productivity increase, indicating warming interstadial conditions. Within the Bolling/Allerod interstadial a strong rise in IP 25 content and IRD spikes rich in detrital carbonate from northern Baffin Bay indicate that northern Baffin Bay ice streams were retreating and provides evidence for increased open water, advection of Atlantic Water in the West Greenland Current, and formation of an IRD belt along the W. Greenland margin.

AB  - 1. Analysis of fossil diatoms and pigments was used to examine the effects of land-management practises on the trophic status of Williams Lake, a eutrophic lake in central British Columbia, Canada. Published weighted-average (WA) models were used to infer changes in total phosphorus concentration (TP) during the past 200 years.
   2. Diatom-inferred TP (DI-TP) was compared to 20 years of direct chemical TP measurements to determine the accuracy of diatom-TP models in inferring mean summer TP in Williams Lake. Plant pigments were measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to quantify historical changes in gross algal community composition and abundance and to evaluate further diatom-TP inferences.
   3. Palaeolimnological analyses showed that Williams Lake has been productive throughout the last 200 years. Diatoms characteristic of alkaline, eutrophic conditions were continuously present c. 1765-1990 AD. Carotenoids from filamentous cyanobacteria (myxoxanthophyll, aphanizophyll) were regularly present in Williams Lake sediments, although cryptophytes (alloxanthin), diatoms (diatoxanthin), chlorophytes (lutein-zeaxanthin b-phorbins), and siliceous algae (diatoms, chrysophytes) or dinoflagellates (fucoxanthin) were also important components of past algal communities. Terrestrial disturbance (railway and road constructions, cattle ranching) increased lake production, but resulted in relatively little permanent environmental change.
   4. Comparison of DI-TP with measured TP (1972-91) showed that inferences from simple WA models were similar to average summer TP (39.1 vs. 35.2 mu g TP l(-1)). Inferences resulting from data manipulations that down-weighted eutrophic lakes (outlier elimination, bootstrapping) or diatom species (square-root transformation, tolerance-weighting) were weakly and negatively correlated with measured TP, introduced bias into inference models, or underestimated measured TP. These patterns suggest that, when using diatom-TP models developed from sparsely populated regions, accurate palaeoecological inferences for TP in eutrophic lakes should avoid data manipulations which down-weight the most productive sites and taxa.
   5. Comparison of DI-TP and fossil-inferred algal abundance during the past 200 years suggested that changes in nutrient inputs accounted for relatively little variation in past algal abundance. Although past changes in total algal biomass (as p-carotene) and DI-TP were broadly similar, the two variables were not significantly correlated (alpha = 0.05). In contrast, changes in DI-TP were significantly correlated with mean concentrations of diatom-specific carotenoids (diatoxanthin), although the explanatory power was low (r(2) = 0.16). These patterns suggest that the DI-TP model reflects more closely environmental conditions in Williams Lake during periods of diatom growth, and not necessarily those when total algal biomass is greatest.

AB  - It is not clear whether any particular type of forest land ownership is better than another regarding the quality of natural resource management. However, some researchers have found that communal ownership is efficient for this purpose, providing all members agree to establish operational rules and apply these in an atmosphere of cordiality and respect. In Mexico, 26% of the forests are privately owned, 4% are publicly owned and the remaining 70% are owned and managed by rural communities known as Ejidos and Comunidades. Studies of how forests and forest management may differ in relation to the type of land ownership in Mexico are scarce. Research on differences in tree species diversity in Mexican forests is desirable because species diversity is an important index in community ecology and may be affected by forest management. Moreover, tree species diversity is used as a biodiversity indicator in various monitoring schemes for sustainable forest management. In order to help resolve the lack of information regarding possible differences in forest management in relation to land ownership type in Mexico, the objectives of this study were as follows: (1) to identify groups of climatic, physiographical and social conditions that are almost homogeneous but widely separated from each other, and (2) to determine whether the type of forest land ownership affects tree species diversity within each group. Vegetation related data on 1592 plots in a forest area of about 6.33 million hectares were obtained from the Mexican National Forest and Soil Inventory. We used k-means clustering algorithms and the Affinity Propagation clustering, in an attempt to compare tree species diversity in communally and privately owned land. Finally, we used the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test and a permutation test to compare the mean values of the tree species diversity in each cluster of similar, special conditions identified.
   There were no significant differences in the mean values of tree species diversity between the two types of forest land ownership. Thus, the study findings did not support the hypothesis that tree species diversity tends to be higher in communally owned forests than in the privately owned forests in the study area. Future research is needed to address the following: (1) the effect of land ownership regime on forest fragmentation, (2) agreements among diverse stakeholders about the type of benefits derived, and (3) improvement of public policies aimed at cost-effective sustainable forest management, considering land ownership.

AB  - Young goats of the Slovak White Short-wooled breed of Saanen type (n = 80) were mated at the age of 8 months in fall 1995. They were divided into 5 groups according to their live weight at mating. The most extreme weights were observed in groups I and II with the average weight 18.96 kg and/or 24.47 kg, the values in other groups were 28.72 kg, 31.59 kg and 33.61 kg. Parameters of body development and production parameters were determined under balanced environmental conditions over the next year. The live weight of young goats substantially increased within 365 days while the relative weight growth in groups with the lightest animals was obviously higher in comparison with groups IV and V as if these groups "tried" to eliminate weight differences. When average live weight at 8 months of age is considered as 100%, it was higher by 88.40% in group I at 20 months of age, by 64.16% in group II, by 53.06% in group III, but by 41.56% in group IV and by 46.56% in group V (Tab. III). Differences between the groups were however statistically significant (F = 9.635). Average live weight of born kids was influenced tl, a lesser extent than the live weight of goats, but differences between the groups were statistically significant (F = 2.660 and/or 3.331). Tab. I shows data on the live weight of born kids and fertility including statistical indicators and significance of differences between the groups. The length of lactation period in 1996 was obviously different in group I only, where it nias by more than two weeks shorter in comparison with groups III to V, and by almost 13 days shorter in comparison with group II. The most significant differences between the groups were observed in total milk production (group I 286.47 1, group II 335.15 1, group III 376.21 1, group IV 431.11 1, group V 369.72 1) while F-test value was 7.288. The rate of weight gains in kids in a postnatal period was not influenced by the presence in the particular weight groups of their mothers. Besides group I, a total of 41 breeding young goats out of all the other groups were included in a herd for further breeding. The bulk of these goats were mated in September 1996 with respect to their average live weight and very good condition (Tab. I).

AB  - Average concentrations of chemical elements in the soil depends on the action of natural and techogenic factors and are characterized by different regularities of migration and accumulation in the lateral and radial directions. Study of concentrations of chemical elements in soils of different elementary geochemical landscapes makes it possible to identify some of the important statistically significant regularities of distribution of chemical elements on the territory of Irpin-Bucha-Vorzel of Kyiv suburban area. The analysis of 190 samples from 36 full-profile soil profiles formed the basis of compositional data (CoDa). CoDa is vector product of the measured values ff concentrations of chemical elements in each sample of soil. Geostatistical model biplot of CoDa is a hyperspace of geochemical factors and reasons with dimension corresponding to the amount determined in samples of chemical elements. Projection of hyperspace on the plane with "star" biplot especially together with projection of sampling points can demonstrate the probabilities of indicators of action of various geochemical factors and causes that occur in the study area. Clustering of sampling points occurs in a possible impact of certain factors on the group geochemical samples. The geostatistical parameters obtained by modeling So-Da in La-Ce-Nd 12-dimensional and Fe-Sr-Ga 9-dimensional hyperspaces mark an area of geochemical factor " influence of initial mineral composition of rocks". The area is defined by relevant geostatistical parameters Rb-Sr-Ba in 12-dimensional and Ba-R in 9-dimensional hyperspaces statistically "linked" to the acid-alkaline conditions in soils. Manganese area in the mentioned above area and 6-dimensional hyperspace of Fe mark the oxidation-reduction conditions in soils. Area of Pb suggests to determine a pyrogenic component of technogenic influence associated with vehicle emissions. Zn-Cu area is associated with impact of biogenic processes. Relative impact geochemical factors on the elemental composition of the upper (10 cm) layer of soil geochemical factors surveyed area are ranged in row: technogenesis > biogenesis > effect of initial lithogenic basis. The analysis of 6-dimensional hyperspace gave general trend to group between areas that are marked Fe-Sr-Ba-Rb (lithological and mineralogical factor) and Pb (technogenesis, especially atmospheric pollution caused by road). For soil sampling points of the subordinate landscapes there is a tendency to highlight grouped areas marked Fe-Sr-Ba-Rb, Zn and Zn, Pb. Geochemical factors and reasons most clearly effect in the analysis SoDa samples taken with reference to the genetic soil horizons than those selected from formal deep layer.

AB  - Outsized clasts (mainly white quartzite pebbles) are found in carbonate deposits of the Enciso Group exposed on the northern border of the Cameros rift basin (Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous, northern Spain). In the Arnedillo section, all the stones are enclosed in micrite, which was assumed deposited in littoral to open lacustrine environments, with minor inputs of deltaic sandstones. The clasts are found in fine-grained lacustrine sediments either as isolated stones or as loosely packed elongated clusters occasionally associated with quartz sands and gravels. The mean size of the clasts is 40 mm (range: 3-100 mm); they are polished, well-rounded, and lack any faceting or striae. Lithology suggests that the clasts were potentially supplied by three stratigraphic formations cropping out in the catchment area of the Cameros lake. The occurrence of outsized stones within featureless micrite indicative of low-energy conditions involves a hydrodynamic paradox which can only be resolved by their vertical or oblique emplacement in the host sediment as dropstones. The lack of mass-flow deposits in the Enciso Group precludes gravitational processes and suggests deposition from a rafting agent. Icebergs and stone-swallowing animals are the main transport agents identified in continental settings. Here, stone swallowing is rejected as the transport mechanism because the stones are loosely packed and are never associated with skeletal remains. Ice rafting is also rejected because of the low density of clusters, and the absence of faceting and striations which characterize glacial sediments. Furthermore, the sub-tropical position of Iberia, the absence of surrounding high relief, and global climatic models for the Aptian corroborate the absence of a glaciolacustrine environment. Consequently, we propose wood rafting as an alternative depositional mechanism for dropstones in non-glacial lacustrine environments. Although no direct evidence has yet been found (i.e. stones enclosed in the roots of rafted woods), several data support our interpretation. First, the occurrence of isolated stones and loosely packed elongated clusters is consistent with the fall of single stones or the disintegration of clods embedded among tree roots. The occurrence of large rafted conifer trunks in lacustrine deposits of the Enciso Group indicates that they may have rafted small clusters of stones from the catchment area into the lake. If wood rafting is a possible depositional mechanism, the occurrence of dropstones is consequently not a sound criterion for inferring the existence of glacial conditions in lacustrine environments. The reliability of wood-rafted dropstones in lacustrine settings as an indicator of paleoclimate is also discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. The results of a restoration experiment carried out on a permanent grassland on peaty, heavy clay in the Netherlands are described. The experiment started in 1985, 7 years after fertilizer application had ceased, and was designed to provide insight into ecologically significant processes accompanying restoration. An analysis was made of the effect of management regime and of raising the water table on nutrient availability, dry mailer production, tissue nutrient concentration, dynamics of species numbers and plant species replacement. Three management practices were compared: cutting and removal (RR), cutting and mulching (M M), sod removal in 1985, and thereafter cutting and removal of the hay (RS). Data are presented on changes during a 5-year period.
   2. No trend was discernible in soil pH, total C, N and P in the RR treatment; extractable P and K decreased sharply in the field with the raised groundwater level.
   3. Nine years after fertilizer application ceased, dry matter production had fallen from 10-11 to 6-7 t ha(-1) year(-1). In the subsequent 5 years of the experiment it declined to 5-6 t ha(-1) year(-1) when all cut biomass was removed. and to about 4 t ha(-1) year(-1) after sod removal. Mulching caused an increase to 11 t ha(-1) year(-1). No effect was seen of the raised water level.
   4. The dry matter yield of the first June cut in the RR treatment decreased. The tissue It concentration also decreased, but no increase of the tissue P concentration was detected. II was concluded that the availability of K and to some extent of P was more important than N availability in explaining the decrease in dry matter production. The tissue nutrient concentrations were not influenced by the water table.
   5. Sod removal to a depth of 5 cm resulted in the lowest productivity and the lowest tissue concentrations of P, while tissue concentrations of N and It were not affected.
   6. Raising the water level resulted in a more rapid establishment of species indicative of wet conditions, some of which invaded from nearby ditches.
   7. The trends of dominant species are described with a set of response models. The species were ranked from disappearing to colonizing species. The relationship between rank order of replacement and indicator values of species was investigated. Raising the water table resulted in species indicative of wet conditions becoming dominant, independently of vegetation management. The removal of nutrients resulted in the appearance of species with a lower maximal height, indicative of lower P and K availability.

AB  - This study aims to determine the yogurt drink spoilage profiles and its physico-chemical properties correlation as to investigate the coliform potability level upon exposure to an open air (unsealed condition). The commercially available three induced contamination of fruit (berry) flavoured yogurt drinks (labelled as A0 (original-flavoured Farm Fresh (TM)), A1 (Farm Fresh (TM)), A2 (Marigold (TM)) and A3 (Nestle (R))) were created to pre-run a spoilage indicator model system with regards to the colony formation unit (cfu) and its physico-chemical properties. Physio-chemical analysis (e.g., Brix, pH, colour and contact angle) and microbiological analysis were performed at 30 min intermittently for up to 4.5 h as soon as the food sample was unsealed (room environment condition: 27 +/- 2 degrees C; relative humidity (RH): 73 +/- 1%). The results showed the presence of yeast and fungus in yogurt drinks after all samples were opened and exposed to the environment. The total formation of yeast colonies and fungi of all three-yogurt berry drink brands on DRBC agar were inevitably high during the treatment (p< 0.05). The amount of cfu/ml of yeast and fungus was higher than the total coliform colony (Escherichia coli) formed throughout the sampling period. The pH analysis showed a significant decrease throughout the treatment due to the accumulation of lactic acid which resulted in high acidity (p < 0.05). The colour profiles of A1 brand showed a significant improvement as compared to A2 brand due to the increasing redundancy degree (p < 0.05). However, the A3 brand has a significant low reduction value, which is the degree of yellowness due to the microorganism's contamination. Finally, the contact angle analysis at 0:00-3:00 h, the range of contact angle of A1 (exclusively selected due to highly pathogenic spoilage) was 45.34-42.80 degrees while at 3:30-4:30 h was 58.66-61.12 degrees with diameter 0.9 and 0.7 cm respectively. In conclusion, the presence of yeast and mould was first detected in the samples as early as 0:30 h (1.4 x 10(4) cfu/ml) and become unsatisfactory after being exposed to environment for 4 h and 30 min. The contact angle spoilage indicator exceeds from 45.34 degrees (control) to 58.66 degrees as to tangibly indicate the unsatisfactory values in terms of microbiological quality and potentially harmful to the consumers.

AB  - This paper constructs a multidimensional typology that captures the contextual feature of Entrepreneurial Framework Conditions (EFC) across Russian regions. An overview of entrepreneurship research priorities in last decades shows that entrepreneurship's nature, extent and contribution to economic growth depend on the context in which it occurs. Contextual approach provides a deeper insight into adult's intrinsic incentives to become entrepreneurial that vary according to the regional "matrix" in which individuals exist and develop. We consider a problem statement, principles of interpretation, multidimensional statistical methodology and its perspectives for entrepreneurship research in the regional context. We proved that databases from the official statistics and microdata of adult population social surveys in this area need to be combined to develop a body of evidence-based knowledge on entrepreneurial context. The contextual approach was interpreted in terms of factor analysis (FA) as a statistical method to regroup interrelated variables into a limited set of unobserved factors based on a shared common variance and dimension reduction. The essential aim of analysis was a "parsimony" enabling to discover the simplest method of interpretation for Rosstat data on the regional EFC. On the base of FA procedure we identified 3 latent factors (instead of the primary set of 144 regional economic and social indicators) that can be interpreted as "Well-being", "Investment problems" and "Social problems". These unobservable variables could not be directly measured but they are hypothetical constructs represented a surrounding medium of entrepreneurship. The reduced database was applied for two-step clustering set of 79 Russian regions covered by GeoRating Survey in 2011 (FOM, about 60 thous. of respondents, 18 variables harmonized with Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Questionnaire) into three homogeneous regional clusters by the type of entrepreneurial context. The first cluster consisted of 6 prosperous regions; the rest regions were determined as disadvantaged areas and subdivided into clusters of "The lack of investment" regions and of "The most socially deprived" regions. Using multidimensional statistical methodology on the base of comparable and geographically coherent regional statistics on EFC in conjunction with adult population surveys microdata, the paper argued, one might consider and explain barriers and stimuli of entrepreneurship development in compliance with special regional features of entrepreneurial context reflected in terms of proposed typology. It is found that the type of entrepreneurial context determines the more of an indirect influence on individuals' decision to be entrepreneurial. The different regional clusters that are homogeneous by the entrepreneurial context show peculiar factors influencing individuals' optimism or pessimism on business prospects in a region both for entrepreneurial and non-entrepreneurial population.

AB  - Interest in palustrine carbonates and calcretes has increased over the last 20 years since they contain significant environmental information. Much of the work performed in this area has focused on either of two types of terrestrial carbonate-palustrine carbonates or calcretes (pedogenic and groundwater)-yet their simultaneous study shows there may be a gradual transition from one form to the other, revealing the interplay between pedogenic, sedimentary, and diagenetic processes. Three main factors control the formation of these carbonates: the position of the water table, the host rock, and the period of sub-aerial exposure. In pedogenic calcretes, precipitation of carbonate takes places mostly in the vadose zone above the water table, and within a previous host rock or sediment. In groundwater calcretes, the precipitation of carbonate also occurs within a previous host rock and around the groundwater table. In palustrine carbonates, however, the precipitation of lime mud occurs in a lacustrine water body. Palustrine carbonates necessarily form on previous lacustrine mud, whereas both types of calcretes may form on any type of sediment or soil. The sub-aerial exposure time needed to form palustrine carbonates may by relatively short (even a season), whereas pedogenic calcreles need more time (several years to millions of years). Groundwater calcretes do not form on the topographic surfaces, so there is no need of sub-aerial exposure. However, stable surfaces favour the development of thick groundwater calcretes. Small fluctuations in the water table cause gradual transitions of these three types of terrestrial carbonates and the subsequent mixture of their characteristic features, causing difficulties in the interpretation of these carbonates.
   The formation of these carbonates is controlled by palaeoenvironmental factors. Both commonly form in semi-arid climates. Arid climates are also suitable for calcretes, but sub-humid conditions are more suitable for palustrine carbonates. More indications of climatic conditions may be obtained through the analysis of the 6180 content of both calcretes and palustrine carbonates, and from the depth of the horizon containing carbonate nodules in pedogenic calcretes. Vegetation is also important in the formation of these types of carbonates. Data on the prevailing vegetation can be obtained from the analysis of the micro and macrofabric as well as from the delta(13)C signal of the primary carbonates, which, in pedogenic carbonates, has also been used to estimate atmospheric pCO(2) during the Phanerozoic. These terrestrial carbonates are widely distributed on floodplains and distal areas of alluvial basins. Their presence and characteristics can be used as indicators of aggradation, subsidence or accommodation rates, and therefore as indicators of different tectonic regimes.

AB  - Mountain recreational use of natural resources for active recreation, restore the health and strength of the people is actively developing. Physical and geographical factors of the climate of mountain regions, such as absolute altitude and landforms, create special climatic conditions that affect human activity. The Altai-Sayan mountain country is promising for the development of recreational nature management. Bioclimatic characteristics in mountain areas are poorly studied. There are few meteorological stations in the mountains.
   The repeatability (%) of the moment weather classes (K Pi M) is used to assess the impact of climate on the thermal state of a person in the mountains in the summer months. Six weather classes (hot and dry, warm, comfortable, moderately cold, cold, sharply cold) are identified for the summer period in the mountains. Significant correlation dependences of weather class repeatability depending on the absolute altitude of the terrain in the mountains were obtained. Separate weather classes for practical use were combined into integral weather groups: optimal (O Pi), satisfactory (Y Pi), unsatisfactory (HY Pi) and extremely unsatisfactory (KHY Pi). The number of days with favorable weather ((sic)Pi) and the number of days with unfavorable weather (H(sic)Pi) was calculated. The average number of days with precipitation was calculated to.. Complex bioclimatic indicators allow us to assess the impact of mountain climates on the thermal state of a person, recreational conditions, as well as on the mode of work and recreation of the population.
   Indirect methods with using absolute elevation have been applied to characterize the climate in mountainous areas when meteorological stations are located far from each other. A high correlation between the repeatability of weather classes and the absolute altitude was revealed. There is a close significant correlation between the number of days with different weather groups and the absolute altitude of the area. This allows you to use the dependence of weather groups on the altitude to analyze their patterns in mountainous areas. These characteristics can be used to assess climate comfort and effective recreational use of natural resources.
   The average long-term repeatability of weather classes and integral groups of favorable and unfavorable weather up to high altitude levels is demonstrated in the article. Modern global climate changes tend to increase the comfort of bioclimatic characteristics. Changes in the number of days with favorable weather during the summer period are not statistically significant yet. Effective use of climate resources in the mountainous regions of Siberia for recreational nature management should be based on modern complex bioclimatic indicators that take into account climate changes with altitude.

AB  - Educational facilities present the largest share of the oldest buildings in Europe and contribute greatly to high energy use. In order to stimulate building energy efficiency, the present day extensive renovations are going towards narrow-minded measures with minimisation of ventilation losses by minimal permissible design ventilation rates. In Slovenia, such an approach is supported by national legislation and results in uncomfortable and unhealthy conditions as well as other negative health-related outcomes. The main purpose of this study was to critically assess the relevant problems related to the deteriorated indoor air quality (IAQ) in a renovated kindergarten. First, a systematic literature review on health outcomes related to inadequate ventilation in kindergartens is presented. Second, in a case study on a renovated kindergarten in Slovenia, IAQ and energy use are critically assessed for 13 sets of scenarios, where design ventilation rates variated according to legal requirements and recommendations. CO2 concentrations were simulated in two model playrooms with CONTAM 3.2. Indicators of energy use were simulated with EnergyPlus 8.8.0, with and without recuperation. The results of literature review revealed that insufficient ventilation was positively associated with higher prevalence of negative health outcomes. Simulations of CO2 in two playrooms showed that the highest CO2 concentrations resulted in scenario 1 with 0.5 ACH and scenario 4 with 1.5 m(3)/(h center dot m(2)), both defined by national rules. The calculated values in both scenarios exceeded the national required value for CO2 (1667 ppm) by 2.5 times and 3 times, and the recommended value for Category I of indoor environmental quality defined by EN 15251: 2007 (750 ppm) by 5.6 times and 6.6 times. Scenario 9_Cat I with 14 L/(s center dot m(2)) defined by EN 15251: 2007 resulted in minimal CO2 (playroom 1: 512 ppm, playroom 2: 536 ppm) and corresponded to the recommended values defined by studies, where no health effects were observed. Energy simulations showed that the application of recuperation in scenario 9_Cat I, minimised heat losses by ventilation by factor 3.6 in playroom 1 and 3.5 in playroom 2 compared to losses without recuperation. Design ventilation rates defined by the design approach of minimal permissible value resulted in conditions relevant for Category IV of indoor environmental quality and have to be prevented. Recommendations in national policies and environmental health strategies can be used in all stages of healthy and energy efficient design of buildings.

AB  - Tail biting outbreaks in pig farming cause suffering through pain and stress, and producers lose revenue due to carcass condemnation. Reliable behavioural indications of when an outbreak is imminent would provide farmers with tools for mitigating the outbreak in advance. This study investigated changes in body and tail posture in the 7 days pre-outbreak.
   Pigs in 15 groups with a mean (+/- s.d.) group size of 27.5 (+/- 2.6; 427 in total) were raised from birth under intensive commercial conditions and with tails intact. Twice daily inspections were made, and a tail biting outbreak was identified (and treated) if 3 or more pigs had fresh tail injuries, or any pig was seen with a freshly bleeding tail or vigorously biting a tail. Video footage was recorded continuously to allow pre-outbreak behaviour recording of body posture (lying laterally, lying ventrally, sitting, standing) and tail posture (curled or uncurled (high, low, tucked)). Pigs were not individually marked, thus observations were made at pen level by group scan sampling 12 times per day on day -1, -3, -5 and -7 pre-outbreak. Each outbreak group was paired with a non-outbreak group of the same age and kept at the facility at the same time which served as a control. A total of 12 pairs were used. Outbreak pigs had fewer curled tails (P = 0.013) and more uncurled (P = 0.008) and tucked tails (P < 0.001) than control pigs overall, but particularly on day -1. Outbreak groups had more tucked tails compared to control on day -7 (P = 0.001). Tail posture did not vary over days, or with time of day. Body posture was not different between outbreak and control groups, and although it was affected by time of day, there was no interaction between outbreak vs. control condition and day, or time of day. Synchrony of behaviour between pigs (more pigs in the pen showing the same body posture) was not reduced in outbreak groups. In conclusion, this study supports other recent findings showing that an increase in tucked tails, and reduced curled tails is an advance indicator of a tail biting outbreak giving at least 7 days warning, and it does not matter what time of day tails are observed. Pig farmers could take note of tail posture changes to identify high risk pens. Considerable variability between pens, and in the timing and magnitude of change means that technology to automate tail posture detection will be of benefit.

AB  - The Seine river watershed (France) is a deeply anthropogenically impacted area, due to the high population density, intense industrial activities and intensive agriculture. The water quality and ecological functioning of the different rivers of the Seine drainage network have been extensively studied during the last fifteen years within the framework of a large French multidisciplinary scientific program (PIREN Seine program). This paper presents a synthesis of the main data gained in the scope of this program concerning the microbiological water contamination of the rivers of the Seine drainage network. The more common indicator of fecal contamination (fecal coliforms) was mainly used; some complementary works used E. coli and intestinal enterococci as alternative fecal indicators. Point sources (outfall of wastewater treatment plants) and non point sources (surface runoff and soil leaching) of fecal pollution to the rivers of the watershed were quantified. Results showed that, at the scale of a large urbanised watershed as the Seine basin, the input of fecal micro-organisms by non-point sources is much lower than the inputs by point sources. However, the local impact of diffuse non-human sources (especially surface runoff of pastured fields) can be of major importance on the microbiological quality of small headwater rivers. Fecal contamination of the main rivers of the Seine watershed (Seine, Marne, Oise rivers) was studied showing high level of microbiological pollution when compared to European guidelines for bathing waters. The strong negative impact of treated wastewater effluents outfall on the microbiological quality of receiving rivers was observed in different areas of the watershed. Once released in rivers, culturable fecal bacteria disappeared relatively rapidly due to mortality (protozoan grazing, lysis) or loss of culturability induced by stress conditions (sunlight effect, nutrient concentration, temperature). Mortality rates of E. coli were studied in different types of rivers within the watershed showing, in summer conditions, no major difference in the mortality rates in small and large rivers. As a result of these studies, a module describing the dynamics of fecal bacteria has been developed and embedded within a hydro-ecological model describing the functioning of the rivers of the whole watershed (the SENEQUE model). Once validated, such a model can be used for testing predictive scenarios and thus can be a very useful tool for the management of microbiological water quality at the scale of the whole basin.

AB  - Traditionally, sustained yield (SY) has been viewed as a pillar of sustainable forest management (SFM), but this has been increasingly questioned. Ensuring SY of some species, i.e., a "strong sustainability" paradigm, could be an inadequate criterion if consideration of the social and economic components of the SFM concept are desired. SFM was translated into the ATO/ITTO set of principles, criteria, and indicators (PCI) for forest management in the Congo Basin; it resulted in the necessity for a certified logging company to ensure that no significant change in structure and floristic composition would result from logging operations. Besides raising the question of where to place the change threshold, we argue that sustainability must be considered from three indissociable viewpoints: ecological, social, and economic. The issue is how to balance these criteria, knowing that this assessment will involve potential conflicts of representations and beliefs. To discuss these questions, we used the example of two heavily logged timber species in the Congo Basin, sapelli (Entandrophragma cylindricum) and ayous (Triplochiton scleroxylon). Using long-term data collected from permanent sample plots in M'Baki, Central African Republic, we calibrated a matrix model and performed short- and long-term simulations to examine ( 1) the potential effect of repeated logging of the species under the current national regulation system and ( 2) the rules that should be set to reach long-term SY. Ensuring long-term SY would require a 22% and 53% decrease in the felling intensity of E. cylindricum and T. scleroxylon, respectively, at first cut, together with an increase in overall logging intensity targeted toward less-used species. Light-demanding E. cylindricum and T. scleroxylon require open forests to regenerate and grow. This new set of rules is probably economically unsustainable for the current African forest industry, and will not meet the ecological requirements encapsulated in the ATO/ITTO PCI. We thus stress the following points: ( 1) the importance of most exploited species for the current industry may change as wood processing capacities become more efficient and markets change, potentially providing conditions for harvesting a greater number of species; ( 2) floristic change is unavoidable in these conditions, but this problem should be addressed at a broad scale, notably by ensuring a network of protected areas; ( 3) as long as the timber industry remains one of the few sources of employment and revenues in marginalized countries, reducing SFM to SY of the most exploited species on every concession appears questionable.

TI  - Variability of the cytological parameters of Pinus sylvestris L. seeds from the unique Hrenovskoy pine forest
T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS
LA  - English
AB  - Hrenovskoy pine forest is a unique island stand at the boundary of the species range of Scots pine Pinus sylvestris L. This object is of exceptional economic value, because it serves as a forest-seed base for the Voronezh oblast and some other regions of Russia; therefore, the stand and seed qualities have to be monitored constantly. The results of the first cytogenetic study of the seed progeny of P. sylvestris from the Morozov Grove, a high-quality stand in a reserved site within the Hrenovskoy pine forest, are reported. The studies have been performed in order to obtain a more correct assessment of seed quality based not only on their germination and energy of germination (traditionally used by forest breeders), but also on their genomic stability. The latter may be estimated by the stability of chromosome number in the somatic cells of seedlings and the regularity of mitotic divisions, because they also characterize the state of the generative system of parental forms and may serve as an integrated estimate of the stand development homeostasis. Therefore, the chromosome number, mitotic and nucleolar activities, and the number and spectrum of pathological mitoses (PMs) have been determined. Seedlings have been obtained from 240 seeds (collected from 12 trees) that resulted from free pollination. The cytological analysis of the rootlets of these seedlings has not detected any deviations from the chromosome number typical of the species P. sylvestris L. (2n = 24). However, considerable variation has been found in each family with respect to the mitotic index (MI) (from 4.2 +/- 0.36 to 8.1 +/- 0.39%) and the number of PMs (from 0.5 to 2.1%); micronuclei have also been found in each family (from 0.01 to 0.05%). In general, the phenotypic characteristics and the variation pattern of cytological parameters of the progeny of the trees studied in the Hrenovskoy pine forest, together with the high germination rate of seeds (90-98%), indicate that the current state of pines in the Hrenovskoy pine forest can be considered to be satisfactory. However, the presence of micronuclei in all variants and the decrease in MI in some individual plants (which was, on average, 6.1 +/- 0.03% in the sample studied, i.e., significantly lower than that of P. sylvestris from the Usmanskii pine forest (7.3 +/- 1.2%), where the conditions are optimal for this species) may serve as the bioindicators of the deterioration of both the state of trees themselves and the ecological conditions in the Hrenovskoy pine forest. Therefore, the population structure of this valuable autochtonic stand should be reproduced urgently.

AB  - The objective of this research is to introduce a novel framework to quantify the risk of the reservoir system outside the design envelope, taking into account the risks related to flood-protection and hydro-energy generation under unfavourable reservoir element conditions (system element failures) and hazardous situations within the environment (flood event). To analyze water system behavior in adverse conditions, a system analysis approach is used, which is founded upon the system dynamics model with a causal loop. The capability of the system in performing the intended functionality can be quantified using the traditional static measures like reliability, resilience and vulnerability, or dynamic resilience. In this paper, a novel method for the assessment of a multi-parameter dynamic resilience is introduced. The multi-parameter dynamic resilience envelops the hydropower and flood-protection resilience, as two opposing demands in the reservoir operation regime. A case study of a Pirot reservoir, in the Republic of Serbia, is used. To estimate the multi -parameter dynamic resilience of the Pirot reservoir system, a hydrological model, and a system dynamic simulation model with an inner control loop, is developed. The inner control loop provides the relation between the hydropower generation and flood-protection. The hydrological model is calibrated and generated climate inputs are used to simulate the long-term flow sequences. The most severe flood event period is extracted to be used as the input for the system dynamics simulations. The system performance for five different scenarios with various multi failure events (e.g., generator failure, segment gate failure on the spillway, leakage from reservoir and water supply tunnel failure due to earthquake) are presented using the novel concept of the explicit modeling of the component failures through element functionality indicators. Based on the outputs from the system dynamics model, system performance is determined and, later, hydropower and flood protection resilience. Then, multi-parameter dynamic resilience of the Pirot reservoir system is estimated and compared with the traditional static measures (reliability). Discrepancy between the drop between multi-parameter resilience (from 0.851 to 0.935) and reliability (from 0.993 to 1) shows that static measure underestimates the risk to the water system. Thus, the results from this research show that multi-parameter dynamic resilience, as an indicator, can provide additional insight compared to the traditional static measures, leading to identification of the vulnerable elements of a complex reservoir system. Additionally, it is shown that the proposed explicit modeling of system components failure can be used to reflect the drop of the overall system functionality.

AB  - Heat load is a challenge for high-producing dairy cows, with adverse consequences on production, reproduction, and welfare. The objectives of this observational study in 2 commercial dairy herds were to determine the effects of environmental heat stress on standing and lying behavior, to monitor the changes in core body temperature (CBT) of cows during lying and standing bouts, and to compare changes in CBT during standing bouts in freestall pens versus standing in holding pens. High-producing cows were selected for data collection over a period of 6 d of increasing heat stress during a heat wave to which they were not acclimated. A total of 20 cows were fitted with leg accelerometers that recorded lying behavior and with vaginal temperature loggers that recorded CBT. These data were recorded at 30-s intervals. Time in the parlor holding pen was calculated from automated parlor software that recorded milking unit attachment and removal times. Mean daily temperature humidity index in the pens increased from 68.5 to 79.0 during the 6-d trial, whereas mean daily lying time decreased from 9.5 to 6.2 h/d. The mean number of lying bouts per day remained similar at 11.1 to 12.2, but duration of lying bouts decreased from a high of 49.7 min on the coolest day to 32.8 min on the hottest day. During lying bouts, CBT increased at a mean rate of 0.50 degrees C/h. In contrast, CBT changed at a mean rate of -0.25 degrees C/h when standing in the freestall pens and only -0.09 degrees C/h when standing in the milking-center holding pens. Explanatory models for the CBT at which cows ended either standing or lying bouts were derived from 6 selected lying bouts and 3 selected standing bouts for each cow on each day. The CBT at which a cow ended a lying bout was positively related to CBT and temperature-humidity index at the start of the bout, bout duration, and rate of CBT change during the bout. The CBT at which a cow ended a standing bout was negatively related to bout duration and positively related to start CBT, start temperature-humidity index, and rate of CBT change. Insights into the thermodynamics of standing and lying behavior in dairy cows during periods of heat stress provided by this study may contribute to the development of more effective strategies to mitigate heat load in dairy cattle.

AB  - Forests play an important role in regulation of the global climate; moreover, they provide human beings with a whole range of ecosystem services. Forest health and ecosystem functioning have been influenced by anthropogenic activities and their consequences, such as air pollution, surface mining, heavy metal contamination, and other biotic and abiotic stress factors, which had an especially serious effect on central Europe. Many aspects of the physiological state of trees are more or less related to the concentrations of two main groups of leaf photosynthetic pigments: chlorophylls and carotenoids. Therefore, their contents can be used as non-specific indicators of the actual tree physiological status, stress and the pre-visible tree damage. Variations in leaf biochemical composition affect foliar optical properties and can be assessed remotely using high spectral resolution data (hyperspectral data). These data were successfully used in earlier studies to detect vegetation stress and damage. However, only a few approaches have dealt with the use of hyperspectral remote sensing to assess vegetation physiological status on a regional scale. Moreover, little or no research has been done on assessing vegetation health while utilizing multi-date hyperspectral images.
   In this study, the method for assessing forest health conditions using optical indices retrieved from hyperspectral data was applied to the two temporal HyMap date sets acquired in 07/2009 and 08/2010 to detect stress for the Norway spruce forests in Sokolov, NW Bohemia, a region affected by long-term extensive mining. The classification results were validated by ground truth data (total chlorophyll-Cab, carotenoids-Car and carotenoid to chlorophyll ratio-Car/Cab) and were associated with the geochemical conditions of the forest stands. Both biochemical analysis of the sampled foliage and classification of 2009 and 2010 hyperspectral image identified the same sites affected by vegetation stress. In addition to higher Car/Cab, which enabled detection of the stressed trees using hyperspectral image data, these sites showed critically low pH and lower values for the macronutrient parameters in both organic horizons and, in addition, both sites exhibit critically low base cation to aluminum ratios (Bc/Al) for lower organic and top mineral (0-20 cm) soil horizons.
   The results of this study demonstrate (i) the potential application of hyperspectral remote sensing as a rapid method of identifying tree stress prior to symptom expression, and (ii) the added value of multi-temporal approaches for hyperspectral data and its further potential for monitoring forest ecosystems.

AB  - Radiolabelled assays and compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) were used to assess methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) biodegradation in an unleaded fuel plume in a UK chalk aquifer, both in the field and in laboratory microcosm experiments. The C-14-MTBE radiorespirometry studies demonstrated widespread potential for aerobic and anaerobic MTBE biodegradation in the aquifer. However, delta C-13 compositions of MTBE in groundwater samples from the plume showed no significant C-13 enrichment that would indicate MTBE biodegradation at the field scale. Carbon isotope enrichment during MTBE biodegradation was assessed in the microcosms when dissolved O-2 was not limiting, compared with low in situ concentrations (2 mg/L) in the aquifer, and in the absence of O-2. The microcosm experiments showed ubiquitous potential for aerobic MTBE biodegradation in the aquifer within hundreds of days. Aerobic MTBE biodegradation in the microcosms produced an enrichment of 7 parts per thousand in the MTBE delta C-13 composition and an isotope enrichment factor (epsilon) of 1.53 parts per thousand when dissolved O-2 was not limiting. However, for the low dissolved O-2 concentration of up to 2 mg/L that characterizes most of the MTBE plume fringe, aerobic MTBE biodegradation produced an enrichment of 0.5-0.7 parts per thousand, corresponding to an epsilon value of -0.22 parts per thousand to -0.24 parts per thousand. No anaerobic MTBE biodegradation occurred under these experimental conditions. These results suggest the existence of a complex MTBE-biodegrading community in the aquifer, which may consist of different aerobic species competing for MTBE and dissolved O-2. Under low O-2 conditions, the lower fractionating species have been shown to govern overall MTBE C-isotope fractionation during biodegradation, confirming the results of previous laboratory experiments mixing pure cultures. This implies that significant aerobic MTBE biodegradation could occur under the low dissolved O-2 concentration that typifies the reactive fringe zone of MTBE plumes, without producing detectable changes in the MTBE delta C-13 composition. This observed insensitivity of C isotope enrichment to MTBE biodegradation could lead to significant underestimation of aerobic MTBE biodegradation at field scale, with an unnecessarily pessimistic performance assessment for natural attenuation. Site-specific C isotope enrichment factors are, therefore, required to reliably quantify MTBE biodegradation, which may limit CSIA as a tool for the in situ assessment of MTBE biodegradation in groundwater using only C isotopes.

AB  - Pedogenic carbonates are ubiquitous in paleosols through geologic history, and have been widely used to speculate on paleoclimatic conditions during their formation. They are widespread and well developed in large areas of Texas. A majority are of late Quaternary age and have formed across a range of climatic conditions on various types of substrates. To evaluate the usefulness of pedogenic carbonates as environmental indicators, this study investigates regional-scale trends in stable-isotope compositions of pedogenic carbonates across approximately 900 km of Texas.
   The delta C-13 values of 49 pedogenic carbonate profiles (182 analyses) on various host strata (e.g., limestone, igneous rocks), range from - 10.6 parts per thousand to +0.7 parts per thousand V-PDB. Most delta C-13 values are evenly distributed between -9 parts per thousand and -1 parts per thousand, and the delta O-18 values range from -9.1 parts per thousand to +0.2 parts per thousand V-PDB, mainly between -6 parts per thousand and -2 parts per thousand. There is no correlation between carbon and oxygen isotopic values (R-2 = 0.0002).
   Pedogenic carbonates in the Texas Gulf Coastal Plains, Southern High Plains, and west Texas exhibit higher delta C-13 values than those in south and central Texas, which corresponds to the spatial change in vegetation between C-4-dominated and C-3-dominated plants. The marked increase in delta C-13 values of the pedogenic carbonates from the Tertiary strata into the overlying Quaternary strata confirms the invasion of a C-4 biomass into the Southern High Plains since the early Pliocene. From east to west, the delta O-18 values of late Quaternary pedogenic carbonates decrease gradually, a trend that mimics the spatial variation of delta O-18 values of modern meteoric water primarily due to the increased distance from the Gulf of Mexico (source of most of the meteoric water).
   In contrast to the regional trends, the stable-isotope values of some pedogenic carbonates developed on marine limestone and calcareous alluvium in central Texas and south Texas have isotopic signatures inherited from the host strata. In addition, some of the delta C-13 values of pedogenic carbonate nodules in the Gulf Coastal Plains have been affected by saline groundwater. Soil carbonates formed in the shallow parts of the profile, such as petrocalcic horizons, may have also been influenced by the atmospheric CO2. Nevertheless, climatic trends are readily apparent in the isotopic data, thus demonstrating their potential value in region-wide paleoclimatic analyses.

AB  - A controlled trial on zero-grazed smallholder dairy farms was conducted to determine the effect of environmental and comfort improvements on sucking and lying behaviours in heifer calves on Kenyan smallholder dairy farms.
   The study involved 187 heifer calves from 150 farms in two Kenyan counties, 75 farms per county. Farms in one county received animal welfare training and improvements in the calf pen that included: 1) placement of rubber mats on the lying area; 2) fixing gaps/holes in the flooring and roofing; and 3) attaching a rubber nipple on the wall of the calf pen. During the 16-month data collection period, bimonthly farm visits were used to collect data on lying time (using accelerometers) and other animal- and farm-level factors. Multilevel mixedeffects linear regression was used to model daily lying times and frequency of lying bouts, with the animal as a random effect.
   Over the visits, daily lying times and lying bout durations averaged 12.6?86.7 min/bout, respectively, while the median for the frequency of lying bouts was between 30?46/day. Provision of rubber nipples for nonnutritive sucking lowered proportions of cross-sucking, self-sucking and object-sucking behaviours slightly but not significantly. In a final daily lying time model, superficial lymph node enlargement, body condition score and use of wood shaving/ sawdust/ crop waste as beddings had positive associations. In contrast, group housing and rubber mat use had negative associations with daily lying time. In an interaction term, lying time was significantly higher for calves on clean versus dirty floors if the age was <190 days but this difference diminished significantly in older animals. In a second interaction term, lying time was lower for calves with leaking versus non-leaking roofs, regardless of the pen floor level, but lying time was higher on elevated than non-elevated floors if the roof was intact. In the final model of the frequency of lying bouts, the use of a rubber mat, the years of experience in dairy farming, and calf body weight had negative associations. In contrast, body condition score had a positive association. In an interaction, the frequency of daily lying bouts was lower on clean floors than dirty floors, irrespective of tethering status, but when the floor was dirty, the lying bouts were higher for animals not tethered than the ones sometimes tethered. We conclude that the comfort improvements enhanced the welfare and lying experience of heifer calves on smallholder dairy farms.

As the isotopic composition of carbon (C-12(,)13) and oxygen (O-16(,)18) of these Sphagnum mosses are affected by environmental conditions, Sphagnum tissue accumulated in peat constitutes a potential long-term archive that can be used for climate reconstruction. However, there is inadequate understanding of how isotope values are influenced by environmental conditions, which restricts their current use as environmental and palaeoenvironmental indicators. Here we tested (i) to what extent C and O isotopic variation in living tissue of Sphagnum is speciesspecific and associated with local hydrological gradients, climatic gradients (evapotranspiration, temperature, precipitation) and elevation; (ii) whether the C isotopic signature can be a proxy for net primary productivity (NPP) of Sphagnum; and (iii) to what extent Sphagnum tissue delta O-18 tracks the delta O-18 isotope signature of precipitation. In total, we analysed 337 samples from 93 sites across North America and Eurasia us ing two important peat-forming Sphagnum species (S. magellanicum, S. fuscum) common to the Holarctic realm. There were differences in delta C-13 values between species. For S. magellanicum delta C-13 decreased with increasing height above the water table (HWT, R-2 = 17 %) and was positively correlated to productivity (R-2 = 7 %). Together these two variables explained 46 % of the between-site variation in delta C-13 values. For S. fuscum, productivity was the only significant predictor of delta C-13 but had low explanatory power (total R-2 = 6 %). For delta O-18 values, approximately 90 % of the variation was found between sites. Globally modelled annual delta O-18 values in precipitation explained 69 % of the between-site variation in tissue delta O-18. S. magellanicum showed lower delta O-18 enrichment than S. fuscum (-0.83 %0 lower). Elevation and climatic variables were weak predictors of tissue delta O-18 values after controlling for delta O-18 values of the precipitation. To summarize, our study provides evidence for (a) good predictability of tissue delta O-18 values from modelled annual delta O-18 values in precipitation, and (b) the possibility of relating tissue delta C-13 values to HWT and NPP, but this appears to be species-dependent. These results suggest that isotope composition can be used on a large scale for climatic reconstructions but that such models should be species-specific.

AB  - The intensification of agricultural practices has led to a severe decrease in grassland biodiversity. Although there is strong evidence that organic farming can reduce the negative impacts of land use, knowledge regarding the most beneficial management system for species richness on organic grasslands is still scarce. This study examines differences in the biodiversity of plants and butterflies on rotationally and continuously grazed pastures as well as on meadows cut twice per year on two large organic suckler cow farms in NE Germany. Vegetation and flower abundance, as factors likely to influence butterfly abundance and diversity, were compared and used to explain the differences. The data attained by vegetation assessments and monthly transect inspections from May to August were analyzed using descriptive statistics and nonparametric methods. The abiotic site conditions of the studied plots had more influence on plant species numbers than the management method. Dry and nutrient-poor areas (mainly poor types of Cynosurion) and undrained wet fens (Calthion) were important for phytodiversity, measured by the absolute number of species, indicator species for ecologically valuable grasslands and the Shannon Index. Meadows tended to have more indicator species than pastures, where small-scale special sites such as wet depressions were crucial for plant diversity. Butterfly diversity was very low, and 90% of the recorded butterflies were individuals of the generalist species Pieris napi. Butterfly abundance depended mainly on occurrence of specific habitat types and specific larval host plants. Supply of flowers was crucial only in certain time periods. Differences in butterfly abundance between the management systems could be explained by the site conditions of the studied grasslands. We conclude that meadows are more favorable to support ecologically valuable plant species; however, their extension is contradictory to the organic farming method of suckler cows maintained outside of stables. Rotationally grazed pastures could be a compromise that would enhance the temporal heterogeneity of flower abundance and vegetation structure. The plant diversity on pastures should be improved by less intensive grazing on special sites and plant species enrichment by means of hay transfer. For enhancing butterfly diversity we suggest to reduce land use intensity especially on poor soils. Considering the economic perspective of the farms, small parts of the agricultural area could be sufficient if connectivity to other suitable habitats is assured. Flower abundance and diversity of larval host plants could be promoted by high diversity of farming practices as well as preserving small uncut strips of meadows.

AB  - Constraints on plant water status and water use indicators were studied in orchard grown Olea europaea L trees, cv. Nocellara del Belice, in order to assess productivity and drought adaptation. The study was conducted on 16-year-old grafted plants. grown under different water treatments for 14 years in an experimental site plantation in southern Italy. Water treatments were: a non-irrigated, rainfed, control (TO) and three treatments that received seasonal water amount equivalent to 33 and 66% of crop evapotranspiration (ETC) from the beginning of pit hardening to early fruit veraison (respectively T33 and T66), and 100% of ETC throughout the irrigation season (T100). During 2006 and 2007 growing seasons, plants were continuously monitored by automatic point dendrometers measuring stem radius variation and whole-plant water use was determined using a xylem sap flow method (compensation heat-pulse technique). Additional ecophysiological parameters, such as stomatal conductance and water potentials were periodically measured, as well as vegetative development. Predawn leaf water potential decreased in rainfed trees and this was associated with increasing soil moisture deficit, while the difference between predawn and midday leaf water potentials increased, suggesting anisohydric regulation of plant water potential. Olive trees exhibited a tight stomatal control over transpiration, but insufficient to prevent loss of hydraulic conductance under severe drought stress. The stem radial increment and sap flux did not differ consistently between water treatments in the mild year (2006), while irrigated trees had higher water use than rainfed trees in the dry year (2007). However, plants growing under rainfed conditions showed a small increase in maximum daily shrinkage during drought periods compared to irrigated ones, although no marked differences were recorded between irrigated treatments. The mean daily transpiration rate, canopy conductance and decoupling coefficient were higher in 2006 than in 2007. the driest year. only, and in fully irrigated rather than rainfed plants. These results support the idea that rainfed trees had more conservative water use strategies than irrigated trees, and that deficit-irrigated trees acclimated somewhat functionally and structurally to long-term partial watering. Based on these observations, we can argue that loss of hydraulic conductance is an important mechanism for increasing stomatal control of transpiration under progressive soil drying. Another view implies that the increasing difference between soil and leaf water potential during summer induced stomatal closure and minimized the risk of a collapse of the conductive system, decreasing transpiration and reducing hydraulic conductance.

AB  - Methods and technologies enabling the estimation at large scale of important traits for the dairy sector are of great interest. Those phenotypes are necessary to improve herd management, animal genetic evaluation, and milk quality control. In the recent years, the research was very active to predict new phenotypes from the mid-infrared (MIR) analysis of milk. Models were developed to predict phenotypes such as fine milk composition, milk technological properties or traits related to cow health, fertility and environmental impact. Most of models were developed within research contexts and often not designed for routine use. The implementation of models at a large scale to predict new traits of interest brings new challenges as the factors influencing the robustness of models are poorly documented. The first objective of this work is to highlight the impact on prediction accuracy of factors such as the variability of the spectral and reference data, the spectral regions used and the complexity of models. The second objective is to emphasize methods and indicators to evaluate the quality of models and the quality of predictions generated under routine conditions. The last objective is to outline the issues and the solutions linked with the use and transfer of models on large number of instruments. Based on partial least square regression and 10 datasets including milk MIR spectra and reference quantitative values for 57 traits of interest, the impact of the different factors is illustrated by evaluating the influence on the validation root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP). In the displayed examples, all factors, when well set up, increase the quality of predictions, with an improvement of the RMSEP ranging from 12% to 43%. This work also aims to underline the need for and the complementarity between different validation procedures, statistical parameters and quality assurance methods. Finally, when using and transferring models, the impact of the spectral standardization on the prediction reproducibility is highlighted with an improvement up to 86% with the tested models, and the monitoring of individual spectrometer stability over time appears essential. This list inspired from our experience is of course not exhaustive. The displayed results are only examples and not general rules and other aspects play a role in the quality of final predictions. However, this work highlights good practices, methods and indicators to increase and evaluate quality of phenotypes predicted at a large scale. The results obtained argue for the development of guidelines at international levels, as well as international collaborations in order to constitute large and robust datasets and enable the use of models in routine conditions.

AB  - Increasing space allowance and enhancing environmental enrichment are two approved solutions to improve pig welfare in modern housing systems, while limited research regarding their interactions could be found. To determine the proper stocking density for growing pigs under China's production conditions, an experiment with a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement (three levels of space allowance x with/without toys) was conducted to evaluate the effects of space allowance and toy provision on the production performance, behavior and physiology of the pigs from the 7th to 13th week of age. Two hundred and sixteen pigs were randomly allocated to pens with the space allowances of 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 m(2)/pig, and the group size in each pen was fixed at 18. The results showed that the average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of the pigs with a space allowance of 0.5 m(2)/pig significantly decreased (P<0.05), while the average daily feed intake (ADFI) did not differ among the groups. Pigs housed in the lower space allowance of 0.5 m(2)/pig spent more time fighting and feeder occupying and less time lying and resting (P<0.05). With larger space allowances of 0.7 and 0.9 m(2)/pig, the surface temperature of the pig body in the middle and later stages after grouping was significantly lower (P<0.05). Toy provision inside the pens effectively decreased the water consumption of pigs at 0.5 m(2)/pig (P>0.01), while no difference was observed in body surface temperature and saliva cortisol concentration among all groups (P>0.05). Pigs gained more weight with toy provision, and their impact was especially enhanced as floor area decreased. Significant interacting effects of space allowance and toy provision on excessive drinker and feeder occupation and negative social behavior were observed (P<0.05). It is concluded that a higher space allowance is beneficial to weight gain, feed conversion and welfare of growing pigs. Toy provision can greatly reduce the excessive occupying behavior and aggression of pigs in barren and crowded environments, indicating that it could improve the growing pig's welfare by enriching the pen environment when the space allowance is limited at the commercial level. Space allowances ranging from 0.7-0.9 m(2)/pig with toy provision are suggested for intensively growing pigs under China's production conditions.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this research work is to design and apply LabVIEW in the area of traffic maintenance and flow, by introducing improvements in the smart city. The objective is to introduce the automated human-machine interface (HMI) - a computer-based graphical user interface (GUI) - for measuring the traffic flow and detecting faults in poles.
   Design/methodology/approach This research paper is based on the use of LabVIEW for designing the HMI for a traffic system in a smart city. This includes considerable measures that are: smart flow of traffic, violation detection on the signal, fault measurement in the traffic pole, locking down of cars for emergency and measuring parameters inside the cars.
   Findings In this paper, the GUIs and the required circuitry for making improvements in the infrastructure of traffic systems have been designed and proposed, with their respective required hardware. Several measured conditions have been discussed in detail.
   Research limitations/implications PJRC Teensy 3.1 has been used because it contains enough general-purpose input-output (GPIO) pins required for monitoring parameters that are used for maintaining the necessary flow of traffic and monitor the proposed study case. A combination of sensors such as infrared, accelerometer, magnetic compass, temperature sensor, current sensors, ultrasonic sensor, fingerprint readers, etc. are used to create a monitoring environment for the application. Using Teensy and LabVIEW, the system costs less and is effective in terms of performance.
   Practical implications The microprocessor board shields for placing actuators and sensors and for attaching the input/output (I/O) to the LED indicators and display have been designed. A circuitry for scaling voltage, i.e. making sensor readings to read limits, has been designed. A combination of certain sensors, at different signals, will lead to a secure and more durable control of traffic. The proposed applications with its hardware and software cost less, are effective and can be easily used for making the city's traffic services smart. For alarm levels, the desired alarm level can be set from the front panel for certain conditions from the monitoring station. For this, virtual channels can be created for allowing the operator to set any random value for limits. If the sensor value crosses the alarm value, then the corresponding alarm displays an alert. The system works by using efficient decision-making techniques and stores the data along with the corresponding time of operation, for future decisions.
   Originality/value This study is an advanced research of its category because it combines the field of electrical engineering, computer science and traffic systems by using LabVIEW.

AB  - A striking feature of UK public services in the 1990s was the rise of performance monitoring (PM), which records, analyses and publishes data in order to give the public a better idea of how Government policies change the public services and to improve their effectiveness.
   PM done well is broadly productive for those concerned. Done badly, it can be very costly and not merely ineffective but harmful and indeed destructive.
   Performance indicators (PIs) for the public services have typically been designed to assess the impact of Government policies on those services, or to identify well performing or underperforming institutions and public servants. PIs' third role, which is the public accountability of Ministers for their stewardship of the public services, deserves equal recognition. Hence, Government is both monitoring the public services and being monitored by PIs.
   Especially because of the Government's dual role, PM must be done with integrity and shielded from undue political influence, in the way that National Statistics are shielded. It is in everyone's interest that Ministers, Parliament, the professions, practitioners and the wider public can have confidence in the PM process, and find the conclusions from it convincing.
   Before introducing PM in any public service, a PM protocol should be written. This is an orderly record not only of decisions made but also of the reasoning or calculations that led to those decisions. A PM protocol should cover objectives, design considerations and the definition of PIs, sampling versus complete enumeration, the information to be collected about context, the likely perverse behaviours or side-effects that might be induced as a reaction to the monitoring process, and also the practicalities of implementation. Procedures for data collection, analysis, presentation of uncertainty and adjustment for context, together with dissemination rules, should be explicitly defined and reflect good statistical practice. Because of their usually tentative nature, PIs should be seen as 'screening devices' and not overinterpreted. If quantitative performance targets are to be set, they need to have a sound basis, take account of prior (and emerging) knowledge about key sources of variation, and be integral to the PM design.
   Aspirational targets have a distinctive role, but one which is largely irrelevant in the design of a PM procedure; motivational targets which are not rationally based may demoralize and distort. Anticipated and actual side-effects of PM, including on individuals' behaviour and priorities, may need to be monitored as an intrinsic part of the PM process.
   Independent scrutiny of PM schemes for the public services should be set up and must report publicly. The extent and nature of this scrutiny should be related to the assessed drawbacks and benefits, reflect ethical concerns, and conform with good statistical practice.
   Research is needed into the merits of different strategies for identifying institutions or individuals in the public release of PM data, into how new PM schemes should be evaluated, and into efficient designs for evaluating a series of new policies which are monitored by PIs.
   The Royal Statistical Society considers that attempts to educate the wider public, as well as policy makers, about the issues surrounding the use of Pis are very important. High priority should be given to sponsoring well-informed public debate, and to disseminating good practices by implementing them across Government.

AB  - There is a need to understand the physio-morphological responses of northern tree species to climate change. The hypothesis of the current study was that provenance and light intensity were both influential in the control of intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE). Diameter at breast height (DBH)-increment was hypothesized as being more affected by provenance. Intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE), the ratio of photosynthesis (A) to stomatal conductance (g(s)), was assessed in foliage under two levels of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; i.e., 300 and 1200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) in 63-year-old balsam fir [Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.] provenances derived from seed sources from across the species' natural range (namely, within 44-51 degrees N latitudes and 53-102 degrees W longitudes) and cultivated in a common garden in eastern Canada. Diameter at breast height (DBH) of provenances from the common garden were measured when they were 42 and 58 years old (DBH1998, DBH2014). The results confirmed the hypotheses regarding the roles of provenance on iWUE and DBH (p < 0.05), but showed a diminished role of PAR on iWUE. The lowest and highest mean iWUE and DBH among the provenances ranged between 0.028 and 0.031 and 0.079-0.083 mu mol mmol(-1) and 11.82-12.78 and 16.38-18.44 cm, respectively. Stomatal conductance of balsam fir had a strong relationship with iWUE at both light settings, whereas A had a weaker relationship with iWUE. There were no significant relationships between iWUE at the two light settings and climatic variables at the provenance source (p > 0.05). Diameter at breast height in 2014 was significantly greater than DBH1998 (p < 0.05). The relationships between DBH2014 and climatic variables at the provenance source were statistically significant (p < 0.05). There was a significant positive relationship between iWUE and DBH measured in 2014. Survivorship of provenances was shown to vary with DBH-increment. The results show that for present-day and future forest management, (i) selection in balsam fir, in relation to iWUE should ideally be based on a criterion of intraspecific stomatal conductance; (ii) shade tolerance of balsam fir, population differentiation, and consistent pace of DBH-growth under variable climatic conditions are important factors in the species' sustained growth under changes in forest dynamics projected to accompany changes in regional climate; (iii) temperature variables are strong indicators of DBH-increment in balsam fir; (iv) the effect of tree size on its survival is maintained under variable climatic conditions; and (v) there is a clear association between iWUE and the species' radial growth.

AB  - Because of the high pK(a) of boric acid, inorganic borates, when taken up by the human or animal organism, exist in the body almost exclusively in the form of non-dissociated boric acid. Therefore, the variety of inorganic boron compounds is commonly addressed in the toxicological literature as "boron" (B). There is a discussion concerning categorisation of inorganic boron compounds as reproductive toxins. Boron treatment of rats, mice and dogs was dose-dependently associated with testicular toxicity, characterised by inhibited spermiation at lower dose levels and by reduction of epididymal sperm counts at higher dose levels. The NOAEL for such fertility effects of boric acid in male rats (oral feeding, Sprague Dawley strain) was evaluated to be 17.5 mg B/kg bw per day. As far as developmental toxicity is concerned, oral dosing of 9.6 mg B/kg bw daily to female pregnant Sprague Dawley rats remained without effects, with foetal skeletal effects observed at higher doses. Therefore, 9.6 mg B/kg bw (oral dosing) was evaluated as NOAEL for developmental effects of boric acid. The blood level in rats, equivalent to this NOAEL, is 1270 ng B/g. As far as B-exposed humans are concerned, field studies on the effect of boron on human reproduction are possible only in a few boron-rich geographical areas. Published field studies were conducted in China's Liaoning province, the Argentinian Andes and Western Anatolia/Turkey. Particularly relevant are studies on occupationally B-exposed groups, because the potential exposure to boron is much higher in occupational compared to environmental settings. Comparison of estimated daily B exposure levels in humans and actually measured B blood levels confirms the preference of biomonitoring for exposure assessment in environmental and occupational studies. A boron blood level scaling shows that the levels of high occupational B exposures reported in China and in Turkey are compatible. Compared to the experimental B blood levels at boron-related NOAELs for male fertility and for developmental toxicity in rats, the human blood level means of the highest occupational exposure groups in China and in Turkey are lower by factors of > 4 and > 2, respectively. Basically, concentrations of B within the body that exert reproductive toxicity in humans are not reached under the conditions of human normal handling and use, including conditions of extreme occupational exposures. In consequence, all relevant results of studies into human reproductive toxicity of B are basically negative. Considering the effective doses, there is no scientific contradiction between experimental and human results of B reproductive toxicity.

AB  - Lacustrine source rocks are well developed within the Upper Cretaceous-Paleocene in the South Yellow Sea Basin (SYSB) in offshore eastern China. Understanding the deposition of these source rocks could provide critical information for hydrocarbon exploration in the SYSB, as well as reveal the paleoenvironment across the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary in eastern China. This study investigates the lacustrine environmental evolution during the Upper Cretaceous Taizhou Formation (K(2)t) to Paleocene Funing Formation (E(1)f) within the SYSB and its implications on source rock deposition based on core observation combined with organic geochemical indicators. Multiple maturity parameters (vitrinite reflectance, T-max and biomarker isomerization ratios) reveal that the organic matter (OM) has reached early oil window maturity. The OM of source rocks is dominated by kerogen Type II-III (liptinite and vitrinite). Anoxic, saline-brackish deep to semi-deep lacustrine environments prevailed during the deposition of K(2)t(2) (second member of the K(2)t), E(1)f(2) (second member of the E(1)f) and E(1)f(4)L (lower unit of fourth member of the Elf). The deposition of three intervals was influenced by marine incursion, as evidenced by geochemical and paleontological results. Low to moderate TOC contents (avg. 0.78 wt% to 1.91 wt%), which corresponds to low to moderate terrestrial OM input, are observed through three intervals. Abundant freshwater, together with high terrestrial OM flowed into the lacustrine environments during the deposition of E(1)f(4)U (upper unit of fourth member of the E(1)f), leading to dysoxic-oxic and freshwater conditions. High terrestrial OM input is probably the major controlling factor for relatively high TOC contents (avg. 2.49%) in the E(1)f(4)U. An evolution from balanced-fill to overfilled lake-type is observed in the Upper CretaceousPaleocene of SYSB, consistent with an evolution from semi-arid to humid paleoclimate conditions. The E(1)f(4)U and E(1)f(2) source rocks exhibit fair to good potential, whereas poor to fair potential is present in the E(1)f(4)L and K(2)t(2) source rocks. Compared with the Paleogene source rocks in onshore eastern China, the Upper CretaceousPaleocene source rocks in the SYSB probably hold good potential for generating commercial quantity of oil, although further study on hydrocarbon generation kinetics of source rocks and overall basin history are needed.

AB  - Aim: The success of inflorescence primordia initiation and differentiation within latent buds (i.e. bud fruitfulness) is a critical issue for grapevine yield sustainability under climate change. The aim of the present study was to track the timing and rate of inflorescence development in latent buds along the cane and to quantify their responses to elevated day/night (D/N) temperatures.
   Methods and results: The experiments were conducted under controlled conditions, using the microvine model, which is suitable for establishment in small areas. Two imagery methods for analyzing bud anatomy were assessed: light microscopy and x-ray microtomography. Light microscopy was laborious, but it was the most accurate method for investigating organogenesis in the primordial shoot of the latent bud. In plants grown in a greenhouse (D/N, 25 degrees C/15 degrees C), the number of phytomer primordia in latent buds increased linearly from the apical to the basal buds on the cane. A maximum of six phytomers and two inflorescence primordia were observed beneath the 20th bud position that is, slightly fewer than usually reported with macrovines. The first and second inflorescences started to differentiate at the 14th and 18th bud position, respectively. Temperature increases in the growth chamber (D/N, 20-30 degrees C/15-25 degrees C) only slightly changed the final number of preformed phytomers and the probability of inflorescence primordia differentiation per bud. However, elevated temperature sharply accelerated and thereby shortened development of the latent bud primordial shoot, resulting in differentiation of the first inflorescence primordia straight from the fifth bud position. Based on the spatiotemporal conversion of bud position into thermal time, the first inflorescence started to differentiate 332 growing degree days (degrees Cd) (or 41 days) after bud emergence at D/N 20 degrees C/15 degrees C, and only 98 degrees Cd (or 5 days) after bud emergence at D/N 35 degrees C/25 degrees C. Finally, the number of preformed phytomers was shown to correlate with primary bud length and cane diameter, independent of temperature. These easily measured variables may be used as indicators of bud developmental stage and potential bud fruitfulness in further studies using the microvine.
   Conclusions: The microvine appears to be suitable for parameterizing a developmental model of grapevine latent buds under controlled environmental conditions and when evaluating the response to elevated D/N temperatures.
   Significance and impact of the study: The precise description of the timing and rate of differentiation of phytomers and inflorescences opens new perspectives for understanding the molecular processes underlying the response of bud fruitfulness to environmental constraints.

AB  - The use of play as an indicator of animal welfare shows promise, and an arena test is one method used to assess how different procedures or housing conditions affect calves' motivation to perform locomotor play. However, it is unclear if this test reflects play in the home pen. In addition, the specific conditions of this test, including timing of the tests and design of the arena, vary between studies; the consequence of these differences in methodology is largely unknown. In a series of experiments, we explored the relationship between play in the home pen and arena (Experiment 1), how testing on consecutive versus alternate days (Experiment 2) and size and shape of the arena (Experiment 3) affected performance of play behavior. In all experiments running duration was continuously recorded. Additionally, the number of bucks, jumps, and kicks were recorded in the second and third experiments. On average, play in the arena reflected play in the home environment (r >= 0.56, P <= 0.002). However, neither play in the home pen nor the arena was consistent from day-to-day. In both the first and second experiments, frequency and duration of running were, on average, three times greater during the initial exposure to the arena than in subsequent tests, which may reflect calves' reaction to novelty or an increase in motivation to play due to restriction in the home pen. Conducting arena tests on alternate, rather than on consecutive, days had no effect on play. In contrast, calves spent more time running in larger (60 m(2) vs. 30 m(2); ranked means: 41 +/- 3.0 vs. 32 +/- 3.0 rank of s/15 min. P = 0.034: true means: 19 vs. 8 s/15 min) and longer pens (twice the length; ranked means: 40.6 +/- 3.0 vs. 32.4 +/- 3.0 rank of s/15 min, P = 0.054; true means: 18 vs. 9 s/15 min). This is likely due to the greater distance available for uninterrupted running in the larger and longer spaces. Calves tended to jump more often in the small pens (ranked means: 40.6 +/- 3.0 vs. 32.4 +/- 3.0 rank of times/15 min. P = 0.066; true means: 3 vs. 2 times/15 min), possibly because less space is required to perform this behavior. We found that while arena tests offer a promising tool for measuring play, caution is needed when interpreting these results, as more play is seen during the first exposure to this environment than in subsequent exposures, as well as in larger and longer arenas.

AB  - The oxidation state of transition metal elements is an indicator of the environmental conditions during formation and history of extraterrestrial materials. We studied the iron valence state of fine-grained material from a bulbous track extracted from the Stardust comctary collector. It likely originated from primitive material of the comet Wild 2. We used synchrotron-based Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy (STXM) to collect Fe L-3-XANES spectra at a spatial resolution of about 20 nm. Maps of Fe valence state were combined with the elemental maps recorded by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) with a transmission electron microscope (TEM), on the same areas and with a comparable electron probe size (520 nm). As for most Stardust fine-grained material, the samples are severely damaged by the hypervelocity impact in the aerogel collector blocks. They show of a wide range of oxidation state at a micrometer scale, from Fe metal to Fe3+. This heterogeneity of oxidation state can be due to the extreme conditions of the collection. Two major parameters can favor changes in redox state. The first is the high temperature regime, known to be highly heterogeneous and to have locally reached extreme values (up to 2000 K). The second is the local chemical environment. It may contain elements that could favor a reduction or oxidation reaction within the flash-heated Wild 2 fragments. Comparison of maps by STXM and EDS shows evidence for several correlation trends between element concentrations and the iron valence state. These observations, together with the study of a melted rim of a larger particle, suggest that the redox state was not completely redistributed within the impact melts. These local signatures are compatible with precursors that could have been close to primitive matrix material of chondrites or to chondritic interplanetary dust particles. On average, the fine-grained material from Wild 2 displays a molar fraction (Fe-oxide(2+) + Fe-oxide(3+))/(total Fe) equal to 0.80 +/- 0.10. It appears more oxidized than the average value measured for the comet, when done on larger particles (Westphal et al., 2009). This fine-grained material from Wild 2 does not seem to have sampled reducing environments in the solar nebulae in contrast with the larger particles of Wild 2. This observation confirms the high degree of diversity of materials in Wild 2 and is in good agreement with the dual distribution of high temperature minerals and matrices in carbonaceous chondrites.

AB  - Soil enzymes are indicators of microbial activities in soil and are often considered as an indicator of soil health and fertility. They are very sensitive to the agricultural practices, pH of the soil, nutrients, inhibitors and weather conditions. To understand the effect of an insecticide, acetamiprid (IUPAC Name: (E)-N1-[(6-chloro-3-pyridyl) methyl]-N2-cyano-N1-methyl acetamidine) on different soil enzyme activities, the experiments were conducted for three consecutive years (2003-2005) at control and cotton experimental fields of Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) and natural area (ridges with forest) in Delhi. The combined results for all three years were presented here to understand the impact of acetamiprid on soil enzyme activities. Acetamipruid was applied three times in one crop season after 41, 48 and 73 days of sowing, to control the pest. Soil of treated fields was analyzed for insecticide residues immediately after first insecticide treatment and thereafter at definite period. The residues of acetamiprid in experimental soil was varied from 0.30 +/- 0.13 to 22.67 +/- 0.2 mu g g(-1) d.wt. soil, during the crop period of 2003. The insecticide residues for 2004 ranged between 0.59 +/- 0.38 and 13.42 +/- 0.71 mu g g(-1) d.wt. soil and for 2005 it ranged between 0.48 +/- 0.22 and 19.81 +/- 0.33 mu g g(-1) d.wt. soil. An average half life of acetamiprid in our treated field was 11.2 +/- 1.7 days for all three years. Similarly, the soil from natural area and control were also tested for insecticide residues. No detectable insecticide residues had been found. Soil from three localities i.e. natural, control and experimental fields were tested for different enzyme activities. Nitrate reductase, arginine deaminase, urease and dehydrogenase activities were high in natural soil in comparison to control soil and insecticide treated soil in all three experimental years. At the same time, nitrate reductase activity was all time low in acetamiprid treated soil. Acetamiprid had inhibitory effects on nitrate reductase, arginine deaminase and urease activities. After first treatment (43 days after crop sowing), nitrate reductase (4 1%), arginine deaminase (22%) and urease (35%) activities were declined. Dehydrogenase activity increased to 22% after first insecticide application. Enzyme activities were recovered at the end of each crop season. Therefore, it can be attributed that agricultural practices, weather conditions and use of acetamiprid might be responsible for the different level of enzyme activities in soil.

AB  - The mean test size of planktonic foraminifera (PF) is known to have increased especially during the last 12 Myr, probably in terms of an adaptive response to an intensification of the surface-water stratification. On geologically short timescales, the test size in PF is related to environmental conditions. In an optimal species-specific environment, individuals exhibit a greater maximum and average test size, while the size decreases the more unfavourable the environment becomes.
   An interesting case was observed in the late Neogene and Quaternary size evolution of Globorotalia menardii, which seems to be too extreme to be only explained by changes in environmental conditions. In the western tropical Atlantic Ocean (WTAO) and the Caribbean Sea, the test size more than doubles from 2.6 to 1.95 and 1.7 Ma, respectively, following an almost uninterrupted and successive phase of test-size decrease from 4 Ma. Two hypotheses have been suggested to explain the sudden occurrence of a giant G. menardii form: it was triggered by either (1) a punctuated, regional evolutionary event or (2) the immigration of specimens from the Indian Ocean via the Agulhas leakage.
   Morphometric measurements of tests from sediment samples of the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 108 Hole 667A in the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean (ETAO) show that the giant type already appears 0.1 Myr earlier at this location than in the WTAO, which indicates that the extreme size increase in the early Pleistocene was a tropical-Atlantic-Ocean-wide event. A coinciding change in the predominant coiling direction likely suggests that a new morphotype occurred. If the giant size and the uniform change in the predominant coiling direction are an indicator for this new type, the form already occurred in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean at the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary at 2.58 Ma. This finding supports the Agulhas leakage hypothesis. However, the hypothesis of a regional, punctuated evolutionary event cannot be dismissed due to missing data from the Indian Ocean.
   This paper presents the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and thermocline hypothesis in the ETAO, which possibly can be extrapolated for explaining the test-size evolution of the whole tropical Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea for the time interval between 2 and 8 Ma. The test-size evolution shows a similar trend with indicators for changes in the AMOC strength. The mechanism behind this might be that changes in the AMOC strength have a major influence on the thermal stratification of the upper water column and hence the thermocline, which is known to be the habitat of G. menardii.

AB  - The Oligocene-Miocene Maikop Series is a world-class source rock responsible for much of the oil and gas found in the South Caspian Basin. It is composed of up to 3 kin of marine mudstone, and contains a nearly continuous record of deposition during progressive tectonic closure of the basin as the Arabian Peninsula converged northward into Eurasia. Historically, the stratigraphy of this interval has been difficult to define due to the homogenous nature of the fine-grained, clay-dominated strata. Outcrop exposures in eastern Azerbaijan allow direct observation and detailed sampling of the interval, yielding a more comprehensive stratigraphic context and a more advanced understanding of syndepositional conditions in the eastern Paratethys Sea. Specifically, the present investigation reveals that coupling field-based stratigraphic characterization with geochemical analyses (e.g., bulk elemental geochemistry, Rock-Eval pyrolysis, bulk stable isotope geochemistry) yields a more robust understanding of internal variations within the Maikop Series. Samples from seven sections located within the Shemakha-Gobustan oil province reveal consistent stratigraphic and spatial geochemical trends. It is proposed that the Maikop Series be divided into three members based on these data along with lithostratigraphic and biostratigraphic data reported herein. When comparing Rupelian (Early Oligocene) and Chattian (Late Oligocene) strata, the Rupelian-age strata commonly possess higher TOC values, more negative delta N-15(tot) values, more positive delta C-13(org) values, and higher radioactivity relative to Chattian-age rocks. The trace metals Mo and V (normalized to Al) are positively correlated with TOC, with maximum values occurring at the Rupelian-Chattian boundary and overall higher average values in the Rupelian. Across the Oligocene-Miocene boundary, a slight drop in V/Al, Mo/Al ratios is observed, along with drops in %S and TOC. These results indicate that geochemical signatures of the Maikop Series are regional in nature, and furthermore that analogous fine-grained sections may be better characterized and subdivided using similar techniques. In general, geochemical indicators suggest that the basin was in limited communication with the Tethys Sea throughout the Oligocene-Early Miocene, with suboxic to anoxic conditions present during the Oligocene and to a lesser extent in the Miocene. This increased isolation was likely due to tectonic uplift to both the south and north of the study area, and greatly enhanced by global sealevel fluctuations. These data serve as the basis for a more detailed understanding of the tectonic evolution of the region, and support a standardized chemostratigraphic division of the important petroleum source interval.

AB  - The need to develop the theoretical heritage of A.G. Kharchev predetermined the purpose of the article. It is based on A. Cherlin's statement about the difference between evolutionary and transformational changes in the institution of marriage as an alternative to the arguments about deinstitutionalization. Deviations (practices and attitudes) are considered as signs of transformation, and variations - the evolution of the institution of marriage. A hypothetical set of practices that can be qualified as deviations and variations of normative marital behavior and normative marital attitudes are presented. Practices and attitudes as indicators of deviations and variations were assessed on the basis of the analysis of subsamples of husbands and wives (RLMS-HSE 2002, 2003, 2009 and 2019) men and women (RLMS-HSE 1994, 2000, 2009, 2019, ESS-2018, VNDN-2019), as well as statistics and results of research.
   Divorce, premarital sexual relations and attitudes to their acceptability, pregnancies before marriage wives' attitudes to symmetrical distribution of roles are identified as deviations. In addition, more young husbands, especially those with higher education, have a strong influence on family decision-making compared to older husbands. The matriarchal type of decision-making that prevailed in the Soviet era in the conditions of the socialist economy, when both spouses had approximately equal salaries, is being transformed in the conditions of the market economy.
   Variations of normative marital behavior can be considered as stepfamilies, childlessness in marriage, acceptability of extramarital sex and opportunities for adoption of children by same-sex couples, cohabitation before marriage or instead of marriage without children, births outside marriage (the child is registered only by the mother), cohabitation of biological parents, i.e. fragile families.
   The paper shows a tendency to reduce the proportion of married people with secondary education in comparison to those with higher education, not only among men, but also among women. The data confirming the advantages of marriage for both men and women, especially in the elderly age, are presented. Husbands agree with the conservative distribution of roles regardless of age, while the share of such wives decreases in younger ages. Even among young spouses with higher education, there are almost twice as many conservative husbands as wives. This divergence of role expectations provokes a potential basic conflict in marriages. More young husbands and wives hold attitudes to the permissibility of sex outside of marriage, with the age of such spouses decreases. There is no data on the behavior of spouses in this area.
   The institution of marriage, at least in Russia, is developing and there is no reason to say that, at the beginning of the 21th century, it is deinstitutionalized.

AB  - The mesozooplankton community structure of a cold core eddy, moving through a coastal location (Bheemunipatnam) in the western Bay of Bengal (BoB), was studied continuously for 17 days (21st February to 8th March 2016) during Spring Intermonsoon. Vertical profiles of temperature, salinity and Chlorophyll a were measured in 1hr interval. Nutrients and dissolved oxygen were measured in every 3 hrs from 8 discrete depths. Mesozooplankton samples were collected through vertical haul (100 m depth to the surface) in 6 hrs intervals. Cluster analysis delineated the entire sampling days into 3 clusters based on temperature, salinity, anomaly of temperature and salinity in various depth layers Viz., phase I (Pre-eddy: 21st to 24th February), phase II (Core eddy: 28th February to 6th March) and phase III (Transition: 25th to 27th February and 7th to 8th March). The phase I was characterised as a comparatively warm, low saline, less nutrient and oxygenated subsurface water. During phase II, cool, nutrient-rich and oxygen deficient waters in the study location indicating the presence of a cold core eddy. Phase III is an intermediate condition between the phases I and II. Deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM) were shoaled to 23 m in Phase II from a depth of 38 m in Phase I. Mesozooplankton abundance was high during phase II (62320 No. m(-2)) compared to phase III (41633 No. m(-2)) and phase I (39510 No. m(-2)). Altogether 64 copepod species were identified of which, seven were dominant throughout the observation. Twelve species found as the indicator species in the core eddy condition. The high abundance of the Temora turbinata (upwelling indicator), Pleuromamma indica (low oxygen tolerant and highly central BoB reported) and occurrence of oceanic, oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) reported forms as indicator species in phase II is indicative of their entrainment from offshore by eddies. Eddy genesis and their movement tracking appear that this northeastern offshore formed cold core eddy advected to western coastal Bay of Bengal and traversing through the study site during the sampling period. Copepod species composition indicates the eddy trapped biological communities were sustained and retained in the core over a long period, and it advected over a long distance. This study is the first kind of information about northeastern offshore formed cold core eddy carries the plankton community in coastal waters of western BoB on their path and explains copepods community structure can be used as the indicator of eddy water masses.

AB  - Burning of waste heaps of coal mines causes pollution of the environment with toxic gases, increases the temperature of the environment thereby changing the microclimate of the mining area. The purpose of the work is to investigate the temperature and humidity conditions of extinguishing heaps in the spring period in Novovolynsk mining area of Ukraine. The waste heap No 1 of mine No 9 "Novovolynska" mine were chosen for the research because the combustion processes were observed there in spring.
   The following actions are foreseen to implement this goal: to determine the temperature on the surface of the heap and in the places of combustion; to determine relative humidity indicators of the rock at a depth of 5 cm, 30 cm, and 50 cm; to measure the radiation background at the extinguishing heap. The temperature of the surface of the extinguishing heap was determined by the contactless pyrometer NR-1300. Humidity of the rock was measured with a moisture tester MG-44. The radiation background was measured by dosimeter by SOEKS USA, LLC. The software is a package of applications Surfer, MS Excel, MS Visio. Statistical data processing was performed using correlation analysis.
   It was found out that: the highest temperature regimes (+33-39 degrees C) was typical for the sites in combustion areas that are located on the middle tier of the southern slope exposure; at a depth of 5 cm the highest humidity was at the foot of the western side of the heap (44.8%); at a depth of 30 cm the highest humidity was at the foot of the western side of the heap (47%); at a depth of 50 cm, the highest humidity was at the foot of the northern side of the heap (55.1%); the highest rates of equivalent radiation dose were observed near the combustion sites of the rock and reached up to 0.18 mu Sv / h; the temperature on the surface of the extinguishing heap correlates with a humidity at a depth of 5 cm (K = -0.58542), 30 cm (K = -0.75665), 50 cm (K = -0.78303) and does not depend on the radiation background at all (K = 0.368116). With an increase in the rock temperature its moisture decreases and vice versa - at high humidity the temperature of the rock reduces.
   Extinguishing heaps are environmentally hazardous as they cause emissions of toxic substances to the environment that do not decrease over the years. Extinguishing heaps due to combustion processes cause the burning of the root system of plants, that leads to the complications of recultivation.

AB  - The widespread use of the potential of vegetative communities of forest areas can require studying and assessment of melliferous resources for beekeeping. The research objectives included the melliferous capacity determination of plant formations in the forest area lands of the steppe Don Region. Studying the bee harvesting conditions in forestry is necessary for beekeeping planning, development of an apiary activity plan for a season, the choice of the method of beekeeping and methods of bees caring, the full use of honey resources; and to outline the ways to improve the honeybase. When assessing honey resources, we established areas occupied by honey plants, carried out the inventory of melliferous trees and shrubs in the sampling areas by the route method. The potential melliferous capacity is calculated per unit area. Melliferous lands and natural and climatic conditions in the forest area of the steppe Don Region are characterized by great variability. The results of the research establish that the Rostov Region with a forest cover of 2.5 % has a huge forest bioresource potential for honey harvest. Woody and shrubby melliferous vegetation (Norway, Tatarian, common maple), linden, black locust, pear, wild cherry, apple, apricot, willow, European cornel, blackthorn, white thorn, Tartarian honeysuckle, Tatar honeysuckle, yellowacacia, amorpha, European dogwood, Persian berry, silverberry, snowberry, frutescent cherry) grow mainly in forest plantations, as well as in ravine and floodplain forests. Oak ravine forests are characterized by maximal melliferous capacity on the light shores (426.4 kg/ha). At the same time, melliferous capacity per unit area increases with the increase of the share of common and Tatarian maple, little-leaved linden and elm. The first place by this indicator is occupied by maple forests of the oak ravine forests (369.1 kg/ha). In the floodplain formations, willow groves of coastal lowlands (156.6 kg/ha) have the highest productivity. Pure stands of common maple are most productive in a dry sedge oak-grove (1050.9 kg/ha). Oak-maple plantations with common maple (487.8 kg/ha), nut-linden (326 kg/ha); oaklinden plantations in the understory with Tatarian maple (306.4 kg/ha); linden-aspen plantations (421.6 kg/ha) are distinguished by significant melliferous capacity. Oak-maple plantations with common maple (with Tatarian maple in the understory) and a forest live cover with aise-weed, starwort, ground ivy and lungwort (603.4 kg/ha) show high melliferous capacity in the aise-weed sedge oak grove. With the skillful use of the melliferous potential of forest plants, we can successfully develop not only profitable beekeeping, but also significantly increase the forest resources of the southern regions of the European part of the Russian federation.

AB  - Agricultural manures are the source of several pathogenic microorganisms in surface and groundwater that could cause diseases and adversely affect human health. Some strains of E. coli, an indicator microorganism, when transported over and/or through the soils reaching the water resources, cause urinary tract infections, diarrheal diseases, and contribute to infant mortality, fatal renal or neurological complications. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no information about the bacterial transport through natural/intact calcareous and gypsiferous soils. In this study, we selected four soil types to investigate the influence of lime and gypsum content on transport and filtration of E. coli released from cow manure during saturated and unsaturated flows. Intact soil columns from Hamadan and Isfahan provinces in Iran were transported to the laboratory. Cow manure was applied to the surface of each column at a rate of 10 Mg ha(-1) dry basis. Soil columns were leached up to four pore volumes (PVs) at 20 degrees C. E. coli influent (C-o) and effluent (C) concentrations were measured by the plate-count method and C-o/C values were drawn vs. PV as breakthrough curves (BTCs). Filtration coefficient (lambda(f)), relative adsorption index (S-R), and maximum depth of potential contamination (Z(max)) were calculated as indices of filtration and transport processes. Our results illustrated that contamination of water is possible where flooding irrigation systems occur in the low-lime soil due to low ionic strength and salinity, and greater structural stability. The BTCs showed that preferential pathways are greater in the low-lime soils than in the other studied soils. The presence of the natural lime and gypsum affected solution chemistry, macro and microporosity of the studied soils, which resulted in more bacterial filtration. The soils high in lime and gypsum also had maximum values for lambda(f) and S-R, respectively. Minimum Z(max) was observed in the high-lime soil and its mean was significantly lower than in the three other soils. The Z(max) was greater in saturated flow conditions than in unsaturated flow conditions. Overall, when a source of E. coli (e.g. cow manure) is applied on a low-lime or gypsum soil, subsurface water contamination would be expected while high-lime and gypsum soils could filter more bacteria. This study showed the effect of natural lime and gypsum on bacterial transportation through intact soils. It is suggested to use techniques such as scanning electron microscope (SEM) and image analysis to present pore-scale information for bacterial movement through calcareous and gypsiferous soils.

AB  - Biogeochemical processes in the sea are triggered in various ways by chlorophyll-containing phytoplankton groups. While the variability of chlorophyll concentration at sea has been observed from satellites for several years, these groups are known only from cruises which are limited in space and time. The Geochemistry, Phytoplankton and Color of the Ocean programme (GeP&CO) was set up to describe and understand the variability of phytoplankton composition on large spatial scales under a multi-year sampling strategy. It was based on sea-surface sampling along the route of the merchant ship Contship London which travelled four times a year from Le Havre (France) to Noumea (New Caledonia) via New York, Panama and Auckland. Observations included the measurement of photosynthetic pigments, counts of picoplanktonic cells by flow cytometry (Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, and picoeucaryotes) and counting and identification of coccolithophores. The results confirmed that tropical areas have low seasonal variability and are characterized by relatively high divinyl-chlorophyll a and zeaxanthin concentration and that the variability is strongest at high latitudes-where the phytoplankton biomass and population structure are found to have large seasonal cycles. Thus, the spring bloom in the North Atlantic and an austral winter bloom north of New Zealand are marked by chlorophyll concentrations which are often higher than 0.5 mu g l(-1) and by high concentration of fucoxanthin (a pigment used as an indicator for diatoms), while summer populations are dominated by Prochlorococcus sp. and have low chlorophyll concentrations. Apart from this yearly bloom at temperate latitudes, fucoxanthin is scarce, except in the equatorial upwelling zone in the eastern Pacific Ocean, where it is found in moderate amounts. In this region, relatively high chlorophyll concentrations extend generally as far as 14 degrees S and do not respond to the seasonal strengthening of the equatorial upwelling during the austral winter. Prochlorococcus, which is known to dominate in oligotrophic tropical seas and to disappear in cold conditions, in fact has its minimum during the spring bloom in the North Atlantic, rather than during the winter. Coccolithophores are ubiquitous, showing a succession of species ill response to oceanic conditions and provinces. 19'Hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin, the pigment generally considered as all indicator of coccolithophores, is relatively abundant at all times and in all regions, but its abundance is generally not tightly correlated with that of coccolithophores. The regional differences revealed by these results are in overall agreement with Longhurst's division of the ocean into ecological provinces. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The accuracy of the thickness of lumber is one of the most important indicators of sawing. It is inextricably linked with saw stabilization in the plane of the greatest stiffness. The aim of the study is to eliminate the influence of lateral force on the saw blade and the thickness of the resulting lumber. The issue of eliminating the influence of lateral force in frame sawing and sawing on band saws belongs to the constructive decision in combination with the analytical one according to classical methods. Therefore, the most important issue in the development of a new machine is to identify the presence of a huge range of frequencies of natural and parametric oscillations of saw blades. Previously, these frequencies could not be analytically found to the full extent and, respectively, the tuning out the machine operating frequencies of the possible oscillation frequencies of saw blades could not be carried out. Due to the complexity and the science intensity of the problem solving, it is not conceivable without modern numerical methods of calculation. Among them are the finite element method, modern software of NX and ANSYS, as well as other original programs. One of such methods, which allow to reduce the influence of lateral force, is determination of stability of the plane form of bending by the Euler's method. The technical solution presented by a fundamentally new saw block with a circular translational motion of the blades reduce dramatically the impact of lateral force on the accuracy of sawing in conjunction with a number of other advantages. At the same time, the issue of ensuring the dynamic stability of the blades both when sawing and at idling speed is solved. It is necessary to point out that with circular translational motion the tooth side cutting edges are under alternating load when scraping over the cut surface. Therefore, the tooth cutting element is a subject of increased strength requirements. The angles of their sharpening were adjusted in order to preserve the integrity of the corners of the teeth tips. The possibility of strengthening the teeth lateral cutting edges of saw blades made of steels of different grades was investigated. The reasons of wear and corrosion, both the elements of the saw module and its operating part (blade teeth) were studied and it was decided to supply the teeth with a hard alloy of the stellite type as the most optimal. However, this provision requires additional targeted field tests. Preliminary calculations showed that the daily productivity of a machine with circular translational motion of the blades (model M2005) in comparison with saw frames increases by 2-4 times; in comparison with band saw equipment of any class by 3-6 times; and in comparison with the circular saw equipment (for small and medium enterprises) by 2-4 times. Analyzing the design scheme and the dynamics of the saw modules, it is possible to find a number of advantages of the multi-saw unit presented as part of the machine. The simplicity and reliability of the design allows us to hope for high functional characteristics. Among those we should highlight the following: increasing the accuracy of sawn products due to the rigidity of short blades, increasing the productivity, improving the quality of treated surfaces, as well as reducing the energy consumption, relatively light weight and dynamic balance of the main units with increased mobility of equipment and the absence of a massive foundation.

AB  - Most interpretations of quantum theory fail to provide a fundamental, complete, self-consistent account of nature describing physical reality itself, as opposed to merely yielding predictions about results of experiments and observations. A paradigm providing a self-consistent foundation for quantum theory and a description of the reality it refers to, generalized to a worldview, is a Quantum Paradigm, where 'paradigm' is defined as structure of experiential reality. We assert that the fundamental obstruction in the quest for a quantum paradigm is the assumption of objectivity. The subject-object distinction, drawn within experience, has within the natural sciences degenerated into a dichotomy-an absolute split into separate realms-with scientists adopting the classical paradigm where the object pole of experience ("objective reality") can be studied independently from the subject pole ("the experiencer"), with a presupposition that this procedure yields a fundamental description of nature. In fact, the subjective is often eliminated altogether as a fundamental category, and reduced to an epiphenomenon of objective processes. We claim this objectivity assumption precludes a full comprehension and a paradox-free formulation of quantum theory. By challenging this presupposition, i.e. leaving the question open, a coherent understanding of quantum nature falls naturally into place, providing appropriate foundation for quantum theory and an associated world-view. The resulting Quantum Paradigm is "realist" in the sense that it provides a description of what is actually happening: namely the arena of all happening is Mind or Consciousness-from which mind and matter, subject and object, individual and collective, and time and space co-dependently arise. The subject matter of quantum theory then becomes the fundamental mind-function of distinction ("measurement"), resulting in information and its statistical correlations. The message of quantum mechanics is surprising: the basic components of objects-the particles, electrons, quarks, etc.-cannot be thought of as 'self-existent'. The reality that they, and hence all objects, are components of is 'empirical reality', of experience." The universe begins to look more like a great thought than a great machine."-James Jeans Anomalous phenomena such as ESP and psychokinesis, collective consciousness, and synchronicity that are considered impossible in the context of the classical paradigm, fit naturally in, and can in turn provide evidence for the Quantum Paradigm. Spirituality and science are shown to be complementary approaches referring to the same reality, Mind, while each discipline retains its integrity. The Quantum Paradigm can be intellectually comprehended, as well as embodied: one can live in quantum reality. A good metaphor for this is "life as a dream": with no "real" objects as distinguished from experienced objects. Experience is "empty" of self-nature in the Buddhist sense, with everything interconnected and co-dependently arising. Experiencing the world by "embodying the Quantum Paradigm" is transformative, healing, and an antidote to alienation resulting from embodying the classical paradigm. Embodying the Quantum Paradigm and living in the Oneness of all creation can help humanity-increasingly lost in the materialism and individualism reinforced by our embodiment of the classical paradigm-and restore intimate connection and harmony with Spirit, Nature and fellow humans; we need such a transformation to survive and thrive in our technological society.

AB  - Black shales are sedimentary rocks containing > 0.5% of organic carbon. They host polymetallic deposits which have been mined for Cu, Ni, Zn, Mn, P, Mo, V, U, Au and PGE (platinum group elements). Even sub-economic occurrences provide potential risk of acid rock drainage when exposed to oxic surface environment. The natural acid neutralisation potential varies depending on the adjacent rock units, especially on the presence of calcareous rocks. The chemical and mineralogical composition of black shale is reflected in the quality of the surface waters and groundwater. Cu, Ni, Pb, U and Zn are recognised as major pollutants though the environmental impact is characteristically polymetallic just like the black shale occurrences. Hence, the environmental impacts have to be evaluated in each occurrence.
   The Proterozoic Ni-Zn-Cu-Co deposit at Talvivaara, Finland, is reviewed in more detail as an example of a large, low-grade deposit that is currently exploited with open pit mining and a bioleaching process, together with the Proterozoic Central African Copperbelt, the Cambrian U-Mo deposits in Sweden, the Cambrian Ni-Mo-PGE deposits in China and the Cambrian-Ordovician U deposits in South-Korea, the Devonian Ni-Zn-PGE occurrences in Yukon, Canada, and Kentucky, USA, and the Permian Cu-Ag deposits in Poland and Germany. The mineralised horizons may be merely few centimetres thick like in Yukon or hundreds of metres thick like at Talvivaara. Both natural and anthropogenic environmental impacts of black shales are reviewed world-wide, and based on the overview of the state-of-the-art an integrated research approach is suggested for the comprehensive assessment of the risk.
   Black shales are natural sources of soil and water contamination. At Talvivaara, the geochemical background includes higher than average concentrations of Ni, Cu, Zn and Mn in glacial till, peat, surface waters and groundwater as well as in stream and lake sediments. Bioaccumulation by plants has been reported in China and Korea. Even endemic diseases have been proposed to be linked with the contamination derived from the weathering and leaching of harmful elements from black shale. Anthropogenic actions exposing the black shale bedrock and associated soils to oxic conditions further intensifies acid rock drainage.
   Regional or nation-wide mapping of the black shales is recommended to detect potential risk areas. Finland has recently completed the country-wide mapping program of black shales with airborne geophysics integrated with geological, petrophysical and geochemical studies. The black shale database is actively used in regional planning and by environmental authorities, research institutes and consulting companies. In the case of the historical black shale mining areas like in the Kupferschiefer in Germany, restoration measures have been applied to prevent further acid mine drainage. In active and future mining projects, a comprehensive environmental impact assessment with effective monitoring programmes and closure plans play a crucial role in the prevention of acid mine drainage from the black shale -associated deposits.

AB  - Background: The potentially negative effects of timber harvesting on biodiversity and habitat conservation leads to the consideration of a wide range of restrictions to forest logging in natural areas. In particular, high noise levels produced by forest machinery present a challenge to developing sustainable forest management plans. The Cinereous vulture (Aegypius monachus), the largest bird of prey whose nests are located in mature trees, is considered to be appropriate as an indicator species for environment-friendly forest planning. In this work, we evaluated spatially differences in sound propagation between stands. We hypothesized that differences due to the influence of orography in mountainous forests would allow the relaxation of spatial and temporary restrictions to timber logging, without causing any great disturbance at nesting sites of sensitive species.
   Methods: Our study was conducted in a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) forest of Spain, where an important colony of the Western European population of Cinereous vulture is located. We built 62 noise maps to characterize noise pollution due to tree logging at planning level. We modeled two different scenarios, in order to characterize; (i) the effect of a chainsaw operator during a complete cycle for felling a tree (Scenario 1), and (ii) the effect of the peak level produced by the breaking noise emitted by the trunk of the tree and its impact on the ground (Scenario 2). A strategy of three logical steps was designed; (i) landscape-scale analysis of noise propagation in stands, (ii) hierarchical cluster analysis of stands, (iii) assessment of the potentially significant influence of noise management in timber harvesting.
   Results: The minimum distance (DIST) from chainsaw operator sites to the 40 dB(A) contour lines was the only variable that had a significant influence on the clustering results. On the other hand, mean values of a newly proposed metric called average radius or radial distance (ARD) oscillated between 174 m in cluster #1 (Scenario 1) and 407 m in cluster #2 (Scenario 2).
   Discussion: Our results highlight the convenience of considering noise modeling tools at a forest planning level in order to address the compatibility of forest logging and the necessity of protecting nature. We found that spatial propagation of noise made by chainsaws at felling sites does not differ between stands even in a mountainous terrain, contrary to what we initially hypothesized. However, temporary logging restrictions could be excluded in about 36% of the current conditioned management areas according to ARD results in Scenario 2 (400 m). This proposal could be based on a sound pressure level (in decibels) criteria instead of conventional buffer protection distance criteria. In addition, it is suggested that the current size of restricted management areas could be generally extended from a 100 m radius to a 200 m one around the Cinereous vulture nest sites.

AB  - Long chain (C-21 to C-37) n-alkanes are among the most long-lived and widely utilized terrestrial plant biomarkers. Dozens of studies have examined the range and variation of n-alkane chain-length abundances in modern plants from around the world, and n-alkane distributions have been used for a variety of purposes in paleoclimatology and paleoecology as well as chemotaxonomy. However, most of the paleoecological applications of n-alkane distributions have been based on a narrow set of modern data that cannot address intra-and inter-plant variability. Here, we present the results of a study using trees from near Chicago, IL, USA, as well as a meta-analysis of published data on modern plant n-alkane distributions. First, we test the conformity of n-alkane distributions in mature leaves across the canopy of 38 individual plants from 24 species as well as across a single growing season and find no significant differences for either canopy position or time of leaf collection. Second, we compile 2093 observations from 86 sources, including the new data here, to examine the generalities of n-alkane parameters such as carbon preference index (CPI), average chain length (ACL), and chain-length ratios for different plant groups. We show that angiosperms generally produce more n-alkanes than do gymnosperms, supporting previous observations, and furthermore that CPI values show such variation in modern plants that it is prudent to discard the use of CPI as a quantitative indicator of n-alkane degradation in sediments. We also test the hypotheses that certain n-alkane chain lengths predominate in and therefore can be representative of particular plant groups, namely, C-23 and C-25 in Sphagnum mosses, C-27 and C-29 in woody plants, and C-31 in graminoids (grasses). We find that chain-length distributions are highly variable within plant groups, such that chemotaxonomic distinctions between grasses and woody plants are difficult to make based on n-alkane abundances. In contrast, Sphagnum mosses are marked by their predominance of C-23 and C-25, chain lengths which are largely absent in terrestrial vascular plants. The results here support the use of C-23 as a robust proxy for Sphagnum mosses in paleoecological studies, but not the use of C-27, C-29, and C-31 to separate graminoids and woody plants from one another, as both groups produce highly variable but significant amounts of all three chain lengths. In Africa, C-33 and C-35 chain lengths appear to distinguish graminoids from some woody plants, but this may be a reflection of the differences in rainforest and savanna environments. Indeed, variation in the abundances of long n-alkane chain lengths may be responding in part to local environmental conditions, and this calls for a more directed examination of the effects of temperature and aridity on plant n-alkane distributions in natural environments.

AB  - Until the mid-sixties of the last century there was a full identification between the concepts of economic growth, development and welfare. With the advent of the Meadows report on "growth limits", scientific community warned of the negative impact on the environment of a development that was excessively focused on the maximization of production. In addition, the new conception of development introduced by Amartya Sen incorporates other alternative variables to per capita income as indicators of development, such as the degree of satisfaction of needs in the educational and health fields.
   As a consequence of these contributions, since the early 1990s the UN has been using the concept of human development, which is a process that can start all nations regardless of their starting conditions. The steady state of the classical economists is abandoned by a path of permanent evolution where freedoms and human capacities could be increased infinitely. People would become real protagonists and the ultimate goal of any development policy, with the main objective being to expend their capacities and opportunities from a multidimensional perspective, where the protagonism is shared between the state, the private sector and citizenship. We would thus have a model of development that does not rely on so heavily on the optimal combination of factors of production, but rather on uncovering untapped powers and resources.
   The main objective of this work has been the estimate of the socio-economic welfare of the counties of the Region de Murcia. A series of partial synthetic indicators are used of different dimensions (demographic, economic, labor, educational, environmental, patrimonial and housing magnitudes). The managers of public resources should increase the levels of this synthetic indicator of happiness, where we would move away from the steady state and approach a state of permanent evolution without an upper limit. This concept is based from the territorial pent of view on the theory of local human development, with the aim of encouraging citizen participation to improve the quality of life, the satisfaction of basic needs and the enhancement of the natural, cultural and historical heritage. Economic growth is a necessary condition for well-being, but not an end in itself.
   Although the terms of socio-economic well-being and quality of life can be considered as synonymous by the close separation between them, they refer to alternative measurement systems. While the first incorporates exclusively objective variables, the quality of life also comprises subjective perceptions of people about their psychosocial situation. In this paper we have chosen the use of objective social indicators of well-being, since there are no official statistics that include subjective variables at municipal or regional level. In this way we avoid the incorporation of human perceptions of a subjective nature, very difficult to measure. These indicators are quantitative, synthetic (summarizing the information contained in different partial indicators), multidimensional (covering several areas related to welfare) and established for a given space-time framework (refer to a given geographic area within a time interval definite). Therefore, they are not subjective indicators of happiness nor indicators of growth or strictly economic development, but emphasize a model of development created for people through the promotion of human capacities and the creation of the basic pillars of true development human.
   To quantify well-being the district level has been taken as a reference since it is the most suitable according to certain authors to secure a more balanced territorial development among different regions, since neither municipalities and provincial councils have managed to avoid the depopulation of more distant from urban areas municipalities. A classification has been made according to levels of socio-economic well-being following the P-2 Pena Trapero distance methodology, since all the requirements of a good synthetic indicator are fulfilled.
   Indicators have been selected taking into account the limitations of the statistical information for areas lower than the province, excluding dimensions such as civic engagement, health, subjective well-being, work-life balance and community. The partial indicator of human resources would be the most correlated with socioeconomic well-being, followed by the indicator of economic endowment, labor market structure and demographic dynamics. The indicators less correlated with well-being are those of housing, environment and historical-artistic heritage. In spite of the above, it should be noted that all synthetic partial indicators used positively contribute to well-being because correction factors never reach the unit value.
   Thus, the basic thesis of the development model advocated by Amartya Sen, where variables such as education and health could be used as an alternative to per capita income as development indicators, is fulfilled in this case.With special emphasis on this objective, that is to say, the improvement of the stock of human resources, it will be possible to get closer to the full development of the individual and collective capacities of the citizens, thus improving the other dimensions of welfare, not only economic.
   Under the last methodology, the regions with the highest socioeconomic well-being are Murcia (above the regional average), Cartagena and Vega del Segura (around the regional average). Northwest and Rio Mula would occupy the sixth and seventh positions, respectively, in spite of their high level (first position for the Northwest) in the indicators of housing, environment and historical-artistic heritage. The order would have been different lithe demographic and economic endowment indicators had not been considered in the study, which indicates that the Public Administrations should make a special effort in the latter two regions (Northwest and Rio Mula) to achieve greater population growth and income, making them more attractive to entrepreneurs and general population, as well as improving their educational structures and reducing early school drop-out rates. However, the results of the study need to be analyzed carefully because of the dependence of the variables used and the lack of municipal data.
   It is concluded that the Region of Murcia does not constitute a homogeneous entity, but it presents differences in the levels of well-being of the different territories considered (coastal regions and those related to large cities versus those of inland). Economic policy must follow a neo-structuralist approach to adapt to the different physiognomy of the territories analyzed.

AB  - Objective: At the environmental level, we should monitor the resistance genes in the air to control the occurrence of nosocomial infections. 2. The distribution of pathogenic microbes in different sections and seasons is different, and the resistance genes of resistant bacteria in different sections and seasons are detected to know whether the resistance genes in each department are homologous, so as to monitor the role of resistant bacteria in the air. 3. Detection of antagonistic genes can be used to understand the resistance of resistant bacteria to antibiotics, to discover the variation of resistance genes in time, and to guide the drug use scheme of drug resistant bacteria in this area.
   Methods: 1. Hospital air sample collection: 10 sampling points including the hospital corridor, emergency infusion, general outpatient, Department of respiration ward, neonatal ward, general paediatric ward, digestive ward, ICU ward, Department of cerebral surgery ward, urology ward, were used as the air medium sampling point, and the investigation of resistance gene pollution were conducted in four seasons: spring, summer, autumn and winter. 2. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of resistance genes: the target samples were collected for qualitative and quantitative analysis of target genes in the laboratory.
   Results: 1. All the air samples in the hospital environment were integrated to analyze the proportion and structure of the pathogenic microorganism in the hospital environment. The proportion of the number of pathogenic microbes in the hospital environment accounted for 3.64% of the total number of all the analytical samples. 2. In different seasons, the main pathogenic bacteria are different, and the drug-resistant bacteria are also different. In the general ward, ICU has different resistance genes. 3. The content of macrolide resistance gene was significantly higher than that of beta lactam and quinolone.
   Conclusions: (1) the basic status of resistance gene pollution in our hospital: The distribution of resistant bacteria in the air of general departments of hospitals and their resistance genes are homologous, because of the change of the first five drug-resistant bacteria with the seasonal changes, so we need to improve the daily disinfection measures of air conditioning and ventilation equipment and cut off the transmission routes every quarter. It is more effective to control the sense of the hospital. (2) The comparison of resistance genes of resistance bacteria in various quarters of the hospital to the conventional culture specimens avoids the repeated detection of the mine patient, and is more sensitive to the difficult culture bacteria than the conventional culture specimen. (3) Establish a resistance gene library of some drug-resistant bacteria in our hospital. In each quarter, each hospital department of pathology issued a microbiological room for different departments of drug resistant bacteria statistics. To increase the monitoring of drug resistance genes, improve the sensitivity of the original drug resistant bacteria monitoring, and reduce the biological pollution in the hospital environment can cause a series of epidemic outbreak of infectious diseases.

AB  - Utilization of the animal model should bring an important precise definition of breeding value estimation and improvement of the prerequisites for an increase in selection efficiency. Utilization of all available information on efficiency of ancestors and siblings and inclusion of repeatability of the observed properties were the priorities of this model.
   During the spot evaluation the class for efficiency was layed down on the basis of objectively determined live weight and pure wool production at the age of one year and it was joined with the class for fleece and exterior classifications. From synthesis of these data the final class is determined and it is a certain type of index. For the population observed we used this method in comparison with evaluation of the same properties by the animal model using the information from pedigree.
   Variability of properties and differences at population evaluation by the spot system presented in comparison with the animal model utilization were evaluated. We were finding out, whether the information on breeding value is more accurate and whether it can establish conditions for improvement of the efficiency of selection in the sheep population.
   The analysis of efficiency of the ,,Sumavka'' (S) sheep breed population and synthetic group of cross-breds with the different share of genes from the Romney Marsh sheep breed (Kent - K), Romanov sheep breed (R), Finnish sheep breed (F), Improved Wallachian sheep breed (ZV) and Texel sheep breed (T) was carried out. The population had been observed over the years 1988, 1989 and 1990.
   Totally 925 individuals were evaluated, out of which the efficiency is known for 515 individuals. The following indicators were evaluated: live weight, pure wool production and mean fineness at the age of one year. The analysis of the final breeding class, determined by the index of the basis of spot evaluation, was carried out. Steady effects on efficiency at the age of one year (genotype, litter size, dam age and the year and month of birth) were considered.
   All relations were used for numerical expression of estimation of breeding values of the individuals. Estimation was carried out individually for particular observed properties.
   Solving the problem is performed by the iterative method and statistical significances of particular effects are not known therefore. For all individuals both with efficiency measured and in pedigree an order in estimated breeding value for weight, pure wool and the class, determined by the spot evaluation at the age of one year, was laid down. Correlations among the indicators were calculated.
   Live weight at the age of one year was 42.65 kg and the average pure wool production was 3.11 kg (Tab. I). Standard deviation for both properties proves higher variability, which establishes conditions for efficient selection. The average of mean fineness - 37.61 mum expresses predominance of the initial breed. The individuals of similar type as the initial domestic breed, which is evidently the most suitable for the given environment, seem to be in the process of hybrid individuals selection also included into breeding. In this respect a natural selection could be of any effect, too.
   Found out differences in the live weight among the levels of steady effects were relatively small and they were approximately 7.81 % of the average weight, in the pure wool even only 6.11 %. The highest differences were found out in the mean fineness, they were 15.46 % there. Crossbreds with fertile breeds and the Texel breed reached the highest values in the live weight and the group of S x KJ crossbreds was the second. In pure wool shearing a group with the share of fertile and K breeds was manifested as the best and the initial S population was the weakest. In the mean fineness the highest values were found out for the group with smaller share of fertile breeds and the K breed. The initial S population had more crude wool. The deviations in the class correspond in an order with deviations of the genotypes in the mean fineness, but pure wool and live weight have the different order than the class determined by the index.
   Also a litter size had an effect on the differences in live weight and pure wool production. Singletons were heavier and they manifested higher pure wool shearing, mean wool fineness was higher comparing to the twins.
   The effect of dam's age was negligible for the indicators observed. The highest production values were found out in the progeny of three to four years old dams. For older and younger dams the live weight and pure wool of progenies decreased. Only in the mean fineness with the increased age of dams a finer assortment was gradually recorded.
   Besides the age also an effect of the year when a dam was born was considered and it can better express changing environment and genetic trend. The results indicate that some, however insignificant, differences actually exist. They were manifested in the live weight more markedly than in pure wool, but a trend in both properties was equal,
   Lay-out of breeding values, determined by the animal model, is besides pure wool considerably irregular and a higher part of individuals obtained negative breeding values. Variability for all the properties observed is adequate.
   Found correlations between utility properties and the class determined by the index were low and negative (class - live weight r = -0.089, class - pure wool r = -0.298, class-mean fineness r = -0.066). On the contrary the correlation among utility properties were higher, significant and positive (live weight - pure wool r = 0.554, pure wool - mean fineness r = 0.463).
   It is obvious that also another indefinable factors have an effect on the complex evaluation during the spot evaluation. Proper efficiency considers this evaluation only little. The class laid down from the efficiency spot evaluation and on the basis of visual classification is of a low conclusiveness, which can cause the differences between estimated and factual selection effect. The animal model utilization during the process of evaluation contributes to an objective utilization of complex information on the proper efficiency, parental and relationships efficiencies at simultaneous elimination of random and systematic errors.

AB  - Simple Summary Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen of dogs and cats able to cause both local and systemic infections. This bacterium is widespread in the environment, resistant to unfavorable conditions, and may spread between humans and other mammals. Its virulence and transmission rely on various virulence factors including those responsible for biofilm formation. Biofilm is defined as a complex biological system that is composed of exopolysaccharides, proteins, extracellular DNA, and biomolecules. Extracellular polymeric substances are the main ingredients of biofilm, accounting for 90% of its total biomass. In this study we analyzed the prevalence of five virulence genes involved in biofilm formation (pelA, pslA, ppyR, fliC and nan1) in 271 P. aeruginosa isolates obtained from dogs and cats. All animals had clinical symptoms of P. aeruginosa infection. In dogs, the strains were isolated from the external auditory canal, respiratory tract, and skin. In cats, the strains were isolated from the nasal cavity, external auditory canal, and skin. Biofilm-forming strains accounted for 90.6% of P. aeruginosa isolates from dogs and 86.4% from cats. The most commonly identified virulence factor gene was ppyR (97.4%). The fliC and pslA genes were detected in 62.4% and 60.1% of the study population, respectively, whereas nan1 and pelA genes were found in 45.0% and 38.7%, respectively. Prevalence of the virulence factor genes was not significantly different between dogs and cats. Given that the ability to form biofilm is related to the antibiotic resistance of P. aeruginosa, our results indicate potential candidates for biomarkers assisting in selection of the most effective treatment for P. aeruginosa infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an ubiquitous bacterium and opportunistic pathogen that plays an important role in nosocomial infections. The presence of virulence factors and the biofilm-forming ability of this species contributes to a high risk of treatment complications. In this study, we examined the biofilm-forming ability and the prevalence of five virulence factor genes (pslA, pelA, ppyR, fliC, and nan1) in 271 P. aeruginosa isolates (212 from dogs and 59 from cats). Biofilm-forming ability was detected in 90.6% of isolates in dogs and 86.4% of isolates in cats. In P. aeruginosa isolates from both species, the most prevalent virulence factor gene was ppyR (97.2% in dogs and 98.3% in cats), followed by pslA (60.8% and 57.6%), fliC (60.4% and 69.5%), nan1 (45.3% and 44.1%), and pelA (40.1% and 33.9%, respectively). In dogs, a significantly higher proportion of biofilm-forming P. aeruginosa strains possessed the fliC gene compared to non-biofilm-forming strains (p = 0.015). In cats, a significantly lower proportion of biofilm-forming strains had the nan1 gene compared to non-biofilm-forming strains (p = 0.017). In conclusion, the presence of fliC gene and the absence of nan1 gene could be indicators of biofilm-forming ability of P. aeruginosa.

AB  - Reconstructing the terrestrial palaeoenvironment during the end-Permian is made challenging by widespread erosion and ecosystem destruction. High-resolution sampling for palynofacies and palynology in sections that preserve the boundary interval allows for detailed examination of the drastic environmental changes that characterize the Permian-Triassic mass extinction. In the Bowen and Galilee basins in eastern Australia, this environmental perturbation is recorded within a Marker Mudstone that occurs above the uppermost Permian coal seams. The Marker Mudstone is used as a stratigraphic reference level at many localities, but has previously only been studied at a single locality in the Bowen Basin. In the present study, borehole Tambo 1-1A drilled in the Galilee Basin was selected to clarify whether this black, organic-rich mudstone marks a marine transgression, and to examine potential indicators of the end-Permian mass extinction. A total of 22 samples were taken from the mudstone unit, and from the over- and underlying strata and processed for palynology, palynofacies, and carbon isotope analysis.
   Biostratigraphic data indicate that the Marker Mudstone itself covers the uppermost part of unit APPS, with the first index taxa of unit APP6 floras occurring in samples less than 80 cm above this interval. This can be correlated with several other localities in the Bowen and Sydney basins where this shift occurs just above the uppermost Permian coal seam. Palynofacies data agree with previous interpretations of a southwards prograding delta that subsides as base level rises to form an extensive waterbody in which the Marker Mudstone was deposited. A change from translucent phytoclast-dominated to opaque phytoclast-dominated palynofacies within the Marker Mudstone suggests a shift to more oxic conditions in the water column, while base level begins to fluctuate, or increased terrestrial input from fluvial systems as the hinterland rises. Algal bodies resembling Botryococcus are found in the strata above the Marker Mudstone, but differ in morphology from the algal bodies found in the deltaic facies below. The presence of acanthomorph acritarchs in the Marker Mudstone and in the overlying Rewan Formation may indicate marine influence. Forms resembling fungal spores are present, but they do not show a "spike" as seen in other P-T boundary localities.
   The relative position of unit APP6 to the P-T boundary itself remains unclear. APP6 assemblages are dominated by simple acavate trilete and cavate trilete spores, which suggests stressed environment dominated by ferns and lycopods. The presence of degraded phytoclasts towards the top of the Marker Mudstone may also be used to suggest a mass-extinction interval. They may also be indicative of shifting local palaeoenvironmental changes, an interpretation that is supported by the low magnitude negative excursion of the delta C-13 isotope values within the Marker Mudstone. More datasets from the Bowen and Galilee basins will be essential to decoupling these signals. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ireland Ltd Elsevier B.V. and Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, CAS.

AB  - We projected changes in weather extremes, hydrological impacts and vulnerability to food insecurity at global warming of 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C relative to pre-industrial, using a new global atmospheric general circulation model HadGEM3A-GA3.0 driven by pattern of sea-surface temperatures and sea ice from selected members of the 5th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) ensemble, forced with the RCP8.5 concentration scenario. To provide more detailed representations of climate processes and impacts, the spatial resolution was N216 (approx. 60 km grid length in mid-latitudes), a higher resolution than the CMIP5 models. We used a set of impacts-relevant indices and a global land surface model to examine the projected changes in weather extremes and their implications for freshwater availability and vulnerability to food insecurity. Uncertainties in regional climate responses are assessed, examining ranges of outcomes in impacts to inform risk assessments. Despite some degree of inconsistency between components of the study due to the need to correct for systematic biases in some aspects, the outcomes from different ensemble members could be compared for several different indicators. The projections for weather extremes indices and biophysical impacts quantities support expectations that the magnitude of change is generally larger for 2 degrees C global warming than 1.5 degrees C. Hot extremes become even hotter, with increases being more intense than seen in CMIP5 projections. Precipitation-related extremes show more geographical variation with some increases and some decreases in both heavy precipitation and drought. There are substantial regional uncertainties in hydrological impacts at local scales due to different climate models producing different outcomes. Nevertheless, hydrological impacts generally point towards wetter conditions on average, with increased mean river flows, longer heavy rainfall events, particularly in South and East Asia with the most extreme projections suggesting more than a doubling of flows in the Ganges at 2 degrees C global warming. Some areas are projected to experience shorter meteorological drought events and less severe low flows, although longer droughts and/or decreases in low flows are projected in many other areas, particularly southern Africa and South America. Flows in the Amazon are projected to decline by up to 25%. Increases in either heavy rainfall or drought events imply increased vulnerability to food insecurity, but if global warming is limited to 1.5 degrees C, this vulnerability is projected to remain smaller than at 2 degrees C global warming in approximately 76% of developing countries. At 2 degrees C, four countries are projected to reach unprecedented levels of vulnerability to food insecurity. This article is part of the theme issue 'The Paris Agreement understanding the physical and social challenges for a warming world of 15 degrees C above pre-industrial levels'.

AB  - This paper is an extension of a previous paper where the natural and purified clay in the homoionic Na form were physico-chemically characterized (doi:10.1016/j.clay.2008.04.014).
   In this study, the adsorption behavior of U (VI) on a purified Na-smectite suspension is studied using batch adsorption experiments and surface complexation modeling (double layer model). The sorption of uranium was investigated as a function of pH, uranium concentration, solid to liquid ratio, effect of natural organic matter (NOM) and NaNO3 background electrolyte concentration.
   Using the MINTEQA2 program, the speciation of uranium was calculated as a function of pH and uranium concentration. Model predicted U (VI) aqueous speciation suggests that important aqueous species in the [U (VI)] = 1 mg/L and pH range 3-7 including UO22+, UO2OH+, and (UO2)(3)(OH)(5+). The concentration of UO22+ decreased and that of (UO2)(3)(OH)(5+) increased with increasing pH. The potentiometric titration values and uptake of uranium in the sodium smectite suspension were simulated by FITEQL 4.0 program using a two sites model, which is composed of silicate and aluminum reaction sites. We compare the acidity constants values obtained by potentiometric titration from the purified sodium smectite with those obtained from single oxides (quartz and a-alumina), taking into account the surface heterogeneity and the complex nature of natural colloids. We investigate the uranium sorption onto purified Na-smectite assuming low, intermediate and high edge site surfaces which are estimated from specific surface area percentage. The sorption data is interpreted and modeled as a function of edge site surfaces. A relationship between uranium sorption and total site concentration was confirmed and explained through variation in estimated edge site surface value.
   The modeling study shows that, the convergence during DLM modeling is related to the best estimation of the edge site surface from the N-2-BET specific surface area, SSA(BET) (thus, total edge site concentrations). The specific surface area should be at least 80-100 m(2)/g for smectite clays in order to reach convergence during the modeling. The range of 10-20% SSA(BET) was used to estimate the values of edge site surfaces that led to the convergence during modeling. An agreement between the experimental data and model predictions is found reasonable when 15% SSA(BET) was used as edge site surface. However, the predicted U (VI) adsorption underestimated and overestimated the experimental observations at the 10 and 20% of the measured SSA(BET), respectively. The dependence of uranium sorption modeling results on specific surface area and edge site surface is useful to describe and predict U (VI) retardation as a function of chemical conditions in the field-scale reactive transport simulations. Therefore this approach can be used in the environmental quality assessment. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the present age, environmental sustainability has been severely challenged because of the human constructions and changes in the ecological landscape of cities so that the issue of the compatibility of urban development with these changes has become especially important. Changes in morphology, structure, form and geometry of the cities, which are themselves caused by changes in the form of urban complexes and geometry of buildings, have a profound effect on the micro-climate and sustainability of urban environments by the efficient adjustments. To assess environmental sustainability or unsustainability in urban neighborhoods, thermal comfort is considered as a good indicator. The assessment of this qualitative concept requires the use of quantitative indicators and assessment tools that can be spatially presented to urban planners and designers to help them in urban development plans. The PMV/PPD model uses heat-balance equations and empirical studies to calculate the 'predicted mean vote' and 'predicted percentage of dissatisfied', which are somehow derived from the parameters that affect thermal comfort. The innovation of the present study compared to the background of the researches is the evaluation of urban building design policies in thermal comfort, which fills the gap between the evaluations of the level and scale of architecture and urban planning in previous researches. An applied and descriptive-analytical research method has been used in the present study. Firstly, data needed to evaluate the main purpose of the research in the selected site located in the Gheytariyeh neighborhood of Tehran were collected. They are then simulated and analyzed. The results indicate that the difference in the geometry of the buildings and the city blocks can make a difference in the heating comfort of the different city neighborhoods and residents. The recent study has proven that the difference in the city blocks (3- and 4-dimensional and square shapes) can affect the comfort and temperature factors. Spatial simulations conducted in the present study by ENVI-met software show that compared to other indices studied, the PMV and PPD indices have the least distance from the ideal thermal comfort conditions in the design of trilateral high-rise buildings and have the greatest distance from them in the design of rectangular building blocks. It is worth noting that the adoption of policies and regulations related to the design and architecture of urban neighborhoods by the implementation of urban development policies is one of the measures required when the urban development plans are drafted and approved. The simulations model indicates that the minimum and maximum values of PPD index have been respectively equal to 51.06% and 99.96% for the option 1 (three-sided block), 56.09% and 98.26% for the option 2(foursided block), 57.32% and 98.19% for the option 3(empty middle block) and 58.76% and 98.05% for the option 4 (rectangular block). The present paper has tried to explain the requirements of it.

AB  - A high resolution systematic geochemical mapping at regional-scale is considered to be the best available method to estimate geochemical baseline levels of trace elements in stream water, and is an essential part of environmental risk assessment. This methodology was applied in a project in the Itacaiunas River Basin, southeastern Amazon, Brazil, which includes several mines of the Carajas Mineral Province (as part of the Itacaiunas Geochemical Mapping and Background Project, ItacGMBP). A total of 1429 samples (including 55 duplicates) were collected in 2017 at 900 sites at one sample per microbasin, during both dry and rainy periods. The analyses of 34 elements were carried out using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). In general, the waters are slightly alkaline and are classified as mixed Ca-Na-HCO3 type, indicating that they are mainly influenced by silicate rock weathering. Most metal concentrations in the water are low, except Fe and Mn. Seasonality explains differences in metal concentrations, with higher values being obtained in the rainy season. Baseline threshold values (B-TVs) were calculated separately for both seasons by employing different statistical methods: iterative 2 sigma and DF preferentially delivered a more restrictive or conservative levels, which can be represenative of the natural B-TVs (NBTVs), considering as the least degraded with low or no significant level of anthropogenic influence; and 98th percentile provides the ambient B-TVs (AB(TVs)), which consists of natural plus diffuse anthropogenic input in the defined area. The AB(TVs) of Fe and Mn significantly exceed the WHO (1998) and CONAMA 357/05 limits. Spatial distribution indicates that Fe and Mn are not strictly related to geologic setting, rather they are highly influenced by specific local land use as well as deep weathering of the catchment and intense leaching and run-off during the rainy season. However, higher Mn occurrence in the dry period results from redox cycling of Fe and Mn via biogeochemical processes. The AB(TVs) of Ni, Cr, and V are controlled by bedrock lithology (geologic setting), mainly associated with mafic-ultramafic rocks; Cu is associated with two large hydrothermally mineralized copper belts. The estimation of baseline levels of As, Se, and Pb were highly limited due to of the large number of samples with results less than detection limits, in this case the 95th percentile was used for their B-TVs. Geochemical data as well as anomalous values for most of the metals indicate that anthropogenic influence from point sources is highly negligible in the basin, except at a few points, where high NO3- has been observed, probably due to more intense human and livestock activity. This study demonstrates that site-specific geochemical baseline assessment is a crucial factor when evaluating surficial water conditions in a large basin.

AB  - Soluble salts in saline soil often exist in the form of salt base ions, and excessive water-soluble base ions can harm plant growth. As one of the water-soluble base ions, Na+ ion, is the main indicator of the degree of soil salinization. The pretreatment of visible, near infrared and short-wave infrared (VNIR-SWIR) spectroscopy data is the key to establishing a high-precision inversion model, and a proper pretreatment method can fully extract the effective information hidden in the hyperspectral data. Meanwhile, different degrees of human activity stress will have an impact on the ecological environment of oases. However, there are few comparative analyses of the data pretreatment effects for soil water-soluble base ions on the environment under different human interference conditions. Therefore, in this study, the difference in the degree of soil disturbance caused by human activities was used as the basis for dividing the experimental area into lightly disturbed area (Area A), moderately disturbed area (Area B) and severely disturbed zone (Area C). The Grunwald-Letnikov fractional-order derivative (FOD) was used to preprocess the VNIR-SWIR spectroscopic data measured by a FieldSpec (R) 3Hi-Res spectrometer, which could fully extract the useful information hidden in the FOD of the VNIR-SWIR spectroscopy results and avoid the loss of information caused by the traditional integer-order derivative (1.0-order, 2.0-order) pretreatment. The spectrum pretreatment was composed of five transform spectra (R, R, 1/R, lgR, 1/lgR) and 21 FOD methods (step size is 0.1, derivative range is from 0.0- to 2.0-order). In addition, this manuscript compares and analyzes the pretreatment advantages between fractional-order and integer-order. The main results were as follows: (1) Grunwald-Letnikov FOD can reveal the nonlinear characteristics and variation laws of the field hyperspectral of saline soil, namely, due to the continuous performance of the order selection, the FOD accurately depicts the details of spectral changes during the derivation process, and improves the resolution between the peaks of the hyperspectral spectrum. (2) There is a big difference in the shape of the correlation coefficient curve between the original hyperspectral and Na+ at different FOD. The correlation coefficient curve has a clear outline in rang of the 0.0- to 0.6-order, and the change trend is gentle, which presents a certain gradual form. With the continuous increase of the order of the FOD, the change range of the correlation coefficient curve is gradually increased, and the fluctuation is greater between the 1.0-order and the 2.0-order. (3) Regardless of the transformation spectrum and different interference regions, the improvement effect of the FOD on the correlation between hyperspectral and Na+ is significantly better than that of the integer-order derivative. Comparative analysis shows that he percentage of increase of the former is more than 3%, and the highest is more than 17%.

AB  - The scarcity of research in NE China on lake ecosystem responses to large-scale climate oscillations since the last deglaciation limits our abilities for informing conservation practices and policies in the context of recent global warming. Here, a high-resolution, sedimentary diatom record covering the past similar to 17,500 years was retrieved from Lake Moon, a small, hydrologically closed crater lake in the remote central part of the Great Khingan Mountain Range in NE China. We compare diatom changes with geochemical data from the same core, and with regional palynological and dust deposition records, to better understand the influences of long-term environmental and climatic variability on aquatic ecosystems in this climatically sensitive region. Several abrupt and pronounced shifts in dominance among diatom taxa corresponded to marked fluctuations in the climate regime since the last deglaciation. During the close of the Last Glacial Period, a series of short-lived diatom shifts that were indicative of an increase in nutrients, signaled the transition from the cold period of the Heinrich event 1 (similar to 17,500-similar to 14,700 cal yr BP) to the warmer Bolling - Allerod interstadial period (similar to 14,700-similar to 12,900 cal yr BP). The onset of the cold Younger Dryas period was marked by a brief rise to dominance of benthic taxa (similar to 12,900-similar to 11,800 cal yr BP), followed by a pronounced lake ecosystem shift to a new trophic state at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition (similar to 11,800-similar to 9900 cal yr BP), evidenced by an abrupt rise to dominance of several eutrophic diatom indicators (e.g. Cyclostephanos dubius, Aulacoseira ambigua and Stephanodiscus parvus). This nearly complete compositional turnover was indicative of an increase in phosphorus supply to the lake with the onset of a warmer and moister climate and an increased frequency of strong dust storms. During the mid-Holocene (similar to 6000 cal yr BP), a striking increase in the relative abundance of Discostella pseudostelligera and Asterionella formosa, at the expense of previously dominant eutrophic indicators, signified another lake ecosystem change from well-mixed, turbid and phosphorus-rich conditions to a lower nutrient state with longer open-water periods and increased thermal stability. The turnover to oligotrophic diatom taxa was likely in response to variations in seasonal temperature, precipitation and dust deposition. The diatom shifts of Lake Moon during the past similar to 17,500 years were directly or indirectly mediated by climate change that affected thermal stratification, productivity, lake level and trophic state. Our results indicate that climate change had an overarching control on aquatic ecosystem changes in the mountain regions of NE China since the last deglaciation. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In terms of origin, grasslands in Central Europe can be classified into (i) natural grasslands, predetermined by environmental conditions and wild herbivores; (ii) seminatural grasslands, associated with long-term human activity from the beginning of agriculture during the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition; and (iii) improved (intensive) grasslands, a product of modern agriculture based on sown and highly productive forage grasses and legumes. This review discusses the origin, history and development of grasslands in Central Europe from the Holocene (9500 BC) to recent times, using archaeobotanical (pollen and macroremains), archaeozoological (molluscs, dung beetles, animal bones) and archaeological evidence, together with written and iconographic resources and recent analogies. An indicator of grasslands is the ratio of non-arboreal/arboreal pollen and the presence of pollen of species such as Plantago lanceolata and Urtica dioica in sediments. Pastures can be indicated by Juniperus communis pollen and charcoal present in sediments and the soil profile. Insect-pollinated species can be studied using cesspit sediments and pollen (from honey) in vessels in graves. In Central Europe, natural steppe, alluvial grasslands and alpine grasslands occurred before the start of agriculture in the early Neolithic (5500 BC); their area was small, and grassland patches were fragmentary in the forested landscape. Substantial enlargement of grasslands cannot be expected to have occurred before the late Bronze Age. The first scythes come from the 7th-6th century BC; therefore, hay meadows probably did not develop before this time. There is evidence of hay meadows in Central Europe during the Middle Ages, documented by macroremains of Arrhenatherum elatius in sediments, written records and long scythes in archaeological assemblages. Based on macroremains analyses, we conclude that there was generally high diversity of seminatural grasslands in the cultural landscape in the Middle Ages, and individual grassland communities were generally species rich. From the beginning of the agriculture until the 18th century, pastures and pasture forests were dominant sources of forage. Large-scale enlargement of hay meadows and decline of pastures in many regions occurred from the 18th century. Hay making is associated with enlargement of arable fields and the use of cattle as draught animals for ploughing and soil preparation. The spread of A.elatius in Central Europe was enabled by the decline of grazing management and an increased proportion of hay meadows in the 18th and 19th centuries. In some mountain areas, there are no records of large-scale deforestation and enlargement of grasslands until the 14th century, and the peak of the agriculturally used area was recorded for the period from the 18th to the first half of the 20th century. Grasslands were converted into arable land during periods of war; conversely, grasslands replaced arable land after the collapse of agriculture in many regions of former communist countries following political regime change in the 1990s. The dynamics of the grassland area reflect the development of human society and the political situation, because grasslands are an integral part of the cultural landscape in Central Europe.

AB  - The results of the medium-and large-scale topographic maps study of Kryvyi Rih territory in different years of their publication, revealing the natural and anthropogenic condition of the territory, are dwelt upon in the article. The region is actually presenting a testing site for the long-term impact of the technosphere on the population and the environment to be studied. Spatial-temporal analysis provides an opportunity to completely re-examine many aspects in this problem. On the basis of complex historical, geographical, cartographic and mathematical-statistical methods of spatial analysis, an assessment of different cartographic materials is made from the point of view of their accuracy, reliability and comparability, which made it possible to select maps suitable for retrospective studies and solve a wide range of applied problems. It has been determined that:
   1. The topographic measurements were not highly accurate before the beginning of the 20th century. So the first maps of Kryvyi Rih in general were made "by hand" and their error often exceeds half a kilometer. The mensul survey, the main type of topographic survey in the period of the Tsarist Russia, ensured a reduction in the error for the most important objects to 50-150 meters; however, secondary objects (rivers, country roads, vegetation zones, etc.) were still marked arbitrarily.
   2. The standard metric system on topographic maps began to be used from the mid-30s of the 20th century. Until then, the distance on the terrain was measured by miles (1066, 781 m), and by English inches (2.54 cm) on maps. Consequently, it becomes necessary to transform units of length measures into modern indicators. In addition, it is necessary to check the scale, because it was of a formal nature in early topographic works.
   3. For more than two hundred years of topographic studies of the region, the maps were created in different standards. For example, the Schubert map is executed in a pseudoconical, equal-sized Born projection, the Strelbitsky map is a conical equal projection of Lambert, whereas the General Headquarters map of the USSR is a transverse cylindrical conformal map projection of Gauss-Krueger. In this regard, when combining different maps, even when they are brought to the same scale, spatial shifts of the survey objects are observed. In addition, their coordinates do not coincide, and if the latitude is not so significant, then the longitude coordinates vary in significant ranges. This is due, first of all, to the change in the basic meridian, from which the longitude reading was taken.
   4. In compiling the majority of topographic maps of the region, earlier cartographic materials were widely used, which were updated with some degree of detail. As a result, many of the maps do not reflect the actual situational picture of the terrain at the time of their creation.
   Carrying out a retrospective analysis of Kryvyi Rih territory on the basis of a detailed study of the above-mentioned topographic items using GIS is the prospect of the further research.

AB  - Geobotanical remote sensing (GbRS) in the strict sense is an indirect approach to obtain geological information in heavily vegetated areas for mineral prospecting and geological mapping. Using ultra- and hyperspectral technologies, the goals of this research comprise the definition and mapping of Neotropical tree species that are associated with geological facies (here called geo-environments) as well as their spectral discrimination at leaf and crown scales. This work also aims to investigate the possible relationship between leaf and crown spectral and chemical properties. The study was developed at the Mogi-Guacu Ecological Station, in the Cerrado domain, southeastern Brazil. Data from 70 sample units, such as sediment texture and species from inventories, were first analyzed through vectorial quantization using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). Principal Component Analysis and Spearman's ranked correlation coefficients were used to define geo-environments and target-species, respectively. Biochemical and visible to shortwave infrared (VSWIR) point spectral data (350-2500 nm) were collected from the leaves of the target-species, during both rainy and dry seasons. Spectral data from target-species crowns were obtained from hyperspectral images (530-2.532 nm, ProSpecTIR-VS sensor) with 1 m spatial resolution, and acquired in the beginning of the dry season. These spectra were classified using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) with two endmembers (EMs). Based on the MESMA results with two EMs, the best dataset per target-species was chosen for pixel-based image unmixing with three EMs (target-species, other vegetation types and shade). From 121 species sampled in the field, two proved to be associated with floodplains (Alluvial Deposits sequence), two with hills and plateaus of the Aquidauna Formation (Carboniferous sedimentary rocks, Parana Basin), and two more with a specific facies of the Aquidauna Formation that has a distinctive presence of coarse and very coarse sand. Five target-species were well discriminated at the leaf scale, reaching 90.0% and 85.0% of global accuracies in the rainy season and in the dry season, respectively. Accurate spectral discrimination appears to be linked to the considerable biochemical variability of their leaves in both seasons. Three species were discriminated at the crown scale, with 70.6% of global accuracy. When eight other landscape scale vegetation classes were included in the analyses, only Qualea grandiflora Mart. produced a satisfactory accuracy (61.1% and 100% of producer and user's accuracies, respectively). The spatial distribution of its fraction in the unmixed image, particularly, matches with the geological facies to which it was associated in the field. Ecological requirements for successfully mapping indicator species include broad and random distribution of the target-species' population, and singular physiological, phenological (and spectral) behavior at the imagery acquisition date. Our study shows that, even in tropical conditions, it is possible to use plant species mapping to support geological delineation, where rock exposures are typically rare.

AB  - Globally, seagrass beds have been recognized as critical yet declining coastal habitats. To mitigate seagrass losses, seagrass restorations have been conducted in worldwide over the past two decades. Seed utilization is considered to be an important approach in seagrass restoration efforts. In this study, we investigated the effects of salinity and temperature on seed germination, seedling establishment, and seedling growth of eelgrass Zostera marina L. (Swan Lake, northern China). We initially tested the effects of salinity (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 ppt) and water temperature (5, 10, 15, and 20 degrees C) on seed germination to identify optimal levels. To identify levels of salinity that could potentially limit survival and growth, and, consequently, the spatial distribution of seedlings in temperate estuaries, we then examined the effect of freshwater and other salinity levels (10, 20, and 30 ppt) on seedling growth and establishment to confirm suitable conditions for seedling development. Finally, we examined the effect of transferring germinated seeds from freshwater or low salinity levels (1, 5, and 15 ppt) to natural seawater (32 ppt) on seedling establishment rate (SER) at 15 degrees C. In our research, we found that: (1) Mature seeds had a considerably lower moisture content than immature seeds; therefore, moisture content may be a potential indicator of Z. marina seed maturity; (2) Seed germination significantly increased at low salinity (p < 0.001) and high temperature (p < 0.001). Salinity had a much stronger influence on seed germination than temperature. Maximum seed germination (88.67 +/- 5.77%) was recorded in freshwater at 15 degrees C; (3) Freshwater and low salinity levels (< 20 ppt) increased germination but had a strong negative effect on seedling morphology (number of leaves per seedling reduced from 2 to 0, and maximum seedling leaf length reduced from 4.48 to 0 cm) and growth (seedling biomass reduced by 46.15-66.67% and maximum seedling length reduced by 21.16-69.50%). However, Z. marina performed almost equally well at salinities of 20 and 30 ppt. Very few germinated seeds completed leaf differentiation and seedling establishment in freshwater or at low salinity, implying that freshwater and low salinity may potentially limit the distribution of this species in coastal and estuarine waters. Therefore, the optimum salinity for Z. marina seedling establishment and colonization appears to be above 20 ppt in natural beds; ( 4) Seeds germinated in freshwater or at low salinity levels could be transferred to natural seawater to accomplish seedling establishment and colonization. This may be the optimal method for the adoption of seed utilization in seagrass restoration. We also identified seven stages of seed germination and seedling metamorphosis in order to characterize growth and developmental characteristics. Our results may serve as useful information for Z. marina habitat establishment and restoration programs.

AB  - The delta N-15 and delta C-13 signatures of major organic matter (OM) pools were measured across chemical and hydrologic gradients in a large (58,800 ha) subtropical wetland to evaluate whether stable isotopes were useful indicators of environmental change. Once a rainfall-driven wetland, the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge in the Florida Everglades now receives agricultural and urban drainage that has increased phosphorus (P) and mineral loads around the wetland perimeter. Additionally, water impoundment at the southern end has produced a latitudinal hydrologic gradient, with extended hydroperiods in the south and overdrained conditions in the north.
   Detritus (-4.8 parts per thousand to 8.6 parts per thousand), floc (-1.4 parts per thousand to 3.6 parts per thousand), and metaphyton (-6.6 parts per thousand to +7.4 parts per thousand) delta N-15 declined southward with changes in hydrology as indicated by water depth. This pattern was attributed to higher mineralization rates under shorter hydroperiods. These signatures were also strongly correlated with increased nutrient and mineral loading. Rooted macrophyte delta N-15, by contrast, appeared more responsive to soil nutrient pools. Cattail (-8.9 parts per thousand to +7.7 parts per thousand) was restricted to the wetland perimeter and had the widest delta N-15 range, which was positively correlated with soil P. Sawgrass (-5.3 parts per thousand to +7.7 parts per thousand) occurred across most of the wetland, but its ON was not strongly correlated to any gradient. Patterns for delta C-13 were more strongly related to chemical gradients caused by canal intrusion than to latitude or hydrology. Again, metaphyton and detrital signatures were more sensitive to water chemistry changes than macrophytes. This pattern is consistent with their locations at the soil-water (detritus-floc), and air-water (metaphyton) interface. Metaphyton delta C-13 (-36.1 parts per thousand to -21.5 parts per thousand) which had the broadest range, was affected by DIC source and pool size. In contrast, cattail delta C-13 (-28.7 parts per thousand to -26.4 parts per thousand) was more closely related to soil P and sawgrass delta C-13 (-30.1 parts per thousand to -24.5 parts per thousand) was not related to any environmental gradient except latitude. There was no correlation between the two isotopes for any OM pool except cattail.
   These results indicate that isotopic signatures of microbial (metaphyton and detrital) pools are more responsive to changes in wetland hydrology and water chemistry while those of rooted macrophytes respond only to the extent that soil chemistry is altered. Rooted macrophytes also differ in the sensitivity of their isotopic signatures to environmental change. The selection of OM pools for isotopic analysis will, therefore, affect the sensitivity of the analysis and the resulting patterns. Furthermore, delta N-15 may be more robust and interpretable than delta C-13 as an indicator of ecosystem change in wetlands exposed to multiple or complex anthropogenic gradients.

AB  - Traditionally, studies of forest development have independently focused on the compositional and structural differences of second-growth and old-growth forests. However, few studies have attempted to use current old-growth forest ecosystems as a benchmark with which to compare the composition, structure, and dynamics of a surrounding matrix of sequentially aged second-growth forests. In order to examine the development of mixed-oak forests we compared the composition, structure, and stand dynamics of seventeen relatively undisturbed second-growth forests (70-149 years old) with four old-growth forests (at least 150 years old) on south-facing ecological landtypes (ELTs) in southeastern Ohio. All living and dead trees over 10.0 cm dbh and coarse woody debris over 10.0 cm mid-diameter were inventoried on 500-m(2) plots. Saplings and seedlings were sampled on nested 100-m(2) and 2-m(2) subplots, respectively. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to support the assumption that study sites had similar soils and physiography.
   Overstory species richness was greatest in the younger second-growth stands, and significantly differed among age classes. Five species of oaks (Quercus spp.) dominated the overstories of all stands. However, white oak (Quercus alba L.) canopy importance value (IV) ((relative dominance + relative density)/2) significantly differed among stands; it ranged from 35.5% in stands 70-89 years old to 86.1% in stands 130-149 years old, while it comprised 46.5% of the old-growth canopies. Pignut hickory (Carya glabra (Mill.) Sweet.) canopy IV tended to be less in the second-growth than in the old-growth stands. Whereas oaks dominated the overstories of the second-growth and old-growth stands, they were almost absent from the sapling layer of all stands (less than 5% of the total densities). The sapling layers of all age classes were comprised of shade-tolerant species. For example, American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) sapling relative density significantly differed between the 70-89 year old stands (6.3%) and the stands at least 150 years old (23.9%). Even though densities of oak saplings were low, the relative densities of oak seedlings were much greater, suggesting adequate oak advance regeneration. Few significant differences in stand structure (e.g. basal area, density, mean diameter, canopy closure) or standing and fallen coarse woody debris were detected between the second-growth and old-growth forests. Detrended correspondence analyses (DCA) appeared to represent a gradient of increasing white oak IV with age. Although indices of old-growth attributes have proven successful in discriminating between second-growth and old-growth ecosystems in other regions of North America, our results suggest that such an index would not work well in mixed-oak forests. Canopies dominated by a mixture of oaks, in conjunction with a majority of canopy individuals at least 150 years old, may be the best indicators of old-growth conditions on south-facing landtypes in southeastern Ohio.

AB  - Over the past decade, there intense consideration of managing flows in the River Murray to provide environmental benefits. In 1990 the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council adopted a water quality policy: To maintain and, where necessary, improve existing water quality in the rivers of the Murray-Darling Basin for all beneficial uses - agricultural, environmental, urban, industrial and recreational, and in 1994 a flow policy: To maintain and where necessary improve existing flow regimes in the waterways of the Murray-Darling Basin to protect and enhance the riverine environment. The Audit of Water Use followed in 1995, culminating in the decision of the Ministerial Council to implement an interim cap on new diversions for consumptive use (the "Cap") in a bid to halt declining river health. In March 1999 the Environmental Flows and Water Quality Objectives for the River Murray Project (the Project) was set-up, primarily to establish water quality and environmental flow objectives for the River Murray system. A Flow Management Plan will be developed that aims to achieve a sustainable river environment and water quality, in accordance with community needs, and including an adaptive approach to management and operation of the River. It will lead to objectives for water quality and environmental flows that are feasible, appropriate, have the support of the scientific, management and stakeholder communities, and carry acceptable levels of risk. This paper describes four key aspects of the process being undertaken to determine the objectives, and design the flow options that will meet those objectives: establishment of an appropriate technical, advisory and administrative framework; establishing clear evidence for regulation impacts; undergoing assessment of environmental flow needs; and filling knowledge gaps.
   A review of the impacts of flow regulation on the health of the River Murray revealed evidence for decline, but the case for flow regulation as the main cause is circumstantial or uncertain. This is to be expected, because the decline of the River Murray results from many factors acting over a long period. Also, the health of the river varies along its length, from highly degraded to reasonably healthy, so it is clear that different approaches will be needed in the various river zones, with some problems requiring reach or even point scale solutions.
   Environmental flow needs have been determined through two major Expert Panel reports that identified the ecological priorities for the river. The next step is to translate these needs into feasible flow management actions that will provide the necessary hydrological conditions. Several investigations are underway to recommend options for flow management. Two important investigations are described in this paper: how to enhance flows to wetlands of national and international significance, and how to physically alter or change the operation of structures (including a dam, weir, lock, regulator, barrage or causeway), to provide significant environmental benefits. Early modelling suggests that the only option which has a positive environmental effect in all zones of the River is a reduction in overall water consumption.

AB  - This paper reviews methods for testing the toxicity of metals associated with freshwater sediments, linking toxic effects with metal exposure and bioavailability, and developing sediment quality guidelines. The most broadly applicable approach for characterizing metal toxicity is whole-sediment toxicity testing, which attempts to simulate natural exposure conditions in the laboratory. Standard methods for whole-sediment testing can be adapted to test a wide variety of taxa. Chronic sediment tests that characterize effects on multiple endpoints (e.g., survival, growth, and reproduction) can be highly sensitive indicators of adverse effects on resident invertebrate taxa. Methods for testing of aqueous phases (pore water, overlying water, or elutriates) are used less frequently. Analysis of sediment toxicity data focuses on statistical comparisons between responses in sediments from the study area and responses in one or more uncontaminated reference sediments. For large or complex study areas, a greater number of reference sediments is recommended to reliably define the normal range of responses in uncontaminated sediments - the 'reference envelope'. Data on metal concentrations and effects on test organisms across a gradient of contamination may allow development of concentration-response models, which estimate metal concentrations associated with specified levels of toxic effects (e.g. 20% effect concentration or EC20). Comparisons of toxic effects in laboratory tests with measures of impacts on resident benthic invertebrate communities can help document causal relationships between metal contamination and biological effects. Total or total-recoverable metal concentrations in sediments are the most common measure of metal contamination in sediments, but metal concentrations in labile sediment fractions (e.g., determined as part of selective sediment extraction protocols) may better represent metal bioavailability. Metals released by the weak-acid extraction of acid-volatile sulfide (AVS), termed simultaneously-extracted metals (SEM), are widely used to estimate the 'potentially-bioavailable' fraction of metals that is not bound to sulfides (i.e., SEM-AVS). Metal concentrations in pore water are widely considered to be direct measures of metal bioavailability, and predictions of toxicity based on pore-water metal concentrations may be further improved by modeling interactions of metals with other pore-water constituents using Biotic Ligand Models. Data from sediment toxicity tests and metal analyses has provided the basis for development of sediment quality guidelines, which estimate thresholds for toxicity of metals in sediments. Empirical guidelines such as Probable Effects Concentrations or (PECs) are based on associations between sediment metal concentrations and occurrence of toxic effects in large datasets. PECs do not model bioavailable metals, but they can be used to estimate the toxicity of metal mixtures using by calculation of probable effect quotients (PEQ = sediment metal concentration/PEC). In contrast, mechanistic guidelines, such as Equilibrium Partitioning Sediment Benchmarks (ESBs) attempt to predict both bioavailability and mixture toxicity. Application of these simple bioavailability models requires more extensive chemical characterization of sediments or pore water, compared to empirical guidelines, but may provide more reliable estimates of metal toxicity across a wide range of sediment types.

AB  - The study of climate change is an urgent problem. At the moment, the global trend towards climate warming has been proven, but the factors determining its changes are insufficient. But not all processes are caused by climate change. In addition, the result of climate change may be interrelated with anthropogenic factors. Complex landscape-ecological studies, including the dynamics of nature management (rural, forestry, etc.) and its influence on many natural processes, will help to answer these questions.
   The aim of the work is to analyze the dynamics of lands occupied in the agricultural sector of the Republic of Tyva over the past forty years and to select representative sites for the organization of comprehensive monitoring studies.
   The Republic of Tuva, located in the center of Asia, in its natural appearance reflects the features of the influence of the neighboring territories: from the north and north-east - taiga Eastern Siberia, from the south and southeast - desert-steppe regions of Mongolia, from the west - mountain taiga Altai. All these conditions have determined the diversity of natural landscapes and the ecological value of the territory.
   The article is based on materials from reports of different levels, statistical yearbooks, archival funds, field research by authors, etc. The materials were processed using MS Excel software packages and GIS technologies in the ArcGIS software package.
   The authors found that the structure of agricultural lands of the Republic of Tyva during the analyzed period underwent tangible changes, which were caused not only by external socio-economic reasons of the end of the 20th century, but also by internal administrative-territorial ones (reduction of the areas of some regions and increase in others, as well as the creation of new ones).
   It is shown that, overall, the areal structure of agricultural lands changed during the second half of the XX - first half of the XXI century. For example, in 1976 the area of agricultural land in Tuva was 4623.2 thousand hectares, which is almost 2 times more than the modern areas. These transformations were noted not only in individual years throughout the republic, but in individual administrative regions. So, it is shown that in the period from 1980 to the early 90s. Most of the districts (kozhuuns) of the region had agricultural territories that did not exceed 20 %. In just two kozhuuns, the share of lands exceeded 50% of the total area ( Ovyursky and TesKhemsky).
   A study in the aspect of periods shows that in 1990 the area of agricultural land had maximum indicators (6812.2 thousand hectares), Then there was a decrease in the area of land of this category and in 2005 it was equal to 1219.9 thousand hectares, and at the beginning of 2020 - 3363.9 thousand hectares. As a result, the authors note that the largest changes in agricultural land occurred in three kozhuuns, namely, their reduction by 1.5-4 times. At the same time, the restoration of natural vegetation was recorded in the place of fallow lands.

AB  - Key features of late Neogene climate remain uncertain due to conflicting records derived from different sea surface temperature (SST) proxies. To understand scenarios in which proxy-derived temperature estimates can be used interchangeably or are instead measuring different aspects of the same system, it is necessary to explore both the consistencies and differences between specific paleothermometers. Here, we report orbital-scale climate records from ODP Site 846 in the eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP) for the interval from similar to 5-6 Ma using alkenone and archaeal lipid paleothermometers. Results from both proxies are similar in their secular trends and magnitude of long-term temperature change, and spectral analysis demonstrates that the records are coherent and in-phase in both the obliquity and precession bands. However, we find that the temperatures reconstructed by TEX86 are consistently offset toward colder values by similar to 2 degrees C relative to U-37(k ')-derived temperatures in global calibrations, or by similar to 0.8 degrees C in Bayesian-based calibrations. All combinations of calibrations also yield approximately twice the amplitude of orbital-scale variation in TEX86 relative to U-37(k ')-derived temperature fluctuations. Both temperature proxies are negatively correlated with sedimentary alkenone concentrations, which we use as an indicator of increased export productivity. Removing this productivity contribution from TEX86 results in an adjusted TEX86 record with temperature sensitivity identical to U-37(k '). In future applications, this signal may be decoupled using additional sedimentary indicators of paleoproductivity, which likely will be most important for upwelling zone environments. There remain other nonexplained factors that contribute to differences between TEX86 and U(37)(k ')that warrant additional investigation.
   Plain Language Summary The remains of organisms found in ocean sediments contain information about the climate at the time the organisms were alive. Some of these remains enable the reconstruction of past temperature and are used as "paleothermometers." Many different types of paleothermometers exist; however, none work across all time periods or geographic locations. Thus, data from different paleothermometers are commonly used interchangeably to study Earth's past climate. However, little previous work has been done to study the limitations of this approach. Two of the most widely used paleothermometers are based on lipids of marine microorganisms. Here, we generated high-resolution temperature reconstructions using both techniques. This allowed us to compare the timing, direction, and magnitude of the reconstructed temperature changes over a time interval of nearly 1 million years. Encouragingly, both paleothermometers show the same general patterns through time, although they yield modestly different results. These differences are greater during cold climate conditions and appear to be in part due to the influence of the amount of local biological productivity on one of the paleothermometers. We propose some ways that the contribution of factors other than temperature, including not only productivity but also community composition, might be explored in the future.

AB  - Savannah-type ecosystems account for 26-30% of global gross primary productivity GPP, with water being one of the major driving factors. In Europe, savannah-type woodlands cover an area of about 1.5 million ha. Here, the recent past has shown a significant decrease in precipitation P in winter and spring as well as a decrease in total annual precipitation. Strong effects on local water balance and carbon sink strength have thus been reported due to changes in precipitation regime.
   The objective of this study is to quantify the impact of the extreme drought event in 2012 on the water balance, gross primary productivity and carbon sink strength of a typical Portuguese cork-oak woodland (montado) compared to the wet year of 2011. Physiological responses of the dominant tree species Quercus suber (L.) are disentangled employing combined photosynthesis and stomatal conductance modelling.
   Precipitation effectiveness ET/P increased from 86% in 2011 to 122% in the 2012 dry year due to deep soil or groundwater access of the Q. suber trees leaving no water for groundwater replenishment. Understorey and overstorey GPP were strongly reduced, by 53 and 28 %, respectively, in 2012 compared to 2011, due to the late onset of the autumn rains in 2011 and an additional severe winter/spring drought. However, the ecosystem was still a carbon sink in both years, but with a 38% reduced sink strength under extreme drought in 2012 compared to 2011. The combined photosynthesis-stomatal conductance model yielded the best results if it was allowed to adjust photosynthetic and stomatal parameters simultaneously. If stomatal response was modelled with the Leuning approach, which allows for a different sensitivity to vapour pressure deficit, the stomatal model parameters were highly coupled. A change in either of the parameters needed to be compensated by the other to guarantee a stable sensitivity of stomatal conductance to assimilation, independent of variations in vapour pressure deficit. The Q. suber trees showed a 37% reduced stomatal conductance during the drought period of 2012 compared to 2011, due to water supply limitations. In response to reduced leaf-internal CO2 availability, the trees strongly reduced the apparent maximum carboxylation rate by 43% in 2012 compared to 2011. Unexpectedly, the optimum temperature T-opt of the maximum electron transport rate decreased during the drought period, enhancing the susceptibility of the trees to high temperature stress during the summer.
   Our results suggest that, if the trend of decreasing annual precipitation and changed precipitation patterns on the Iberian Peninsula continues, sustained effects on local groundwater reservoirs, understorey species composition and tree mortality have to be expected in the long term. To model the effect of drought on the montado ecosystem successfully, variable apparent maximum carboxylation rate V-c,V-max, stomatal conductance parameter m and vapour pressure deficit sensitivity parameter D-0 need to be incorporated into photosynthesis-stomatal conductance modelling.

AB  - High-accuracy spectrophotometric pH measurements were taken during a summer cruise to study the pH dynamics and its controlling mechanisms in the northern Gulf of Mexico in hypoxia season. Using the recently available dissociation constants of the purified m-cresol purple (Douglas & Byrne, 2017, ; Muller & Rehder, 2018, ), spectrophotometrically measured pH showed excellent agreement with pH calculated from dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity over a wide salinity range of 0 to 36.9 (0.005 0.016, n = 550). The coupled changes in DIC, oxygen, and nutrients suggest that biological production of organic matter in surface water and the subsequent aerobic respiration in subsurface was the dominant factor regulating pH variability in the nGOM in summer. The highest pH values were observed, together with the maximal biological uptake of DIC and nutrients, at intermediate salinities in the Mississippi and Atchafalaya plumes where light and nutrient conditions were favorable for phytoplankton growth. The lowest pH values (down to 7.59) were observed along with the highest concentrations of DIC and apparent oxygen utilization in hypoxic bottom waters. The nonconservative pH changes in both surface and bottom waters correlated well with the biologically induced changes in DIC, that is, per 100-mu mol/kg biological removal/addition of DIC resulted in 0.21 unit increase/decrease in pH. Coastal bottom water with lower pH buffering capacity is more susceptible to acidification from anthropogenic CO2 invasion but reduction in eutrophication may offset some of the increased susceptibility to acidification.
   Plain Language Summary pH is a master variable of seawater chemistry reflecting the acidity of the seawater. It can be determined from spectrophotometric measurement of the color changes of a pH-sensitive dye when it is added into the sample. In this study, we present high-accuracy spectrophotometric pH measurements to study the pH dynamics and its controlling mechanisms in the northern Gulf of Mexico in the hypoxia summer season. Our results recommend the use of dissociation constants of a commonly used indicator dye (m-cresol purple) recently proposed by Douglas and Byrne (2017, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marchem.2017.10.001) and Muller and Rehder (2018, https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2018.00177) in coastal environments, especially for low-salinity estuarine waters. High pH values in the surface layer were observed in river plumes where photosynthesis by algal uptake CO2 from the water. On the contrary, the microbial consumption of the sinking organic matter resulted in low oxygen (hypoxia) and low pH (acidification) in bottom water. In comparison to the surface water, the dissolution of atmospheric CO2 causes more intense pH decreases in bottom water with higher CO2 concentration. In order to alleviate hypoxia and acidification in coastal bottom waters, actions need to be taken to decrease the human inputs of nutrients to coastal waters.

AB  - Aim The New Zealand terrestrial mollusc fauna is among the most speciose in the world, with often remarkably high richness at lowland forest sites. We sought to elucidate general explanations for patterns of richness in terrestrial mollusc communities by analysis of species coexistence and habitat relationships within a New Zealand district fauna.
   Location Pukeamaru Ecological District, eastern North Island, New Zealand.
   Methods We sampled molluscs using qualitative methods at twenty-three sites and quantitatively by frame sampling of scrubland-forest floor litter at six-teen of these sites and analysed patterns of species richness and turnover in relation to regional species pools and local habitat attributes. We then tested for nonrandom assemblage of taxa along diversity and habitat gradients.
   Results Ninety-four indigenous mollusc species were recorded from a district fauna estimated at 102 indigenous species: only two species were endemic. From the presumptive geological history of the district, the low endemism, and Brooks parsimony and indicator species analyses of faunal relationships, the communities were indicated to have resulted by accumulation of colonists from other New Zealand districts since the Miocene. Richness ranged from two or three indigenous species in dune habitats to fifty-nine species in a floristically rich forest. Beta diversity was high and site occupancy per species was low, indicating communities structured by successive replacement of ecological equivalents. Sites differing in vegetation had characteristic species assemblages, indicating a degree of habitat specialization. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that canopy tree species, canopy height, floristic diversity, altitude, litter mass, and litter pH were important determinants of species assemblage in scrubland and forest. Richness was strongly associated with site floristic diversity and, for litter-dwelling species, the pH of litter substrate. High richness occurred at those sites supporting molluscs in high abundance. Shell-shape distributions were essentially Cainian unimodal, with communities dominated by snail species with subglobose to discoidal shells. Mean and variance of shell size increased with mollusc species richness and floristic diversity at sites, indicating dominance of communities by small-shelled species at early successional or floristically poor sites, and increased richness resulting from addition of larger snails into vacant niches. Shifts in shell form were associated with sympatry in several congeneric taxa.
   Main conclusions The underdispersion of shell shape, relative to faunas elsewhere in the world, indicates that community structure in New Zealand land snail faunas has been constrained by limited phylogenetic diversity and/or by convergence upon successful adaptations. The remarkably high richness that characterizes these communities indicates special conditions allow coexistence of numerous species. The relationship between floristic diversity at sites and the richness, diversity, and shell-size distributions of the molluscs suggests assemblages structured around niche partitioning among competing species. While there is an element of congruence between vegetation and mollusc pattern, this study indicates that assembly rules will be defined, and spatial pattern predicted, only through a better understanding of the linkage between regional species Fool, organism traits, environment, and local community assemblage.

AB  - The effect of mining waters on the physical and chemical properties of surface and ground waters was evaluated in 2014 and 2015 within the Lublin Coal Basin. Samples of water for physicochemical analyses were taken twice a year. Water was sampled from piezometers, wells, drainage ditches and from the river Swinka. The following parameters were analyzed: pH, conductivity, dissolved substances, general hardness, calcium, magnesium, sodium, nitrates, sulphates and chlorides. The examined indicators were subjected to Friedman's nonparametric univariate analysis (ANOVA) for measurements repeated using the Statistica software.
   The tests and analysis of water and sewage management make it possible to evaluate the physicochemical parameters of waters within the mining area in the Lublin Coal Basin. The best measure of the intensity of parameter changes can be the response of the surface water environment to contact with mining waters.
   Underground waters featured low values of chemical indicators. Drinking water drawn from wells in all cases was classified as quality class I. Ground waters sampled from piezometers were most often classified as quality class II. The value of maximum conductivity did not exceed 2500 mu S.cm(-1), while that of dissolved substances, 1500 mg.dm(-3). Only with regard to the content of calcium and chlorides were some cases of water quality class III recorded. The maximum value for calcium was 2500 mg Ca+.dm(-3), while for chlorides this was 300 mg Cl.dm(3). Water in the river featured parameter values similar to those recorded for underground water. Therefore, it could be included in quality class II (the limit value for conductivity is 2000 mu S.cm(-1), for dissolved substances 1000 mg.dm(-3)). The situation was different for water sampled from ditches. Here, water quality indicators were even three times higher than in the river. In this case the limit values for quality class II were exceeded. Such limit values are not determined for other classes.
   Can observe changes in the examined parameters describing the quality of river Swinka waters, it must be stressed that the significant increase in mining activity had no effect whatsoever on its water quality. The increase in chemical concentrations in mine waters drained to the river are not that high so as to cause irreversible changes in this ecosystem. This is proved by a fast return of water quality in the river to the pre-drainage condition. Comparing their current state to the beginning of mining activity, the majority of mine water indicators show stability. The observed single increases in concentrations do not remain fixed. Waters taken from the piezometers, the well and the river were classified as second water quality, while the waters from the land improvement ditches did not meet these criteria. The highest quality was observed for groundwater which is often classified as Type I water quality. This means that the aquifers provide good insulation and are not affected by the Bogdanka mine's activity.

AB  - Nineteen exclosures on sagebrush steppe and shadscale rangelands, varying in age from 18 to 38 years, were sampled for plant species richness, plant composition, indicators of soil erosion, ground cover, vegetative cover, and herb-low shrub layer screening cover. Features within the exclosures were compared with adjacent sites of the same size that were open to grazing by livestock and wildlife. Species richness typically was slightly greater inside p exclosures than in adjacent grazed sites (median = 2 more species inside exclosures), but the difference was not significant (P = 0.16). Similarity of plant community composition between exclosures and adjacent grazed sites ranged from 45% to 82%. Evidences 4 soil movement, soil pedestals, and soil flow patterns were all more pronounced outside exclosures than inside (P less than or equal to 0.02), even though many sites were on flat to mild slopes (median slope = 12%). Meta-analysis of the 19 exclosure sites indicated that grazing exclusion resulted in less bare ground cover compared with adjacent grazed sites (P less than or equal to 0.05). The effect of grazing exclusion on visible soil surface cryptogams was significant (P less than or equal to 0.05), with generally greater cover inside exclosures. Cryptogam cover differences between grazed sites and exclosures tended to increase with the number of years of grazing exclusion (r = 0.64, P = 0.046). Pseudoroegneria spicata, a principal livestock forage, averaged greater basal cover inside exclosures than outside on 4 of 10 sites where it occurred, although no exclosure sites had greater P spicata cover on grazed sites. Meta-analysis of the 10 sites indicated that grazing exclusion resulted in greater P spicata cover compared with adjacent grazed areas (P less than or equal to 0.05). Poa secunda, a short-growing grass that initiates growth early in the spring and is not important livestock forage, averaged greater basal cover outside exclosores on 5 of 15 sites where it occurred. Meta-analysis of the 15 sites indicated a significant treatment effect (P less than or equal to 0.05), with greater Poa secunda basal cover outside exclosures. Grazing exclusion resulted in greater screening cover in the herb-low shrub layer (0-0.5 m height; P less than or equal to 0.05). These results indicate that despite improved livestock grazing management over the past half century, livestock grazing still can limit the potential of native plant communities in sagebrush steppe ecosystems, and that the health of semiarid ecosystems can improve with livestock exclusion in the absence of other disturbances. A few exclosure sites were similar for the measured parameters, suggesting that these sites were ecologically stable and that exclusion of livestock grazing was not sufficient to move succession toward more pristine conditions, at least within the time periods studied. Managed disturbance such as fire or mechanical brush treatments may be necessary to restore herb productivity on these ecologically stable sites.

AB  - Tropical mobile mud belts represent a major class of biogeochemical and diagenetic systems characterized by extensive and frequent physical reworking of fine-grained, organic-rich deposits underlying oxygenated waters. Large regions of the Gulf of Papua, Papua New Guinea deltaic complex are dominated by such conditions. A reworked mud belt lies within the inner shelf between similar to10 and 20 m depth on a sedimentary clinoform derived from coalescing deltas. Deposits across the topset are typically suboxic, nonsulfidic over the upper similar to0.5-1 m, and have low to moderate maximum pore water concentrations of dissolved Fe(II) and Mn(II) (similar to100-200, but up to similar to800 muM). Sediments are reactive, with surficial SigmaCO(2), production similar to0.1-0.3 mM d(-1) and benthic O-2 fluxes similar to23+/-15 mmol m(-2) d(-1) (upper similar to20cm). The highest rates occur within inner topset deposits (similar to10-20m) and near the high accumulation rollover region of the topset-foreset beds (similar to40-50m). Lower rates are found inshore along intertidal channels-mangrove fringe and within scoured or exposed consolidated deposits of the middle topset region. Remineralization rate patterns are independent of relative dominance by terrestrial or marine carbon in sediments. Dissolved O-2 usually penetrates similar to2-5 mm into surface sediments when macrofaunal burrows are absent. More than 75% of the highly reactive sedimentary Fe(III) pool (similar to350-400 mumol g(-1)) is typically diagenetically reduced in the upper similar to0.5 m. Pore water SO42- can be measureably depleted at depths >0.5m, but dissolved H2S generally remains below detection over the upper similar to1-2 m. As in other deltaic topset regions, SO42- concentration gradients often indicate that compared to many marine 4 deposits of similar sediment accumulation rates, relatively refractory C-org is Supplied to the SO4 reducing zone. Sedimentary C/S ratios are similar to4-6 within the suboxic topset regions but decrease to <3 in offshore foreset beds where sulfidic diagenesis dominates. Only similar to15-20% of the diagenetically reduced Fe(II) is pyritic and a maximum of similar to10-25% is carbonate, implying that most Fe(II) is associated with authigenic or lithogenic silicates or oxides. The dominance of suboxic, nonsulfidic diagenetic processes reflect coupling between delivery of oxide-rich terrestrial debris, remobilization and reoxidation of deposits, and repetitive entrainment/remineralization of both labile and refractory organics. Distinct sedimentary indicators of reactive, suboxic mobile mud belts within tropical climatic zones are: abundant total highly reactive Fe (SigmaFeR) > 300 mumol g(-1)'; most reactive Fe is diagenetically reduced (SigmaFe(II)/ SigmaFeRsimilar to0.7-0.8); the proportion of diagenetically reduced Fe present as pyrite is low (Py-Fe(II)<0.2); C/S similar to4-8; and C-org/particle surface area <0.4 (mgCm(-2)). These depositional environments must be most common in tropical climates during high sea stand. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Given China's rapid industrial upgrade and economic development process, this study tries to explore the effect of industrial structure transformation on carbon emissions in China and the moderating effect of financial development by employing the traditional OLS model, the dynamic SYS-GMM model, and the dynamic spatial lag model comprehensively. In particular, industrial structure transformation has been divided into two indicators including industrial structure rationalization and industrial structure optimization; carbon emissions are evaluated from the dual perspective of scale and average. The empirical results indicate that only industrial structure optimization has a negative impact on carbon emissions scale in China at the national level. In addition, financial development has merely and positively moderated the nexus between industrial structure rationalization and carbon emissions scale and per capital carbon emission in the southern regions of China, which highlights the establishment of regional heterogeneity and the necessity of formulating policy in line with local conditions. Both theoretical and practical significance have drawn from this study, for the emerging economics and in particular for China, to reduce carbon emissions through industrial structure transformation and financial development and promote high-quality development in the new era.

AB  - Socioenvironmental indexes are important mechanisms for the communication of information in a summary form. They may also be a sound source on the quality of life of human beings. In this sense, the objective of this research is to create a socioenvironmental sustainability index (SSI) applied to river basins that integrate socioenvironmental information from the river basin of the Una River in Sao Paulo (Brazil) by creating a fuzzy inference system in a geographic information system environment. From the results obtained, only two sub-river basins of the Una River are classified as regular. They are in the urban area to the north of the study area. The other sub-river basins are classified as in poor conditions, that is, with high socioenvironmental vulnerability. They correspond to 81% of the study area. This poor classification is justified by the low income and the high rate of illiteracy in the study area. Both factors presented very poor values. The urban area, compared to the rural area, showed a better socioenvironmental performance. It is partly justified by the access of the population in these areas to education and better work opportunities.

AB  - Plantago major L. (P. major L.) is a perennial plant belonging to the family Plantaginaceae. It has been used as a folk remedy for diabetes in Europe and Asia. However, the biologically active constituents responsible for the antidiabetic effects have not been reported. The objectives of this study aimed at determining the chemical components of Plantago major L. and evaluating the antidiabetic activity of the extracts using streptozotocin- (STZ-) induced diabetic mice. In this study, the Swiss mice were fed a high-fat diet to gain weight before STZ injections to induce diabetic conditions. The STZ-induced diabetic mice were orally treated with P. major L. extracts. The blood glucose test results from the treated diabetic mice and nontreated diabetic mice were compared. We found that a 15-day treatment with EP6 extract from P. major L. at a dose of 400 mg/kg could reduce the blood glucose level to the same level as a 15-day treatment with glucophage at a dose of 70 mg/kg. The major chemical components and structural characterization of EP6 extract were also reported. AST (aspartate transferase) and ALT (alanine aminotransferase) indicators of liver damage were measured in the treated and nontreated diabetic mice to give an overall view of the antidiabetic effect of P. major L. extracts.

AB  - Harvesting and cleaning of sugar beet lead to root damage, which increases storage losses due to wound healing and by causing entry points for pathogens. This study aimed at quantifying the effects of variety and site on the tissue strength of sugar beet roots, and moreover, to evaluate the impact of tissue strength on damage and storage losses. For this purpose, field trials with three varieties were carried out at six sites, three in Germany and the others in Belgium, the Netherlands and Sweden in 2018. Texture analysis and storage trials were conducted in Gottingen. Puncture and compression measurements revealed differences in tissue strength between varieties and sites. Drought stress during the vegetation period significantly reduced the tissue strength. Tissue strength of sugar beet roots turned out to be an environmental stable variety characteristic. It is not possible to draw conclusions from tissue strength to storage losses at a site, since many other factors, such as growing conditions, diseases and damage due to harvester settings have a strong impact. However, tissue strength might be an indicator for damage susceptibility and storage losses of sugar beet varieties.

AB  - Phosphoproteins are the key indicators of signaling network pathway activation. Many disease treatment therapies are designed to inhibit these pathways and effective diagnostics are required to evaluate the efficacy of these treatments. Phosphoprotein IHC have been impractical for diagnostics due to inconsistent results occurring from technical limitations. We have designed and tested a novel cold transport device and rapid cold plus warm formalin fixation protocol using phosphoproteins IHC. We collected 50 liver tumors that were split into two experimental conditions: 2 + 2 rapid fixation (2 hours cold then 2 hour warm formalin) or 4 hour room-temperature formalin. We analyzed primary hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 10) and metastatic gastrointestinal tumors (n = 28) for phosphoprotein IHC markers pAKT, pERK, pSRC, pSTAT3, and pSMAD2 and compared them to slides obtained from the clinical blocks. Expression of pERK and pSRC, present in the metastatic colorectal carcinoma, were better preserved with the rapid processing protocol while pSTAT3 expression was detected in hepatocellular carcinoma. Differences in pSMAD2 expression were difficult to detect due to the ubiquitous nature of protein expression. There were only 3 cases expressing pAKT and all exhibited a dramatic loss of signal for the standard clinical workflow. The rapid cold preservation shows improvement in phosphoprotein preservation.

AB  - Lavender leaves, widely used as flavors for foods and beverages, are a rich source of phenol components and antioxidant. Drying method is of vital importance for keeping these compounds. In this study, lavender leaves were dried by means of Atmospheric Freeze (AF), Multi-Stage Semi-Industrial Continuous (MSSIC), and Near Infrared-Vacuum (NIR-Vacuum) dryers and optimized by Response Surface Methodology (RSM) for the highest drying rate, total phenol content, antioxidant capacity, and the lowest color indicators change. Lavender leaves were also dried under natural conditions as the traditional method. Multi-stage drying caused tempering phenomenon and, consequently, drying rate increased obviously. Near infrared-vacuum dryer had suitable performance on keeping the active ingredients of lavender leaves. Optimum point to dry lavender leaves in atmospheric freeze dryer was found to be -5 degrees C. The optimum temperature points in the multi-stage semi-industrial continuous dryer were achieved to be 60, 40, and 60 degrees C for the first, second, and third stages, respectively. The optimum point in near infrared-vacuum dryer was 60 degrees C and 20 kPa for air temperature and pressure, respectively. Based on the results, among several drying methods, near infrared-vacuum dryer was the more suitable for drying lavender leaves.

AB  - The relationship between institutional quality and sustainable development?; in all its three connected dimensions economic, social, environmental - is widely discussed at the decision making level and in the specialized literature, with some contradictory opinions among researchers. This paper aims at investigating the relationship between institutions and sustainable development in a cross-country analysis, on a sample of 132 countries around the world, which were grouped in clusters based on the similarities between them regarding the values of the three dimensions of sustainable development. The three dimensions of sustainable development are captured with GDP per capita for the economic dimension, the Human Development Index for the social dimension and Environmental Quality for the environmental dimension. The institutional status of the countries considered in the analysis is measured with the six Governance Indicators released by the World Bank. In all countries, despite differences in terms of development or geopolitical context, sustainable development represents an option which is generally taken into account. The differences in terms of implementation are determined by the level of available resources and by the efficiency of their management at the central level. We may talk about a certain "normalcy" of institutional conditions, which represents a common denominator of sustainability.

AB  - The influence of volcanic rocks, namely, the Cretacious-Tertiary trachybasalt deposits of the Tamchinsky volcano, on the vegetation of mountain steppes in southern Siberia under the conditions of western Transbaikalia has been established. It is shown that weather-resistant basalts, which are highly various in terms of their geochemical composition, have served as a basis for the formation of unique mountain-steppe communities with the development of peculiar plant life forms. A floristic complex of rosette herbaceous polycarpics combined with sod grasses (Potentilla sericea, Chamaerhodos altaica, Pulsatilla turczaninovii, Silene jenisseensis, Amblynotus rupestris, Festuca lenensis, Aster alpinus, etc.) has been revealed; they form phytocenotically determined synusiae in the studied phytocenoses. It has been established that the Tamchinsky basalt field is a refugium for relics of different times. They include preglacial relics, namely, populations of semishrub wormwoods, Artemisia rutifolia and A. messerschmidtiana. A close affinity between A. gmelinii and A. messerschmidtiana has been proven, taking into account the ecological and morphological and phytochemical data. An increased geochemical background of elements (Ba, Sr, V, Zr, and U) promoted not only the conservation of relic plants but also the morphogenesis of endemic species, peashrub and iris.

AB  - According to archaeological investigation and preliminary excavation, the Yangjia Site, located in the northern Taihu Lake region, at Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, is a Neolithic archaeological site dominated by cultural remains attributed to the late Majiabang Culture (6270-5920 cal. a BP). Here a systematic archaeobotanical study was conducted to investigate vegetation landscape, environmental characteristics and rice agriculture in the prehistoric northern Taihu Lake area. The abundance, frequency and standard density of charred rice were the highest of all of the remains of the seed plants unearthed. In addition, a variety of wetland weeds, such as Haloragaceae, Cyperaceae, Carex sp., and Oxalis corniculata, were found. Pollen and phytoliths recorded that the evergreen-deciduous broadleaf mixed forest (represented by Quercus and Castanopsis) tends to decrease, while Poaceae was the most significant of the terrestrial herbs, water area expanded and water activities strengthened, indicating generally warm and humid conditions at the Yangjia Site during the late Majiabang Culture. All indicators of pollen, phytolith and macro-plant remains suggest that wild rice should be once distributed at or around the site before human occupation, after which rice agriculture progressed rapidly during the late Majiabang Culture.

AB  - Water is now considered the most important but vulnerable resource in the Mediterranean region. Nevertheless, irrigation expanded fast in the region (e.g. South Portugal and Spain) to mitigate environmental stress and to guarantee stable grape yield and quality. Sustainable wine production depends on sustainable water use in the wine's supply chain, from the vine to the bottle. Better understanding of grapevine stress physiology (e.g. water relations, temperature regulation, water use efficiency), more robust crop monitoring/phenotyping and implementation of best water management practices will help to mitigate climate effects and will enable significant water savings in the vineyard and winery. In this paper, we focused on the major vulnerabilities and opportunities of South European Mediterranean viticulture (e.g. in Portugal and Spain) and present a multi-level strategy (from plant to the consumer) to overcome region's weaknesses and support strategies for adaptation to water scarcity, promote sustainable water use and minimize the environmental impact of the sector.

AB  - Chlorophyll index and leaf nitrogen status (SPAD value) was incorporated into the nonrectangular hyperbola (NRH) equation for photosynthetic light-response (PLR) curve to establish a modified NRH equation to overcome the parameter variation. Ten PLR curves measured on rice leaves with different SPAD values were collected from pot experiments with different nitrogen (N) dosages. The coefficients of initial slope of the PLR curve and the maximum net photosynthetic rate in NRH equation increased linearly with the increase of leaf SPAD. The modified NRH equation was established by multiplying a linear SPAD-based adjustment factor with the NRH equation. It was sufficient in describing the PLR curves with unified coefficients for rice leaf with different SPAD values. SPAD value, as the indicator of leaf N status, could be used for modification of NRH equation to overcome the shortcoming of large coefficient variations between individual leaves with different N status. The performance of the SPAD-modified NRH equation should be further validated by data collected from different kinds of plants growing under different environments.

AB  - Green leaf proportion is an important factor affecting nutritive value, ingestive behavior and forage intake. Determination of green leaf proportion by hand separation of plant samples is time consuming and expensive. The aim of this work was to establish whether a stable relationship exists between the proportion of green leaf blade and total mass of harvestable forage in ungrazed kleingrass (Panicum coloratum L.) cv. Verde. The study was carried out during four consecutive growing seasons in an established pasture of kleingrass. During two growing seasons, 90 kg N ha(-1) was applied. Forage samples were collected at biweekly intervals and separated into leaf blades, stems (inclusive of leaf sheaths), and senescent material. Regression analysis indicated a consistent relationship (y = 0.70x(-0.41), R-2 = 0.84, P< 0.001, n = 180) between the proportion of green leaf blade and total mass of harvestable forage in ungrazed kleingrass, even under varying environmental conditions of rainfall and N availability. Thus, total harvestable forage might be used to predict the green leaf proportion of kleingrass in contrasting environments, and used as an easy-to-measure indicator of green leaf proportion that would permit a balance of forage quality and quantity in kleingrass.

AB  - Macrofungi play an extraordinarily important role in the catalysis of the nutrient cycle of deciduous and coniferous forests. Habitat degradation adversely influences the number of fruiting bodies of macrofungi and diminishes the diversity of the fungal community. The diversity of the terricolous- and lignicolous macrofungi assemblages were compared in stands of semi-natural and two plant associations modified by humans in different degrees in North-East Hungary. We used data from 15 permanent plots that were sampled for vascular plants and macrofungi. Rank-abundance curves and R,nyi's diversity profiles were applied for diversity research. The results indicated that structure and diversity of the terricolous macrofungi assemblages were mainly influenced by climatic and habitat conditions and the degradation of the plant associations to a lesser degree. The diversity of lignicolous macrofungi was primarily affected by the continuous presence, quality, and quantity of deadwood. Accordingly, the form and degree of forest management, as well as the age of the growing stocks, influenced community structure. If nature conservation planning and conservation activity are based on those biodiversity indicators which are good proxies for macrofungi biodiversity, the latter might be optimal for preserving macrofungi biodiversity.

AB  - Community indicator projects have the potential to deliver new knowledge about the quality of life in local communities and drive actions to improve them (Phillips 2003; Holden Social Indicators Research 92: 429-448, 2009; Memon and Johnstone 2008). However, the connection between the information produced by community indicator projects and the actions taken to improve conditions in communities remains under-researched (Holden Social Indicators Research 92: 429-448, 2009; Hezri and Dovers Ecological Economics 60: 86-99, 2006). This is because community indicator projects have mainly been conceptualized as producing information for action rather than as part of an action process (Memon and Johnstone 2008). This paper provides a case study of a community indicator project with an explicit plan to move beyond the data and into action. A review of one of the oldest community indicator projects in the United States, the Santa Cruz County Community Assessment Project (CAP) demonstrates how an action oriented community improvement cycle has contributed to measurable improvements for children and youth in one California County. The paper identifies key elements that were important for turning CAP data into local actions and concludes with lessons for community indicator practitioners and questions for future research.

AB  - Ecological risk and vulnerability maps can be used to improve the analysis of pollutant risks and communication to stakeholders. Often, such maps are made for one pollutant at the time. We used the results of wildlife vulnerability analysis, a novel trait-based risk assessment approach, to map overall vulnerability of habitats in Denmark to various metals and one insecticide. These maps were combined with maps of estimated soil concentrations for the same compounds divided by their Maximum Permissible Concentrations. This combination yielded relative risk maps that can be used to assess where the highest risk conditions to wildlife from these individual pollutants in Denmark occur (hot spot identification). In order to show how cumulative risk maps can be made, the maps of the individual pollutants were combined assuming different mechanisms of joint toxicity: no addition, concentration addition, antagonism and synergism. The study demonstrated that with an accurate set of geographical and ecological data one can use the results of vulnerability analysis to make relevant ecological risk maps that show hot spot areas for risks of single or cumulative risks from soil pollutants.

AB  - The development of transgenic plants may help alleviate both environmental and food problems. In Japan, transgenic plants cannot be planted in the field without undergoing an environmental biosafety assessment under confined and semi-confined conditions. The main objectives of environmental biosafety assessment studies are to define the properties of the host plant and to evaluate its influence on other organisms. To appraise the influence of a transgenic plant on other plants, the transgenic plant is examined for new compounds that influence plant using the sandwich method to assay the allelopathic activity of leachate from dried leaf samples. However, because Eucalyptus leaves are difficult to dry, the sandwich method does not allow the evaluation of multiple samples at the same time. Here, we report a new "homogenized method" that relies on homogenizing fleshy leaf samples, instead of drying them. The alleopathic activity of a non-transgenic plant and an Antisense-lim transgenic plant were evaluated using both the sandwich method and the homogenized method to determine whether the homogenized method was available for in biosafety for in biosafety assessments of transgenic plants. The homogenized method may be an effective and useful tool for evaluating differences between non-transgenic and transgenic plants using multiple, concurrent samples.

AB  - This study assessed foraminiferal assemblages in Biscayne Bay, Florida, a heavily utilized estuary, interpreting changes over the past 65 years and providing a baseline for future comparisons. Analyses of foraminiferal data at the genus level revealed three distinct biotopes. The assemblage from the northern bay was characterized by stress-tolerant taxa, especially Ammonia, present in low abundances (similar to 2.0 x 10(3) foraminifers/gram) though relatively high diversity (similar to 19 genera/sample). The southwestern margin of the bay was dominated by Ammonia and Quinqueloculina, an assemblage characterized by the lowest diversities (similar to 12 genera/sample) and highest abundances (similar to 1.1 x 10(4) foraminifers/gram), influenced by both reduced salinity and elevated organic-carbon concentrations. A diverse assemblage of smaller miliolids and rotaliids (similar to 26 genera/sample) characterized the open-bay assemblage, which also had a significant component (similar to 10%) of taxa that host algal endosymbionts. In the past 65 years, populations of symbiont-bearing taxa, which are indicators of normal-marine conditions, have decreased while stress-tolerant taxa, especially Ammonia spp., have increased in predominance.

AB  - Different types of malformations are likely to affect the morphology of diatoms when exposed to particularly unstable environmental conditions, the most easily identifiable being distortion of the whole frustule. In the present study, we investigated, by means of SEM, valve abnormalities induced by high cadmium contamination (100 mu g . L(-1)) in small pennate diatoms. Changes in the shape of Amphora pediculus (Kutz.) Grunow and anomalous sculpturing of the cell wall of many species, such as Encyonema minutum (Hilse) D. G. Mann, Mayamaea agrestris (Hust.) Lange-Bert., Gomphonema parvulum (Kutz.) Kutz., or Eolimna minima (Grunow) Lange-Bert., were observed, which were not, or almost not, noticeable in the LM. With consideration to current knowledge of diatom morphogenesis, metal uptake by the cell would induce, directly or indirectly, damage to many cytoplasmic components (e.g., microtubules, cytoskeleton, Golgi-derived vesicles) involved in the precisely organized silica deposition. This study confirms that many species, whatever their size, are likely to exhibit morphological abnormalities under cadmium stress, and that this indicator may be valuable for the biomonitoring of metal contamination, even if SEM observations are not necessary for routine studies.

AB  - Clinical tests are readily available for assessing severe loss of immune function in children with diseases such as AIDS or primary immunodeficiency. However tests that could reliably identify subtle immune changes, as might be expected to result from exposure to developmental immunotoxic agents, are not readily available. A number of tests are described which we believe have potential applicability for epidemiological studies involving developmental immunotoxicity. Several of the tests, such as T cell receptor rearrangement excision circles (TRECs) and cytokine measurements, while highly relevant from a biological standpoint, may be precluded from use at the current time, for either technical issues or insufficient validation. Immunophenotyping and measurement of serum immunoglobulin levels, on the other hand, are well validated. Yet they may require extraordinary care in experimental design and technical performance in order to obtain data that would consistently detect subtle changes, as these tests are not generally considered highly sensitive. Quantification of the immune response to childhood vaccine, while up to the present used sparingly, may represent an excellent indicator for developmental immunotoxicity when conducted under appropriate conditions.

AB  - Biochemical results on pigments and antioxidants from four for est research areas in Austria (Loisach-Valley, Achenkirch, Glein, Schoneben) were analysed by principal component analysis and classified by cluster analysis. The original data set was compressed to six components containing information about chlorophyll, carotene, and xanthophyll contents (component 1), redox state of carotenoids (2), chlorophyll a/b ratios (3), antioxidant contents (4), chlorophyll/carotenoid ratios (5), and peroxidases (6). A cluster analysis for exemplary plots performed on this new database resulted in 4 distinct clusters of stress-physiological response patterns. Members of cluster 1, representing trees of comparably good health, grew at 1000 in at Glein. Trees belonging to cluster 2, characterized as intermediates between healthy (cluster 1) and oxidatively stressed (cluster 3) were found mainly at 1500 in at Glein and at 1000 in at Achenkirch. Cluster 3 was related to oxidative stress with its members being found at high-elevated (1500 in) plots of Loisach-Valley and Achenkirch areas. Responses of cluster 4 might be related to edaphic conditions. Trees belonging to cluster 4 grew at 1000 in at the Loisach-valley. Such statistical classifications of multivariate patterns allow the objective evaluation of similarities among different field study areas.

AB  - Austrian pine (Pinus nigra Arn.) and red pine (P. resinosa Ait.) were tested for needle damage caused by sulphuric acid spray. Morphology and histology of newly grown needles were compared in 3- and 6-yr-old plants growing in the greenhouse under controlled conditions. Potted plants covered with plastic bags were sprayed daily either with distilled H2O or sulphuric acid of pH 2.5, 3.5 and 4.5. Needle tips, mid-parts and bases were fixed after 1, 3 and 24 h, and 3, 7 and 30 d in glutaraldehyde + 0.1% caffeine for intracellular precipitation of phenolics. Histochemical reactions and electron microscopic observations showed that the morphological damage is linked to increased deposition of phenolic compounds in mesophyll cells, beginning directly under the stomata. Disorganization of membranes leads to death of the mesophyll cells, even before morphological damage is recognizable as brown spots on the needle surface. Thus the histochemical reactions and observations of cell structure revealed damage earlier than macroscopic observations.

AB  - Every year, for ten years now, the IPIN competition has aimed at evaluating real-world indoor localisation systems by testing them in a realistic environment, with realistic movement, using the EvAAL framework. The competition provided a unique overview of the state-of-the-art of systems, technologies, and methods for indoor positioning and navigation purposes. Through fair comparison of the performance achieved by each system, the competition was able to identify the most promising approaches and to pinpoint the most critical working conditions. In 2020, the competition included 5 diverse off-site off-site Tracks, each resembling real use cases and challenges for indoor positioning. The results in terms of participation and accuracy of the proposed systems have been encouraging. The best performing competitors obtained a third quartile of error of 1 m for the Smartphone Track and 0.5 m for the Foot-mounted IMU Track. While not running on physical systems, but only as algorithms, these results represent impressive achievements.

AB  - Composting is a solid waste management alternative that avoids the emission of methane associated with its disposal in landfill and reduces or eliminates the need for chemical fertilisers if compost is applied. The main objective of this study was to analyse the environmental burdens of composting as a way to achieve a more circular valorisation of wine waste. To do so, with the purpose of identifying optimal operational conditions and determining the "hotspots" of the process, the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology was used. The consumption of diesel fuel in machinery was determined to be the main critical point in the environmental effects of the system, followed by the transport and distribution of the compost. After the application of compost instead of mineral fertilisers, corn, tomato and strawberry crops would have a better environmental performance in most impact categories. In this sense, a maximum improvement of 65% in terrestrial ecotoxicity is achieved in strawberry cultivation. In light of the results obtained, it is demonstrated that composting is a suitable way of organic waste valorisation according to Circular Economy principles. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Cell volume regulation, as one of the fundamental homeostasis of the cell, is associated with many cellular behaviors and functions. With the increased studies on the effect of environmental mechanical cues on cell volume regulation, the relationship between cell volume regulation and mechanotransduction becomes more and more clear. In this paper, we review the mechanisms and hypotheses by which cell maintains its volume homeostasis both in vivo and in constructed cell mechanical microenvironment (CMM) in vitro. We discuss how the growth-division regulation maintains the volume homeostasis of cells in the cell cycle and how the cell cortex/membrane tension mediates the effect of CMM (i.e., osmotic pressure, matrix stiffness, and mechanical force) on cell volume regulation. We also highlight the roles of cell volume as a perfect integrator of the downstream signals of mechanotransduction from different aspects of CMM and an effective indicator for the mechanical condition that cell confronts. This interdisciplinary perspective can provide new insight into biomechanics and may shed light on bioengineering and pathological research work. We hope this review can facilitate future studies on the investigation of the role of cell volume in mechanotransduction.

AB  - Acridinium salts, due to their chemiluminogenic properties, have found several applications in biomedical analysis as labels and indicators, where the assessment of emission intensity is used for the end-point detection. This work presents the use of chemiluminescent indicators in the form of selected acridinium esters in order to determine the antioxidant properties of exemplary formulations, namely quercetin, vitamin C and the dietary supplement, Apiextract. The principle of measurements is based on a change in the kinetics of emission decay derived from the acridinium cations in alkaline solutions of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of an antioxidant (the analyte). The proposed system makes a beneficial alternative to related methods, which mostly rely on the assessment of emission efficiency and use the luminometric standard luminol - due to superior parameters of acridinium chemiluminescence, among others - high temporary emission efficiency. The features of the proposed method are manifested by a shorter time period of analysis and lower background signals associated with the environmental influences, as compared to typical approaches. The chromatographic (RP-HPLC) analyses of the substrates and products generated during chemiluminogenic oxidation of acridinium cations under assay conditions are also presented.

AB  - Nosema apis is a pathogen spesific for the European honeybee, Apis mellifera L., while Nosema ceranae is specific for the Asian honeybee, Apis cerana. Turkey provides different environmental and host conditions for both Nosema species. The aim of the study is to determine the dynamic of N. cerenae and N. apis seasonal infection. A number of samples were collected from different apiaries between 2009-2016 years. The samples were kept at -20 degrees C in the laboratory. Light microscopy was used for spore counting and molecular techniques were used to identify the Nosema species. The results showed that winter season had an impact on the type of Nosema as well as on infection rates. The number of N. ceranae spores decreases significantly at low temperatures (<= 5 degrees C). The winter period was found to be the main factor affecting nosema infection level and dominancy of Nosema ceranae. Furthermore, co-infection of both species is an indicator of the dynamics of N. apis and N. ceranae. This study suggests, that there is a dynamic prevalence among the Nosema species depending of the average winter temperature and not a replacement of N. apis by N. ceranae.

AB  - Saline water can be drained from the plant root zone by developing a drainage network; therefore, the lack of control strategies for soil salinity and the subsurface water level will result in high salinity and nutrient concentrations. In large drainage systems, this issue becomes more important due to the large amount of water drained into the environment. Therefore, an environmental impact assessment (EIA) should be conducted before undertaking such developments. Due to the importance of wetlands that may be affected by the sugar cane fields located in Khuzestan Province in Southern Iran, the EIA process was implemented to evaluate this project. Three scenarios of a pre-drainage system development, drainage system development without management issues, and drainage system development with management issues are considered to help reduce the amount of water drained and protect the wetland. The scaling weighting checklist method was used to categorize the data and to ensure that no potential influence was overestimated. The results show the necessity of the application of management practices and drainage system development to protect the Shadegan International Wetland. Development of the project in its current condition is not recommended. Applying wastewater management, including cultivating salinity-resistant plants, is recommended as the most effective method.

AB  - In 1988, the topsoil layer from an ancient coppice wood, situated on the site of the rail terminal of the Channel Tunnel at Folkestone in Kent, was translocated to a receptor site a short distance away. The ground flora of the original wood was surveyed prior to translocation and monitored for 25 years at the new receptor site, where the presence or absence of species was recorded in permanent quadrats. The receptor site was planted with a mixture of broadleaved trees immediately after the soil was moved. After transference there was an increase in the abundance of open-ground species, reflected in the soil seedbank, but while many shade-tolerant species survived and some became dominant, some losses of ancient woodland indicator plants also occurred. Although it was judged to be the best available receptor site for the translocation, the comparatively drier conditions strongly influenced the field layer, while the species composition and density of the planted trees also differed from that of the canopy in the donor wood. Tree canopy uniformity at the receptor site was much greater than in the donor wood, suggesting that management interventions designed to create a more variable light environment might have been conducive to the survival of some ground flora species.

AB  - Urbanization is associated with dramatic increases in noise and light pollution, which affect animal behaviour, physiology and fitness. However, few studies have examined these stressors simultaneously. Moreover, effects of urbanization during early-life may be detrimental but are largely unknown. In developing great tits (Parus major), a frequently-used model species, we determined important indicators of immunity and physiological condition: plasma haptoglobin ( Hp) and nitric oxide (NOx) concentration. We also determined fledging mass, an indicator for current health and survival. Associations of ambient noise and light exposure with these indicators were studied. Anthropogenic noise, light and their interaction were unrelated to fledging mass. Nestlings exposed to more noise showed higher plasma levels of Hp but not of NOx. Light was unrelated to Hp and NOx and did not interact with the effect of noise on nestlings' physiology. Increasing levels of Hp are potentially energy demanding and trade-offs could occur with life-history traits, such as survival. Effects of light pollution on nestlings of a cavity-nesting species appear to be limited. Nonetheless, our results suggest that the urban environment, through noise exposure, may entail important physiological costs for developing organisms.

AB  - Emerging theory suggests that biotic communities in floodplain wetlands should change longitudinally along a river's length and be affected by lateral connectivity of floodplain habitats with main river channels. However, useful invertebrate indicators of floodplain condition remain poorly developed. Snails as a group possess several attributes that should make them useful as potential environmental indicators. In this study, we sampled snail assemblages in 12 floodplain wetlands along Wusuli River (headwater, mid, and downstream reaches) in Northeastern China's Sanjiang Plain. In addition, at 10 sites, comparisons between river-connected and levee-isolated wetlands were performed. Results demonstrated that snail assemblages were concurrently being impacted by river reach, and whether the wetlands were isolated from the river, or not. Using multivariate analyses, the studied wetlands were divided into three major groups based on snail assemblages: downstream, mid, and headwater reaches. Seven snail species were significant indicators of these wetland groups. Because snail assemblages vary strongly both longitudinally along and laterally across floodplain habitats of Northeastern China, management of floodplains should recognize that landscape position plays an important role in local habitat ecologies, and that efforts to limit hydrologic connectivity across floodplains will have important consequences for resident biota.

AB  - The present study focuses on the performance analysis of a biomass-to-liquid (BTL) process for the co-production of green diesel and electricity. The BTL process consists of biomass gasification and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis, and rice straw is investigated as the biomass feedstock. The modeling of the BTL process is performed using Aspen Custom Modeler (ACM). BTL processes with different configurations, i.e., with and without a tar removal unit based on steam reforming and autothermal (ATO) reforming, are compared. The amounts of green diesel and electricity produced and the overall potential environmental impact (PEI) derived from the Waste Reduction (WAR) algorithm are used as technical and environmental performance indicators and subjected to the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) analysis. The simulation results demonstrate that the BTL process with ATO reforming is the most practical configuration, and the process offering maximum internal heat recovery and minimum external utility requirements is proposed. Based on the parametric analysis of key operating parameters (i.e., gasifying temperature, FT operating temperature and pressure), the optimal operating conditions of the BTL process providing the highest AHP index are identified.

AB  - In high speed and high precision machining applications, it is important to monitor the machining process in order to ensure high product quality. For this purpose, it is essential to develop a dynamometer with high sensitivity and high natural frequency which is suited to these conditions. This paper describes the design, calibration and performance of a milling torque sensor based on piezoresistive MEMS strain. A detailed design study is carried out to optimize the two mutually-contradictory indicators sensitivity and natural frequency. The developed torque sensor principally consists of a thin-walled cylinder, and a piezoresistive MEMS strain gauge bonded on the surface of the sensing element where the shear strain is maximum. The strain gauge includes eight piezoresistances and four are connected in a full Wheatstone circuit bridge, which is used to measure the applied torque force during machining procedures. Experimental static calibration results show that the sensitivity of torque sensor has been improved to 0.13 mv/Nm. A modal impact test indicates that the natural frequency of torque sensor reaches 1216 Hz, which is suitable for high speed machining processes. The dynamic test results indicate that the developed torque sensor is stable and practical for monitoring the milling process.

AB  - Salinization is an increasing enviromental problem in ecosystems. The assessment of total dissolved solids (TDS), pH, electrical conductivity (EC), exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), alkalinity and the concentrations of main ions makes possible to identify salinization and alkalization degree. The salt-affected soils occur in the south part and south-east part of Zitny ostrov, where the dry and mild summer climate, evaporation soil water regime and mineralized groundwater create conditions for development of the saline and alkaline soils. Five localities with highly-mineralized groundwater were monitored to evaluate salinity and alkality in the period 1989-2006. At the bottom horizons in localities 1 5 evaporative residues (salt content) reached value 0.1 - 0.2 %. In 2006 dry evaporative residues (salt content) was higher than 0.2 %, EC was higher than 250 mS m(-1) at the bottom horizons in localities 1, 2, 4. The mentioned data allow us to state that salinization and alkalization of soils is developing, it starts from the bottom of soil horizons through middle part of the soil profile up to the top horizons. This phenomenon was observed in all investigated soils in different stages of development.

AB  - This paper uses a multi-period economic-environmental Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modelling framework to analyse local sustainability policy issues. Our focus is the small, open, labour-constrained regional economy of Jersey. The case of Jersey is of particular interest for two main reasons. The first is the unusually low degree of geographical labour market integration for such a small regional economy. This motivates our treatment of labour as a region-specific factor of production. The second is the availability of high quality, Jersey-specific economic-enviromental data. We employ CGE model simulations to track the impact of changes in population on a number of energy-consumption and pollution indicators in a recursive dynamic framework under alternative hypotheses regarding economic conditions over the time period under consideration. In the case of Jersey, we find that household consumption is the key factor governing the environmental impact of economic disturbances. Therefore the analysis includes an examination of the sensitivity of the simulation results to different assumptions affecting the wage elasticities of labour demand and supply, and the speed of adjustment to equilibrium on the responsiveness of household income to shifts in labour supply.

AB  - This study examines the distribution characteristics of reduced sulfur compounds (RSCs such as DMS, CS2, H2S, DMDS, and CH3SH) and their photochemical reactions in landfill air. The photochemical conversions of RSCs to a further oxidized form, SO2 were evaluated in the landfill site using a photochemical box model. Measurements of RSCs were carried out from landfill areas in Daegu, Korea, during a wintertime period (e.g., 13-16 Jan 2004). This study indicated that H2S was the most dominant RSC in the landfill, with the concentrations of 4.2 +/- 5.8ppbv. The chemical species of RSCs, which may exert influences on the SO2 production depending on sampling conditions, were found to include DMS, DMDS, and H2S. In general, the RSC contribution to the observed SO2 levels was insignificant in the sampling sites investigated. Overall, the extent of the RSC oxidation to the observed SO2 varied dramatically during the sampling period. The photochemical conversion of the RSCs in the landfill environment can account for about 15% of the observed SO2, on average. There was a strong correlation between DMS and SO2 concentration levels during the study period. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Traditional culture and microscopy methods for evaluation of bioaerosols are slow, tedious, and rather imprecise. In this study, the application of flow cytometry that was combined with a fluorescent technique (FCM/FL) was evaluated as a technique to quickly and accurately determine and quantify the total concentration and viability of bioaerosols. The optimal conditions of five fluorescent dyes [ acridine orange (AO), SYTO-13, propidium iodide ( PI), YOPRO-1, and 5-cyano-2,3-ditolytetrazolium chloride (CTC)] used in FCM/FL were determined for laboratory samples of bacterial aerosols ( Escherichia coli, and endospores of Bacillus subtilis) and fungal aerosols ( Candida famata and Penicillium citrinum spores). Based on the measured cell concentration, fluorescence intensity, and staining efficiency as indicators for dye performance evaluation, SYTO-13 was found to be the most suitable fluorescent dye for determining the total concentration of the bioaerosols, as well as YOPRO-1 was the most suitable for determining viability. Moreover, the established optimal FCM/FL with dyes was validated for characterizing microorganism profiles from both air and water samples from the aeration tank of hospital wastewater treatment plant. In conclusion, the FCM/FL successfully assessed the total concentration and viability for bacterial and fungal microorganisms in environmental field samples.

AB  - The occurrence of nitrogen isotope discrimination with absorption and assimilation of nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+) was investigated using two genotypes of barley, Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Steptoe and Az12 : Az70, the latter of which lacks the characterized nitrate reductase isozymes. Plants were grown under two situations: a closed system with limited nitrogen or an open system with unlimited nitrogen, to elucidate the conditions and processes that influence discrimination. There was no discrimination observed for Az12 : Az70 when supplied with limited nitrogen. Discrimination was observed for Steptoe seedlings at high external NO3- concentrations, but not with low NO3- when assimilation is probably rapid and complete. The same pattern was observed for Steptoe when NH4+ was supplied; indicating that for both nitrogen forms discrimination is dependent upon the presence of the assimilatory enzyme and the external concentration. The implications of this study are that both internal ( assimilatory enzyme distribution) and external ( source concentration) factors may have a larger impact on tissue delta(15)N than the form of nitrogen utilized. This suggests that tissue delta(15)N may not always be a reliable indicator of a plant's integrated nitrogen nutrition.

AB  - The waste water discharges of Finnish industry have mainly been regulated by permits. The permits contain limits and requirements individually set for each plant, taking into account the ecological characteristics of the specific site as well as the technological and economic features of the plant. Despite great increases in production, discharges into water by the Finnish pulp and paper industry have decreased markedly in recent decades. For example, the total biochemical oxygen demand of discharges in 1997 was less than 10% of the corresponding figure for 1982. This paper examines the development of the limits included in the permits and their effects on the discharges of the entire Finnish pulp and paper industry. Statistical analyses of mill level data are combined with the results of thematic interviews. The results show that permit conditions are only one of several factors responsible for the reduced discharges. In some cases clear effects of permit limits can be identified, whereas in other cases they have had no effect. The study shows that more information can be gathered by combining quantitative and qualitative research methods than by using these methods separately. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Background: In most developing countries, the prevalence of height deficit among schoolchildren correlates well with poverty. Therefore this indicator is frequently used to monitor the quality of life of a population. Aim: To assess the changes in height of children entering first grade during the last decade. Material and methods: The records of the Chilean Board of School Assistance, that recollects anthropometric data on 80% of the national population of school age children, were used. For the purposes of this analysis, data from first graders in 1987, 1990, 1993 and 1996 were considered. The absolute variation of height, height for age Z scores were calculated. Children were grouped by sex and by age, using 7 years old as the cutoff value. Results: During the last decade, height has increased significantly in men and women and in all ages. The increase has been greater in younger children. There is a higher proportion of males than women with height deficit. Conclusions: The increase in height can be attributed to the improvement in social, economic and biological conditions of our population as well as to the targeting strategies of existing food programs.

AB  - In the context of energy conservation and sustainable development, building design should take into account the energy efficiency criteria by using renewable energy sources. Double-skin facades (DSF) represent innovative energy-efficient techniques that have gained increasing interest worldwide. The present study reports the results of an experimental campaign performed on a full-scale double-skin facade using the in-situ measurement methodology. The thermodynamic behavior of the facade is studied under real exterior climatic conditions in Romania in hot and cold seasons, and performance indicators in terms of pre-heating efficiency and dynamic insulation efficiency were determined. Three summer periods are analyzed corresponding to the outdoor air curtain scenario for three ventilation modes in naturally or mechanically ventilated single-story DSF. Results revealed that the third ventilation scenario, which combines horizontal and vertical openings, gives the best efficiency of 71.3% in the double skin facade functioning. During the cold season, the channel facade behaved like a thermal buffer between the building and the exterior air, ensuring the thermal energy for partial or integral heating of the building.

AB  - In order to reduce the risk and assess the organism's ability to cope with stress in the changing workplace environment of the rail industry, we have conducted psychophysiological examinations to assess the functional status of 204 rail transport operators (Astana, Kazakhstan). The occupational composition included traffic operators, in particular, train, terminal, locomotive, and energy operators, 204 persons in total. The assessment included the analysis of professional activity, registration of 22 characteristics of labor stressfulness across three subdivisions and sections, and psychophysiological status tests over the course of a shift using EPDK-MK and Varicard automatic machines. Functional studies were conducted via certified methods before and after the shift. The reliability of traffic operators depends on their health, since any deviations can affect the mental processes that are responsible for professional activity. It was found that the indicators of the psychophysiological status were characterized by pronounced fatigue, which required not only pre-shift control, but also post-shift express correction. Recommendations how to reduce stress were marked. The main ones are improvement of equipment, giving on the job access to professional psychological counseling, support during work in dangerous conditions and modeling of an optimal daily routine.

AB  - Farmland soil typical for the Polish rural environment was used in pot experiment to estimate the impact of cadmium and zinc on the manganese, lead and copper uptake by lemon balm (Melissa officinalis L). Bioavailable and total forms of investigated metals in soil and metal concentrations in plants were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. The plant photosynthesis indicators were also examined. Intensification of photosynthesis upon the high zinc and cadmium soil supplementation was observed. This effect was not detected at low metal concentrations. ANOVA proved that cadmium and zinc treatments influenced manganese, lead and copper transfer from soil and their concentration in plants. Zinc uptake and accumulation in either roots or above-ground parts in plant was inversely proportional to cadmium concentration in soil. Manganese concentration in roots decreased upon the soil supplementation with either zinc or cadmium. It suggests that the latter ions are transported via symplastic pathways and compete with manganese for similar transporters. The opposite situation was observed for lead and copper. Soil supplementation with cadmium and zinc affects manganese, lead and copper concentrations and photosynthesis intensity in lemon balm plant. The following combined interactions in either normal or stress conditions are important indicators of the migration pathways.

AB  - This organic-rich shale was analyzed to determine the type, origin, maturity and depositional environment of the organic matter and to evaluate the hydrocarbon generation potential of the shale. This study is based on geochemical (total carbon content, Rock-Eval pyrolysis and the molecular composition of hydrocarbons) and whole-rock petrographic (maceral composition) analyses. The petrographic analyses show that the shale penetrated by the Chaiye 2 well contains large amounts of vitrinite and sapropelinite and that the organic matter within these rocks is type III and highly mature. The geochemical analyses show that these rocks are characterized by high total organic carbon contents and that the organic matter is derived from a mix of terrestrial and marine sources and highly mature. These geochemical characteristics are consistent with the results of the petrographic analyses. The large amounts of organic matter in the Carboniferous shale succession penetrated by the Chaiye 2 well may be due to good preservation under hypersaline lacustrine and anoxic marine conditions. Consequently, the studied shale possesses very good hydrocarbon generation potential because of the presence of large amounts of highly mature type III organic matter.

AB  - Ecosystem water use efficiency is an important indicator of carbon and water cycle coupling. This study presents a new measure of water use efficiency, soil water use efficiency (SWUE), based on gross primary production and surface soil moisture derived from remote sensing products (ECV/-SM). Variation in SWUE among biomes, climate conditions, and latitudes from 2000 to 2014 was comprehensively assessed. Average global SWUE over this 15-year period was approximately 3.47 gC/kgH(2)O. SWUE was relatively high for ecosystems near the equator and decreased gradually with increasing latitude. At the biome level, high SWUE was measured in evergreen broadleaf forests, and lower values were found in shrublands. Compared with two other commonly used indicators of water use efficiency, EWUE (ratio of gross primary production to evapotranspiration) and RUE (ratio of gross primary production to precipitation), average SWUE from 2000 to 2014 was significantly higher and had the largest range of values. In addition, spatial distributions of these three indicators varied greatly. The new indicator SWUE will help promote understanding of soil water use in various ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of the study is to compare biochemical and physiological reactions of two related species of green microalgae (Scenedesmus acuminatus and Scenedesmus opoliensis), both considered suitable for bioindication and remediation of aquatic environments polluted with herbicides. Monoalgal axenic cultures were treated for 10 days under controlled conditions with different concentrations (from 0.1 mu M to 100 mu M) of glufosinate (a nonselective contact herbicide that inhibits glutamine synthase activity, thus disturbing photorespiration, inhibiting photosynthetic carbon assimilation, and generating ammonium excess in plant cells). S. opoliensis was found to be a better indicator of adverse effects of glufosinate than S. acuminatus. Changes in the ground chlorophyll fluorescence (reflecting light energy harvesting capacity), in cell division rate and in chlorophyll-a content may be early, costeffective and sensitive markers of herbicide impact on microalgal communities inhabiting polluted water. Our results bring new data concerning the need of selection among related test organisms based on differentiated tolerance, as well as concerning biochemical parameters suitable for evaluation of water pollution impact when organic xenobiotics accumulate in aquatic environments. Thus, the presented results may be applied in optimizing bioindication of water quality using microalgae, and in treatment of wastewater polluted due to agricultural practices.

AB  - Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a popular supervised data-driven approach for building empirical models from available data. Like all data-driven methods, under non stationary environmental and operational conditions it needs to be provided with adaptive learning capabilities, which might become computationally burdensome with large datasets cumulating dynamically. In this paper, a cost-efficient online adaptive learning approach is proposed for SVR by combining Feature Vector Selection (FVS) and Incremental and Decremental Learning. The proposed approach adaptively modifies the model only when different pattern drifts are detected according to proposed criteria. Two tolerance parameters are introduced in the approach to control the computational complexity, reduce the influence of the intrinsic noise in the data and avoid the overfitting problem of SVR. Comparisons of the prediction results is made with other online learning approaches e.g. NORMA, SOGA, KRLS, Incremental Learning, on several artificial datasets and a real case study concerning time series prediction based on data recorded on a component of a nuclear power generation system. The performance indicators MSE and MARE computed on the test dataset demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed online learning method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - During recent years, many studies have been undertaken to investigate how spectral characteristics of forests can provide information on spatial patterns of tree species diversity (TSD). Important advances have been made, and significant relationships between TSD and remotely sensed indicators of net primary productivity and environmental heterogeneity have been reported. However, the season-dependence of these relationships has not yet been fully investigated, and the influence of phenology remains poorly understood. In this study, we aim to assess how the relationships between remote sensing indicators and TSD depend on the season of the year. TSD measures, including species richness, Shannon's diversity and Simpson's diversity, were determined for 82 field plots in the Afromontane cloud forests of Taita Hills, Kenya. A time series of 15 Landsat images were used to calculate a set of spectral and heterogeneity metrics. The relationship between remote-sensing metrics and TSD measures was analysed by simple and multivariate regression analysis. We conclude that the relationships between remote-sensing metrics and TSD are season-dependent. Hence, it is demonstrated the date of image acquisition is an important aspect to be considered in biodiversity studies. Given that the dependence of the relationships is closely linked to climate seasonality defining vegetation phenology, the relationships may also vary according to geographical conditions.

AB  - Over the last forty years, applying dendrogeomorphology to palaeoflood analysis has improved estimates of the frequency and magnitude of past floods worldwide. This paper reviews the main results obtained by applying dendrogeomorphology to flood research in several case studies in Central Spain. These dendrogeomorphological studies focused on the following topics: (1) anatomical analysis to understand the physiological response of trees to flood damage and improve sampling efficiency; (2) compiling robust flood chronologies in ungauged mountain streams, (3) determining flow depth and estimating flood discharge using two-dimensional hydraulic modelling, and comparing them with other palaeostage indicators; (4) calibrating hydraulic model parameters (i.e. Manning roughness); and (5) implementing stochastic-based, cost-benefit analysis to select optimal mitigation measures. The progress made in these areas is presented with suggestions for further research to improve the applicability of dendrogeochronology to palaeoflood studies. Further developments will include new methods for better identification of the causes of specific types of flood damage to trees (e.g. tilted trees) or stable isotope analysis of tree rings to identify the climatic conditions associated with periods of increasing flood magnitude or frequency.

AB  - Lava-fed deltas are extraordinarily useful indicators of fossil water (and ice) levels in glacial, marine, and lacustrine environments. Deltas fed by 'a'a lava should be at least as common as those sourced in pahoehoe, yet they have been rarely described. Although facies models for pahoehoe lava-fed deltas are well established, the architecture and lithofacies of 'a'a-fed equivalents are substantially different and have thus far largely been unrecognized. This can have profound consequences for paleoenvironmental investigations, particularly those attempting to reconstruct past ice sheets. Essential features of 'a'a lava-fed deltas include (1) a subaerial 'a'a lava capping unit comprising massive internal sheet lava overlain by clinkers; (2) a crudely developed subaerial to subaqueous transition (passage zone); (3) a chaotic subaqueous association of abundant lava lobes and hyaloclastite with admixed vesicular, often reddened (oxidized) lava clinkers; and (4) rare subaqueous stratification with predominantly lower dips (similar to 10 degrees-20 degrees) than in deltas fed by pahoehoe lava (similar to 25 degrees-40 degrees). We develop a generic facies model and investigate the emplacement conditions of 'a'a lava-fed deltas in order to facilitate the recognition and environmental interpretation of these important sequence types in ancient successions.

AB  - Exergy analysis is applied to assess the energy conversion processes that take place in the human body, aiming at developing indicators of health and performance based on the concepts of exergy destroyed rate and exergy efficiency. The thermal behavior of the human body is simulated by a model composed of 15 cylinders with elliptical cross section representing: head, neck, trunk, arms, forearms, hands, thighs, legs, and feet. For each, a combination of tissues is considered. The energy equation is solved for each cylinder, being possible to obtain transitory response from the body due to a variation in environmental conditions. With this model, it is possible to obtain heat and mass flow rates to the environment due to radiation, convection, evaporation and respiration. The exergy balances provide the exergy variation due to heat and mass exchange over the body, and the exergy variation over time for each compartments tissue and blood, the sum of which leads to the total variation of the body. Results indicate that exergy destroyed and exergy efficiency decrease over lifespan and the human body is more efficient and destroys less exergy in lower relative humidities and higher temperatures.

AB  - The Sustainable Value approach integrates the efficiency with regard to environmental, social and economic resources into a monetary indicator. It gained significant popularity as evidenced by diverse applications at the corporate level. However, its introduction as a measure adhering to the strong sustainability paradigm sparked an ardent debate. This study explores its validity as a macroeconomic strong sustainability measure by applying the Sustainable Value approach to the EU-15 countries. Concretely, we assessed environmental, social and economic resources in combination with the GDP for all EU-15 countries from 1995 to 2006 for three benchmark alternatives. The results show that several countries manage to adequately delink resource use from GDP growth. Furthermore, the remarkable difference in outcome between the national and EU-15 benchmark indicates a possible inefficiency of the current allocation of national resource ceilings imposed by the European institutions. Additionally, by using an effects model we argue that the service degree of the economy and governmental expenditures on social protection and research and development are important determinants of overall resource efficiency. Finally, we sketch out three necessary conditions to link the Sustainable Value approach to the strong sustainability paradigm. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to identify the habitat types listed in the Habitats Directive Annex I that require low-intensity agricultural management for their existence. We assessed the link between the Annex I habitat types and agricultural practices in order to identify habitat types that depend on the continuation of agricultural practices or whose existence is prolonged or spatially enlarged via blocking or reducing the secondary succession by agricultural activities. 63 habitat types that depend on or which can profit from agricultural activities-mainly grazing and mowing-were identified. They are classified into 2 groups: (1) habitats fully dependent on the continuation of agricultural management; (2) habitats partly dependent on the continuation of agricultural management. This paper also briefly discusses habitat types for which either doubts remain on their dependence on agricultural management, or the relation to extensive farming practices exists only in part of their area of distribution in Europe or under certain site conditions, respectively. Assessments of the conservation status of habitats of European Importance by 25 EU Member States in 2007 showed that habitats identified by us as depending on agricultural practices had a worse status than non-agricultural habitats.

AB  - The aim of this work was to quantify the most significant impact from the polluted environment and to review the correlation between pollution indicators and the content and structures of Tanacetum vulgare L. (Tansy). Heavy metals as mercury, lead, cadmium, chromium and nickel are considered as pollution indicators. The micro and macro elements concentration of S, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, Fe, Si, Al and Mn were tested too. The concentration of the essential oil was analyzed as indicator of Tansy environmental adaptability. Essential oils are practically agents which represents correlation between plant and environment. The type of Tansy was selected for laboratory research, because it belongs to most speeded urban flora and vegetation, in which the imperative to adapt is very strong. All those parameters was monitored on two different locations: industrial zone (anthropogenic) and park area (non anthropogenic) for comparison, as zero stage of the environment, before pollution. The diferences were also recorded in the morphological and anatomical structure and chlorophyll a and b content of the Tansy and they were caused by differences of cumulative environmental conditions, with dominant efects of the contamination degree of the location, soil type and microclimate.

AB  - Finnish agriculture is likely to undergo major changes in the near and intermediate future. The future policy context can be examined at a general level by strategic scenario building. Computer-based modelling in combination with agricultural policy scenarios can in turn create a basis for the assessments of changes in environmental quality following possible changes in Finnish agriculture. The analysis of economic consequences is based on the DREMFIA model, which is applied to Study effects of various agricultural policies on land use, animal production, and farmers' income. The model is suitable for an impact analysis covering an extended time span - here up to the year 2015. The changes in land use, obtained with the DREMFIA model assuming rational economic behaviour, form the basis when evaluating environmental impacts of different agricultural policies. The environmental impact assessment is performed using the field scale nutrient transport model ICECREAM. The modelled variables are nitrogen and phosphorus losses in surface runoff and percolation. In this paper the modelling strategy will be presented and highlighted using two case study catchments with varying environmental conditions and land use as an example. In addition, the paper identifies issues arising when connecting policy scenarios with impact modelling.

AB  - The incidence of cannibalism of larval Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) on maize under field conditions was investigated using field cages. Cannibalism was found to account for approximately 40% mortality when maize plants were infested with two or four fourth-instar larvae over a 3-day period. Field trials examined the effect of larval density on the prevalence of natural enemies of S. frugiperda. The abundance of predators (earwigs, staphylinids, other predatory beetles, and Chrysoperla spp.) was significantly greater on maize plants with higher levels of larval feeding damage, while the relationship between predator abundance and number of S. frugiperda larvae per plant was less clear. As larval damage is probably a more reliable indicator of previous larval density than numbers collected at an evaluation, this indicates that predation risk will be greater for larvae living in large groups. Parasitism accounted for 7.1% mortality of larvae in sorghum, and involved six species of Hymenoptera and Tachinidae. There was no effect of larval density or within-plant distribution on the probability of larval attack by parasitoids. The selective benefits of cannibalism, in relation to the risk of predation and parasitism, are discussed.

KW  - VEGETATION THEORY
AB  - The importance of the shape of a species response curve to an environmental gradient is reviewed. The implications for vegetation theory, ordination methods, species as indicators of environmental conditions, predicting species distribution from surveys and simulation models of climatic impact on vegetation are examined. A beta-function V = k (x - a)alpha . (b - x)gamma is used to model species response curves using generalized linear modelling (GLM). Two hypotheses are tested; (1) that response curves differ significantly from a unimodal symmetric (Gaussian) shape and (2) that the direction of skew is a function of species position along the gradient. Nine eucalypt species are modelled using GLM with a beta-function fitted for mean annual temperature. Six other environmental variables and factors are considered in fitting the statistical models; mean annual rainfall, mean monthly solar radiation, topographic position, lithological type, nutrient index and rainfall seasonality.
   All nine species are significantly skewed in response to temperature. The direction of skew is positive when a species optimum temperature falls below 11.5-degrees-C and negative for species with optimum above. These results indicate that current vegetation analyses which require the modelling of species response curves, or assumptions about the shape of the response, require reassessment.

AB  - Like most other similar institutions in Jordan, Jordan University of Science and Technology relies on a diesel-fired boiler that supplies a district heating system for space heating on campus. Different solar collector area scenarios were considered for both evacuated tube collector and parabolic trough collector technologies. The MATLAB package was utilized, and a code was developed using hourly irradiance and ambient temperature data which represented the average values for the last three years. The results show promising benefits at all levels. Technically, a high solar fraction of 0.84 can be achieved without the need for energy storage. Environmentally, potential reduction in carbon dioxide emission of 1,600 tons can be realized annually. Economically, the discounted payback period was calculated for each case studied. It turned out that the best value was 3.4 years for the case of 4,000 m2 evacuated tube collector and that parabolic trough collector technology is superior to evacuated tube collector technology although it has a higher initial cost.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of nature-based guidance lessons on anxiety and connection to nature among elementary students using a pretest post-test with control group experimental design. Nature-based interventions have been an effective treatment for anxiety among adults, but there is less literature conducted with children, and no other studies thus far have examined interventions as implemented by a school counselor through guidance lessons. An elementary school was recruited through convenience sampling and included four third grade classes, representing the entire grade level at the school, which were randomly assigned to control and experimental conditions. Participants were given anxiety and connection to nature assessments 1 week before and after the 6-week intervention. Data were analyzed using a two-way mixed analysis of variance for each assessment, and t-tests were done to establish group equivalence at baseline. Results indicated that anxiety was significantly reduced among the experimental group, and that there was a significant increase in connection to nature among both groups. Based on these findings, this study presents a cost-effective intervention that reduces student anxiety and is easily incorporated into an existing guidance curriculum.

AB  - We developed an index for use by New Jersey counties to measure West Nile virus (WNV) transmission risk to the human population. We used a latent profile analysis to develop the index, identifying categories of environmental conditions associated with WNV transmission risk to humans. The final model included 4 indicators of transmission risk: mosquito abundance and minimum field infection rate, temperature, and human case count. We used data from 2004 to 2018 from all 21 New Jersey counties aggregated into 11 2-wk units per county per year (N = 3,465). Three WNV risk classes were identified. The Low Risk class had low levels of all variables. The Moderate Risk class had high abundance, average temperature levels, and low levels of the other variables. The High Risk class had substantially above average human case likelihood, average temperature, and high mosquito infection rates. These results suggest the presence of 3 distinct WNV risk profiles, which can be used to guide the development of public health actions intended to mitigate WNV transmission risk to the human population.

AB  - N. gonorrhoeae is one of the most pressing antibiotic resistant threats of our time and low-cost diagnostics that can easily identify antibiotic resistance are desperately needed. However, N. gonorrhoeae responds so uniquely to growth conditions that it cannot be assumed gonorrhea will respond to common microbiological methods used for other pathogenic organisms. In this paper, we explore visual colorimetric indicators of N. gonorrhoeae growth that can be seen without a microscope or spectrophotometer. We evaluate growth media, pH indicators, resazurin-based dyes, and tetrazolium-based dyes for their use in simple colorimetric system. Overall, we identified Graver Wade media as the best at supporting robust gonococcal growth while also providing the least background when analyzing results of colorimetric tests. XTT, a tetrazolium-based dye, proved to show to brightest color change over time and not negatively impact the natural growth of N. gonorrhoeae. However, other dyes including PrestoBlue, MTT, and NBT are less expensive than XTT and work well when added after bacterial growth has already occurred. By identifying the specific use cases of these dyes, this research lays the groundwork for future development of a color-based antibiotic susceptibility low-cost test for N. gonorrhoeae.

AB  - The aim of the study was to examine the species diversity of mycoplankton in the profiles of eutrophic lakes with different abundance of indicator microorganisms and aerobic conditions, and to check whether there are species of mycoplankton characteristic for particular layers of the studied limnic ecosystems. It has been shown that the epilimnion and metalimnion of the studied lakes are characterized by the highest abundance of mycoplankton, while the highest species diversity of these microorganisms, expressed with the Shannon-Wiener index, occurred in the epilimnion and hypolimnion. The most important factors determining the species composition and abundance of mycoplankton in eutrophic lakes are: concentration of organic matter and oxygen dissolved in the water as well as electrolytic conductivity of the water. Candida argentea had the highest stability index in lakes where the metalimnion was characterized by well oxygenated water, whereas in lakes which were characterized by a lack of oxygen in the metalimnion, the predominant species was Candida albicans. This species seems to be a very good microbiological indicator of water quality, due to its interactions with indicator bacteria, in particular Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli.

AB  - Hundred-seed weight (HSW) is an important measure of yield and a useful indicator to monitor the inheritance of quantitative traits affected by genotype and environmental conditions. To identify quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) and mine genes useful for breeding high-yielding and high-quality soybean (Glycine max) cultivars, we conducted a multilocus genome-wide association study (GWAS) on HSW of soybean based on phenotypic data from 20 different environments and genotypic data for 109,676 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 144 four-way recombinant inbred lines. Using five multilocus GWAS methods, we identified 118 QTNs controlling HSW. Among these, 31 common QTNs were detected by various methods or across multiple environments. Pathway analysis identified three potential candidate genes associated with HSW in soybean. We used allele information to study the common QTNs in 20 large-seed and 20 small-seed lines and identified a higher percentage of superior alleles in the large-seed lines than in small-seed lines. These observations will contribute to construct the gene networks controlling HSW in soybean, which can improve the genetic understanding of HSW, and provide assistance for molecular breeding of soybean large-seed varieties.

AB  - Animal welfare, in addition to individual aspects, depends on the understanding and dedication of those responsible for the shelter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the welfare of dogs kept in municipal shelters in the state of Parana, using the Shelter Quality protocol. A total of 16 shelters, 439 dogs and 165 enclosures were evaluated in the fall season of 2017. Most shelters presented dogs with adequate body condition and clean coat, in secure enclosures with adequate water supply and thermal comfort. In addition, most dogs were kept in collective enclosures and in open environments, with low noise levels and showing more positive, desirable emotions in adoption. As negative aspects, 58% (96/165) of the precincts evaluated had inadequate or inexistent beds and 30% (50/165) of the enclosures kept dogs individually, being indicators of a low degree of well-being for the dogs involved. In addition, no shelter provided elderly dog rations and 81% (13/16) of the shelters neglected the diagnosis and treatment of pain. Although most shelters present more positive than negative points in their evaluation, shelter management should always aim at correcting critical points that compromise animal welfare.

AB  - Despite the importance of the American lobster fishery, little data exists on wild larval stages. Analysis of nutrient composition from wild specimen is commonly used to evaluate the physiological condition of marine species, to characterize populations and to establish feeding strategies when cultivating that particular species. The aim of this study was to evaluate the natural variations of lipid classes and fatty acid profiles of stage IV American lobster caught in three different sites of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence (Canada): the Iles-de-la-Madeleine (Qc); Dingwall (NS); and False Bay (August and October) (NS). Both neutral and polar fatty acids levels were highly variable among sample sites. Almost all the main physiological indicators of lipids (TAG, PL, DHA, EPA, ARA and DHA/EPA) varied among sites, while only the ARA levels varied in time, for the False Bay site. ARA levels are usually associated with stressful situations that could have occurred when water temperatures decreased before winter, in October, at the False Bay site. Variations observed between sites could reflect differences existing in the type of food available and/or local adaptation of the stage IV larvae.

AB  - 1 The African coffee white stem borer (CWSB) Monochamus leuconotus is a destructive pest of Arabica coffee in Africa. Documentation on outbreaks, spatiotemporal development and the relationship with different environmental conditions and coffee production system is limited.
   2 To underpin effective control measures, we studied aspects of local and regional pest drivers in Eastern Uganda.
   3 At the local scale, we (i) characterized the temporal development of CWSB and explored associations with environmental and shade-related indicators. During two growing seasons and on 84 coffee plots, we recorded CWSB incidence/infestation and microclimate on an altitudinal gradient and different shading systems. The bimodal rainfall, altitude and shade affected CWSB development through their effect on minimum temperature.
   4 At the landscape level, we (ii) analyzed the spatial pattern of CWSB. Data on CWSB were collected on 180 plots. Pest incidence showed a spatial arrangement varying by districts. A possible relationship with human movement and the landscape context contributing to pest spread is suggested.
   5 CWSB control measures should be synchronized with the bimodal rainfall patterns and an emphasis should be given to identifying and limiting pathways of pest spread from highly infested to new areas.

AB  - Identification of the key environmental indicators (KEIs) from a large number of environmental variables is important for environmental management in tidal flat reclamation areas. In this study, a modified principal component analysis approach (MPCA) has been developed for determining the KEIs. The MPCA accounts for the two important attributes of the environmental variables: pollution status and temporal variation, in addition to the commonly considered numerical divergence attribute. It also incorporates the distance correlation (dCor) to replace the Pearson's correlation to measure the nonlinear interrelationship between the variables. The proposed method was applied to the Tiaozini sand shoal, a large-scale tidal flat reclamation region in China. Five KEIs were identified as dissolved inorganic nitrogen, Cd, petroleum in the water column, Hg, and total organic carbon in the sediment. The identified KEIs were shown to respond well to the biodiversity of phytoplankton. This demonstrated that the identified KEIs adequately represent the environmental condition in the coastal marine system. Therefore, the MPCA is a practicable method for extracting effective indicators that have key roles in the coastal and marine environment.

AB  - High-temperature stress markedly influences grape growth and development. However, how high-temperature stress response differs between controlled and field-cultivated grape is poorly understood. In this study, the effects of heat treatment on grapevines were studied for changes in photosystem II (PSII) activity and expression levels of heat-responsive genes and heat shock protein HSP21. July 31st, 2015 was considered as the post high-temperature treatment (42 degrees C; temperatures above 40 degrees C for a period of time each day ranging from 1-7 h) under field cultivation in our experiment. The recovery of chlorophyll fluorescence indicators and the increasing expression of heat-responsive genes and the heat shock protein HSP21 suggested the development of heat tolerance in the form of acclimation in grape. Changes in various parameters of photosynthetic pigment fluorescence and of the electron transport chain (Fv/Fm, PIABS, W-k, RCQA, phi(Po), and phi(Eo)) between 42 degrees C and the 45 degrees C treatment demonstrated that the donor side, reaction center, and acceptor side of PSII were influenced by a critical high temperature. Furthermore, the difference between the two cultivation conditions studied was attributed to other environmental factors and inherent tree vigor.

AB  - A rich and diverse assemblage of arthropods and non-biomineralized macroalgae occurs in the Upper Devonian marine deposits of the Holy Cross Mountains, central Poland. The phrase Kowala Lagerstatte is herein proposed for the fossil-bearing deposits confined to the lower Famennian marly shale and limestone succession of the famous Kowala Quarry. The arthropod fauna is represented by phosphatic exo-skeletal remains that still preserve the fine micro-ornamentation of the cuticle. The fauna includes crustaceans and crustacean-like taxa such as thylacocephalans, phyllocarids and angustidontids (in order of abundance). The non-biomineralized algae, represented by at least three morphotypes, occur as carbonaceous compressions of their thalli while still preserving fine details including bundles of thin tubular projections. Although their general appearance is reminiscent of some Early Palaeozoic non-calcified Dasycladales algae, their true taxonomic position is still uncertain. Lithology, as well as faunal and phytoplankton content point to a pelagic sedimentary environment. Impoverished benthic fauna, sediment lamination and geochemical signatures indicate at least periodic bottom-water dysoxic to anoxic conditions. Thus, the preservation of arthropod cuticle and non-calcified algae was primarily governed by oxygen-deficient bottom waters that prevented bioturbation and scavenging during their burial.

AB  - This paper presents a non-intrusive approach for monitoring driver drowsiness using the fusion of several optimized indicators based on driver physical and driving performance measures, obtained from ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistant Systems) in simulated conditions. The paper is focused on real-time drowsiness detection technology rather than on long-term sleep/awake regulation prediction technology. We have developed our own vision system in order to obtain robust and optimized driver indicators able to be used in simulators and future real environments. These indicators are principally based on driver physical and driving performance skills. The fusion of several indicators, proposed in the literature, is evaluated using a neural network and a stochastic optimization method to obtain the best combination. We propose a new method for ground-truth generation based on a supervised Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). An extensive evaluation of indicators, derived from trials over a third generation simulator with several test subjects during different driving sessions, was performed. The main conclusions about the performance of single indicators and the best combinations of them are included, as well as the future works derived from this study.

AB  - The submerged and floating plant communities in floodplain wetlands of the Upper Columbia River have never been described. To explore mechanisms behind the influence of the annual flood pulse on vegetation, we investigated how species group into flood response guilds whose distributions vary along a connectivity gradient between 44 floodplain wetlands and the river, how connectivity influences water and sediment, and to what degree the effect of connectivity on vegetation is mediated by its effects on these environmental variables. We characterised assemblages with cluster and indicator species analysis, as well as non-metric scaling ordination and tested a structural equation model, which defined the relationship between assemblage composition, sediment and water quality, and connectivity to the river. We found four assemblages, each associated with different water and sediment conditions, and positioned at differing degrees of connectivity. The model provided a good fit to the data. We conclude that in highly connected floodplain wetlands the direct effect of flooding supersedes the influence of water and sediment quality in structuring vegetation assemblages. Yet where flooding is less intense, these environmental variables resume their structuring role.

AB  - Eleven million tonnes of waste are produced yearly by the European pulp and paper industry, of which 70% originates from the production of deinked recycled paper. Wastes are very diverse in composition and consist of rejects, different types of sludges and ashes in mills having on-site incineration treatment. The production of pulp and paper from virgin Pulp generates less waste but the waste has similar properties to waste from the production of deinked pulp, although with less inorganics. Due to legislation and increased taxes. landfills are quickly being eliminated as a final destination for wastes in Europe, and incineration with energy recovery is becoming the main waste recovery method. Other options such as pyrolysis, gasification, land spreading, composting and reuse its building material are being applied, although research is still needed for optimization of the processes. Due to the large volumes of waste generated, the high moisture content of the waste and the changing waste composition its it result of process conditions, recovery methods are usually expensive and their environmental impact is still uncertain. For this reason, it is necessary to continue research on different applications of wastes, while taking into account the environmental and economic factors of these waste treatments.

AB  - Chironomid assemblages and sedimentological parameters (grain size, organic content, mineralogy) of a short sediment core from Lake Galletue (38 degrees 41' S, 71 degrees 17' W) were analysed. The sedimentary record includes one volcanic ash (tephra) layer, which has a completely different composition than the host sediment in terms of organic content, grain size, and mineralogy. According to the geochronology (Pb-210 and Cs-137), this ash layer corresponds to the eruption of Llaima Volcano in 1956-1957. The tephra deposition had an impact on chironomid assemblages producing, among other changes, an increase in Parakiefferiella and a decrease in Ablabesmyia, although no noticeable change was detected in the diversity index. When compared with other studies, our results also show an impact in terms of the presence of chironomid head capsules within the tephra. The presence of these head capsules could result from the effects of percolation, since the coarse grain size of the tephra particles provides large interstitial spaces. The recovery in the abundances of some taxa after the tephra input, suggests the lake is probably restoring the conditions prevailing before the tephra fall.

AB  - At present Uzbekistan uses about 42 km(3) of transboundary river flow and 27 km(3) of this is from the Amu Darya. Annual average flow entering the upper reaches of Amu Darya within Uzbekistan is over 60 x 10(9) m(3), which is already contaminated, but significant adverse water quality changes occur downstream where the river is the main source of drinking water. After independence Uzbekistan made a commitment to transfer management of farms and the rural economy from the public sector to private hands. Living conditions have deteriorated severely throughout Uzbekistan, but rural areas have been hit hardest. Several studies and projects in Uzbekistan have adopted the integrated water management-based environmental approach. A structured public participation and consultation process was followed during these projects including a social and the environmental assessment. This paper presents the two case studies to illustrate the effects of uniting the potential of all interested participants to improve water management and environmental safety. Consultation between the two main groups of stakeholders is essential for the future of the water sector. There is substantial support for WUAs among all stakeholders, at all levels, including among those stakeholders who currently manage the existing system.

CP  - World Environmental Congress on Appropriate Environmental and Solid Waste Management and Technologies for Developing Countries
AB  - A series of experimental runs were conducted from 1995 to 1999 in Madison (WT; USA) with the goal to investigate the biodegradation process of seven (7) solid waste components and mixtures of them under near optimal aerobic conditions. It was shown that substrates with high initial lignin contents or high initial HWSM contents Were observed to have relatively low and high degradation extents, respectively. Two linear equations were derived that correlate degradation extent (as indicated by the volatile solids reduction) to initial lignin and initial HWSM contents separately. The lignin equation was compared to a similar equation previously developed for anaerobic environments by Chandler et al. [Predicting methane fermentation biodegradability. In: Biotechnology and Bioengineering Symposium No. 10 (1980) New York: John Wiley & Sons]. With comparison to the Chandler formula, lignin was found to be less inhibitory to the overall substrate decomposition in aerobic environments compared to anaerobic ones. Cellulose loss contributed to a higher than 50% to the overall dry mass loss for all substrates studied. In addition, the cellulose to lignin (C/L) ratio appeared to be a relatively accurate compost maturity indicator, since it reduced to a value less than 0.5 for most substrates that had reached their degradation extent.

AB  - The composition and rate of degradation of organic waste deposited in sediment underneath and adjacent to fish cages in the Huon Estuary, Tasmania, Australia, were investigated. Sediment samples from two near-adjacent sites, but with different sediment types and depths, were analyzed for total organic matter, lipids (fatty acids and sterols), %C, delta(13)C, %N, delta(15)N, and redox potential during a 12-month fallowing period. Additionally, representative samples of fish food and fish faeces were analyzed. It was found that most of the accumulation of organic matter was confined to an area directly underneath the fish cages, but at 30 m from the center of the cage, indicators of fish cage waste (faeces and fish food) were still elevated compared with reference sites. As both fish food and faeces have distinctive fatty acid profiles, the relative proportion of food and/or faeces deposited on the sediment could he determined. After 12 months fallowing, fish-farm-derived organic matter in surface sediment at the center of the cage remained greater than at 30 m distance, even though redox potentials indicated that normal oxic conditions had returned.

AB  - It is assumed that the primary mechanism of action of carbamate and organophosphate insecticides is the inhibition of an enzyme, acetylcholinesterase (AChE; EC 3.1.1.7). This enzyme normally maintains the proper level of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the central and peripheral nervous systems. When AChE activity is depressed due to exposure to cholinesterase-inhibiting insecticides, the ordinarily rapid breakdown of acetylcholine is retarded, causing overstimulation of target cells, which, under extreme conditions, is termed a ''cholinergic crisis.'' At the present time, these indicators of acute intoxication, that is, cholinesterase inhibition and/or clinical signs of cholinergic overstimulation, are used in the risk assessment process to regulate cholinesterase-inhibiting insecticides. There is, however, accumulating evidence both from epidemiological studies and from experimental laboratory studies that short-term exposure to some cholinesterase-inhibiting insecticides may precipitate long-term adverse effects. Recent experimental studies in our laboratory and in others have demonstrated that a single or short-term exposure to some cholinesterase-inhibiting insecticides may produce behavioral or neurochemical changes lasting for days or months, presumably outlasting the cholinesterase inhibition. This body of amassing evidence should alert those in the scientific and regulatory arenas as to the multifaceted nature of the toxicity profile of cholinesterase-inhibiting insecticides.

AB  - The ethylbenzene production process from dry gas has been an energy-intensive process that will inevitably bring about massive carbon emissions. With increasingly stringent regulations to mitigate the effect of greenhouse gas emissions, decision-makers need to make a trade-off among the objectives of environmental impact, economic benefit, and process indicators. An integrated framework combining simulation and multiobjective optimization is proposed to address this issue. The model of the dry gas based ethylbenzene production process is developed by Aspen Plus. The multiobjective optimization (MOO) model, including the profit before tax (PBT), greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), and alkylation reaction selectivity (S-AR), is then derived considering the operational flexibility and mass and energy balance constraints. The Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is used to solve this problem, and the three-dimensional Pareto front is obtained. The TOPSIS method is employed to select a specific solution from the Pareto front. Then, the sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the effects of the decision variables on the objectives. Compared with the original operating conditions, a substantial reduction in GHGs (23%) and a slight increase in PBT (4.1%) are achieved at the expense of specific S-AR (5.3%).

AB  - Supercritical Carbon Dioxide treatment of clean and soiled Filtering Face-Piece respirators is shown to meet mandatory requirements for safe reuse of FFP2. Preliminary tests enabled us to select optimal conditions for Supercritical Carbon Dioxide treatment of FFP2, for one hour at 343 K under 7.5 MPa, with a biocide solution. FFP2s from Paul Boye ' (R) were then tested before and after Supercritical Carbon Dioxide treatment with a soiling solution and a biological indicator (i.e. spores of GeoBacillus stearothermophilus) with respect to three objectives: (i) washing of organic deposits, (ii) sterilization (i.e. spores inactivation) and (iii) preservation of the filtration performances. The proposed Supercritical Carbon Dioxide treatment fulfils these three criterions, with effective decontamination of spores and promising washing preserving FFP2 requirements for filtration efficiency of aerosol ( 94%) with acceptable pressure drop (< 240 Pa). As a simple and low-cost one-step recycling method, Supercritical Carbon Dioxide fits to economical and sustainable development standpoints but also allows one to come back to good practices of face protective equipment use, lowering eventual shortage and tensions for most countries importing these respirators.

AB  - Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a debilitating mental health condition which usually emerges during adolescence and is characterised by distressing and impairing appearance concerns. It is currently unclear whether body dysmorphic concerns represent an extreme manifestation of normal appearance concerns (a dimensional conceptualisation), or whether they are qualitatively distinct (a categorical conceptualisation). This study aimed to determine whether body dysmorphic symptoms are dimensional or categorical in nature by investigating the latent structure using taxometric procedures. Body dysmorphic symptoms were assessed using validated measures among 11-16-year-old school pupils (N=707). Items of the Body Image Questionnaire Child and Adolescent version were used to construct four indicators that broadly corresponded to the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for BDD (appearance concerns, repetitive behaviours, impairment, and insight). Indicators were submitted to three non-redundant taxometric procedures (MAMBAC, MAXEIG and L-MODE). Overall, results of all three taxometric procedures indicated a dimensional latent structure of body dysmorphic symptoms. The current study provides preliminary evidence that body dysmorphic symptoms are continuously distributed among adolescents, with no evidence of qualitative differences between mild and severe symptoms. Implications for clinical practice and research are discussed.

AB  - This paper explores the relationship between internationalization and corporate social responsibility (CSR) communication in Russian firms. Our baseline argument is that internationalization positively affects CSR reporting, as it is expected to enhance the legitimacy of Russian firms abroad. We examine the role of state ownership, and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) vs. non-CIS location, as two boundary conditions on the relationship between internationalization and CSR reporting. We test our hypotheses on panel data of 223 large Russian firms for the period 2012-2017, collected from company annual reports, databases, and official company websites. Our data include financial and non-financial indicators, and firm-level organizational characteristics. The results reveal the context specificity of CSR reporting. We find that state ownership moderates the relationship between internationalization and CSR reporting in CIS and non-CIS markets differently, and the positive effect is stronger for non-CIS locations. Our study goes beyond the traditional approach, treating CSR reporting as a unidimensional construct. We show that the effect of internationalization, both direct and moderated, differs for the different types of CSR activity.

AB  - By producing pellets rich in micromammal remains, owls are important contributors to small vertebrate accumulations in archaeological sites. Neotaphonomic studies are necessary to evaluate predation and fossilization biases before using pellet-derived assemblages to assess palaeoenvironmental reconstructions and micromammal community changes in plio-quaternary deposits. In this study, barn owl (Tyto alba) pellets were collected from two localities of Botswana with markedly different environments: the northern Kalahari (arid) and the Okavango Delta (humid). The taxonomic and taphonomic analyses of the two samples were compared with data from the literature on other T. alba pellet assemblages from Sub-Saharan Africa. This study provides additional data for the wildlife inventory at a local scale and further information about the diet and hunting habits of Tyto alba in this area, as well as its taphonomic impact on local rodent species. It confirms that barn owl assemblages are reliably good indicators of local environmental conditions. An application of palaeoecological methods was also made in order to evaluate the accuracy and performance of palaeoenvironmental reconstructions based on micromammal assemblages produced by owls in an archaeological context. Here, we discuss some methodological issues facing micromammal studies in southern Africa.

AB  - In Bangladesh, drought has negative consequences on agriculture, environments, livelihood, and food security. However, a comprehensive statistical assessment of drought indices has rarely been found in the existing literature. To address this issue, firstly, this paper used daily temperature and precipitation data from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) to calculate Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). After that, we performed a statistical assessment, for instance, Pearson correlation coefficient, cross-correlation, cross-wavelet transform, and root mean square error, to identify the strengths of SPI and SPEI. Our findings showed that though both indices had a strong correlation with each other, SPEI performed better than SPI because evaporative demand has a positive impact on defining drought conditions in Bangladesh. Temperature and rainfall indices, for example, warm spell duration indicator (WSDI) and maximum amount of rain (Rx5day) that falls in five consecutive days, have been applied to find out the relationship between climate extremes and drought indices using cross-wavelet transform. Our results suggested that climate extremes such as WSDI and Rx5day have an influence on droughts in Bangladesh. Our results recommended that multi indices of drought assessment should be required in order to draw a robust conclusion.

AB  - Petrological study of the ultramafic rocks from the Nidar Ophiolite Complex (NOC) of the Indus Suture Zone is carried out. The study of Cr-spinels along with olivine and pyroxenes emphasizes the genesis and tectonic setting of the ultramafites. Olivine from the harzburgite is Mg-rich, with the molar ratio Mg# [Mg/(Mg + Fe2+)] varying between 0.91 and 0.94 and olivine in dunite between 0.92 and 0.94. Clinopyroxene from the harzburgite is TiO2 and Na2O-poor diopside (Wo(47-50)En(47-50)Fs(2-4)). Spinel in harzburgite shows wide Cr#, molar ratio varied between 0.26 and 0.72, and significantly higher in dunites with Cr# ranges from 0.69-0.85. Cr# of the peridotite spinel follow a depletion trend. Calculated equilibrium conditions of the samples are 800-900 degrees C temperature, 32 and 40 kbar pressure, oxygen fugacity -0.09 to 0.55 log units above the FMQ buffer. Residual nature of the harzburgites and the presence of high and low Cr# spinels may be due to the genetic artifact of the different ultramafic units.

AB  - For decades, the concept of sustainability has been recognized as the basis for survival and further development of humanity. As the result of joint efforts, The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted in 2015 by United Nations member states, as a plan and direction for future prosperity. It identified 17 goals, with one of them highlighting the sustainable economic growth, productive employment and decent work. Providing quality jobs and safe working environment, while decreasing in-work poverty, are important preconditions for sustainable economic development. The purpose of this paper is to point out the importance of productive employment from the aspect of sustainable development on the example of Serbia, comparing indicators with surrounding countries and leading EU members. Particular emphasis will be placed on the main difficulties young people in Serbia deal with at the labor market, on certain inequalities and necessary strategies to alleviate the current problems. The issue of youth not in employment, education or training will be analyzed as well, along with unemployment and decent work opportunities in terms of gender and age structure. Furthermore, it aims to address the main causes of these disparities in order to indicate the changes that need to be made and suggest strategies for their implementation.

AB  - Hyperbaric storage is an innovative preservation method that consists of storing food under pressure, either at room or at low temperature, for time periods of days, weeks, or months. Recent scientific literature shows that hyperbaric storage at room temperature (HS-RT) could be an efficient method for fruit juice preservation. Depending on the level applied, pressure can inhibit and even inactivate the endogenous microflora of the fresh juice, while properly preserving other organoleptic and quality indicators. Even though the method has not yet been implemented in the food industry, its industrial viability has been evaluated from different points of view (product quality, consumer acceptation, vessel design, economic, or environmental, among others). The results reveal that HS-RT is effective in extending the shelf-life of both acidic and low-acidic fruit juices. Moreover, the energetic costs and the carbon footprint of HS-RT are considerably lower than those of refrigeration, therefore, HS-RT could be a reliable and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional cold storage. However, before industrial implementation, much more research is needed to clarify the effects of the storage conditions on the agents that cause fruit juice deterioration.

AB  - So far, the study of gear contacts in lightly loaded gears by means of vibration analysis has not been sufficiently addressed in the literature. Indeed, the complex nature of the physical phenomena involved makes the vibration analysis extremely challenging. This paper deals with the development and the validation of an approach for the contact pattern assessment in straight bevel gears within a pass/fail decision process. The proposed methodology is based on blending vibration-based condition indicators with classification algorithms in order to discriminate proper contact patterns from improper ones. Specifically, three different classification algorithms have been investigated: the Naive Bayes classifier, the weighted k-Nearest Neighbors classifier and a novel classifier proposed by the authors. The classifier accuracies are evaluated with a MC cross-validation that includes an extended experimental campaign consisting of more than one hundred different straight bevel gear pairs. The results show that the proposed classifier is superior to the other considered classifiers in terms of average accuracy. Finally, this manuscript proposes an original methodology that provides a reliable and quick assessment of the contact pattern in straight bevel gears considering different speeds, gear parameters and surface finish.

AB  - In the frames of F7P project AMIGA "Assessing and monitoring the impact of genetically modified plants on agro-ecosystems" we studied the biodiversity of epigeic spiders in a typical potato growing region of South-western Bulgaria for three consecutive years (2013-2015). A total of 1523 individuals from 46 species were collected and defined. The present data are discussed in relation to results recorded more than ten years earlier for the same agricultural area. The lycosid species Pardosa agrestis and the linyphiid species Oedothorax apicatus, O. retusus, Trihoncoides piscator, Araeoncus humilis, Erigone dentipalpis, and Meioneta rurestris were predominant for the whole period. Despite the variation of potato cultivars, pesticides applied and irrigation systems, there were no significant differences in epigeic spiders biodiversity for this typical potato region of Bulgaria, during the last fifteen years. P. agrestis accounted for 53-90% from all spider species and thus it could be used as bioindicator for monitoring the effects (positive/negative) of the different agricultural practices, climatic conditions, or various cultivars grown. It appeared that epigeic spiders' abundance was more negatively influenced by heavy rainfall or flooding type of irrigation than the use of particular insecticides including systemic ones.

AB  - Denitrification is a dominant nitrogen loss process in the sediments of San Francisco Bay. In this study, we sought to understand the ecology of denitrifying bacteria by using next-generation sequencing (NGS) to survey the diversity of a denitrification functional gene, nirS (encoding cytchrome-cd(1) nitrite reductase), along the salinity gradient of San Francisco Bay over the course of a year. We compared our dataset to a library of nirS sequences obtained previously from the same samples by standard PCR cloning and Sanger sequencing, and showed that both methods similarly demonstrated geography, salinity and, to a lesser extent, nitrogen, to be strong determinants of community composition. Furthermore, the depth afforded by NGS enabled novel techniques for measuring the association between environment and community composition. We used Random Forests modelling to demonstrate that the site and salinity of a sample could be predicted from its nirS sequences, and to identify indicator taxa associated with those environmental characteristics. This work contributes significantly to our understanding of the distribution and dynamics of denitrifying communities in San Francisco Bay, and provides valuable tools for the further study of this key N-cycling guild in all estuarine systems.

AB  - Comparison of two conventional analytical techniques such as X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for measuring Pb concentrations in soil samples was achieved using field and laboratory work. Seventy-three samples were collected from urban areas surrounding the large lead smelter at South Australia, as an indicator of the environment impact of smelter activity. Soil Pb concentrations were determined using hand-held XRF analyser under laboratory conditions. ICP-MS analysis on digested soils (using a microwave-assisted nitric acid digestion-extraction) was applied to validate p-XRF data. The analysis showed that Pb concentrations determined by XRF correlated with high linearity with Pb concentrations determined by ICP-MS measurements (R-2 = 0.89). Statistical test (t test) was applied to the data of both methods applied without any significant difference between the two techniques. These results indicated that ICP-MS corroborated XRF for Pb soil measurements and suggests that XRF was a reliable and quick alternative to traditional analytical methods in studies of environmental health risk assessment, allowing for much larger sampling regimes in relatively shorter times and could be applied in the field.

AB  - Although small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play an important role in economy and use a significant amount of chemicals in their manufacturing processes, little support has been offered in their process improvement for chemicals management. In this series of two papers, we proposed a design support framework for strategic chemicals management in SMEs, and the supporting mechanisms in the framework were informatized as software tool developed in the case study of metal cleaning. In part 2, a software tool which informatized supporting mechanism in process design was developed for chemicals management in SMEs operating metal cleaning processes utilizing chlorinated organic solvents with an open-top washing machine. The developed tool was reviewed by trial users in cleaning industry. Such highly user-friendly tool dedicated for specific industry can strongly facilitate a strategic chemicals management by firm-level decision makers. An informatization approach through analysis scrutinizing industry-specific conditions can lead to familiarize SMEs with assessment methods of health and environmental impacts through practice of LCA and RA.

AB  - This study investigated the cadmium (Cd) accumulation and growth response to Cd stress of 18 plant species. After growth for 30 days in the sand containing 0, 2, or 10 mg Cd kg(-1), seedlings were evaluated for growth parameters, specific root length, and Cd accumulation. The 18 species differ greatly in Cd accumulation and resistance to Cd stress, depending on Cd concentrations in the sand. Under high Cd condition (10 mg kg(-1)), the 18 species were classified into two groups: (1) Indian mustard and rapeseed having high Cd tolerance and increased accumulation capacity in shoots could be considered as Cd accumulators, and (2) the remaining 16 non-accumulators constitute a species continuum from the indicators to excluders. Shoot Cd concentration showed exponential decay relationships with biomass production, absolute growth rate, and growth ratio, indicating that biomass production negatively relates to the shoot Cd concentration in non-accumulators via dilution or concentration effect. Species with high biomass generally accumulate low Cd in the shoots and display high Cd-tolerant capacity. Indian mustard and rapeseed are promising species for long-term phytoextraction of Cd-contaminated farmlands for bioenergy production.

AB  - Improvements in resource efficiency often underperform because of rebound effects. Calculations of the size of rebound effects are subject to various types of bias, among which methodological choices have received particular attention. Modellers have primarily focused on choices related to changes in demand, however, choices related to modeling the environmental burdens from such changes have received less attention. In this study, we analyze choices in the environmental assessment methods (life cycle assessment (LCA) and hybrid LCA) and environmental input output databases (E3IOT, Exiobase and WIOD) used as a source of bias. The analysis is done for a case study on battery electric and hydrogen cars in Europe. The results describe moderate rebound effects for both technologies in the short term. Additionally, long-run scenarios are calculated by simulating the total cost of ownership, which describe notable rebound effect sizes from 26 to 59% and from 18 to 28%, respectively, depending on the methodological choices with favorable economic conditions. Relevant sources of bias are found to be related to incomplete background systems, technology assumptions and sectorial aggregation. These findings highlight the importance of the method setup and of sensitivity analyses of choices related to environmental modeling in rebound effect assessments.

AB  - Airline pilots and similar professions require reliable spatial cognition abilities, such as mental imagery of static and moving three-dimensional objects in space. A well-known task to investigate these skills is the Shepard and Metzler mental rotation task (SMT), which is also frequently used during pre-assessment of pilot candidates. Despite the intuitive relationship between real-life spatial cognition and SMT, several studies have challenged its predictive value. Here we report on a novel instrument interpretation task (IIT) based on a realistic attitude indicator used in modern aircrafts that was designed to bridge the gap between the abstract SMT and a cockpit environment. We investigated 18 professional airline pilots using fMRI. No significant correlation was found between SMT and IIT task accuracies. Contrasting both tasks revealed higher activation in the fusiform gyrus, angular gyrus, and medial precuneus for IIT, whereas SMT elicited significantly stronger activation in pre- and supplementary motor areas, as well as lateral precuneus and superior parietal lobe. Our results show that SMT skills per se are not sufficient to predict task accuracy during (close to) real-life instrument interpretation. While there is a substantial overlap of activation across the task conditions, we found that there are important differences between instrument interpretation and non-aviation based mental rotation.

AB  - Stacked (insect and herbicide resistant) transgenic rice T1c-19 with cry1C*/bar genes, its receptor rice Minghui 63 (herein MH63) and a local two-line hybrid indica rice Fengliangyou Xiang 1 (used as a control) were compared for agronomic performance under field conditions without the relevant selection pressures. Agronomic traits (plant height, tiller number, and aboveground dry biomass), reproductive ability (pollen viability, panicle length, and filled grain number of main panicles, seed set, and grain yield), and weediness characteristics (seed shattering, seed overwintering ability, and volunteer seedling recruitment) were used to assess the potential weediness without selection pressure of stacked transgene rice T1c-19. In wet direct-seeded and transplanted rice fields, T1c-19 and its receptor MH63 performed similarly regarding vegetative growth and reproductive ability, but both of them were significantly inferior to the control. T1c-19 did not display weed characteristics; it had weak overwintering ability, low seed shattering and failed to establish volunteers. Exogenous insect and herbicide resistance genes did not confer competitive advantage to transgenic rice T1c-19 grown in the field without the relevant selection pressures.

KW  - SUBSTANCE
AB  - This study explored differences in the factor structure of depressive symptoms in patients with and without alcohol abuse, and differences in the severity of depressive symptoms between the two groups. In a sample of 358 patients without alcohol problems and 167 patients with comorbid alcohol problems, confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the same factor structures, Beck et al.'s two-factor Somatic Affective-Cognitive (SA-C) model, and Buckley et al.'s three-factor Cognitive-Affective-Somatic (C-A-S) model, demonstrated the best fit to the data in both groups. The SA-C model was preferred due to its more parsimonious nature. Evidence for strict measurement invariance across the two groups for the SA-C model was found. MIMIC (multiple-indicator-multiple-cause) modeling showed that the level of depressive symptoms was found to be highest on both factors in the group with comorbid alcohol problems. The magnitude of the differences in latent mean scores suggested a moderate difference in the level of depressive symptoms between the two groups. It is argued that patients with comorbid depression and alcohol abuse should be offered parallel and adequate treatment for both conditions.

AB  - The basic biochemical profile of gibel carp (Carassius gibelio), diploid-triploid cyprinid species complex with dual reproduction modes, was investigated. The aim of the study was to test for the effect of fish group (which combines the effects of ploidy and sex) and temporal changes on indicators of the biochemical profile of blood in gibel carp. We showed that the basic biochemical profile of blood is significantly influenced by season and fish group. Triploid gynogenetic females had a better condition measured by total protein concentration than sexual diploids. The higher concentrations of triacylglycerols and cholesterol in triploid females when compared to diploids indicate a higher metabolic rate and higher energy intake during the whole year, which may represent a disadvantage for triploids. Differences in the concentrations of blood biochemical analytes between triploid females and diploids suggest a potential difference in the regulation of a wide range of physiological and biochemical processes in which these analytes participate. The biochemical profiles of two forms of C. gibelio could at least partially explain the changes of character of its naturally occurring populations.

AB  - Lettuce tipburn is an irreversible physiological disorder caused by calcium deficiency that decreases the crop value. Breeding a tipburn-resistant cultivar is the only causal therapy in many cases. In this study, we investigated an efficient method to evaluate lettuce resistance to tipburn in vitro. Seedlings of 19 lettuce cultivars representing three head types were cultured on agar medium containing EGTA, which chelates Ca2+. The percentage of tipburned leaves decreased proportionally with EGTA concentration. Susceptible cultivars were distinguished at 0.01 mM EGTA, whereas resistant cultivars were classified at 1.0 mM EGTA. Based on mean values of tipburn measurements, tipburn susceptibility was highest for 'Leaf Lettuce', followed by 'Butterhead Lettuce', and then 'Crisphead Lettuce'. Two cultivars were selected for further tests using hydroponic and pot culture. The rank order of susceptibility to tipburn in these experiments was consistent with that of the in vitro assay. The in vitro evaluation of lettuce susceptibility to calcium deficiency is useful for initial screening of lettuce cultivars against tipburn incidence. Resistant cultivars identified in this study are practical candidates for cultivation in controlled environments, such as a plant factory, while sensitive cultivars are also useful as indicator plants to monitor environmental conditions.

AB  - Oxygen isotopes provide one of the best tracers of the Mediterranean hydrological cycle from source areas in the oceans, through precipitation, to ground- and surface freshwaters. The ratio of oxygen isotopes preserved in sedimentary carbonates also provides a key indicator of natural climatic variability over timescales beyond those based on direct monitoring or historical observations. This set of papers, originally deriving from an ESF MedClivar workshop meeting in Pisa, Italy, critically considers how delta O-18 data can be used to provide records of Mediterranean climate variability over a hierarchy of timescales. They focus on five main themes, namely 1) water isotopes as tracers for monitoring and modelling patterns of precipitation, 2) lakes and surface waters, and their sedimentary records, 3) groundwaters and cave systems as preserved in speleothems, 4) marine systems, such as deep-sea sediments and surface corals, and 5) intercomparison of different archives and regional-scale data: model comparisons using isotope data bases. Future priorities include improved calibration of proxy-climate data via monitoring of contemporary systems and mass balance modelling, and a focus on synthesising high-resolution climate reconstructions during the last 2000 years.

AB  - The effects of Tinto River water on Erica andevalensis growth, biochemical indicators and elemental concentration and distribution were investigated under laboratory conditions. High levels of toxic elements such as B, Fe and S and acidic pH characterized the river water. Plant analysis revealed that the concentration of Al, B, S and Fe increased in all plant organs reaching in some cases values in the toxicity range. Plants transferred into river water stopped growing and stress was manifested by plant water loss, increase in peroxidase activity and decrease of chlorophyll a concentration. Significant decreases of free amino acid concentration were found in shoots and roots of plants grown in diluted river water. The results indicated that Tinto River water acidity and its excess in soluble elements produced altogether severe alterations in roots affecting plant water and nutrient uptake and leading to the massive entry of some metals (e.g. Fe, Al) with toxic effects. Scanning-electron microscopy (cryoSEM and ESEM) observations showed that E. andevalensis had not exclusion mechanisms of Cu, Fe and S therefore it was not able to reduce translocation to aerial parts.

AB  - A traffic light procedure is used for comparing temporal evolution of indicators of the snow crab (Chionoectes opilio) abundance, fishery success and environmental change. Indicators related to recruitment success in the fishery between 1968 and 2003 were followed and comparisons with life history stages (in trawl surveys conducted over 15 years) allowed the temporal sequence of events in the life cycle to be established. Although recruitment seems to be synchronized with bottom temperature, and may be related to abundance changes in groundfish predators, the main factors determining recruitment fluctuations appear to be density-dependent interactions between life history stages. Establishing the abundance and timing of successive life history stages using the traffic light approach seems to provide a reliable indication of their passage through the fishery, and might be used to make forecasts of the condition of the fishery several years ahead. The analysis raises the question of which of a number of possible density-dependent factors are dominant. Two management approaches by reference points and fisheries control rules are suggested.

AB  - A summary of the broadscale tropical circulation from 70 E to 180, for the six months November 2004 to April 2005, is presented. While some El Nino characteristics were seen, some critical elements usually associated with El Nino events were absent. For instance, the SST (sea-surface temperature) pattern in the near-equatorial far eastern Pacific and nearby South American coast was near normal, as was tropical cloudiness in this region. However, within the RSMC region several indicators were of a nature similar to weak El Nino conditions. For instance, higher than normal atmospheric pressure anomalies over most of the RSMC longitude range, five-month averaged values of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) that remained between -10 and -4 and higher than average levels of tropical outgoing long wave radiation (OLR) across most of the central longitude range. The low rainfall and low-level easterly wind anomalies over northern Australia were indicative of a poor summer monsoon season over northern Australia. However, the date of onset of the Australian monsoon over northern Australia was close to climatology. The signal of Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) showed a regular periodicity at around 30 35 days. A total of 23 tropical cyclones (TCs) developed in the RSMC area during the period.

AB  - An increase in the population of Yellowstone bison (Bison bison) and changes in their winter distribution have prompted concerns about. the potential for bison to transmit brucellosis to cattle. Elk (Cervus elaphus) also are hosts for the disease organism and could play a role as reservoirs for the disease. Environmental conditions on the Madison-Firehole winter range promote a high degree of range overlap between bison and elk (53% in Dec to 76% in May). Radiocollared elk were located within 100 in of bison 18% of the time, and commingling between species was positively correlated with snowpack. We investigated the seroprevalence of elk of the Madison-Firehole winter range and made comparisons to other elk populations in the region as an indicator of potential for interspecies transmission of brucellosis in the wild. We found that the seroprevalence rate in the Madison-Firehole elk (3%; n = 73) was consistent with elk that do not commingle with bison (0-1%) and lower than in elk associated with supplemental feeding programs (25-37%). Despite high levels of commingling, the seroprevalence rate in the Madison elk herd suggests that interspecies transmission from bison to elk in the Madison-Firehole is low.

AB  - A video-rate (30 frames/s) scanning two-photon excitation microscope has been successfully tested. The microscope, based on a Nikon RCM 8000, incorporates a femtosecond pulsed laser with wavelength tunable from 690 to 1050 nm, prechirper optics for laser pulse-width compression, resonant galvanometer for video-rate point scanning, and a pair of nonconfocal detectors for fast emission ratioing. An increase in fluorescent emission of 1.75-fold is consistently obtained with the use of the prechirper optics. The nonconfocal detectors provide another 2.25-fold increase in detection efficiency. Ratio imaging and optical sectioning can therefore be performed more efficiently without confocal optics. Faster frame rates, at 60, 120, and 240 frames/s, can be achieved with proportionally reduced scan lines per frame. Useful two-photon images can be acquired at video rate with a laser power as low as 2.7 mW at specimen with the genetically modified green fluorescent proteins. Preliminary results obtained using this system confirm that the yellow "cameleons" exhibit similar optical properties as under one-photon excitation conditions. Dynamic two-photon images of cardiac myocytes and ratio images of yellow cameleon-2.1, -3.1, and -3.lnu are also presented.

AB  - In order to estimate the proportion which may enter the aquatic environment and characterize exposure potential, the environmental fate properties of two polycarboxylate polymers in activated sludge were determined. The polycarboxylates studied were a polymer emulsion (PE), a high-moIecular-weight polymer (MW 50,000-60,000), and a resin polymer (RP), a low-molecular-weight polymer (MW 4500 to 9000), Both polymers exhibited a high degree of sorption to sludge solids in a series of sorption/desorption studies, indicating a high potential for removal during wastewater treatment, In isotherm tests, the adsorption coefficient, K-oc, was 1060 and 2730 for the RP and the PE, respectively, The biodegradation of the two polymers was measured under aerobic conditions in a 60-day semicontinuous activated sludge test and in a 60-day modified Sturm test using C-14-labeled compounds, In both studies, polymers accumulated in sludge solids over time and there was no evidence of significant biodegradation, although small amounts of radiolabeled CO2 were produced, suggesting the potential for biodegradation. Testing confirmed that the lack of biodegradation was not due to inhibition of microbial respiration by the polymers, High removals of PE and RP during wastewater treatment were confirmed in a field study at a facility receiving polymer inputs from households and manufacturing plants.

AB  - The aim of this study was to enable searches for truffles (Tuber spp.), particularly the Burgundy truffle (T. aestivum Vittad.), to be carried out in forests based on a method that has been constantly developed since 2007 by the Forest Research Institute. The method is termed "Virtual Truffle Hunting" and it takes 12 parameters into account: bedrock, soil pH, Ca+ and CaCO3 content in soil, C/N ratio, soil structure, altitude of terrain, type of forest site, forest structure, the Burgundy truffle host trees, and the presence of particular species including orchids and insects. A simple "Virtual Truffle Hunting" software has also been developed, which makes the use of the method easy, fast, and effective. This method is to ascertain the truffle potential for all areas in which digital maps are not available. In 2015, the method was tested in 20 sites, representing forests in 5 Polish macroregions. Hunting for hypogeous fungi was conducted from June to October with the help of trained dogs. Thanks to this method, 14 new truffle sites were found. The knowledge of environmental conditions conducive to the Burgundy truffle growth enabled us to form an effective tool in order to identify new sites of truffle presence.

AB  - The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of daily exposure to body-positive and fitspiration Instagram posts on young women's mood, body satisfaction, and appearance comparison tendency. One hundred and twenty-two young Italian women (M-age = 22.29 +/- 2.26 years) were randomly assigned to three different conditions of daily exposure on Instagram (i.e., body-positive, fitspiration and neutral content) and followed with an experience sampling method over a period of 28 consecutive days. Comparisons between groups were performed via multilevel regression modelled as a linear growth model. Results showed that daily exposure to body-positive images was associated with the highest rates of growth of positive mood and body satisfaction. Daily exposure to fitspiration images was associated with the highest rates of growth of negative mood and appearance comparison. In conclusion, the body-positive movement may be considered in interventions aimed at improving young women's body image. Fitspiration content on Instagram should be deemed inappropriate.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the unsafe conditions of pedestrian crossings at signalized intersections under the mixed traffic environment in Changsha, China. For this purpose, based really pedestrian-related crash data of Changsha city and visualized crash geographic information, six typical urban signalized intersections were selected. The peak and off-peak surveillance videos of six signalized intersections were collected via field surveys, 1,070 conflicts were extracted through using professional trajectory tracking software Traker to track pedestrian and vehicle trajectories. PSMT (Pedestrian Safety Margin Time) was used as an indicator to identify the severity of conflicts, and manually recorded the characteristics of pedestrian crossing behavior, vehicles and roads during the conflict. An Ordered Probit model was established to analyze the risk factors that led to different severities of the conflict between pedestrians and vehicles. The model outcome indicates a significant relationship between the severity level and characteristics of pedestrian behavior, vehicles and conflict. Moreover, it was identified that, in addition to the above characteristics, roadway characteristics significantly influenced likelihood of severe pedestrian-vehicle conflict. Finally, these factors are discussed, and suggestions for improving the pedestrian traffic environment are proposed from different perspectives.

AB  - This study aims to determine the effect of changes in learning systems and its effects on students' learning outcomes amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The sample of this study are the students who are in Jakarta, Indonesia. "Non-probability random sampling" technique has been used to select the samples while the sampling method used is "purposive sampling", where criteria are used to select samples. The samples in this study are 200 people taken randomly using Google Form. Concentration ability and learning interest can affect learning outcomes with the mediation of learning comfort and a good learning environment. As well as physical distancing can moderate the effect of concentration ability and learning interest on learning outcomes. The ability to concentrate on improving learning outcomes requires psychomotor improvement. Whereas interest in learning with indicators of learning awareness can improve learning outcomes. A clean environment is a strength in the learning comfort and the community environment can be recommended in the learning environment. The implementation of the restriction of gathering becomes an important point of physical distancing. The other novelties are the learning comfort and the learning environment as mediating variables and physical distancing as moderating variables in one study at a time.

AB  - Somalia is one of the most drought prone countries both in Africa and globally. Drought events usually develop gradually unnoticed, causing tremendous effects on both agriculture and environment. This study evaluated the spatio-temporal variations of drought occurrences in Somalia for the period between 1980 and 2015 as quantified by Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The intensities, frequencies and trends of drought occurrences were analyzed using SPEI for the multiple timescales of 1-, 3-, 6-, 12-, and 24-month. The temporal variations in drought showed decreasing trends in severity and increasing trends in drought duration as the SPEI timescales increases. The major drought event as identified by SPEI 12 occurred during the period between May 2011 and January 2013 lasting for a period of 12 months with an intensity of -0.55. Furthermore, drought count was generally high in the southern parts of Somalia and entire country had suffered droughts ranging from moderately dry to severely dry conditions. An average drought duration of between 2 and 3 months was recorded for most (81%) of the locations. The results of this study could be used to support the water resources management, and to promote the realization of environmental protection and crop production in future.

AB  - Cocoa is a primary source of economic income in the agricultural and agroindustrial sectors of Ecuador. However, cocoa crops are vulnerable to meteorological conditions that affect reproduction processes, including pollen production, which has encouraged the study of factors related to low crop yields and practical implications in breeding programs. The objective of this study was to assess the pollen production per flower in 11 genotypes of Theobroma cacao national type and CCN-51 clone. The number of pollen grains per flower was estimated by collecting 10 flower buds from each genotype for 12 consecutive months and directly counting pollen grains using an optical microscope and a Neubauer chamber. An average of 32,611 pollen grains per flower was estimated, with the largest amount of pollen (44,000) produced by the CCN-51 genotype. There was a moderate positive correlation between the environmental variables and pollen production (temperature, r = 0.33; p = 0.028; precipitation, r = 0.43; p = 0.0025). Since pollen production is an important indicator used for the selection of promising genotypes, the genotypes identified with the highest pollen production should be used in breeding programs.

AB  - In this work, for the first time, the volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from carbonized refuse-derived fuel (CRDF) were quantified on a laboratory scale. The analyzed CRDF was generated from the torrefaction of municipal waste. Headspace solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify 84 VOCs, including many that are toxic, e.g., derivatives of benzene or toluene. The highest emissions were measured for nonanal, octanal, and heptanal. The top 10 most emitted VOCs contributed to almost 65% of the total emissions. The VOC mixture emitted from torrefied CRDF differed from that emitted by other types of pyrolyzed biochars, produced from different types of feedstock, and under different pyrolysis conditions. SPME was a useful technology for surveying VOC emissions. Results provide an initial database of the types and relative quantities of VOCs emitted from CRDF. This data is needed for further development of CRDF technology and comprehensive assessment of environmental impact and practical storage, transport, and potential adoption of CRDF as means of energy and resource recovery from municipal waste.

AB  - Erosional unconformity surfaces are key indicators for the variations in eustatic sea level, ocean dynamics and climatic conditions which significantly affect depositional environments of sedimentary successions. Using a dense grid of 2D seismic data, we present new evidence from a frontier basin, the offshore Durban Basin, of a mid-Miocene age erosional unconformity that can be correlated with analogous horizons around the entire southern African continental margin.
   In the Durban Basin, this unconformity is typified by the incision of a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic wedge and ramp margin by a series of submarine canyons. Epeirogenic uplift of southern Africa characterised this period, with erosion and sediment bypass offshore concomitant with increases in offshore sedimentation rates. Although epeirogenic uplift appears to be the dominant mechanism affecting formation of the identified sequence boundary, it is postulated that an interplay between global eustatic sea-level fall, expansion of the east Antarctic ice sheets, and changes in deep oceanic current circulation patterns may have substantially contributed to erosion during this period.

AB  - The study assessed the ecological status of water supply reservoirs with different trophic states through the phytoplankton assemblage index (Q index). Integrated water and phytoplankton sampling were collected in euphotic zone of five tropical reservoirs (Upper Tiete river basin, Sao Paulo, Brazil) in the summer and winter (2010). Biovolume of functional groups was determined, and the Q index was applied at each site of the reservoirs. The composition of functional groups and biomass changed between the reservoirs and between the climatic periods. From upstream to downstream of the basin, the reservoirs showed the following qualification: Ribeirao do Campo (ultra-oligotrophic-excellent to good), Ponte Nova (oligotrophic-good), Paraitinga (mesotrophic-medium), Jundiai (meso-eutrophic-medium to tolerable), Taiac, upeba (mesotrophic-tolerable to bad). Q index was significantly correlated with trophic state index (r = -0.81). Linear regression showed that Q index tended to decrease with the increasing in TP concentration. We conclude that the phytoplankton assemblage index showed consistently the spatial and temporal variation of the ecological status of different reservoirs in the study period. Our results evidenced that this biotic index can be a useful tool for monitoring and assessment of the ecological conditions of tropical reservoirs.

AB  - A new multi-criteria method of evaluation and assessment of the ecological status of lakes is proposed. It is based on macrophytes analysis integrated with geomorphological, landscape and catchment sources of threats. A total of 22 lakes in the Transboundary Biosphere Reserve 'West Polesie' (Poland) were investigated along trophic (available nutrients) and human pressure gradients, testing the proposed method with ESMI and TRS indices. Therefore, the present indexation included 22 criteria (i.e., catchment land use, phytolittoral area, number of plant species) concerning three different assessing zones (lakeshore, littoral and surrounding area), and provided a five-class ecological classification. The proposed index, in addition to the general ecological conditions assessment of lakes, allows to point out a zonal evaluation, identifying the most critic zones in terms of ecological status. The proposed method can be universally adapted for any type of lakes, regardless of their geographical characteristics. It can be applied to system monitoring, and to support lakes biodiversity, functionality, conservation, restoration, water protection and uses, as well as water, territory and landscape management actions.

AB  - Spontaneous dynamics of unmanaged floodplain oak and submontaneous Illyrian beech forests were compared in the Pannonian ecoregion (southern Hungary), with special respect to changes of abundance of species in the ground layer. Due to gap forming, light availability, estimated by Ellenberg indicator values, improved significantly in oak stands, in a smaller extent in beech stands. Oak regenerated very poorly in the unmanaged stands, but the diversity of tree seedlings increased. On the other hand, in beech forests the diversity of tree regeneration decreased notably, due to dominance of beech seedlings. No light-demanding specialist species appeared. Changes in share of shade-tolerant specialists were controversial. Serious conservational concerns regarding the spread of weeds and invasive species were not confirmed, as their share did not exceed 1.5% in the floodplain oak stands either. Our results draw attention to that experiences on close-to-nature silviculture gained in beech forests should be applied precautiously in other forest with quite different natural dynamics.

AB  - Chewing skills develop greatly during the two first years of life, but the evolution of masticatory efficiency has never been directly measured so far. A bottleneck for such study is the difficulty in using the chew-and-spit method with infants and very young children. Herein, we propose a new method based on a model gel enclosed in a food feeder, which has been assessed with adult subjects. Subjects chewed and compressed the gel either alone or enclosed in two different feeders. Analysis of the number of particles and particle area distribution revealed that one feeder, made from silicone teat, interfered with bolus breakdown. However, similar results were observed between experiments in a feeder made from tissue mesh and in natural condition (unbagged). This method allows easy collection of bolus and is infant friendly; it can be used in future experiments as an alternative to chew-and-spit method for studying masticatory efficiency in infancy.
   Practical ApplicationsThis paper proposes for the first time a method that could be used to quantify masticatory efficiency in infants. More generally, the approach based on feeder could be used for collecting boluses as an alternative when chew-and-spit is impracticable.

AB  - The lichen community diversity in patches of Chaco forest -NE of Cordoba Province, Argentina was analyzed. Fifteen forest patches embedded in farmland areas were sampled. Size of the patch and exposure to the crops were registered. In each patch, ten trees (sample units) with epiphytic lichens were sampled. The cover for epiphytic lichen species and the number of species present were recorded. Shannon-Wiener diversity index was calculated for each patch and multivariate analyses (DCA and Indicator Species Analyses) were applied in order to study the composition of the community. The sample patches in the DCA were associated with patch exposition. Four quantitative variables (patch size, relative cover of Physciaceae, Parmeliaceae and Collemataceae; the most representative families) were related with the first two axes of DCA using correlations coefficients. Twenty one species in patches were identified. A multivariate analysis of sample units showed preferences of some species to exposure of patches to the crops. The data indicated that there would be a degradation marked by the impact of the edges on the remaining forests. There is a trend towards more homogeneous communities, formed by species resistant to these boundary conditions and possessing high coverage.

AB  - This work focuses on the potential of aquatic plants for bioindication and/or phytofiltration of arsenic from contaminated water. More than 71 species of aquatic plants were collected at 200 sampling points in running waters. The results for the 18 most representative plant species are presented here. The species Ranunculus trichophyllus, Ranunculus peltatus subsp. saniculifolius, Lemna minor, Azolla caroliniana and the leaves of Juncus effusus showed a very highly significant (P<0.001) positive correlation with the presence of arsenic in the water. These species may serve as arsenic indicators. The highest concentration of arsenic was found in Callitriche lusitanica (2346 mg/kg DW), Callitriche brutia (523 mg/kg DW), L minor (430 mg/kg DW), A. caroliniana (397 mg/kg DW), R. trichophyllus (354 mg/kg DW), Callitriche stagnalis (354 mg/kg DW) and Fontinalis antipyretica (346 mg/kg DW). These results indicate the potential application of these species for phytofiltration of arsenic through constructed treatment wetlands or introduction of these plant species into natural water bodies.

AB  - Despite its extremely weak adsorption at the water/silica interface, carbofuran can, however, induce the coadsorption of metallic salts like lead nitrate, for example; by way of consequence its adsorption is enhanced. At the water/atmosphere interface, carbofuran adsorption is far more important than at the water-silica interface, whereas ionic adsorption remains smaller despite its enhancement by coadsorption. After comparison of the data obtained by a depletion method in the case of the solid/liquid interface and by tensiometry for the atmosphere/liquid interface, we tried to find a relationship between both from kinetic measurements of adsorbent desorption from a silica surface. Indeed, desorption from soil particles may feed surface adsorption, bubbling and entail the formation of polluted aerosols. In this study, the concentration conditions were close to the environmental ones. A model based on the Wagner-Onsager-Samaras' views of ionic interfaces positively accounts for the opposite behaviour of the systems according to the surface under study. This report shows that these facts have to be thoroughly considered in order to make a relevant assessment of environmental issues. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Gene expression levels of choriogenin, vitellogenin and estrogen receptor were determined using Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR technique after exposure to estrogenic chemical bisphenol A in the Korean wild medaka (Oryzias sinensis). These genes have been known to be induced in male test fish when the fish are exposed to estrogenic chemicals. Therefore they can be suggested as a possible biomarker of endocrine disruption in fish, however, relatively little has been known about these genes expression by estrogenic chemicals in Korean wild fish. Mature male Oryzias sinensis were treated with bisphenol A at nominal concentrations of 0.02, 0.2 and 2 mg/L for 6 days and total RNA was extracted from the livers of treated fish for RT-PCR. When the five biomarker genes were amplified by RT-PCR in the same condition, mRNA induction level of each gene was elevated with different sensitivities. Conclusively, the results of this work indicated that measurement of vitellogenin and choriogenin using RT-PCR is effective as a simple tool for the screening of estrogenic chemicals and suggested that O. sinensis would be a suitable model fish for the environmental risk assessment of potential endocrine disruptors.

AB  - Modern pig farmers work with a variety of objectives they apply to their current situation and future insecurities. They face the daily realities of managing their herd, organizing their time and resources and gaining an income, realities that have been shaped by the past. Supported by technology this daily reality is constantly progressing towards further increase of intensity and scale. The future is unpredictable and not promising. Falling prices, increased risks of disease outbreaks, food quality problems and conflicting interests of consumer demands, all help create uncertainty. Where do farmers take a stand in this turbulent environment? Field surveys have revealed that there is no single answer. Depending on their ambition for revenues and development and on their rationale for the current condition of the farm, farmers hold a variety of positions. There are various styles of farming. Each style represents a specific and integral logic in relation to their ambition and rationale. Farmers express their dominant logic in their specific objectives and strategies. Using results from field research in the Netherlands this paper illustrates what styles of farming mean, how they relate to management indicators, what relevance they have to diversifying and expanding markets and the opportunities and risks these present.

AB  - This case study summarizes an assessment of risk of methylmercury (MeHg) exposure to fish-eating birds foraging at Stormwater Treatment Area-2 (STA-2). This assessment was required as a special condition for a permit modification authorizing flow-through operation of STA-2 Cell 1 without it first satisfying formal mercury start-up criteria. The assessment estimates the risks posed by MeHg to the great egret (Ardea albus) and the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). Exposure models were based on literature-derived life history parameters combined with site-specific MeHg concentrations in water, sediment, and fish. To assess risk, daily MeHg intake by females and cumulative MeHg consumed by nestlings were compared to literature-derived effects thresholds. The results indicated the likelihood was low that MeHg exposures to birds foraging throughout STA-2 would exceed effects thresholds at the time of this assessment. Birds foraging exclusively from Cell I or the small discharge canal were predicted to experience greater exposures and could be at potential risk. However, this worst-case risk was comparable or lower than risk levels encountered in nearby water conservation areas or the Everglades National Park.

AB  - The use of benthic foraminifera as sea-level indicators? Case study of the Aiguillon cove. Seventy-four sediment samples were collected within the Aiguillon cove (Charente-Maritime and Vendee, France) in order to investigate the ecology of benthic foraminifera in relation to their vertical elevation. The distribution of the seven dominant species was studied with a view to a further use in sea-level reconstruction. Vertical elevation and the associated duration of subaerial exposure significantly influence the distribution of four species along the eastern shore of the cove (Charente): Haynesina germanica (in the higher position), Brizalina variabilis, Stainforthia fusiformis, and Hopkinsina Atlantica and of one species, Ammonia tepida along the northern and western shores (Vendee). This study provides more information on the vertical elevation of dominant intertidal species, which may be used for reconstructing former sea levels. It suggests that their position may change. depending on local conditions, which reqUil-eS.-reat caution ill using them as indicators of former sea levels. To cite this article: E.

AB  - Carbon isotope fractionation during dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes was investigated using a methanogenic microbial enrichment culture. Subcultures were amended with trichloroethene (TCE), cis-1,2-dichloroethene ( cis-DCE), and vinyl chloride (VC), respectively. Carbon isotope ratios and concentrations of reactants and of all dechlorination products were monitored during two experiments. All dechlorination steps were accompanied by significant isotope fractionation. The isotope ratios of the reactants were described with a Rayleigh type model, and the following enrichment factors (epsilon(P/R)) were obtained: -6.6 and -2.5% for dechlorinationof TCE, -14.1 and -16.1% for dechlorination of cis-DCE, and -26.6 and -21.5% for dechlorination of VC. isotope and mass balances suggested that ethene (ETH) was degraded. In additional experiments with ETH as reactant, ETH became enriched in C-13 as its concentration decreased indicating the cultures were capable of degrading ETH. The average value for the enrichment factor obtained for the degradation of ETH was -3.0%. The large carbon isotope fractionation observed in this study confirms that carbon isotope ratios are a sensitive tool for monitoring dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes to nontoxic end products.

AB  - The characterisation of fluoresceinphosphatidylethanolamine (FPE) as a real-time indicator of the electrostatic nature of the cell membrane surface is described, The conditions appropriate for the labelling of cell membranes and the implementation of FPE as a tool to monitor the interactions of various proteins and peptides with membranes are outlined. Some complications attributed to the erythrocyte glycocalyx are examined. In addition it is shown using neuraminidase as an example, that some types of enzyme-catalysed reactions on the cell surface may be monitored in real time, It is also shown that information concerning the binding of several proteins such as serum albumin and monoclonal antibodies are accessible with this technique, The albumin in particular is shown to exhibit a saturation of binding, the analysis of which indicates that the dissociation constant for erythrocytes was determined to be 8 mu M and for lymphocytes to be almost 3 mu M. On the basis of this comparison together with artificial membranes, the membrane protein components of the lymphocyte surface are implicated in the binding of albumin or the erythrocyte membrane proteins reduce the affinity of the cell surface for albumin.

AB  - 931 samples of skins, hides, carcases, organs and faecal contents of bovines and porcines as well as 247 environmental samples (equipment, work surfaces, soil etc) were collected at two slaughterhouses and examined for the presence of Listeria monocytogenes and other Listeria spp.  The skins and hides appeared to be important contamination sources.  A dissemination by direct or indirect contact during driving, stunning and bleeding of the animals could be shown:  the percentage of positive findings increased from about 20% to 50%.
   The dehiding of the bovines and the scalding and singeing of the porcines led to a clear reduction:  only 1.2% of the bovine resp.  8.7% of the porcine carcases in the chilling room were still Listeria positive.
   Several working posts were heavily contaminated:  especially dehiding of the bovines, stunning and hoisting of the pigs, and the passing of the carcases into the chilling room.  If hygienic measures are respected, a relatively low contamination degree can be kept.  Nevertheless an elimination of these germs from the slaughterhouses seems to be impossible.  We propose the use of L. monocytogenes and other Listeria spp. as indicator germs of the global hygienic conditions in a slaughterhouse, also within an elaboration of a HACCP-program.

AB  - Business activities within the tourism industry are especially suffering from the consequences of the COVID19 pandemic. Those countries whose economy depends largely on tourism will experience a troublesome situation for years to come. Their return to a normal situation will be conditioned by the competitiveness of their tourism sector. The study begins by pinpointing the countries that have been more hardly stricken by the pandemic and in which tourism accounts for a greater share of the GDP. A comparative analysis of the competitiveness of these countries with that of world-leading countries will be carried out so as to conclude which will face the recovery period in a more vulnerable situation. The measurement of tourism competitiveness will be supported by the creation of a synthetic indicator based on the P-2 distance method. A group of 13 countries has been identified as the most vulnerable, and it is advisable to act urgently in the following areas: the promotion of cultural elements and the historical and artistic heritage, the protection of natural areas, the availability of information and communication technologies, the international openness of the destination, and the availability of transportation infrastructures and tourist services.

AB  - Studies evaluating bikeability usually compute spatial indicators shaping cycling conditions and conflate them in a quantitative index. Much research involves site visits or conventional geospatial approaches, and few studies have leveraged street view imagery (SVI) for conducting virtual audits. These have assessed a limited range of aspects, and not all have been automated using computer vision (CV). Furthermore, studies have not yet zeroed in on gauging the usability of these technologies thoroughly. We investigate, with experiments at a fine spatial scale and across multiple geographies (Singapore and Tokyo), whether we can use SVI and CV to assess bikeability comprehensively. Extending related work, we develop an exhaustive index of bikeability composed of 34 indicators. The results suggest that SVI and CV are adequate to evaluate bikeability in cities comprehensively. As they outperformed non-SVI counterparts by a wide margin, SVI indicators are also found to be superior in assessing urban bikeability and potentially can be used independently, replacing traditional techniques. However, the paper exposes some limitations, suggesting that the best way forward is combining both SVI and non-SVI approaches. The new bikeability index presents a contribution in transportation and urban analytics, and it is scalable to assess cycling appeal widely.

AB  - This paper presents an analysis on the accuracy of a two-IMU (Inertial Measurement Units) device. The device consists in two identical wired BNO080 sensors connected to a Central Control Unit, with the aim of developing a remote tracking tool for upper limb movements. The control unit collects the data from the sensors, ensuring the time synchronization, and retransmits the information to an external device. From the quaternions representing the orientation of the two sensors, the relative orientation can be calculated. A series of tests has been carried on using a robotic arm, allowing to perform repeated movements. Using this setup, the repeatability of the measurement, the accuracy and the measurement drift were then evaluated. The parameters were evaluated in conditions of variation of speed, position and acceleration compatible with those of a person. In a second stage, the sensors have been inserted into a wearable garment and used by a human in a real scenario, allowing the evaluation of possible sources of disturbance due to the environment, e.g. magnetic fields generated by electronic devices. The results show a good reliability of the relative orientation measurement, with an uncertainty generally smaller than 6 degrees per eulerian angle.

AB  - Acoustic emission (AE) has been used extensively for structural health monitoring based on the stress waves generated due to evolution of cracks in concrete structures. A major concern while using AE features is that each of them responds differently to the fractures in concrete structures. To tackle this problem, Mahalanobis-Taguchi system (MTS) is utilized, which fuses the AE feature space to provide comprehensive and reliable degradation indicator with a feature selection method to determine useful features. Further, majority of the existing investigations gave little attention to naturally occurring cracks, which are actually more difficult to detect. In this study, a novel degradation indicator (DI) based on AE features and MTS is proposed to indicate the performance degradation in reinforced concrete beams. The experimental results confirm that the MTS can successfully distinguish between healthy and faulty conditions. To alleviate the noise from the DI obtained through MTS, a noise-removal strategy based on Chebyshev inequality is suggested. The results show that the proposed DI based on AE features and MTS is capable of detecting early stage cracks as well as development of damage in concrete beams.

AB  - The article reviews the theory and methodology and searches for relevant tools for modeling stakeholder contribution and benefits.The methodological framework comprises the stakeholder approach, the concept of sustainable growth and shared values. The study presents two econometric models of stakeholder value contribution and a mathematical model of stakeholder benefits.The models are built on panel data of several Russian banks.The authors look upon banks as constituents of the financial infrastructure essential for the existence of integrated business structures. Our findings show that the most appropriate proxy indicator for modeling monetary stakeholder value is sales revenue. We conclude that, for practical use, it is necessary to explore the relationships between different models and possible ways of their integration and develop a methodology for their evaluation and comparison. Further research should be related to the choice of factors affecting the model, the validity of the choice, the analysis of the regression model in order to infer the stakeholder contribution. To achieve technological breakthroughs, it is important to study value assessment procedures for stakeholders in the conditions of innovative and technological transformation of new forms of business organization, including network-based models, smart industries and ecosystems.

AB  - Choosing vegetable crops in greenhouse farming plays a significant role in the feasibility of sustainable farming practices. The selected crop affects the economic and environmental conditions which in turn influence the sustainability of farming practices. Therefore, a systematic approach is needed to prioritize the most suitable vegetable crop for sustainable farming practices. The current research focuses on prioritizing vegetable crops grown in green house farming in the environment of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), which takes into account comprehensive criteria related to sustainable farming practices. Five major criteria including crop field area, crop field production, cost of production, price of sale and the usage of water have been selected for the five major vegetable crops grown in the green chamber farming of KSA to determine the most sustainable one. The multiple attribute-based decision making (MADM) model has been developed taking into account the KSA Green House Chamber farming system. The research work reported in this study provides useful information for greenhouse farming in Saudi Arabia in particular and also helps policymakers to formulate effective regional policies to improve the gross domestic product and make farmers self-reliant.

AB  - Using data from European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions, the study examines the causes of variation in the unexplained gender pay gap among 25 European countries and considers the effect of the legal environment on these. We employ the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition to estimate the unexplained part of the gender pay gap. To assess the impact of the rule of law on unexplained gender wage differences, we apply a linear regression model, where the estimated unexplained gender pay gap is used as a dependent variable and selected rule of law indicators (specifically the Worldwide Governance Indicators Rule of Law and the Legal System & Property Rights Index) as explanatory variables. Controlling for other institutions affecting gender wage differences (specifically labour market regulation, work-family reconciliation policy and male wage dispersion), we suggest that differences in the quality of legislation and law enforcement across European countries may partly account for the variation in the unexplained gender pay gap. A very progressive improvement in rule of law indices (from the worst to the best among the 25 European countries examined) leads to a decrease in the unexplained gender pay gap by 4.5-5 percentage points.

AB  - This work was carried out in two Zonal Units of Conservation of the Turquino National Park, with the seeds of seven trees in six locations, to characterize the dispersal of the seeds of Juglansjamaicensis subsp. jamaicensis in a protected area of national significance. For this, it was determined the dispersion of the seeds in parcels of 1 x 1 m located each 2 m along four 50-m length radial transects, guided toward the four cardinal points, from the base of the donating tree of seeds. Results revealed that the density of the seeds of Juglansjamaicensis dispersed on the surface of the ground, declined markedly with the distance from the plant. Maximum seed-dispersal distance was 23 m, and average distance was 13 m around the trees, comprising 84% of dispersed seeds. Seed dispersal varied among the cardinal points, resulting in an asymmetric distribution pattern biased toward the north, as consequence of the land slope. Seed density on the ground surface averages 12 seeds per m(2), forming a small seed bank under natural conditions. These elements constitute indicators of fragility of the species in front of interferences and external factors as well as the contagious distribution pattern of the species in the forest.

AB  - Growth regulator in oat can reduce lodging with effects on yield indicators. The objective of the study is to define the optimum dose of growth regulator to reduce lodging in oats under different conditions of nitrogen (N) fertilization (reduced, high and very high) and the effects on yield indicators in the succession systems. In each succession system (soybean/oats and corn/oats), two experiments were conducted, one to quantify biomass yield and the other to estimate grain yield and lodging. In the four experiments, the design was randomized blocks with four replicates in 3 x 4 factorial scheme, for N-fertilizer doses (30, 90 and 150 kg ha(-1)) and growth regulator doses (0, 200, 400 and 600 mL ha(-1)), respectively. Growth regulator reduces lodging in oat plants, with the ideal doses of 500 mL ha(-1) in the soybean/oat system and 400 mL ha-1 in the corn/oat system, regardless of the reduced, high and very high N doses. There is a linear reduction of biological and straw yields, and a quadratic trend in the expression of grain yield and harvest index as a function of the growth regulator doses, regardless of succession systems (soybean/oats and corn/oats).

AB  - A significant portion of the particulate matter is the total carbonaceous fraction (or total carbon, TC), composed of two main fractions, elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC), which shows a large variety of organic compounds, e. g. aliphatic, aromatic compounds, alcohols, acids, etc. In this paper, TC, EC and OC concentrations determined in a downtown Rome urban area are discussed considering the influence of meteorological conditions on the temporal-spatial aerosol distribution. Similar measurements were performed at ENEA Casaccia, an area outside Rome, which is considered as the ome background. Since 2000, TC, EC and OC measurements have been performed by means of an Ambient Carbon Particulate Monitor equipped with a NDIR detector. The EC and OC concentrations trends are compared with benzene and CO trends, which are specific indicators of autovehicular traffic, for identifying the primary EC and OC contributions and the secondary OC fraction origin. Further, a chemical investigation is reported for investigating how the main organic (i.e., n-alkanes, n-alkanoic acids, polyaromatic hydrocarbons and nitro-polyaromatic hydrocarbons) and inorganic (i.e., metals, ions) fractions vary their levels during the investigated period in relationship to new regulations and/or technological innovations.

AB  - Thermal imaging has been used in the past for remote detection of regions of canopy showing symptoms of stress, including water deficit stress. Stress indices derived from thermal images have been used as an indicator of canopy water status, but these depend on the choice of reference surfaces and environmental conditions and can be confounded by variations in complex canopy structure. Therefore, in this work, instead of using stress indices, information from thermal and visible light imagery was combined along with machine learning techniques to identify regions of canopy showing a response to soil water deficit. Thermal and visible light images of a spinach canopy with different levels of soil moisture were captured. Statistical measurements from these images were extracted and used to classify between canopies growing in well-watered soil or under soil moisture deficit using Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Gaussian Processes Classifier (GPC) and a combination of both the classifiers. The classification results show a high correlation with soil moisture. We demonstrate that regions of a spinach crop responding to soil water deficit can be identified by using machine learning techniques with a high accuracy of 97%. This method could, in principle, be applied to any crop at a range of scales.

AB  - Learning an informative data representation is of vital importance in multidisciplinary applications, e.g., face analysis, document clustering and collaborative filtering. As a very useful tool, Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is often employed to learn a well-structured data representation. While the geometrical structure of the data has been studied in some previous NMF variants, the existing works typically neglect the discriminant information revealed by the between-class scatter and the total scatter of the data. To address this issue, we present a novel approach named Discriminative Orthogonal Nonnegative matrix factorization (DON), which preserves both the local manifold structure and the global discriminant information simultaneously through manifold discriminant learning. In particular, to learn the discriminant structure for the data representation, we introduce the scaled indicator matrix, which naturally satisfies the orthogonality condition. Thus, we impose the orthogonality constraints on the objective function. However, too heavy constraints will lead to a very sparse data representation that is unexpected in reality. So we further make this orthogonality flexible. In addition, we provide the optimization framework with the convergence proof of the updating rules. Extensive comparisons over several state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Stress can compromise welfare in any confined group of nonhuman animals, including those in shelters. However, an objective and practical method for assessing the stress levels of individual dogs housed in a shelter does not exist. Such a method would be useful for monitoring animal welfare and would allow shelters to measure the effectiveness of specific interventions for stress reduction. In this pilot study, activity levels were studied in 13 dogs using accelerometers attached to their collars. Behavioral stress scores as well as urinary and salivary cortisol levels were measured to determine if the dogs' activity levels while confined in the kennel correlated with behavioral and physiological indicators of stress in this population. The results indicated that the accelerometer could be a useful tool to study stress-related activity levels in dogs. Specific findings included a correlation between the salivary cortisol and maximum activity level (r = .62, p = .025) and a correlation between the urine cortisol-to-creatinine ratio and average activity level (r = .61, p = .028) among the study dogs. Further research is needed to better understand the complex relationship between stress and activity level among dogs in a kennel environment.

AB  - La Serreta endokarst (SE Spain), which UNESCO declared a World Heritage Site in 1998, was considered a sanctuary with cave art and one of the most important archaeological sites in the Mediterranean region for both the remains it hosts and the spectacular karstic landscape at the site.
   To coincide with the 40th anniversary of its discovery, the La Serreta cave-chasm was adapted for public use with the intention of showing visitors the remains, which date back to prehistoric times. The solution included attempts to minimize contact with the valuables in the cave in order to alter the existing remains as little as possible and to make good use of the magnificent interpretative conditions of such a unique place by showing the spectacular views over the Los Almadenes canyon, where the Segura River flowed, which is now a viewpoint over the void.
   In order to determine the sustainability of the endokarst, the Karstic Sustainability Index (KSI) was applied as a standard measure of sustainable development practices in karstic environments, which employs indicators for the three domains: use of social, economic and environmental resources. By applying this index, La Serreta endokarst was found to be progressing towards the sustainable management of karst resources.

AB  - Little is known about the intensity and extension of subsurface urban heat islands (UHI), and the individual role of the driving factors has not been revealed either. In this study, we compare groundwater temperatures in shallow aquifers beneath six German cities of different size (Berlin, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Karlsruhe and Darmstadt). It is revealed that hotspots of up to +20 K often exist, which stem from very local heat sources, such as insufficiently insulated power plants, landfills or open geothermal systems. When visualizing the regional conditions in isotherm maps, mostly a concentric picture is found with the highest temperatures in the city centers. This reflects the long-term accumulation of thermal energy over several centuries and the interplay of various factors, particularly in heat loss from basements, elevated ground surface temperatures (GST) and subsurface infrastructure. As a primary indicator to quantify and compare large-scale UHI intensity the 10-90%-quantile range UHIl(10-90) of the temperature distribution is introduced. The latter reveals, in comparison to annual atmospheric UHI intensities, an even more pronounced heating of the shallow subsurface. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The tolerance of green manure species to diclosulam can be used in crop rotation schemes aiming to reduce the subsequent phytotoxic effect of this herbicide on sensitive plants, such as sunflower or corn plants. This study evaluated the tolerance of green manure to diclosulan and the capacity of these plants in reducing the phytotoxic effect of this herbicide on Helianthus annuus (sunflower). Three rates of diclosulam (0; 0.035, and 0.070 kg a.i. ha(-1)) were evaluated under greenhouse conditions in pre-emergence of the following green manures: Dolichos lablab, Cajanus cajan, Canavalis ensiformis, Crotalaria juncea, C. breviflora, C. spectabilis, Mucuna deeringiana, M. cinerea, M. aterrima, Lupinus albus, Helianthus annuus, Pennisetum glaucum, Avena strigosa, Raphanus sativus and Calopogonium muconoides. C. cajan, C. ensiformis, M. cinerea, and M. aterrima were selected as the most tolerant ones, being evaluated in the field with diclosulan at the rates of 0, 0.035, and 0.070 kg a.i. ha(-1) in a 4 x 3 factorial scheme, with four repetitions. The shoots of these plants were collected 60 days after emergence, and H. annuus was sown as bio indicator of diclosulam. The results showed that C. cajan was the most promising species to reduce the phytotoxic effect of diclosulam on susceptible cultures.

AB  - The polychaetes assemblage structure was used in order to investigate taxonomic sufficiency in a heavily polluted tropical bay. Species abundance was aggregated into progressively higher taxa matrices (genus, family, order) and was analyzed using univariate and multivariate techniques. Polychaetes distribution in Guanabara Bay (GB) was in accordance with a pollution gradient, probably ruled by the organic enrichment, consequent effects of hypoxia and altered redox conditions coupled with prevailing patterns of circulation. Within the sectors of GB, an increasing gradient in species richness and occurrence was observed, ranging from the azoic and impoverished stations in the inner sector to a well-structured community in terms of species composition and abundance inhabiting the outer sector. Multivariate statistical analysis showed similar results when species were aggregated into genera and families, while greater difference occurred at coarser taxonomic identification (order). The literature about taxonomic sufficiency has demonstrated that faunal patterns at different taxonomic levels tend to become similar with increased pollution. In GB, an analysis carried out solely at family level is perfectly adequate to describe the environmental gradient, considered a useful tool for a quick environmental assessment.

AB  - Rhythmicity in physiological parameters is an important process both as convenient and reliable markers of operation of the biological clock and as an indicator of general health of an animal. In order to find out the heat storage in adult and growing Murrah buffaloes, 6 each of growing and adult female Murrah buffaloes were selected from National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI) herd for this study. The experiment was conducted in three seasons i.e. winter (Dec-Jan), spring (Feb-March) and summer (April-May). Rectal temperature (RT) and skin temperature (ST) were recorded during 4.00 hrs interval i.e. 6.00, 10.00, 14.00, 18.00, 22.00 and 2.00 hrs. The circadian variation in Skin temperature and rectal temperature was found to be maximum at 2.00 PM during summer season compared to spring and winter season. The heat storage was also observed highest at 2.00 PM in adult Murrah compared to growing during summer season. Physiological parameters (RT and ST) increased significantly (P<0.01) during spring and summer season compared to winter in both growing and adult buffaloes. Therefore young buffaloes should be protected from extreme hot conditions and direct sun exposure be avoided.

AB  - In this work, an evaluation of commercially available polystyrene-divinylbenzene sorbents for solid-phase extraction (SPE) of eleven phenolic compounds is intended. Considering the particle size and cross-linking degree, Amberlite XAD-4 (commercial or grounded), Macronet MN-200 and Lichrolut EN were tested. The SPE protocol was performed by an automatic system, providing repeatable experimental conditions for assessment of sorbent capacity, breakthrough volume and enrichment factor (EF). A positive correlation between EF and logK(ow) was found for Amberlite XAD-4 while a negative correlation was observed between EF and molecular weight of analyte for Macronet MN-200 and for Lichrolut EN. This indicates a prevalence of hydrophobic interactions or molecular exclusion depending upon the polymer cross-linking degree. Despite the similar repeatability (RSD < 4.7%, n > 6) and recovery values attained (97.6-102.7%, using 50mL of sample) for all sorbents, Lichrolut EN is the best choice for analytical application as higher EF and lower LOD values (between 18 and 207 ng) were attained for this sorbent.

AB  - Peripheral populations-generally defined as those at the geographic edge of the range-often have increased conservation value due to their potential to maximize within-species biodiversity, retain important evolutionary legacies, and provide the fodder for future adaptation. However, there has been little exploration of their conservation value in aquatic systems. Inland cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii) subspecies provide a unique opportunity to evaluate the distribution of peripheral populations and patterns of persistence across a wide range of environmental conditions. Our assessment analyzed range-wide losses of peripheral and core populations since the 1800s, and evaluated the likelihood of persistence for remaining populations of five cutthroat trout subspecies: Bonneville, Colorado River, Yellowstone, Rio Grande, and westslope. For all five, we found that core and peripheral populations have declined substantially, but the amounts of habitat occupied by peripheral populations generally have declined at a greater magnitude. The more isolated peripheral populations typically exhibited the greatest declines. Remaining peripheral populations often failed to meet minimum persistence criteria. Our characterization of peripheral populations and their losses emphasizes the need for closer evaluation of conservation priorities and management actions for cutthroat trout and other fishes if the values of peripheral populations are to be maintained.

AB  - Much attention has been given to heavy metal contamination in coastal waters and on seafood safety induced by bioaccumulation of aquatic organisms in China. To obtain the kinetic characteristics of heavy metal bioaccumulation in Chinese native organisms, the accumulation and elimination of three heavy metals (Cu, Pb, and Cd) in domestic oyster Ostrea plicatula were investigated in both laboratory and field conditions. The kinetic parameters of bioaccumulation, including the uptake rate constant (K-1), elimination rate constant (K-2), bioconcentration factors (BCFs), and biological half-life (t(1/2)), were estimated through nonlinear curve fitting using a two-compartment model. The results showed that the Pb and Cd metal concentration data perfectly fitted the two-compartment model, and good agreement was obtained between the predicted data and those obtained by the goodness-of-fit test. However, the Cu data did not fit the model. The modeling results indicated that the Pb and Cd concentrations in O. plicatula could reflect the contamination status of seawater and that O. plicatula is a potentially dependable indicator for monitoring heavy metal (Pb and Cd) contamination and seafood safety in the coastal areas of China.

AB  - This paper presents a study of precision agriculture in the wine industry. While precision viticulture mostly aims to maximise yields by delivering the right inputs to appropriate places on a farm in the correct doses and at the right time, the objective of this study was rather to assess vine biomass differences. The solution proposed in this paper uses aerial imagery as the primary source of data for vine analysis. The first objective to be achieved by the solution is to automatically identify vineyards blocks, vine rows, and individual vines within rows. This is made possible through a series of enhancements and hierarchical segmentations of the aerial images. The second objective is to determine the correlation of image data with the biophysical data (yield and pruning mass) of each vine. A multispectral aerial image is used to compute vegetation indices, which serve as indicators of biophysical measures. The results of the automatic detection are compared against a test field, to verify both vine location and vegetation index correlation with relevant vine parameters. The advantage of this technique is that it functions in environments where active cover crop growth between vines is evident and where variable vine canopy conditions are present within a vineyard block.

AB  - The spatial distribution of vegetation in the Qilian Mountain area was quantified with remote sensing data. The MODIS NDVI values for June, July, August and September are the best indicators for the vegetation growth during a year in this area and thus were used in this study. The results obtained by analysing NDVI data for seven years from 2000 to 2006 clearly indicated that elevation and aspect, as a proxy for precipitation and temperature, are two very important factors for the vertical distribution of vegetation in Qilian Mountain area. In the Qilian Mountain area the vegetation growth is optimal between the elevations of 3200 m and 3600 m, with NDVI values larger than 0.50 and a peak value of >0.56 around 3400 m. It is the combination of plentiful precipitation and suitable land surface temperature that provides less soil moisture stress and thus suitable conditions for vegetation growth in this range of elevations. The optimal vegetation growth is found in the shady slope between NW340 degrees to NE70 degrees with the largest NDVI value (>0.56) within the elevation range of 3200 m and 3600 m. The methodology developed in this study should be useful for similar ecological studies on vegetation distribution.

AB  - The microbiological quality of beef and meat products is strongly influenced by the conditions of hygiene prevailing during their production and handling. Without proper hygienic control, the environment in slaughterhouses and butcher shops can act as an important source of microbiological contamination. To identify the main points of microbiological contamination in the beef processing chain, 443 samples of equipment, installations and products were collected from I I establishments (I slaughterhouse and 10 butcher shops) located in the state of Parana, Brazil. The microbiological quality of all the samples was evaluated using Petri dishes to obtain counts of mesophilic aerobes (AC), total coliforms, Escherichia colt (EC), yeasts and molds (YM). The main contamination points identified in butcher shops, in decreasing order, were stainless steel boxes, beef tenderizers, grinders, knives, mixers, sausage stuffers, plastic boxes, floors and drains. In the slaughterhouse, these points were sausage stuffers, platforms, floors and drains. The most severely contaminated products were fresh sausages and ground beef. This information about the main points of microbiological contamination in the beef processing chain is expected to aid professionals responsible for hygiene in similar establishments to set up proper hygienic procedures to prevent or reduce microbiological contamination of beef and meat products.

AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) is known to play a major role in soil fertility due to its influence on physical, chemical and biological properties of soil; and it is closely related to particle size distribution. The ratio of SOM (g kg(-1)) to clay + silt content (g kg(-1)) was evaluated as an indicator of soil quality for barley (Hordeum vulgare) grain yield, reflecting N availability and soil physical conditions to which crop development is sensitive. Thirty-eight sites in the semiarid Pampa region of Argentina with a wide range of SOM and texture were evaluated for malting barley yield during three growing seasons. In control plots, 51% of grain yield could be explained by this indicator. The threshold value between high and low N-fertilization response was 4.4. Better yield prediction to almost 68% was achieved by combining the SOM to clay + silt indicator with initial nitrate content of the soil at seeding. This combined indicator was also able to explain a high proportion of water use efficiency, particularly in the early growth stages. The ratio of SOM to clay + silt content provided a better tool for estimating grain yield than nutrient availability or SOM alone. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Following the spread of Bluetongue virus (BTV) in many Mediterranean countries during the last 5 years, presence of the main BTV vector, Culicoides imicola Kieffer (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae), was recorded in the region, including the island of Sardinia where the first BT epidemic originally started in the year 2000. Several models were also designed based on climate variables and satellite imaging in order to predict the presence and abundance of BTV vectors across Europe. A 3 years entomological survey (2001-2003) was conducted in the southern part of Sardinia confirming the widespread presence of C. imicola. However, substantial differences in terms of relative abundance were observed between field data and prediction maps based on satellite-derived climate variables. Distribution of other potential BT vectors, belonging to Culicoides obsoletus Meigen and Culicoides pulicaris Linnaeus groups was also not congruent with model-based predictions. These results stress the need of taking into account additional environmental factors (such as soil type, land usage, etc.) and local microclimatic conditions, especially related to breeding site requirements of Culicoides species, in order to predict the presence and abundance of BT vectors and to design reliable prediction maps on a local scale.

AB  - The agro-environmental advantages of a good crop sequence system are widely recognised. Crop rotation is considered to be a cornerstone of 'integrated farming', particularly in view of its ability to maintain soil fertility and increase productivity. This paper focuses initially on the implementation of a crop sequence indicator (using a Geographic Information System allowing successive land parcel plans to be superimposed) developed using the Indigo method [Bockstaller, C., Girardin, P., 1996. The crop sequence indicator: a tool to evaluate crop rotations in relation to the requirements of integrated Arable Farming Systems. Aspects Appl. Biol. 47, 405-408] and it then discusses possible improvements and adaptations of this indicator to pedoclimatic conditions that differ from the original ones. An illustration of both these aspects is provided by the example of Wallonia in Belgium. The results were mapped for the whole Walloon region, allowing many common rotation types to be assessed from an agro-environmental perspective. A system enabling the regional authorities to monitor and, above all, to promote ways of managing crop sequences that are compatible with environmental protection is put forward for the Agricultural Areas concerned.

AB  - Several different Microbial source tracking methods (MSTs) can be used to distinguish human from animal fecal contamination in water; In this study, experiments were carried out to test the effectiveness and reliability of three bacteria based approaches (the fecal coliforms to fecal streptococci ratio, antibiotic-resistant Clostridium perfringens, and human bifidobacteria) in a simulated groundwater micro-environment.
   The methods were evaluated in three phases: initially, the specificity of each indicator was validated on groundwater samples affected by known pollution source; then the variation of performance with time of each method was determined, and finally, the die-off coefficients for pure species of Clostridium perfringens and Bifidobacterium adolescentis were measured.
   The results indicate that only the determination of human bifidobacteria concentration can be considered reliable in distinguishing human from animal pollution in groundwater at the conditions applied. Nevertheless, human bifidobacteria were detectable only for two weeks after the contamination event. This study also shows that antibiotic resistant Clostridium perfringens detected using the Shahidi-Ferguson medium is not source specific, whereas it confirms that this species can be useful for timing general fecal contamination events.

AB  - In 1991, the first subsurface flow constructed wetland for treatment of domestic wastewater was built in Norway Today, this method is rapidly becoming a popular method for wastewater treatment in rural Norway. This is due to excellent performance even during winter and low maintenance. The systems can be constructed regardless of site conditions. The Norwegian concept for small constructed wetlands is based on the use of a septic tank followed by an aerobic vertical down-flow biofilter succeeded by a subsurface horizontal-flow constructed wetland. The aerobic biofilter, prior to the subsurface flow stage, is essential to remove BOD and achieve nitrification in a climate where the plants are dormant during the cold season. When designed according to present guidelines a consistent P-removal of > 90% can be expected for 15 years using natural iron or calcium rich sand or a new manufactured lightweight aggregate with P-sorption capacities, which exceeds most natural media. When the media is saturated with P it can be used as soil conditioner and P-fertilizer. Nitrogen removal in the range of 40-60% is achieved. Removal of indicator bacteria is high and < 1000 thermotolerant coliforms/100 ml is normally achieved.

AB  - Photoinduced alterations of light-sensitive artifacts represent one of the main problems that conservators and curators have to face for environmental control in museums and galleries. Therefore, increasing attention has been recently devoted to developing strategies of indoor light monitoring, especially aimed at minimizing the cumulated light exposure for the objects on exhibit. In this work a prototype of a light dosimeter, constituted by a photosensitive dyes/polymer mixture applied on a paper substrate, is presented. This indicator, specially designed for a preventive assessment of the risk of damage for highly light-sensitive objects, undergoes a progressive color variation as its exposure to the light increases. Different, easily distinguishable color steps are exhibited depending on the light dose received, so that the dosimeter can be used straightforwardly to have a first, instrumentation-free estimation of the total light exposure. A reflectance spectroscopy study in the 350-860 nm range was carried out on prototype dosimeters exposed to light emitted from a tungsten-halogen lamp to investigate the response of the dosimeter to the light and to study the fading mechanism. Two different approaches were evaluated for the calibration of the prototype: colorimetry and principal component analysis of the reflectance spectra. The usefulness of the two methods in providing a quantitative indication of the light dose received was evaluated.

AB  - Soil aggregate stability is one of the most important properties controlling plant growth in semiarid Mediterranean environments. A field study was carried out to evaluate the effect of the rhizosphere of Olea europaea subsp. sylvestris and Rhamnus lycioides, the addition of a composted residue and mycorrhizal inoculation with Glomus intraradices on rhizosphere aggregate stability and on the viability of both plant species in a semiarid structureless soil. For both plant species. water-soluble carbon (WSC) content and enzyme activities (urease, acid phosphatase and beta-glucosidase) measured in the rhizosphere aggregate were higher than in the non-rhizosphere soil. Rhizosphere aggregate stability of both plant species was on average 1.8-fold higher than that of non-rhizosphere aggregate. The addition of composted residue was the most effective treatment for increasing rhizosphere aggregate stability. The water-soluble carbon content was correlated positively with aggregate stability of the O. europaea rhizosphere. The mycorrhizal component was increasingly important for improving the growth of both seedlings following the addition of composted residue to soil under the severe climatological conditions of the area.

AB  - The occurrence, activity and plasticity of the CAM pathway is described from an introductory viewpoint, framed by the use of the four 'Phases' of CAM as comparative indicators of the interplay between environmental constraints and internal molecular and biochemical regulation. Having described a number of 'rules' which seem to govern the CAM cycle and apply uniformly to most species, a number of key regulatory points can then be identified. These include temporal separation of carboxylases, based on the circadian expression of key genes and their control by metabolites. The role of a circadian oscillator and interplay between tonoplast and nuclear control are central to maintaining the CAM cycle. Control of reserve carbohydrates is often neglected, but the importance of daily partitioning (for growth and the subsequent night-time CAM activity) and use at night is shown to drive the CAM cycle. Finally, it is shown that the genotypic and phenotypic plasticity in patterns of CAM expression is mediated partly by environmental conditions and molecular signalling, but also by diffusive constraints in succulent tissues. A transformation system is now required to allow these key areas of control to be elucidated.

KW  - HABITAT
AB  - We provide the first ecological account of the alligator gar, Atractosteus spatula, in the Vicente Guerrero Reservoir, Tamaulipas, Mexico. During March to September, 1998, the local fishery cooperative captured more than 23,000 kg of alligator gar from the reservoir. A random sample of their catch was dominated by males, which were significantly smaller than females. Males and females had similar weight-length relationships. Relative testicular weight varied little seasonally, but relative ovarian weight showed a strong seasonal pattern that indicated peak spawning activity during July and August. Body condition of both sexes also varied in a pattern consistent with late summer spawning. Fishing for alligator gar virtually ceased from October to February, when nonreproductive individuals were presumed to move offshore to deeper water. Alligator gar fed primarily on largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, and less frequently on other fishes. The gillnet fishery for alligator gar in the reservoir appears to be based primarily on individuals that move into shallow shoreline areas to spawn. Males probably remain in these habitats longer than females. The dominance of largemouth bass in the alligator gar diet reflects this centrarchid's high occurrence in littoral habitats of the reservoir, and the diet of alligator gar inhabiting deeper habitats of the reservoir could be different.

AB  - The present investigation was designed to gain information on the role of algae in a deep wastewater self-regeneration pond. The experimental pond was continuously fed with secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant. Biological, physical and chemical profiles were recorded throughout the water column during the period July 1996 to December 1997. The removal efficiencies of several chemical and sanitary indicators were calculated. The time course of species biomass was used to evaluate phytoplankton dynamics and its relationship with the performance of the deep pond. The efficiency of the system seemed to he conditioned by temperature and phytoplankton biomass. Improved performance was observed during periods of mixing. Chlorococcales and Volvocales grew extensively during stratification periods. Euglenophyceae dominated during the mixing. When the total phytoplankton biomass exceeded 15,000 mgC m(-3), the removal efficiencies of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and the suspended solids acquired negative values. These phytoplankton blooms were associated with an intense increase in pH and, consequently, in NH3 levels, in the epilimnion, during the stratification. When such a bloom occurred, considerable decreases in zooplankton and bacterial biomasses were observed, which temporarily destabilized the trophic structure of the pond.

AB  - Phosmet is a non-systemic organophosphorus insecticide exerting its toxicity by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase upon entering the body via contact, ingestion and inhalation. Data regarding its sublethal effects on fish are limited, and therefore, with this study it was aimed to investigate the effects of phosmet on liver and brain tissues of juvenile Oncorhynchus mykiss following 24, 48, 72 and 96 h of exposure to 5, 25 and 50 mu g/l concentrations. Pesticide treatment caused notable decrease in the levels of serum glucose, protein and cholesterol, whereas there was prominent elevation in the activities of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase. Anticholinesterase activity of phosmet was observed in brain tissue reaching maximum of 46%. In both tissues, increase in the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase and level of glutathione was accompanied by elevated thiobarbituric acid reactive substances level. Our results clearly indicate the modulatory effect of phosmet on acetylcholinesterase activity and its potency to provoke oxidative stress condition. The determined alteration in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activities indicates hepatotoxic potential of pesticide; meanwhile, obtained hypoglycaemia and hypoproteinaemia are evaluated as adaptive responses to handle the stress to survive.

AB  - In recent years, corporate involvement in CSR has become increasingly important and appreciated in the context of the ideas and assumptions regarding sustainable development. Due to the specificity of the energy sector, its particular impact on the environment, the living conditions of the population, and the social involvement of energy companies is particularly desirable, therefore it is observed and assessed by many stakeholder groups. The aim of this article is to assess the CSR commitment of Polish energy companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The assessment was based on the proposed indicator model, based on the data published in the annual reports of the companies. The study uses data from the years 2016-2020. The main research question is as follows: What is the engagement in CSR activities of six Polish energy companies towards contractors, investors, employees, society, and the environment? The obtained results show that the investigated energy companies present a similar average level of engagement in CSR activities. The highest level of involvement concerns the area of contractors and the lowest levels relate to the donors of capital and the environment.

AB  - Leaf age and plant centre are important phenotypic information of weeds, and accurate identification of them plays an important role in understanding the morphological structure of weeds, guiding precise targeted spraying and reducing the use of herbicides. In this work, a weed segmentation method based on BlendMask is proposed to obtain the phenotypic information of weeds under complex field conditions. This study collected images from different angles (front, side, and top views) of three kinds of weeds (Solanum nigrum, barnyard grass (Echinochloa crus-galli), and Abutilon theophrasti Medicus) in a maize field. Two datasets (with and without data enhancement) and two backbone networks (ResNet50 and ResNet101) were replaced to improve model performance. Finally, seven evaluation indicators are used to evaluate the segmentation results of the model under different angles. The results indicated that data enhancement and ResNet101 as the backbone network could enhance the model performance. The F-1 value of the plant centre is 0.9330, and the recognition accuracy of leaf age can reach 0.957. The mIOU value of the top view is 0.642. Therefore, deep learning methods can effectively identify weed leaf age and plant centre, which is of great significance for variable spraying.

AB  - Hemp seed oil (HSO) liposomes (HSOLs) were prepared by ethanol injection-ultrasonic dispersion (EIUD). The encapsulation efficiency (EE) and oil loading ratio (OLR) were used as the response indicators to optimize the preparation conditions of the HSOLs. The average particle size (Z-Ave) of the prepared liposomes was 122 +/- 1.64 nm, the polydispersity index (PDI) was 0.21 +/- 0.06, the zeta potential (ZP) was-36.5 +/- 0.32 mV, the encapsulation efficiency (EE) was 81.3 +/- 1.62 % and the oil loading rate (LOR) was 6.13 +/- 0.07 %. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and cryo-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM) showed that the morphology of the HSOLs was round, and the cut surface was regular. The storage and oxidative stability tests of the HSOLs showed that the Z-Ave was 152 +/- 1.87 nm and the polydispersity index (PDI) was 0.72 +/- 0.03 after storage for 70 days under natural light at 25 degrees C. The zeta potential change showed no trend. The polyphenolic content in the HSOLs was 2.25 mg GAE/100 g, the DPPH clearance rate was 60.7 %, and the Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta 9THC) content was 85.43 mg/kg.

AB  - Patterned-ground landforms represent the most common phenomenon of periglacial environment, and their large sorted forms belong to the few morphological indicators of past permafrost distribution. The relic forms of patterned ground are widespread on high-elevated surfaces in the central European uplands, providing the evidence of regional periglacial conditions in the last glacial period. However, the timing of these landforms, as well as their potential for paleoclimate reconstructions, has remained unexplored. In this paper, we present Be-10 exposure ages from the large sorted polygons sampled at four sites in the Sudetes Mountains, the highest part of the central European uplands. These results indicate that these landforms started to form at the end of Marine Isotope Stage 3, and the main phase of their formation occurred between 30 and 20 ka. This research confirms the hypothesis of sorted patterned-ground formation within the last (Weichselian) glacial stage (110.6-11.7 ka) and suggests that earlier-sorted features are not preserved in the Sudetes. The recognized period of enhanced periglacial activity coincides with a prominent cold interval identified earlier in both regional and northern-hemispheric proxy records.

AB  - Socioeconomic characteristics are commonly used as indicators of vulnerability and resilience to inform disaster risk planning and management. Vancouver is a coastal seaport city along the west coast of Canada and is exposed to risk from the impacts of flooding. Previous studies have assessed and modelled a city's resilience to environmental hazards based on socioeconomic status derived from census data, such as income status, family structure, and dwelling conditions. However, these data sources are aggregated into different census units of varying scale, such as Census Tracts (CT) and Dissemination Areas (DA). Spatial analysis of the same data using different aggregation units manifests in the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP), where varying scale can produce different results and conclusions. This exploratory analysis of the MAUP demonstrates that social resilience to flooding hazards in Vancouver at the CT and DA census scales can have contradictory results depending on the census scale adopted. The effect of scale and the aggregation units at which spatial analysis occurs can have a significant impact on the conclusions imparted and decision making to identify priority areas. Since individual-level disaggregate data is unavailable, the analytical results based solely on aggregate data should be interpreted with caution.

AB  - Tracer methods are useful for investigating groundwater travel times and recharge rates and analysing impacts on groundwater quality. The most frequently used tracers are stable isotopes and tritium. Stable isotopes of oxygen (delta O-18) and hydrogen (delta H-2) are mainly used as indicators of the recharge condition. Tritium (H-3) is used to estimate an approximate mean groundwater age. This paper presents the results of an analysis of stable isotope data and tritium activity in Croatian groundwater samples that were collected between 1997 and 2014 at approximately 100 sites. The composition of the stable isotopes of groundwater in Croatia originates from recent precipitation and is described using two regional groundwater lines. One of them is applied to groundwater accumulated in the aquifers in the Pannonian part of Croatia and the other is for groundwater accumulated in the Dinaric karst of Croatia. The isotope content shows that the studied groundwater is mainly modern water. A mix of sub-modern and modern water is mostly accumulated in semi-confined porous aquifers in northern Croatia, deep carbonate aquifers, and (sub)thermal springs.

AB  - Seven coal samples were collected from Changguang area, a typical bark coal field in Zhejiang Province, China. The organic geochemical characteristics and depositional environment of bark coal were studied by Rock-Eval pyrolysis, gas chromatography (GC), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The results show that all samples are type II kerogen. The values of total organic carbon (TOC), potential yield (S-1+S-2), and hydrogen index of these samples ranged from 65.80 wt%-87.00 wt%, 170.43-232.89 mg HC/g, and 234-295 mg HC/g TOC, respectively. In aromatic hydrocarbons compounds of bark coal samples, the phenanthrene series occupy the largest proportion (43.48%-53.74%), followed by the dibenzothiophens (7.33%-16.53%). The distributions of naphthalenes, diphenyls, and chrysene of the samples indicate the source inputs are mainly derived from terrestrial higher plants. Furthermore, the ratios of naphthalene and phenanthrene series compounds reveal the samples are in the mature stage. Some biomarkers (Pr/Ph and C-35/C31-35 homohopane), aromatic hydrocarbons (fluorene, dibenzofuran and dibenzothiophene), and high inertinite contents (14.7%-41.8%) suggest that bark coal was formed under relatively oxic conditions and was influenced by marine or brackish lakes environment.

AB  - The accumulation of prey remains in the pellets of the Great Grey Owl in the winter and nesting periods was studied over a number of years at the contact of the taiga and northern forested steppe belts in the trans-Urals. Characteristics of the hunting territory and small mammal populations were shown to render varying impacts on the composition and ratio of the types of prey. A comparison with the results of the feeding activity of the Eagle Owl was also made. Published information concerning four places of long-term nesting on rocks in the river valleys of the western slope of the Middle Urals in similar natural conditions was used as well. Selective accumulation of prey remains of these two owl species was revealed to lie in a small number of the main prey species, those mostly populating open habitats. In both owls, mammal species of closed forest (transitional) habitats served as accompanying prey. The Eagle Owl was characterized by a large size range of prey. Special attention was paid to the indicator roles the accompanying prey play in palaeoreconstructions.

AB  - Study on the weathering characteristics of Niche of Sakyamuni Entering Nirvana at Dazu Rock Carvings is the first step of scientific conservation. Based on the in-depth investigation on the weathering characteristics of Niche of Sakyamuni Entering Nirvana, the weathering degree was measured and evaluated by means of the in-situ non-destructive surface hardness test and ultrasonic test. The results reveal that the weathering types of Niche of Sakyamuni Entering Nirvana consist of granular disintegration, salt efflorescence, scaling, blistering, cracking, missing parts, biological colonization, and water seepage. The weathering degree of the head and foot of the statues are higher than that of the chest and abdomen in the horizontal direction, and the weathering degree of the upper parts of the statues and the ground area are higher than that between them in the vertical direction. The results of surface hardness and ultrasonic velocity are in close accordance with the weathering degree of the statues. Sedimentary and structural characteristics of sandstone lay a material foundation for various weathering characteristics and degree. The research results pave the way for condition assessment, intervention decision-making, and preventative conservation of the studied statues.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of positive psychology and exercise interventions on psychological well-being and ill-being indicators in Costa Rican college students. This study had a quasi-experimental factorial (4 x 2) design, 233 college students (18.97 +/- 2.18 years, 135 females, 98 males) were assigned to one of four different conditions: positive psychological interventions (PP), exercise interventions (E), combined (PP + E) interventions, and control group (C). Psychological well-being and ill-being indicators were measured pre and post interventions. Positive psychological interventions improved the "negative emotions" indicator (p = .022); but did not have a significant impact on well-being indicators (p > .05). The combination of PP and E interventions produced the same effects as PP alone; a decrease in "negative emotions" was observed (p = .028). This effect might contribute to improve the experience of university life for higher education students and protect them from the risks associated with psychological ill-being. Exercise interventions alone did not change either the psychological well-being or ill-being indicators (p > .05).

AB  - Alzheimer's disease currently lacks treatment options that effectively reverse the biological/ anatomical pathology and cognitive deficits associated with the disease. Loss of function of the nuclear receptor REV-ERB is associated with reduced cognitive function in mouse models. The effect of enhanced REV-ERB activity on cognitive function has not been examined. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that enhanced REV-ERB function may enhance cognitive function in a model of Alzheimer's disease. We utilized the REV-ERB agonist SR9009 to pharmacologically activate the activity of REV-ERB in the SAMP8 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. SR9009 reversed cognitive dysfunction of an aged SAMP8 mouse in several behavioral assays including novel object recognition, T-maze foot shock avoidance, and lever press operant conditioning task assessments. SR9009 treatment reduced amyloid-beta 1-40 and 1-42 levels in the cortex, which is consistent with improved cognitive function. Furthermore, SR9009 treatment led to increased hippocampal PSD-95, cortical synaptophysin expression and the number of synapses suggesting improvement in synaptic function. We conclude that REV-ERB is a potential target for treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Attainment of high competitiveness indicators of products and services is a natural goal of each enterprise. This goal stems from the desire of stakeholders to ensure the continuous, long-term development of a company and the high performance of labour results. However, the market has leaders and outsiders for various reasons. And the outsiders can be decently prepared in organizational and technical terms. But something prevents them from successfully developing. In addition, a decision of methodological and analytical tasks is not cheap.

AB  - Seagrass beds degraded significantly since the last century on both, global and local scale. The seagrass species Enhalus acoroides (Linnaeus f.) Royle is a common species found in almost all marine ecosystems including bays, lagoons and around offshore islands in tropical regions of the West Pacific. It was shown that genetic diversity is an essential indicator of the conditions of ecosystems. In the present study, microsatellite markers were used to assess the genetic diversity and population structure of six distinct seagrass beds along the coast of the Khanh Hoa Province, Vietnam. The results indicate that the genetic diversity of the populations in the open sea is higher than in the lagoon. Seagrass beds occurring in disturbed sites show reduced genetic diversity. The fixing index value (F-ST) depicts a relatively high genetic structure among populations. Structure analysis clusters the populations into open sea and lagoon populations and cluster analysis and AMOVA indicate a significant difference between the two groups. There are low but non-significant positive correlations between geographic and genetic distances. The different habitats of the open sea and the lagoon are probably responsible for forming two groups.

AB  - Research is increasingly addressing the evolution and use of sexually selected traits in females. One strong area of interest is the display of intrasexual aggression and how female ornaments are used in intrasexual competition. One particular type of ornament focused on for its use in intrasexual aggression in both sexes is the melanin pigmented ornaments. Over the course of 2 breeding seasons in a southeastern Mississippi population of cardinals, we assessed brightness of the melanin face mask plumage ornament in female Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) and compared it to behavioral responses during intraspecific simulated nest intrusions (SNIs). All females responded to the SNI, but face mask brightness did not covary with the level of aggression shown. Our findings do not support earlier work suggesting that the face mask in female Northern Cardinals is an indicator of aggression at the nest. Potentially, differences in behavior and environmental variables between populations of cardinals could be factors in this difference and deserve further assessment. Future research should investigate other populations of cardinals to fully assess the communicative malleability of this ornament type and different selective pressures on female ornamentation and behavior.

AB  - Despite the environmental benefits associated with wind energy, studies have confirmed the occurrence of significant levels of bat and bird fatalities at windfarms, which raise concerns about the long-term effects of these infra-structures on these populations. Reliable estimates of windfarm fatalities are fundamental for accurate environmental assessment studies and supporting management actions. A spatially explicit agent-based model (ABM) was developed to investigate how searcher "controlled" variables, i.e., different field monitoring protocols, monitoring periods and periodicities influence the success of carcasses detection in field trials and estimator accuracy. Different rates of bat mortality due to collision, scavenger pressures and habitat complexity were simulated in order to reproduce variable conditions that might take place at onshore wind facilities. Based on our findings we propose a reduction in the monitoring periods and a shortening in the periodicity of searches in order to reduce bias in the estimations and increase the confidence limits of impact assessments associated with mortality estimates at onshore windfarms.

AB  - In the treatment of unipolar depression, treatment response is a key issue in terms of evolution and prognosis. Within this concept, the inadequate response includes the worsening, the lack of response, partial response and poor tolerance. This lack of response may be related to intrinsic factors to the individual, but also to more extrinsic environmental factors. In this review, we explore this concept through its links with adherence and treatment duration. In this field, the concept of early response can be a powerful indicator of therapeutic response, which conditions the prescription of antidepressants beyond the strict framework of the sufficient period of 4 to 6 weeks. In addition to its impact on prognosis, the literature data show that the insufficient response is a significant burden in terms of medical and economic cost, and somatic comorbidity; and justifies a systematic identification of this dimension. Therefore self-reports (QIDS; BDI) will be preferred to the clinician-rated depression symptom rating scales (MADRS, HAMD) that require a specific training. Identifying predictors of non-response would be an attractive target for prescribers but the results to date are not operative. (C) L'Encephale, Paris 2015

AB  - At present, there is no universally accepted method for deriving near-extreme summer weather data for building performance simulation. Existing data sets such as the Design Summer Years (DSY) used in the UK to estimate summer discomfort in naturally ventilated and free running buildings have been criticised for being inconsistent with the corresponding Test Reference Years (TRY). This paper proposes a method for generating Summer Reference Years (SRY) by adjusting the TRY of a given site with meteorological data in order to represent near-extreme conditions. It takes as the starting point that the TRY is robust, being determined on a monthly basis from the most typical months. Initial simulations for the 14 UK TRY locations show promising results for determining building overheating with the SRY. Practical application: The proposed method for deriving near-extreme summer years from multi-year data and the corresponding typical' weather year (TRY) of a given site is applicable to locations worldwide and facilitates summer overheating assessment of naturally ventilated and free running buildings. The method helps to overcome the previous shortcomings of near-extreme summer year selection procedures by providing a clear relationship to the underlying TRY.

AB  - Nitrate-dependent anaerobic ferrous oxidizing (NAFO) is a valuable biological process, which utilizes ferrous iron to convert nitrate into nitrogen gas, removing nitrogen from wastewater. In this work, the performance of NAFO process was investigated as a nitrate removal technology. The results showed that NAFO system was feasible for autotrophic denitrification. The volumetric loading rate (VLR) and volumetric removal rate (VRR) under steady state were 0.159 +/- 0.01 kg-N/(m(3) d) and 0.073 +/- 0.01 kg-N/(m(3) d), respectively. In NAFO system, the effluent pH was suggested as an indicator which demonstrated a good correlation with nitrogen removal. The nitrate concentration was preferred to be less than 130 mg-N/L. Organic matters had little influence on NAFO performance. Abundant iron compounds were revealed to accumulate in NAFO sludge with peak value of 51.73% (wt), and they could be recycled for phosphorus removal, with capacity of 16.57 mg-P/g VS and removal rate of 94.77 +/- 2.97%, respectively.

AB  - Despite increasing demands within the healthcare market, the growth of peptide based therapeutic products is challenged by the need for sustainable processing strategies using cheaper and eco-friendly processes. To overcome this hindrance, this study aims to evaluate the potential of the intein autocleavage based bioprocessing platform as an alternative to the solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) route for economical peptide manufacture. The robustness of the bioprocessing strategy was evaluated by designing a processing platform for manufacturing an 11-mer synthetic antimicrobial peptide. The peptide was successfully produced in its active form using the SspDnaB mini intein system and showed antimicrobial efficacy against E. coli, a common pathogen. The cleaved peptide and the cleavage reaction was further characterized by RP-HPLC, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and calorimetric methods. Process simulation studies were also conducted using the Super Pro Designer software to compare the overall process economics and environmental impact of the proposed bioprocessing strategy with the SPPS methodology. Operating costs for the intein based bioprocessing strategy was found to be at least two to three times cheaper compared to the SPPS method while being 5-8 times more environmentally friendly.

AB  - It is well established that plants and soil properties are interdependent. What is less known is the degree to which the distribution of plant and soil properties, in both space and time, match one another. We assessed plant community and soil conditions in permanent sample plots in a tallgrass prairie community from 2002 to 2008. Redundancy analysis showed that the dominant grass species were associated with changes in elevation, soil pH, and gravimetric water content, but not nitrogen or phosphate. Indicator species analysis suggested the community is best described by four cluster types, with half of the plots changing community type over the 6-year sampling period. These cluster types were generally spatially aggregated, with semivariograms showing a range from 80 to 346 m. This degree of spatial structuring was observed in the elevation and soil water content data, but not in measures of soil inorganic N or P. This suggests that natural plant communities do not necessarily show a strong correspondence to all soil variables, especially those that vary rapidly in time and space. The dynamic nature of vegetation patch distribution, combined with their size, may contribute to the loss of species from small tallgrass prairie reserves.

AB  - Measurement of detrital zircon U-Pb ages has become the method of choice for single crystal-based investigations of provenance for both modern and ancient sediments. Recent studies, however, demonstrated the failure of zircon to record major tectonic events in source terranes, revealing the need for a more robust provenance methodology. A direct comparison between the utility of crystallization ages of detrital zircon and monazite as provenance indicators has been made using modern river alluvium derived from known sources. While detritll zircon does not fully record the multiple collisional phases that are the hallmark of the Appalachian orogen, detrital monazite accurately records all the major tectonic events. The physical and petrogenetic differences between zircon and monazite are the primary factors for differing detrital age spectra. Zircon, owing to its extreme refractory nature, skews detrital age spectra toward older ages and limits its ability to record low-grade thermotectonic events in orogens. Monazite recrystallizes over a broader range of metamorphic conditions than does zircon. Consequently, monazite has the potential to record metamorphic events that might otherwise be absent from the detrital zircon record, thus providing a more accurate record of source terranes in regions characterized by moderate thermal events.

AB  - The kinetic patterns of pure soy lipoxygenase LOX-1 and crude or defatted soybean extracts containing LOX isoenzymes (LOX-1, LOX-2 and LOX-3) were studied by UV spectrometry at 234 and 280 nm, depending on their extraction and measurement conditions. Different pHs (from 6.0 to 9.0), corresponding to specific activation of LOX isoenzymes and the ratios of enzyme protein per substrate were used in order to evaluate the enzyme rates, as indicators of its affinity for substrate in different environments. The crude soy extract contained mainly LOX-1 activity (measured at 234 nm, at pH 9.0) and LOX-3, in an approximate ratio of 3:1. The LOX-2 activity was very low. The defatted extracts buffered at pH 6.8 and 7.1 showed a low LOX-1 and LOX 2 activity, but mostly LOX-3 activity (measured at 280 nm, at pH 7.1), with a mirror-type relation between the enzyme/substrate ratio and their enzymatic specific activity. The results suggest that defatting inhibits specifically the LOX-1 activity and indicate the possibility to modulate LOX activity by modifications of enzyme/substrate ratios and modifications of pH in the enzyme environment.

AB  - Twenty-nine C-14 dates of precise biological sea-level indicators from the Lebanese coast show evidence for two significant regional crustal uplift episodes during the past 6000 years. We elucidate: (1) an upper shoreline at ca. +120 to +140 cm, which lasted from ca. 6000 to 3000 BP; and (2) a lower shoreline at +80 +/- 40 cm, developed between the fifth century BC and the sixth century AD. These movements are associated with: (1) two major seismic crises along the Yammuneh fault and the Roum-Tripoli Thrust (RTT); and (2) subsequent seismic events on a series of second-order ENE trending dextral transpressive faults. Vertical movements affected north Lebanon, whilst the coasts of south Lebanon generally underwent crustal downlift. This is in contrast with relative stability in northern Israel, suggesting an area of stationary tectonic conditions west of the Dead Sea-Rosh Hanikra/Ras Nakoura fault. The main C-14 age cluster, corresponding to the second uplift event, may have resulted from fault movements during the "Early Byzantine Tectonic Paroxysm" (EBTP), between ca. 1750 and 2000 BP. Relative sea level stabilised to present level around 1000 BP. (c) 2006 Elsevier BY. All rights reserved.

AB  - Difructose anhydrides (DFAs) are pseudodisaccharides produced by condensation of two fructose molecules by means of caramelization reaction which takes place during heating of sugars or sugar-rich foodstuffs. The aim of this research was to evaluate the feasibility of DFAs as chemical markers of honey authenticity and sugar-roasted torrefacto coffee. DFAs were analysed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry after conversion to their trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives. alpha-D-fructofuranoside-1,2':2,1'-beta-D-fluctofuranoside (DFA7) and alpha-D-fructofuranoside-1,2':2,1'-beta-D-fructopyranoside (DFA9) can be used as quality markers of honey and coffee. DFA7 and DFA9 were detected in honey added with 5% fructose and sucrose caramels and 15% of glucose caramels. Torrefacto coffees showed DFAs values ranged from 0.195 to 0.570 g/100 g whereas only traces were found in natural roasted coffees. Quantities from 0.073 to 0.189 g/100 g were measured in blends of natural and torrefacto roasted coffees. A relationship between DFAs content in torrefacto coffees and roasting conditions was observed. In conclusion, this study indicated that DFAs are useful chemical indicators to control honey authenticity and torrefacto coffee roasting. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - When Enterococcus faecalis is isolated from fresh feces, its host range appears to be limited to humans and birds. Although E faecalis is found in human sewage, the extent to which the bacterium is found in broiler litter and in the feces of wild birds is unclear. These results have implications for bacterial source tracking. We determined if media designed for the isolation of fecal enterococci affected this host range, and if E. faecalis was routinely found in broiler litter and in the feces of wild birds. Of five different isolation media, none affected the isolation of E. faecalis. Enterococcus faecalis was routinely found in fresh broiler feces (522 of 1092 isolates; 48%), but rarely in broiler litter (12 of 1452 isolates; <2%). Therefore, broiler litter selects against this bacterium, and broiler litter is an unlikely environmental source of this bacterium. The presence of E. faecalis in eight wild bird species was highly variable. Unless the fecal loading rate from migratory or resident wild birds is high, water samples collected during baseflow conditions with high numbers of E faecalis may indicate human fecal contamination.

AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the influence of the organic and nutritional quality on the activity and Cand N contents of the microbial biomass in different structures of litter from a Mountain Atlantic Forest from around the Desengano State Park-RJ, Brazil. Litter samples were collected in September 1999. The litter structures were leaves, branches, and superficial roots; fine debris (F structure); and organic matter smaller than 2 mm (H structure). The nutritional and organic litter quality influenced the activity of the microbial biomass. The leaves had the most efficient microbial biomass in the immobilization of C and N. The qCO(2) (metabolic quotient) was an indicator for the stress condition and presence of cellulose and polyphenol for the microbial biomass in the different structures. The formation of three distinct groups was observed by the Tocher group technique. The first group consisted of superficial roots and H strucuture; the second comprised leaves and the third group consisted off strucuture. Through the relative contribution of the characters to the divergence between components, the variable that most contributed was polifenol: N ratio, followed by carbon microbial biomass, polifenol, cellulose and lignin: N ratio.

AB  - The US Geological Survey has reported the presence of a metal contamination gradient in clam tissues, decreased condition indices, and irregular reproductive patterns have been reported in the Asian clam, Potamocorbula amurensis, from San Francisco Bay. If metals are driving the observed patterns in the field, then biomarkers of exposure, and possibly deleterious effect, should show a corresponding gradient. In this study, biomarkers from sub-cellular to tissue levels of biological organization were assessed in P. amurensis collected from the Bay or exposed to cadmium in the laboratory. Cellular and tissue alterations were assessed using histopathology and enzyme histochemistry (EH). Alterations in the ovary, testis, kidney, and gill tissues were most common at the most contaminated station when data were averaged over a 12-month sampling period. EH analysis indicated decreased active transport, energy status, and glucose oxidation in kidney and digestive gland at the most contaminated site which may indicate a decreased potential for growth. Ovarian lesions observed in feral Asian clams were experimentally induced in healthy clams by cadmium exposure in laboratory exposures. Our results suggest a contaminant etiology for tissue alterations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The orientation system of migratory birds consists of a magnetic compass and compasses based upon celestial cues. In many places, magnetic compass directions and true or geographic compass directions differ (referred to as magnetic declination). It has been demonstrated experimentally in several species that the innate preferred direction of magnetic orientation can be calibrated by celestial rotation, an indicator of geographic directions. This calibration process brings the two types of compass into conformity and provides the birds with a mechanism that compensates for the spatial variation in magnetic declination. Calibration of magnetic orientation has heretofore been demonstrated only with hand-raised birds exposed to very large declination (90 degrees or more). Here we show that the magnetic orientation of wild birds from near Albany, New York, USA (declination = 14 degrees W) was N-S, a clockwise shift of 26 degrees from the NNW-SSE direction of birds raised entirely indoors. Hand-raised birds having visual experience with either the daytime sky or both day and night sky orientated N-S, similar to wild-caught birds. These data provide the first confirmation that calibration of magnetic orientation occurs under natural conditions and in response to modest declination values.

AB  - Measurements of ozone, carbon monoxide, NOy, NOx, HNO3, particulate NO3-, PAN, PPN, and alkyl nitrates were made at Chebogue Point, Nova Scotia, during July, August, and September 1993, and measurements of ozone, carbon monoxide, NOx and NOy were made at Sable Island, Nova Scotia, during August and September 1993 as part of the North Atlantic Regional Experiment (NARE). Periods of photochemical pollution were observed during which concentrations of the above species were elevated relative to average conditions. The best indicator of the extent of impact was found to be the sum of the C-1-C-4 alkyl nitrates. The removal of PAN and PPN by fog droplets through thermal decomposition and subsequent uptake of the peroxyacetyl and peroxypropionyl radicals (PA and PP) was suggested by loss of PAN and PPN during fog. The effect of this chemistry on NOy species in the marine environment will need to be considered. The loss of inorganic nitrate (HNO3 and particulate NO3-), PAN (and to a minor extent PPN) resulted in deviation of the O-3 versus NOy-NOx correlations from that observed in eastern North America.

AB  - Ecological restoration trials in high-alpine sites require sampling of indigenous plant populations. This problem is discussed briefly in relation to initial genetic diversity in the restoration material. The further part of the paper deals with restoration trials in the Swiss Alps and their assessment.
   The plots, set in machine-graded downhill ski runs, were revegetated with transplants of alpine species used in various combinations. Safe-site conditions were simulated with biodegradable wood-fibre mats. Surveys carried out in plots aged four to seven years focused on plant species inventory and age-state structure of mixed stands. The alpha diversity assessment included species number and the associated aspects. The consistent increase in species number, the number of plant families represented, and range of life-forms was apparently independent of the restoration timing. The age-state structure of the mixed stands was characterized by a considerable increase in the range of age-state classes and, in particular, a regular appearance of younger variants. These changes clearly indicate development of self-sustaining plant communities influenced by reproduction of the transplants and extensive immigration. It is proposed that age-state structure be called delta diversity and included in a routine assessment of post-restoration status of both single plant populations and mixed stands.

AB  - Blood and urine samples were collected at the end of an 8-h workshift from 30 male workers exposed to a mixture of n-hexane, ethyl acetate and toluene (each being about 2 ppm as geometric means) and also from 20 nonexposed male workers. Blood samples were analyzed for n-hexane and toluene, and urine samples were analyzed for n-hexane, toluene, 2,5-hexanedione (both with and without hydrolysis) and hippuric acid. Based on the correlation between biological exposure indicators and solvent concentrations in air, sensitivity as an exposure indicator was compared between solvents in blood and solvents or metabolites in urine in terms of the lowest solvent concentration at which the exposed subjects can be statistically separated from the nonexposed. Both n-hexane and toluene in blood were sensitive enough to detect the exposure at 6.1 ppm and 1.4 ppm, respectively. n-Hexane exposure below 2 ppm was detectable also by urinalysis for 2,5-hexadione without hydrolysis. Urinary hippuric acid, however, failed to detect low toluene exposure under the conditions studied. Of additional interest is the fact that toluene in urine correlated significantly with toluene in air, which apparently deserves further study for confirmation.

AB  - Purpose: The study's purpose was to examine the management of agri-food enterprises' resource-saving development to minimize potential imperfections in managing material and human resources and improve data quality.
   Materials and methods: A combined analysis was used to display the potential relationships between the agri-food sector achievements and basic indicators of natural resources' sustainability and resilience to risks. The analysis covered Ukraine, Romania, and Poland. The analysis allowed for developing a general management scheme, including a management transformation comparative description in the economic growth context.
   Results: The study revealed that Ukraine is clearly not on the path to progress in manufacturing enterprises and agriculture, as most of its indicators do not meet global nutrition goals. At the same time, Ukraine remains an export-oriented country. Its agri-food enterprises' activities focus on external markets, corresponding to the priorities of the country's agricultural policy and sustainable development goals of the United Nations organization.
   Conclusion: The obtained results provide knowledge about and understanding of processes that occur in the agri-food enterprises' organizational structure in countries with different development levels. The awareness of these processes is crucial for effective enterprise management in the resource conservation context.

AB  - The reliable operation of urban road traffic is the vision of urban development. The reliability measurement method with travel time as a performance index is the starting point of this study. Based on the travel time data, we have studied the shortcomings of existing travel time reliability indicators. Most of them simplify or even ignore the information of traffic performance thresholds. According to the characteristics of the actual urban road network, we proposed measurement of travel time reliability under uncertain random environment, that is, the travel time belief reliability. By extracting the information of traffic service subject and object, this method takes into account the influence of cognitive and random uncertainty on reliability. Next, we established the belief reliability model of travel task under the uncertain random road environment. The model considers the route selection, departure status and road conditions and gives the route selection algorithm under a time-varying road network. In addition, the impact of road objective factors and driving state factors on the travel time threshold is discussed by using the uncertainty regression analysis method. Finally, we took the actual travel task in Beijing as an example to verify the feasibility and practicability of the model and algorithm.

AB  - Diamond is commonly regarded as an indicator of ultra-high pressure conditions in Earth System Science. This canonical view is challenged by recent data and interpretations that suggest metastable growth of diamond in low pressure environments. One such environment is serpentinisation of oceanic lithosphere, which produces highly reduced CH4-bearing fluids after olivine alteration by reaction with infiltrating fluids. Here we report the first ever observed in situ diamond within olivine-hosted, CH4-rich fluid inclusions from low pressure oceanic gabbro and chromitite samples from the Moa-Baracoa ophiolitic massif, eastern Cuba. Diamond is encapsulated in voids below the polished mineral surface forming a typical serpentinisation array, with methane, serpentine and magnetite, providing definitive evidence for its metastable growth upon low temperature and low pressure alteration of oceanic lithosphere and super-reduction of infiltrated fluids. Thermodynamic modelling of the observed solid and fluid assemblage at a reference P-T point appropriate for serpentinisation (350 degrees C and 100 MPa) is consistent with extreme reduction of the fluid to logfO(2) (MPa) = -45.3 (Delta logfO(2)[Iron-Magnetite] = -6.5). These findings imply that the formation of metastable diamond at low pressure in serpentinised olivine is a widespread process in modern and ancient oceanic lithosphere, questioning a generalised ultra-high pressure origin for ophiolitic diamond.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Racism is an underlying cause of ethnic health inequities both in Aotearoa New Zealand and internationally. It is timely to synthesise racism and health research within New Zealand particularly given the current policy environment and shift towards addressing the health effects of racism. AIM: To review quantitative research examining self-reported experiences of racial discrimination and associations with measures of health (health conditions, health risk, health status and healthcare) in New Zealand.
   METHODS: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science and CINAHL databases were searched for studies reporting on associations between experiences of racism and health.
   RESULTS: The systematic review identified 24 quantitative studies reporting associations between self-reported racial discrimination across a wide range of health measures including mental health, physical health, self-rated health, wellbeing, individual level health risks, and healthcare indicators.
   CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative racism and health research in New Zealand consistently finds that self-reported racial discrimination is associated with a range of poorer health outcomes and reduced access to and quality of healthcare. This review confirms that experience of racial discrimination is an important determinant of health in New Zealand, as it is internationally. There is a pressing need for effectively designed interventions to address the impacts of racism on health.

AB  - Mechanical characteristics of individual cells play a vital role in many biological processes and are considered as indicators of the cells' states. Disturbances including methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (M beta CD) and cytochalasin D (cytoD) are known to significantly affect the state of cells, but little is known about the real-time response of single cells to these drugs in their physiological condition. Here, nanoindentation-based atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to measure the elasticity of human embryonic kidney cells in the presence and absence of these pharmaceuticals. The results showed that depletion of cholesterol in the plasma membrane with M beta CD resulted in cell stiffening whereas depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton by cytoD resulted in cell softening. Using AFM for real-time measurements, we observed that cells mechanically responded right after these drugs were added. In more detail, the cell ' s elasticity suddenly increased with increasing instability upon cholesterol extraction while it is rapidly decreased without changing cellular stability upon depolymerizing actin cytoskeleton. These results demonstrated that actin cytoskeleton and cholesterol contributed differently to the cell mechanical characteristics.

AB  - The palm swamps are arranged in the landscape in wetlands, which contribute to regulate the hydrological cycle of water courses supply. These areas are characterized by superficial streams and populated by Buritis (Mauritia flexuosa), typical palm of these environments. The soils in the palm swamp present indicative of pedoenvironmental conditions related to intense reduction processes of Fe, common in swampy areas where the reducing environment hinders the oxidation process. This study aims to evaluate the use of soil color parameter, associated with data from iron extracted with dithionite (Fe DCB), as indicator for delimitation of areas that comprise a palm swamp, producing subsidies to adequate the permanent preservation area surrounding the palm swamp, and as an indicator for delimitation of soils under water influence. The results pointed out the color GLEY 1, with values from 5 to 8 and chroma N, and colors 10Y, and 5Y with value and chroma varying among 5/1, 6/1, 7/1 and 7/2 as a useful tool for delimitation of palm swamp pedoenvironment, as well as 330 ppm of iron, since both indicate the occurrence of soils formation under hydromorphic or gley environments.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the possible correlation between 5-n-alkylresorcinols and hydroxycinnamic acids on mycotoxin accumulation in grains under field conditions. At this purpose, ten different grain varieties characterized by different degree of ploidy (hexaploid, tetraploid, diploid) were chosen, among them common and durum wheat, einkorn, emmer, and spelt. The contamination, expressed as the sum of DON and DON3Glc, was found to be significantly lower in common wheat and spelt than in emmer, durum wheat and einkorn, following a trend hexaploid < tetraploid < diploid species. The mycotoxins content negatively correlated with the total 5-n-alkylresorcinols and the ratio AR21:0/AR23:0, recently reported as an indicator of antifungal activity. Interestingly, DON3Glc was negatively correlated with the ratio AR17:0/AR21:0, reported as a genetic related indicator, in agreement with its biological role; in fact, it is formed in plant as detoxification product. On the contrary, no correlation was pointed out with total and free HCA. The results obtained indicated that only the lipophilic phenolic fraction in wheat could exert an inhibitory effect towards mycotoxin accumulation.

AB  - According to "polluter pays" principle, there is huge burden on the industries to remediate contaminated sites. Mergers and acquisitions of industrial sites is a preferred mode of growth for corporations. The management of the acquiring company should be mindful of potential environmental risks which they may inherit as part of the acquisition and take appropriate risk management actions. If not, they may face financial, reputation and other liabilities due to the "polluter pays" principle. This paper presents a case study of an environmental audit during acquisition of an Indian automobile axle manufacturing facility. This audit serves as a due-diligence process to identify environmental risks due to non-compliance with environmental legislation and potential release of environmental pollutants in the soil or groundwater at the time of transaction. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate that an environmental audit process can serve as an effective due-diligence or risk management tool to identify existing and future environmental liabilities at industrial sites. The environmental audit is thus an important tool to mitigate business risks during mergers and acquisitions, document the baseline environmental conditions at the facility; identify areas for improvement and ensuring sustainable compliance with environmental legislation.

AB  - The rapid spread of the Industry 4.0 technologies is deeply changing workplaces. In order to achieve the so-called Forth Industrial Revolution, several open issues have to be faced, concerning technologies, enterprise organization and knowledge. Automation systems are already replacing men in manual, repetitive tasks: both shop-floor and office operations are experiencing this kind of transformation. Therefore, the role of human operators is shifting from manual work to knowledge work: people will be increasingly required to manage and exploit technologies by interacting with automation devices. In order to fulfill such requirements, operators will need to own appropriate knowledge and skills, enabling them to profitably understand the feedback data and take complex decisions to guarantee high performance levels for the enterprise. Obviously, this change cannot ignore the need to maintain and improve Occupational Safety and Health - OS&H conditions, whose assessment and management are entrusted to specific analyses of each production context.
   The paper proposes some applications on innovative technologies involved in Industrial production scenarios, highlighting also how a different and tailored analysis on Occupational Safety and Health - OS&H aspects are essential to both ensure and preserve safety and health of workers in a continuous working environment changing.

AB  - The origin of the organic matter was assessed in two estuaries in Eastern Amazon, Brazilian Northern Coast, under different hydrodynamic conditions. The isotopic composition (delta C-13; delta N-15) and the elementary ratio (C/N) were determined in the sediments, in the suspended particulate material (SPM), as well as in the phytoplankton, plants and oysters. The (delta C-13) values have indicated that the sedimentary organic matter is a terrestrial-marine mix composed of terrigenous organic matter (75%) in the Para River estuary, as well as of marine organic matter (60%) in the Mocajuba River estuary. The estimates of sources recorded through delta C-13 data were partially confirmed through the correlation (delta N-15) versus C/N, which reflects the action of diagenetic and biological processes on the organic matter composition control. On the other hand, the high carbon content (delta C-13) found in Para River estuary samples is conclusive because it shows isotopic changes due to the anthropogenic processes in the region.

AB  - Studies confirm physical long-range cell-cell communication, most evidently based on electromagnetic fields. Effects concern induction or inhibition of cell growth. Their natural function is unclear. With the protozoan Paramecium caudatum I tested whether the signals regulate cell density and are electromagnetic. Up to 300 cells/mL, cell growth in clones of this study is decreasingly pronounced. Using cuvettes as chemical barriers enabling physical communication I placed 5 indicator cells/mL, the inducer populations, into smaller cuvettes that stand in bigger and contained 50, 100, 200 or 300 cells/mL. Under conditions of total darkness such pairs were mutually exposed for 48 hours. The hypothesis was that indicator cells, too, grow less the more neighbor cells there are. The bigger inducer populations were in the beginning the less they grew. The indicator populations grew accordingly; the more cells they were surrounded by the less they grew. The suppressing neighbors-effect disappeared when inner cuvettes were shielded by graphite known to shield electromagnetic radiation from GHz to PHz, i.e. to absorb energy from microwaves to light.

AB  - Assemblages of zoo-indicators were studied in the peat deposits of a floodplain terrace eutrophic peatland located on the bank of Bakchar River, within the southern taiga zone of western Siberia. The peat deposits were formed by minerotrophic peat dated 8500 cal yr BP. A detailed analysis of fossil animal remains (testate amoebae, oribatid mites and molluscs) was carried out in three peat layers formed under contrasting environmental conditions. These peat layers used for the analysis of zoo-indicators were selected, based on data concerning plant macrofossils of the peat and the dynamics of hydrological indices such as: the peat humification index and the water table depth (WTD) calculated using rhizopod analysis. A thorough study of zoo-indicator paleo-assemblages allowed us to reconstruct increased water levels in the eutrophic peatland during the periods 5900-5400 and 4000-3900 cal yr BP; moreover, in the first case the water regime was flowing, to change for stagnant in the second. A period of a decreased water level in the peatland was also revealed, between 4900-4800 cal yr BP.

AB  - The propensity to misfold and self-assemble into stable aggregates is increasingly being recognized as a common feature of protein molecules. Our understanding of this phenomenon and of its links with human disease has improved substantially over the past two decades. Studies thus far, however, have been almost exclusively focused on cytosolic proteins, resulting in a lack of detailed information about the misfolding and aggregation of membrane proteins. As a consequence, although such proteins make up approximately 30% of the human proteome and have high propensities to aggregate, relatively little is known about the biophysical nature of their assemblies: To shed light on this issue, we'have studied as. a model system an archetypical representative of the ubiquitous major facilitator superfamily, the Escherichia coli lactose permease (LacY). By using a combination of established indicators of cross-beta structure and morphology, including the amyloid diagnostic dye thioflavin-T, circular dichroism spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray fiber diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy, we show that LacY can form amyloid-like fibrils under destabilizing conditions. These results indicate that transmembrane alpha-helical proteins, similarly to cytosolic proteins, have the ability to adopt this generic state.

AB  - The potential of beekeeping to mitigate the exposure of rural sub-Sahara African farmers to economic stochasticity has been widely promoted by an array of development agencies. Robust outcome indicators of the success of beekeeping to improve household well-being are unfortunately lacking. This study aimed to identify the key drivers and barriers of beekeeping adoption at the household level, and quantified the associated income contribution in three agro-ecological zones in Uganda. Beekeepers were generally the most economically disadvantaged people in the study areas and tended to adopt beekeeping following contact with non-government organisations and access to training. Whilst incomes were not statistically lower than their non-beekeeping counterparts; their mean household well-being scores were significantly lower than non-beekeeping households. The inability of beekeeping to significantly improve well-being status can in part be attributed to a lack of both training in bee husbandry and protective equipment provision such as suits, gloves and smokers. These are critical tools for beekeepers as they provide the necessary confidence to manage honey bees. Rather than focussing solely on the socio-economic conditions of farmers to effectively adopt beekeeping, future research should also attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of development agencies' provision to the beekeeping sector.

AB  - The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is constructed in a mountainous area where limited information has been collected on key environmental factors and which is lacking of information about site condition, hazards and environmental impacts. To deal with problems, the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) DEM and Advanced Land Observation Satellite Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOSPALSAR) were used to map factors that can lead to the GERD failure and predict the flooded area in Sudan and seawater intrusion in the Nile Delta, Egypt. The results showed that the Nubian Block and the GERD site are structurally controlled by sets of faults. Their trends are in the NNE-SSW, NE-SW, and NNW-SSE directions and share the similar trends with the shear stress and African Rift, which created some alarm. The results indicated that the maximum extent of the Sudanese inundation area, as estimated from a DEM using a flood basin model, was about 667,228 km(2) along the Blue Nile River and was at high risk. The results also showed that one-third of the Nile Delta will experience seawater intrusions when the groundwater table depletes 5 m below sea level.

AB  - In this work, the problem of driving a batch process to a desired final product quality using data-driven model based midcourse correction (MCC) is described. Specifically, we adapt a sequential and orthogonalized partial least squares (SO-PLS) method to calibrate the inferential quality model, which takes into account the serial nature of the input batch data matrices and could retain the reliable information as much as possible when it is used to perform online quality prediction. Since the process variable trajectories that are necessary to predict the final quality are incomplete at a certain decision point, known data regression (KDR) is used to estimate the future trajectories, and the causal relationship of the initial conditions and the future candidate manipulated variables in determining the future process variable trajectories is also considered. Finally, taking the advantage of the latent variable model, the indicators that consider only the degrees of freedom are employed as hard constraints to confine the SO-PLS model only used in a valid region. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a virtual batch process and a cobalt oxalate synthesis process.

AB  - Aquaculture has become a rapidly growing industry: over the past 3 decades, commercial production has steadily increased, and further expansion seems likely. However, the rise of aquaculture has been accompanied by concerns, especially regarding environmental sustainability. Substrates located under aquaculture sites receive large influxes of organic matter that can subsequently create anoxic conditions and thereby impact existing benthic communities. Shifts in the relative abundance of specific groups of bacteria could prove to be important indicators of impact and remediation. Here, we investigated bacterial community composition via 16S rRNA gene sequencing on isolated DNA from flocculent matter samples and associated bacterial mats under a hard-bottom aquaculture site in Newfoundland, Canada. We describe the heterogeneous community present in the flocculent matter, characterized by high relative abundances of the genera Spirochaeta (12%), Prolixibacter (5.6%) and Marinifilum (4.6%). Bacterial mats were not composed of Beggiatoa as often hypothesized, but instead were dominated by the genera Spirochaeta (15%), Prevotella (21%), Meniscus (11%) and Odoribacter (20%). Our findings provide insights into the bacterial composition of flocculent matter deposited on hard substrates and undergoing de gradation, and point to 3 unexpected bacterial genera as potential indicators of organic enrichment.

AB  - Poor water quality is a major contributing factor to disease in developing countries. Silver-coated ceramic pot filters (CPFs) are a relatively common form of household water treatment system (HWTS) representing an effective and sustainable technology for poor communities. Water production seems to be the major limiting factor of the CPF's lifetime and sustainability since low flow rates do not produce an adequate daily volume of treated water. This paper describes a long-term study of CPF flow rates under controlled conditions using three different water sources. The relationship between water characteristics and flow rate was assessed with the intent of identifying the principal parameters that impact CPF water production. The study concluded that turbidity seems to be the principal indicator in determining CPF lifetime in terms of quantity of treated water. There is no evidence that biological activity also contributes to premature failure of CPFs and the data did not indicate that chemical precipitation is responsible for the filter clogging. Manufacturers commonly conduct initial flow rate tests using clear water as a measure of quality assurance. However, the relationship between initial flow rate and average flow rate during the lifetime of the CPF should be further studied.

AB  - Most urban rivers play an important role in urban flood control and drainage in China, but pollution is fast becoming an issue of greater importance in water management. In this study, 63 zooplankton species were recorded in four downtown rivers in Shanghai between November 2007 and October 2008. Of these, 44 species belonged to the Rotifera, 13 to Cladocera, and six to Copepoda. The three most frequently occurring zooplankton (Brachionus calyciflorus, Microcyclops leuckarti, and Asplanchna priodonta) accounted for 80.00%, 76.84%, and 53.68%, respectively. Rotifera were found to be dominant, comprising 86.26% of total zooplankton, while cladoceran and copepod abundance amounted to 5.08% and 8.67%, respectively. Water temperature, salinity, electrical conductivity, and total nitrogen were of the greatest significance in the occurrence of zooplankton. Two species (Schmackeria forbesi and Lepadella ovalis) were notably more sensitive to environmental factors such as salinity and electrical conductivity than other species. The population size and community were inversely correlated with the increasing nutrient levels of the four rivers, suggesting that the water quality of the four rivers had been gradually recovering from a severe eutrophic state and that water conditions of the rivers had been gradually improved.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess potential toxic effects of phenanthrene (PHE) on tissues of clam Venerupis philippinarum using parameters of antioxidant defenses and oxidative stress. Antioxidant biomarkers including ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione (GSH), as well as DNA damage and lipid peroxidation (LPO) in gills and digestive glands of V. philippinarum, were analyzed after a 1-, 3-, 6-, 10- and 15-day exposure to seawater containing PHE at concentrations of 2, 10, 50 mu g/L. The results showed that the activity of most antioxidant enzymes was induced throughout the exposure period, and different trends were detected with time of exposure. The oxidative stress could be obviously caused in the gills and digestive glands under the experimental conditions. Overall, our results show that digestive glands are more sensitive to marine environmental stressors than gills, and GSH is proposed as potential useful biomarker as it showed good correlation with the target contaminant. This could provide useful information for toxic risk assessment of environmental pollutant PHE. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Releves from meadows and pastures of South Transdanubia (Hungary) are evaluated by clustering and ordination methods. The releve selection focused on the Arrhenatheretalia order but its transitions towards other types were also included. The groups of releves are delimited and described according to differential, dominant and constant species. Ecological conditions of the groups were compared using indicator values. Nine groups were distinguished, four of them belonging strictly to the order Arrhenatheretalia. Each alliance of Arrhenatheretalia presented in the study area (Cynosurion, Arrhenatherion) was represented by two groups. Groups from these two alliances are separated along a light gradient, while groups of the same alliance differ in nutrient values. Within Cynosurion, the nutrient-poor group cannot be identified unambiguously as any syntaxa previously known from Hungary. The nutrient-rich Cynosurion meadows are similar to Lolio-Cynosuretum, however, they show a stronger relationship with wet meadows. Within Arrhenatherion, Pastinaco-Arrhenatheretum is recognised as a hay meadow of nutrient-rich soils. The other meadow type is similar to Filipendulo-Arrhenatheretum, thus raising syntaxonomical problems. There are transitional groups towards semi-dry and wet meadows, one dynamic phase and one outlier group among the other five clusters.

TI  - Reduced feedback selective cluster index scheduling with user pre-selection for next-generation multi-input multi-output orthogonal frequency division multiple access systems
T2  - IET COMMUNICATIONS
LA  - English
AB  - The joint use of opportunistic scheduling and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) provide significant gains in environments of low mobility and scatter for which channel variations are low. The downside of opportunistic scheduling in multicarrier systems such as OFDMA, lies in the substantial uplink overhead required to feed back by the mobile stations (MSs) describing users' instantaneous link conditions. This study presents a novel approach towards multicarrier opportunistic scheduling for a multi-input multi-output configuration that promises major overhead reductions with only minor degradations on downlink throughput performance. The conventional channel quality indicator, in the form of instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is replaced by an alternative metric, in the form of the strongest cluster indices of each MS, which imposes a significantly reduced overhead. This study examines the performance of the proposes metric for random beamforming and examines the benefits in terms of throughput and feedback overhead over existing schemes. The results show that the proposed scheduling approach maintains performance within 1 dB of a full SNR based feedback scheme, while achieving feedback overhead reduction up to a factor of 24 and also providing improved fairness among users experiencing different channel gain levels.

AB  - Dragonfly assemblages represent sensitive indicators of environmental conditions including the water environment and forest structure. However, an understanding the ecology of tropical forest odonates remains one of the most significant gaps in our knowledge of the order. We sampled odonates at Sungai Wain Protection Forest, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Relatively high dragonfly species richness (88 species) was found during 35 survey days divided between two seasons. Seasonal differences in the species diversity were fairly small, in accordance with the fact that the climate in Kalimantan is generally stable. The highest species diversity was observed in intact primary forest: 60% of all recorded species were found there and 32% of all species were exclusive to this habitat. The proportion of biotope specialists decreased along the gradient - intact primary forest, slightly degraded primary forest, secondary forest, heavily degraded forest and non-forest. The ordination obtained from detrended correspondence analysis showed, along the main axis, a gradient in community similarity corresponding to the degree of forest degradation. The evidence indicates that, within the applied spatial scale, any forest degradation results in fewer species, with a pronounced change in the species composition, and an overall reduction in taxonomic diversity.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the content of selected elements and metabolites produced by fungi of the genus Fusarium in spell (Triticum spelta L.) grain and husks and common wheat (T. aestivum L.) grain. Concentration of trichothecenes. a volatile metabolite trichodiene (TRICH). as well as ergosterol (ERG) and adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) (a total microbial biomass indicator). were assessed. Toxin concentrations in spell grain and husks harvested in 2003 and 2004 were comparable. Average deoxynivalenol concentrations reached 450 and 523 pg/kg, in grain and 2.162 and 855 mu g/kg, in husks. respectively. Spelt grain, in comparison with common wheat grain, contained significantly higher concentrations of P. S. Mg. Zn, and Cu and a lower concentration of Al, whereas the concentrations of Ca, Fe. and Pb were significantly higher in the husks than in the grain of this cereal. A comparison of concentrations of, Fusarium spp. metabolites in the grain of spell and common wheat showed that the total concentration of mycotoxins and TRICH was slightly lower in 7: spelta. whereas common wheat grain contained lower concentrations of ERG and ATP. The obtained results indicate that spelt husks contain considerable concentrations of trichothecenes.

AB  - Aboriginal and Indigenous people are among the world's poorest of the poor, and are forming increasing proportions of urban centres throughout the world. Little information is currently gathered on urban Aboriginal and Indigenous populations, and almost no systems exist that examine their quality of life or importance to urban sustainability. An indicators system was developed by the Centre for Native Policy and Research to examine the condition of the Greater Vancouver region's 36,000 Aboriginal people. The system was based on the traditional Aboriginal concept of the medicine wheel and incorporates four elements or directions (physical/economic, spiritual/cultural, emotional/social, and mental/environment) as the foundation of sustainability. Information for the indicators revealed a much lower quality of life for Aboriginal people in the Greater Vancouver region compared to other residents. Only 36% of the indicators ranked as fair or improving, while 60% ranked as deteriorating, weak, or poor. In order to improve our understanding of progress towards sustainability, Aboriginal and Indigenous people need to be involved in developing and defining measures of sustainability. Such measures should take into account the significant cultural heritage and importance of Aboriginal and Indigenous people, and the significant socioeconomic gaps that exist.

AB  - Marine reptile remains, represented by several fragmentary skeletons and isolated elements, are described front the Lower Cretaceous (Aptian) southern high latitude deposits (Doncaster Member, Wallumbilla Formation) of White Cliffs in southeastern Australia. The specimens are attributable to at least three families of plesiosaur (Elasmosauridae, Polycotylidae and Pliosauridae) and probably one family of ichthyosaur (Ophthamosauridae). Polycotylid material from White Cliffs is amongst the oldest from anywhere in the world, and could point to an eastern Gondwanan origin for the group. Interestingly, the White Cliffs marine reptile fossils occur in association with palaeoclimatic indicators denoting seasonally very cold to near freezing conditions. This differs markedly from the climate regimes typically tolerated by modern aquatic reptiles but Suggests that some Mesozoic taxa were able to cope with low temperature environments. Exactly what adaptations facilitated their Survival is unknown. However, various strategies including elevated metabolic rates, rapid growth and/or seasonal migration/hibernation might have enabled their exploitation of cold water habitats along the southern coastal margin of the Australian Cretaceous epicontinental seaway.

AB  - Holstein cows were tested to determine which measures of thermal strain are the better predictors of production over 24-96 h at constant air temperatures of 19 and 29 degreesC. Both rectal temperature and respiration rate increased within 24 h, followed by milk yield and feed intake reductions after 48 h of heat stress. There were significant correlations between milk yield, feed intake, and rectal temperature. Several physiological strain indices were created to determine if combinations of measures are better than single measures in predicting production under these acute conditions. Mean daily rectal temperature was superior to maximum and minimum daily values of rectal temperature, as well as other indicators of thermal status in predicting dairy cow production. Likewise, mean daily rectal temperature was equal if not better than the physiological strain indices used in this study in predicting production. These data suggest that rectal temperature is superior to both single and combined indicators of thermal status in predicting dairy cow production, and should be considered for future development of physiological strain indices over a longer time period in both laboratory and field environments.

AB  - Geographic distribution of vector-borne diseases is mostly determined by environmental factors that condition both the pathogenic agent and its vectors. Based on satellite imagery data, some of these factors could be apprehended and quantified. A NASA sponsored project using remote sensing technology in a predictive model of high, medium and low malaria vector populations is described. This study, based on a thorough knowledge of vector biology, took into account climatic, environmental, and human factors measured by remotely sensed data. Analysis of these data integrated into a geographic information system (GIS) demonstrated the feasibility of elaborating a predictive model of malaria vector densities closely associated to malaria risks. Consequently, a decrease of malaria transmission and an improved cost-effectiveness of vector control were generated on the base of spatially and temporally adapted and targeted control strategies. Meteorological satellite data for which spatial resolution is low but which allows a global earth coverage, were able to predict apparition of epidemics and to elaborate large scale predictive models of vector and intermediate host abundance, including mosquitoes, ticks, tsetse flies, black flies, culicoides, and snails.

AB  - Semi-static toxicokinetic experiments were performed during a cruise of RV ''Polarstern'' to the Greenland Sea for Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn in mesozooplankton collectives of Calanus hyperboreus, C. finmarchicus, Metridia longa and Themisto abyssorum, to provide first tentative information on accumulation strategies and the experimental basis for estimation of kinetic parameters of two-compartment models. This is an inevitable precondition for using these organisms as biomonitors. Our results indicate a net accumulation strategy for Cu and Pb (within the given experimental constraints), but a tendency for regulation of Zn and especially for Cd. Two-compartment models were successfully fitted to the data, leading to rate constants statistically different from zero, which were validated by independent experiments. An extrapolation to field conditions is not possible without further evaluation. The collectives investigated may be regarded as potentially suitable biomonitors of Cu and Pb, but probably not of Zn and Cd. More information is required for a wider range of external metal exposures and the potential influences of life-history status on metal toxicokinetics must be clarified, before this approach can be fully adopted in the assessment of environmental quality.

T2  - NATURE

KW  - COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN
AB  - UNDERGROUND nuclear explosions produce trace amounts of distinctive but ephemeral radionuclide gases. In the context of monitoring a comprehensive test ban treaty, the detection of these gases within the territory of a signatory, during a challenge inspection(1-5), may indicate the occurrence of a clandestine nuclear event. Here we report the results of an experiment simulating a well-contained underground nuclear explosion, undertaken to test the ability of natural gas-transport professes to move highly dilute and rapidly decaying radionuclides to the surface. We find that trace gases are transported to the surface within periods of weeks to a year, by how along faults and fractures driven by barometric pressure variations. Both our observations and related simulations exhibit a chromatographic behaviour, with gases of higher atomic mass and lower diffusivity reaching the surface more rapidly. For a 1-kilotonne nuclear test under conditions identical to those of our experiment, we predict that short-lived Xe-133 and Ar-37 would be detectable, respectively, about 50 and 80 days after the detonation. Our results indicate that radionuclide sampling along natural faults and fractures, as a forensic tool, can be an extremely sensitive way to detect nearby underground nuclear explosions that do not fracture the surface.

AB  - The August 1991 eruption of the Hudson volcano in the southern Andean volcanic zone affected an area of 1000 km in radius to the east in the Argentine Patagonic meseta. The thickness of ash ranged from 20 cm in the Andean area to less than 1 mm in the Atlantic coast zone. Wind storms reactivated the ash deposits, together with terrigenous material, more than one year after the eruption. In order to assess the potential risk of the ash, analyses of concentration, size, mineralogical composition, toxic elements, and irritating effects of gases were performed. In all samples, the percentage of particles of the 2- to 5-mu m range is below the toxic threshold level. Trace elements are below the toxic threshold concentration for humans and animals. The major impact of the ashfall was on sheep herds; about one third of them were lost in the areas close to the volcano. Soil incorporated the ash layers, and a fast recovery of orchards was reported two years later. Rivers were loaded with sediment in the immediate aftermath, but one year later returned to previous conditions. Along the shores of the Buenos Aires Lake, a fresh tephra layer can be distinguished.

AB  - The genotoxic effects of benzene were assessed in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 49 workers occupationally exposed to benzene (3-68.7 mg/m(3) in the work environment) for 0-2, 2-10 and more than 10 years (10, 22 and 17 workers, respectively). Chromosomal aberrations, SCEs and UV-induced DNA synthesis were used as indicators of genotoxic effects. Most of the workers were followed up in 1991 and 1992, while the benzene concentrations were reduced to 1-18.4 mg/m(3) air. Considered overall, in the ''exposed'' groups, the frequencies of chromosomal aberrations were significantly higher than in controls thus providing evidence for the clastogenic effects of benzene. However, there seems to be no correlation between aberration frequencies and the duration of prior exposure to benzene. In 1991 and 1992, when the benzene concentrations were brought down, there was a concomitant decrease in the frequencies of chromosomal aberrations; in 1992 the decrease reached one third to one half of the initial frequencies, values still higher than in the controls. With the other genotoxic end-points, the changes were small and not consistent.

AB  - Irradiation experiments were conducted on a thermally immature rock sample of the Phosphoria Retort Shale and its isolated kerogen.  A Co-60-source for gamma radiation was employed at dosages ranging from 81 to 885 Mrads, which are attainable by Paleozoic and Precambrian black shales with syngenetic uranium enrichments.  Kerogen elemental, isotopic, and pyrolysate compositions are not affected at these dosages, but the bitumens extracted from the irradiated rock are affected.  The major effects are reductions in the amounts of bitumen, acyclic isoprenoids, and high-molecular weight acyclic carboxylic acids.  Natural differences in the amounts of bitumen and acyclic isoprenoid due to regional and stratigraphic variations in organic source input and depositional conditions make the radiation-induced reductions in these parameters difficult to use as indicators of natural radiation damage in black shales.  However, the preferential reduction in the high-molecular weight acyclic carboxylic acids, which are ubiquitous in the living precursory organic matter, is diagnostic of experimental gamma-irradiation but may not be diagnostic of natural irradiation.  The overall process associated with radiation damage is polymerization by cross-linking through a free radical mechanism.  As a result, irradiation of organic matter in black shales is more likely to retard rather than enhance petroleum generation.

TI  - Health Monitoring Framework for Weather Radar Based on Long Short-Term Memory Network with a Real Case Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
LA  - English
KW  - DIAGNOSIS
AB  - The health management of weather radar plays a key role in achieving timely and accurate weather forecasting. The current practice mainly exploits a fixed threshold prespecified for some monitoring parameters for fault detection. This causes abundant false alarms due to the evolving working environments, increasing complexity of the modern weather radar, and the ignorance of the dependencies among monitoring parameters. To address the above issues, we propose a deep learning-based health monitoring framework for weather radar. First, we develop a two-stage approach for problem formulation that address issues of fault scarcity and abundant false fault alarms in processing the databases of monitoring data, fault alarm record, and maintenance records. The temporal evolution of weather radar under healthy conditions is represented by a long short-term memory network (LSTM) model. As such, any anomaly can be identified according to the deviation between the LSTM-based prediction and the actual measurement. Then, construct a health indicator based on the portion of the occurrence of deviation beyond a user-specified threshold within a time window. The proposed framework is demonstrated by a real case study for the Chinese S-band weather radar (CINRAD-SA). The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in providing early fault warnings.

AB  - Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a pathogenic lentivirus related to human and simian immunodeficiency viruses that has been associated with AIDS-like pathologies in domestic and wild cats, as well as in hyenas. Despite known pathologies, progressive immunosuppression and ill health effects driven by these lentiviruses in association with other secondary infections remain understudied in free-ranging species. Here, the role of coinfections by gastrointestinal parasites and tick-borne hemoparasites for FIV disease progression was explored in 195 free-ranging African lions (Panthera leo) living in Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa. Using statistical methodology, we evaluated the effects of FIV on a range of health indicators to explore how direct and indirect effects of FIV and associated coinfections align to determine lion health outcomes. Findings show direct negative effects of FIV on host immunity and nutritional status, and exacerbation of aggressive behaviors, conditions which may increase exposure/susceptibility to other secondary infections. When taken together, the contribution of coinfecting parasites to morbidity in lions is of similar magnitude as direct effects of FIV infection alone, suggesting that the particular coinfection assemblage may play a role in mediating disease progression within natural lion populations.

AB  - Soil erosion is a type of land degradation caused by the interactive interaction of numerous factors, such as natural and socioeconomic conditions of a particular watershed. In this study, a comprehensive integrated methodology was used to evaluate the water erosion hazard in the Zhuxi watershed in Southern China, which is greatly affected by eroded soil. Ten indicators were selected, and a thematic layer map was generated for each indicator using Geographic Information System (GIS). The weight of each evaluation indicator was determined by combining analytic hierarchy process (AHP) with entropy method. Results show that the east and west sections of the Zhuxi watershed have very low and low grades of soil erosion hazards, respectively, and the middle part has the highest hazard. More than 60% of the area has high erosion hazard (moderate to very high). The intensity of soil erosion is lower than its hazard level, especially in high-grade hazard. The obtained results for erosion hazard level can be used to develop conservation strategies for the Zhuxi watershed. This study evaluates soil erosion hazard and offers reference for soil erosion control.

TI  - Bedrock weathering contributes to subsurface reactive nitrogen and nitrous oxide emissions
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - Atmospheric nitrous oxide contributes directly to global warming, yet models of the nitrogen cycle do not account for bedrock, the largest pool of terrestrial nitrogen, as a source of nitrous oxide. Although it is known that release rates of nitrogen from bedrock are large, there is an incomplete understanding of the connection between bedrock-hosted nitrogen and atmospheric nitrous oxide. Here, we quantify nitrogen fluxes and mass balances at a hillslope underlain by marine shale. We found that, at this site, bedrock weathering contributes 78% of the subsurface reactive nitrogen, while atmospheric sources (commonly regarded as the sole sources of reactive nitrogen in pristine environments) account for only the remaining 22%. About 56% of the total subsurface reactive nitrogen denitrifies, including 14% emitted as nitrous oxide. The remaining reactive nitrogen discharges in porewaters to a floodplain where additional denitrification probably occurs. We also found that the release of bedrock nitrogen occurs primarily within the zone of the seasonally fluctuating water table and suggest that the accumulation of nitrate in the vadose zone, often attributed to fertilization and soil leaching, may also include contributions from weathered nitrogen-rich bedrock. Our hillslope study suggests that, under oxygenated and moisture-rich conditions, weathering of deep, nitrogen-rich bedrock makes an important contribution to the nitrogen cycle.

AB  - The purpose of the research was conducting expert validation on environmental pollution problems based on the fundamental chemistry concepts. The type of research was design and development that involved three experts as validators. Data processing was carried out using SPSS ver.26 through the Kendall test. The values of Asymp.Sig. showed that pre-learning questions were valid in terms of the compatibility of pre-learning questions with indicators of the national curriculum and SDGs, compatibility of pre-learning questions with creative thinking indicators, and clarity of language use. The pre-learning questions were divided into ten indicators. Most of them asked students to describe of how greenhouse gases, heavy metal, and solid or liquid nano-plastic destroy environment. Students explained and wrote the chemical representations of those processes, namely macroscopic, sub-microscopic, and symbolic. Pre-learning questions were valid because they have conducted a curriculum review and the needs analysis. Besides, the creation process also involved teachers who mastered fundamental concept of chemistry and understood the condition of students. The validated pre-learning question is expected to help teachers deliver the fundamental concepts of chemistry on environmental pollution well so that teachers can achieve learning objectives.

AB  - Many dicyanoisophorone-based fluorophores with an optical hydroxyl group have been explored to meet different imaging needs along with the rapid and wide development of molecular fluorescence bioimaging in recent years. However, most of them used to need the addition of slight alkaline conditions to dissociate a proton for near-infrared emission and this limits their wider application in complex bio-systems. Aiming to modify the dicyanoisophorone-based fluorophore platform with an optically tunable hydroxyl group for better biocompatibility for molecular bioimagingin vivo, we developed a new chloro-substituted dicyanoisophorone-based near-infrared fluorophore (DCM-COH) which featured simple preparation (two steps), good optical properties and showed potential application prospects. As a proof-of-concept,DCM-COHwas applied to design a new probe (CYS-1) for detecting cysteine.CYS-1(lambda(ex/em)= 490/655 nm) possessed a large Stokes shift (165 nm), low toxicity, good sensitivity (detection limit of similar to 173 nM) and selectivity for rapid cysteine detection. More importantly,CYS-1successfully served as an indicator for imaging cysteine in cells andin vivo. FluorophoreDCM-COHmay act as a potential platform to be extended as a capable tracking tool in biological chemistry and preclinical applications.

AB  - The Aral Sea catastrophe profoundly worsened the socio-economic, environmental and health conditions of the local communities in Central Asia. This research paper is based on quantitative approach. The three indicators of climate change temperature, relative humidity and precipitation were used to assess if climate change was one of the main contributors to the shrinkage of Aral Sea. The initial data were retrieved from Global Weather Data SWAT. The paper has analyzed the aforementioned indicators of climate change from January 01st, 1979 to July 05th, 2014 using Hydrologic Engineering Center-Hydrologic Modeling System model. The paper has found out that the discharge of Amu Darya River Basin at the inlet of Aral Sea Basin in Karakalpakstan, an autonomous Republic located in Uzbekistan, has sharply declined. A maximum peak flow happened at the inlet of Aral Sea in Karakalpakstan on May 25th, 1988. Since then, the inflow at the Aral Sea Basin in Karakalpakstan was sharply declined due to the drastic climate change in the region. The author believes that the outcome of the research paper will support policy makers of Central Asian states as well as other stakeholders to take measurable steps in addressing the issue of Aral Sea crisis.

AB  - The breeding programs of hybrid wheat are aimed at increasing the grain yield and ecological plasticity, as well as the stress tolerance to drought and heat that have an unfavourable effect on the harvest quality parameters. As a result, this brings up the question whether or not these hybrids can compete or even replace the wheat cultivars which are considered high in terms of bread-making value. In order to elucidate this question, comparative research was established in the 2014-2015 growing season. The genotypes studied consisted of four winter wheat varieties (cultivars: Dropia, Glosa, Katarina, Mulan) and four hybrids wheat (Hyfi, Hystar, Hywin, Hybiza). The hybrids that clearly produced higher grain yield than the winter wheat varieties. The results of the research have shown that the quality index, the technological indicators of the flour and the rheological attributes of the dough, all eight winter wheat genotypes tested and analysed recorded values that fit into the "very good" category regarding the milling-bakery properties. Of all studied hybrids, the Hyfi hybrid wheat was high to the other hybrids regarding the bread-making suitability.

AB  - The objective of this work was to identify hyperaccumulator plants and evaluate their capacity on copper mine tailings in the Antofagasta Region (Chile), considered one of the most arid in the world.
   Two native plant species, Gazania rigens and Pelargonium hortorum, were grown during 11 weeks on mine tailings. The physico-chemical characterization of the mine tailings under study indicated that the substrate required conditioning to support a phytoremediation system. In this respect, organic and inorganic amendments and mycorrizhal fungi were added to the substrate. Three treatments were designed to assess the effects of the amendments through an analysis of variance.
   Indicators of plant growth and development were measured weekly, and concentrations of Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, Al, and Zn in roots of tailing-grown plants and substrate were measured at the end of the experiment.
   The results were used to determine the bioconcentration factor (BCF), which demonstrated that both species act as excluders of Fe, Mn, Pb, Al, and Zn. In addition, it was found that both species present characteristics of potential accumulators of Cu.

AB  - Population vulnerability of geological disasters is an important way in research on the relationship between human society and its geo-environment. This study examines the provincial administrative units of China as a research object. Twelve indicators are selected on the basis of three aspects, namely population exposure, population capacities, and environmental conditions surrounding people, to construct an index system for the assessment of population vulnerability to geological disasters (including landslide, debris flow, collapse, and land collapse) in China. Criteria importance through Inter-criteria Correlation (CRITIC) and Gray Relational Analysis (GRA) methods is employed to evaluate the population vulnerability of geological disasters in this country. The zoning map of China's population vulnerability to geological disasters and the ranking of evaluation results are obtained. The results show that the population vulnerability of geological disasters considerably differs in China, which is bounded by the Yellow River. The north of the Yellow River is basically a low population vulnerability zone, whereas the south of this river covers zones with moderate, high, and very high vulnerability. This study can be used as a basis for the reconstruction of the regional population's ability to resist geological disasters and undergo disaster recovery.

AB  - Designing autonomous vehicles for urban environments remains an unresolved problem. One major dilemma faced by autonomous cars is understanding the intention of other road users and communicating with them. To investigate one aspect of this, specifically pedestrian crossing behavior, we have collected a large dataset of pedestrian samples at crosswalks under various conditions (e.g., weather) and in different types of roads. Using the data, we analyzed pedestrian behavior from two different perspectives: the way they communicate with drivers prior to crossing and the factors that influence their behavior. Our study shows that changes in head orientation in the form of looking or glancing at the traffic is a strong indicator of crossing intention. We also found that context in the form of the properties of a crosswalk (e.g., its width), traffic dynamics (e.g., speed of the vehicles) as well as pedestrian demographics can alter pedestrian behavior after the initial intention of crossing has been displayed. Our findings suggest that the contextual elements can be interrelated, meaning that the presence of one factor may increase/decrease the influence of other factors. Overall, our work formulates the problem of pedestrian-driver interaction and sheds light on its complexity in typical traffic scenarios.

AB  - Human enteric viruses, such as norovirus and hepatitis A virus, are spread by a variety of routes including faecal-oral transmission. Contaminated bivalve shellfish are regularly implicated in foodborne viral disease outbreaks internationally. Traditionally indicator bacteria, the coliforms and Escherichia coil, have been used to detect faecal pollution in growing waters and shellfish. However, studies have established that they are inadequate as indicators of the risk of human enteric viruses. Bacteriophages have been identified as potential indicators or surrogates for human enteric viruses due to their similarities in morphology, behaviour in water environments and resistance to disinfectant treatments. The somatic coliphages, male-specific RNA coliphages (FRNA coliphages) and, the bacteriophages of Bacteroides are the groups recognised as most suitable for water and shellfish testing. In this review, we discuss the rationale and supporting evidence for the application of bacteriophages as surrogates for human enteric viruses in shellfish under a variety of conditions. There is some evidence to support the validity of using bacteriophage levels to indicate viral risk in shellfish in highly contaminated sites and following adverse sewage events.

AB  - A ZigBee based wireless sensor network is implemented in this paper which is of low-cost solar-powered air quality monitoring system. The main objective of the proposed architecture is to interfacing various sensors to measure the sensor analog data and displayed in LabVIEW on the monitor using the graphical user interface (GUI). The real time ambient air quality monitoring in smart cities is of greater significance for the health of people. The wireless network sensor nodes are placed at different traffic signals in the smart cities which collect and report real-time data on different gases which are present in the environment such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), methane (CH4) and humidity. The proposed system allows smart cities to monitor air quality conditions on a desktop/laptop computer through an application designed using graphical programming based LabVIEW software and provides an alert if the air quality characteristics exceed acceptable levels. The sensor network was successfully tested on the campus of the institute of aeronautical engineering, Hyderabad. The sensor data are indicated by different indicators on the front panel of LabVIEW and also different charts are plotted with respect to time and amplitude which explains the severity of polluted areas.

AB  - We simulated metacommunities in a hypothetical riverine network to investigate whether and how connectivity affects the species richness of groups with different dispersal abilities under different niche and dispersal-assembly rules. The simulated network was represented by a graph in which the nodes represented habitat patches, each with a particular environmental condition. We built our model based on Muller's "colonization cycle" hypothesis, in which adult aquatic insects compensate for the gradual downstream movement of larvae by flying preferentially upstream to oviposition. Species occurrence in each patch was probabilistically determined, taking into account environmental filtering and/or dispersal ability in different assembly scenarios. Variation in local species richness was explained by connectivity in both assembly scenarios, especially when dispersal ability was weak. In niche assembly metacommunities, the effect of connectivity was also dependent on the location of preferable patches. In general, local species richness was higher when dispersal ability was strong. Our findings suggest that the role of connectivity in shaping riverine metacommunities is context dependent and that the spatial structure of riverine networks should be considered in monitoring freshwater biota.

AB  - Marine or freshwater mussel species are found in large quantities around populated areas and accumulate metals in aquatic systems. Therefore, these organisms are used to monitor environmental pollution. Mytilus galloprovincialis is a generally accepted bioindicator of metal pollution and is used in this study. The aim of this study is to determine the changes in the environmental conditions since antiquity. M. galloprovincialis shells were used to monitor Chalcolithic pollution levels in Yarimburgaz Cave, one of the oldest settlements in Europe. Recent samples were collected from 12 stations on the coasts of the Northern Marmara Sea and the Bosphorus between May-September 2004. The environmental pollution substantially changed over the last 7500 years. The comparison of the geochemical characteristics of the environmental pollution observed in the Chalcolithic period and today revealed that pollution from both household and industrial chemicals has increased in Istanbul.

AB  - Balanced dynamics of reactive oxygen species in the phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium graminearum play key roles for development and infection. To monitor those dynamics, ratiometric analysis using the novel hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) sensitive fluorescent indicator protein HyPer-2 was established for the first time in phytopathogenic fungi. H2O2 changes the excitation spectrum of HyPer-2 with an excitation maximum at 405 nm for the reduced and 488 nm for the oxidized state, facilitating ratiometric readouts with maximum emission at 516 nm. HyPer-2 analyses were performed using a microtiter fluorometer and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Addition of external H2O2 to mycelia caused a steep and transient increase in fluorescence excited at 488 nm. This can be reversed by the addition of the reducing agent dithiothreitol. HyPer-2 in F. graminearum is highly sensitive and specific to H2O2 even in tiny amounts. Hyperosmotic treatment elicited a transient internal H2O2 burst. Hence, HyPer-2 is suitable to monitor the intracellular redox balance. Using CLSM, developmental processes like nuclear division, tip growth, septation, and infection structure development were analyzed. The latter two processes imply marked accumulations of intracellular H2O2. Taken together, HyPer-2 is a valuable and reliable tool for the analysis of environmental conditions, cellular development, and pathogenicity.

AB  - Destabilisation of blood cell lysosomes in Mediterranean green crab Carcinus aestuarii was investigated using Neutral Red Retention Assay (NRRA). Crabs collected in Narta Lagoon, Vlora (Albania) during May 2014 were exposed in the laboratory to sub-lethal, environmentally realistic concentrations of copper. Neutral Red Retention Time (NRRT) and glucose concentration in haemolymph of animals were measured. The mean NRRT showed a significant reduction for the animals of the treatment group compared to the control one (from 118.6 +/- 28.4 to 36.4 +/- 10.48 min, p<0.05), indicating damage of lysosomal membrane. Haemolymph glucose concentration was significantly higher in the treatment group (from 37.8 +/- 2.7 to 137.8.4 +/- 16.2 mg/dL, p<0.05) than in control group, demonstrating the presence of stress on the animals. These results showed that C. aestuarii could be used as a successful and reliable bioindicator for evaluating the exposure to contaminants in laboratory conditions. NRRA provides a successful tool for rapid assessment of heavy metal pollution effects on marine biota.

AB  - The genotype by environment (GxE) interactions can be observed by differential genotypic responses to varied environmental conditions. Its effect is to limit the accuracy of yield estimates and complicate the identification of specific genotypes for specific environments. The objective of this study was to use the Additive Main Effects and Multiplicative Interactions (AMMI) method, with additive effects for genotypes and environments and multiplicative terms for genotype by environment interaction for analyzing data of 6 sweetpotato genotypes at 8 agro-environments. Results indicated that genotypes MIB05 and MIB14 were suitable for vegetable use for their higher shoot yield despite the root yield was low but they had low stability among agro-environments especially for 2 environments in Pontian, Johor with peat soil but these genotypes are suitable for 2 seasons of Telong, Kelantan. More breeding efforts are needed in order to improve the yield stability of these genotypes. AMMI biplot analysis has shown its advantage as helpful tool in identifying the best genotype for improving leafy vegetable for a new cycle of crossing and selection. Moreover, results indicated that MIB20 (control variety) had high stability with low interaction effects in eight agro-environments.

AB  - The objective of this article is to highlight culture problems, bottlenecks to broodstock management, and possible genetic consequences to be taken into consideration when planning the domestication and captive breeding program for white grouper (Epinephelus aeneus) in Israel. Taking into account the biological features and genetic background of the white grouper, we suggest developing industrial cultivation in several stages. In stage 1, the establishment of broodstock and first steps towards domestication, emphasis should be placed on avoiding inbreeding in captive populations. Establishment of foundation population(s) is the most important step in broodstock management and determines the amount of genetic variation and culture potential of future domesticated generations. In stage 2, existing populations and strains will be tested under experimental and commercial growout conditions. In stage 3, traditional selective breeding methods including mass selection and crossbreeding will be implemented. In stage 4, development of marker-assisted selective breeding molecular techniques will enable assigning parentage to individual fish in mixed-progeny groups and design of an efficient genetic improvement program. Finally, in stage 5, organized and supervised domestication and selective breeding programs will provide Israeli farmers more control of broodstocks and sustainable development of white grouper aquaculture.

AB  - Wood anatomical features measured in tree-rings are useful indicators of environmental change and wood quality. The effect of latitude on the wood anatomy of mature black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) was investigated along a 500 km transect from 47 degrees N to 52 degrees N across the continuous boreal forest in Quebec, Canada. Total tree-ring width, earlywood width, latewood width, latewood proportion, cell numbers, tracheid length, radial diameter, lumen diameter, and cell wall thickness were measured using image analysis on samples from 15 mature stands. Our results suggest that tree-ring, earlywood, and latewood widths, cell numbers, latewood radial cell diameter, and cell wall thickness decrease with latitude. No significant trend was observed for latewood proportion, despite a slight increase with latitude (p = 0..0856). However, the hight variability in radial growth seen along the gradient might explain the absence of a significant relationship. Latitude and the associated growth rate reduction had no effect on tracheid length. The existence of a latitudina pattern of variation in black spruce wood anatomy may be the result of tree adaptatin to differing environmental conditions along the gradient.

TI  - Attainment of water regulations and building permit for the new Rhine hydroelectric power plant at Rheinfelden
T2  - WASSERWIRTSCHAFT
LA  - German
AB  - The river Rhine at Rheinfelden is forming the border between Switzerland (Canton of Aargau) and Germany (State of Baden-Wurttemberg). Thus it was difficult and time-consuming to attain water regulations and building permit for the new Rhine hydroelectric power plant at Rheinfelden. Furthermore the project is located in a densely populated and intensively used landscape. Finally it was the first large hydro-electric power plant, which was subjected to the legally prescribed environmental impact assessment in new form. The actual water regulations procedure went on from the end of 1983 to the end of 1989. The granting procedure of the building permit including the second part of environmental impact assessment dragged on, so that the permit was not given before autumn 1998. The new concessions of 1990 made it a condition for the owner (KWR) to start reconstructing the power plant within 10 years and to go on-stream within 14 years. Owing to delays in preparatory operations the time limit to start building was extended halfway through the year 2003. The reconstruction of the weir as the first building stage started just in time. The power station building on the Swiss part of the river Rhine is under construction at the moment. The completion is intended for 2010.

AB  - Recreational water quality is assessed by using water quality objectives for fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) including total coliform, fecal coliform. (or E. coli), and/or Enterococcus. It is required under the Clean Water Act that a TMDL be developed for a bacteria-impaired water body The development and implementation of bacterial TMDLs has proven challenging and often difficult due to unknown source(s) of FIB. This study found that FIB levels varied significantly in flowing water, ponded water, and associated sediment. FIB levels in isolated ponded water in waterways were significantly higher than in flowing water. Sediment under ponded water contained a great amount of FIB. Furthermore, FIB concentrations in ponded water tended to increase with increasing water temperature and to decrease with increasing water salinity. The result provides the field evidence of survival/growth of FIB in water and sediment under ambient conditions in southern California. A holistic approach including natural sources (e.g., a reference system) should be considered for practical and applicable purposes while developing and implementing bacterial TMDLs for pathogen-imp aired waterbodies.

TI  - Optimized energy saving rehabilitation of a baroque building monument
T2  - BAUPHYSIK
LA  - German
AB  - With the rehabilitation of the baroque building Hand-werk 15 in Gorlitz the authors achieved the energy efficiency class A+ under observance of all conditions from preservation of historic buildings and monuments, taking into account the environmental issues as well as durability and safety of the constructions in the house. The rehabilitation includes the internal thermal insulation of the historically valuable facade on the street side, the thermal insulation of the facade on the backyard side, the use of solar energy for hot water and for the support of heating especially in summer for heating the ground floor, a ventilation system with heat exchanger the use of gray water generated from domestic processes such as laundry and bathing, and an underfloor heating for the ground floor with waste water as medium. The measurement results will be verified with numerical simulations (temperature, air moisture transport in porous materials) of the separate building constructions and the technical components. The physical influence of the high building mass is quantified. The effects of the HVAC system on the historical building construction like for instance the timber beam floor will be investigated. Based on experiences about avoiding condensate and hoarfrost on inclined insulated glass together with a glass producing firm a new insulate glass with a special coating was developed.

AB  - in this study, Lactobacillus salivarius CECT 5713 was originally isolated from feces of a one-month-old breast-fed infant. Since it has been suggested that the gut microbiota of breast-fed infants reflects that of the maternal breast milk, we investigated if this specific strain was present in breast milk of the respective mother. RAPD and PFGE analysis revealed the presence of the strain L. salivarius CECT 5713 in this biological fluid. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a L. salivarius strain isolated from breast milk. L. salivarius CECT 5713 produced L-lactate, acetate and hydrogen peroxide, which may be responsible for its antimicrobial activity against most of the indicator organisms used in this study; in addition, this strain showed a high survival rate after exposition to conditions simulating those found in the gastrointestinal tract. Finally, it was strongly adhesive to Caco-2 and HT-29 cells did not produce biogenic amines and were unable to degrade gastric mucin in vitro. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - [ 1] This paper presents a joint inversion approach for combining crosshole seismic travel time and borehole flowmeter test data to estimate hydrogeological zonation. The approach is applied to a complex, fractured Department of Energy field site located at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, United States. We consider seismic slowness ( the inverse of seismic velocity) and hydrogeological zonation indicators as unknown variables and use a physically based model with unknown parameters to relate the seismic slowness to the zonation indicators. We jointly estimate all the unknown parameters in the model by conditioning them to the crosshole seismic travel times as well as the borehole flowmeter data using a Bayesian model and a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling method. The fracture zonation estimates are qualitatively compared to bromide tracer breakthrough data and to uranium biostimulation experiment results. The comparison suggests that the joint inversion approach adequately estimated the fractured zonation and that the fracture zonation influenced biostimulation efficacy. Our study suggests that the new joint hydrogeophysical inversion approach is flexible and effective for integrating various types of data sets within complex subsurface environments and that seismic travel time data have the potential to provide valuable information about fracture zonation.

AB  - The European Environment Agency (EEA) is the European Union body dedicated to providing sound, independent information on the environment. It is a major information source for those involved in developing, adopting, implementing and evaluating environmental policy in Europe, and also for the general public. In line with its mandate, the EEA has developed - focused around a set of policy relevant questions - a set of indicators to assess progress in Europe in integrating environmental considerations into the energy sector. Each question is answered through one or more indicators describing the development of the sector in Europe, implications for the environment and links to policy actions. The indicators cover not only the current situation, but also trends and prospects and, most importantly, point to the conditions for change that are needed for progress towards a more sustainable energy policy that benefits the environment. The results of the most recent assessment are presented in this article and show that in many areas of environmental integration there have been some successes, but overall progress to date has been insufficient. Substantial additional action will therefore be required in the future if the European Union is going to move towards a more environmentally sustainable energy system.

AB  - The spatial variability of microbial biomass C and three humification indexes (the degree of humification, DH; the index of humification, HI; and the humification rate, HR) were investigated in order to evaluate their usefulness as indicators of the response of soil organic matter to altered soil environments. The investigation was carried out by examining the topsoil layer of an experimental field characterized by the presence of four phases of one soil series and, except for the addition of cattle manure in part of the field, by fairly uniform agricultural practices. A rectangular area of 350 by 800 m was sampled on a square grid scheme coupled with nesting. The experimental objective was to determine if the investigated properties were influenced by changes in soil type and bu the addition of cattle manure. All properties measured showed spatial dependence at the sampling distances adopted, Two groups of properties were identified based on their degree of spatial variability: microbial biomass C, DH, and HI exhibited short-range variability, whereas HR varied across longer distances. Microbial biomass C and FIR showed a spatial pattern related to soil amendment and soil types, respectively. Therefore, these variables provided complementary information about the condition of soil organic matter in the study area.

AB  - Heterogeneous chemistry of nitrous acid (HONO) on liquid sulfuric acid (H2SO4) was investigated at conditions that prevail in the stratosphere. The measured uptake coefficient (gamma) of HONO on H2SO4 increased with increasing acid content, ranging from 0.03 for 65 wt % to about 0.1 for 74 wt %. In the aqueous phase, HONO underwent irreversible reaction with H2SO4 to form nitrosylsulfuric acid (NO+HSO4-). At temperatures below 230 K, NO+HSO4- was observed to be stable and accumulated in concentrated solutions (>70 wt % H2SO4) but was unstable and quickly regenerated HONO in dilute solutions (<70 wt %). HCl reacted with HONO dissolved in sulfuric acid, releasing gaseous nitrosyl chloride (CINO). The reaction probability between HCl and HONO varied from 0.01 to 0.02 for 60-72 wt % H2SO4 In the stratosphere, CINO photodissociates rapidly to yield atomic chlorine, which catalytically destroys ozone. Analysis of the laboratory data reveals that the reaction of HCl with HONO on sulfate aerosols can affect stratospheric ozone balance during elevated sulfuric acid loadings after volcanic eruptions or due to emissions from the projected high-speed civil transport (HSCT). The present results may have important implications on the assessment of environmental acceptability of HSCT.

AB  - Genotype x year (G x Y) and genotype x crop (G x C) interactions may be confounded in sugar cane when data is obtained from the plant crop and/or from ratoon crops in successive years. A technique to minimise the effects of confounding of the G x C interaction with the G x Y interaction is presented. The mean yield of cane from neighbouring farms was used as an indicator of the year (environment) effect. It was used to re-analyse yields from three experiments comparing six genotypes grown over a plant crop and three ratoons. Two experiments were grown under rainfed conditions and one experiment was irrigated. The confounded interactions were partitioned into a linear contrast on the farm yields (a year effect) and a crop effect that was the remainder. When the yields adjusted for the farm yield effects were compared with original yields of cane, yields of plant and first ratoon were reduced and those of third ratoon were increased. There were only minor changes in the ranking of genotypes on yield. It was concluded that the re-analysis using farm yield showed that the confounding effect of years on the interpretation of genotype x crop effects was small.

AB  - Simple Summary Improving broiler performance is still an essential task in animal production, especially under certain environmental challenge conditions. Heat stress is among the first and crucial limiting factors of the development of poultry production in warm regions. Betaine (B) and creatine (C) are seemingly two promising additives that showed enhancement in water metabolism in several animal species. Despite the clear beneficial effect of B and/or C on water metabolism, limited information is available about their use and effect on performance and thermophysiological responses of broiler chicks exposed to heat stress challenge. In view of the above consideration and in order to improve the productivity of broiler chickens, the present study was designed to examine the potential alteration in water metabolism in broiler chicks treated with B and/or C under thermoregulation challenge, which may contribute to the ongoing efforts to improve broiler chicken production. Under the current study conditions, the results demonstrated that performance and carcass parameters measured were not affected by B and/or C supplementation by the end of the rearing period. In light of the improved thermoregulatory performance and water balance indicators, it seems that B and/or C have successfully improved water holding capacity and therefore helped in enhancing thermo-tolerance.
   Abstract The present study aimed to assess the effect of dietary betaine (B) and/or creatine (C) on performance and thermoregulatory responses of broiler chicks. Indian River broiler chicks, fitted with compact thermosensors, were reared to market age (five weeks). The chicks were randomly distributed into four treatment groups, in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments-basal control diet (Control group: CONT; B-/C-); 1 g betaine/kg feed (Betaine group: BETA; B+/C-), 1.2 g creatine monohydrate/kg feed (Creatine group: CRET; B-/C+), and combination (Betaine and Creatine group: COMB; B+/C+) of both supplements. At 31 days of age, 20 chicks from each group were exposed to acute heat stress (A-HS) for 3 h (34.45 +/- 0.20 degrees C), and hemogramic profiles were screened before and after. Performance parameters (feed intake, body weight gain, and feed conversion ratio) were reported on a weekly basis, and carcass meat quality was evaluated at the end of experiment. Redness of breast was higher due to B and C treatments separately than the CONT group (B by C interaction; p < 0.05). Compared to the CONT, dietary supplements alleviated hyperthermia responses, with B alone being more efficient than C or COMB treatments. The mitigation of hyperthermia is likely mediated by enhancement of water balance indicators. Although not efficient in improving growth performance, dietary B and/or C are efficient in improving thermophysiological performance and survival of finishing broiler chicks under A-HS.

AB  - The assessment of ecosystem functions in Cerrado is important to implement practices of conservation. Recently, a 'rapid ecosystem function assessment' (REFA) for measuring ecosystem functions has been proposed and tested as a suitable method. Thus, this study aimed to assess the proxies of ecosystem functions of three physiognomies of Cerrado through REFA. This method was applied in three different preserved physiognomies of Cerrado from Northeastern, Brazil, namely: Campo Graminoide (CG), Cerrado Stricto Sensu (CSS), and Cerradoo (CD). All proxies for the selected ecosystem functions differed between sites and seasons. The above- and belowground primary productivity and microbial biomass C were higher in CD than in CSS and CG. The above- and below-ground secondary productivity and decomposition were higher and similar in CD and CSS as compared to CG. The principal component analysis explained 89.8% of the data variation and clustered the majority of ecosystem functions with CD, in both seasons and CSS in the wet season. The proxies of ecosystem functions measured through REFA showed differences between the physiognomies of Cerrado. Since each physiognomy of Cerrado presents different plant richness and diversity, and soil conditions, these characteristics contribute to influencing multiple ecosystem functions.

AB  - The characterization and cleanup of groundwater contamination in hazardous-waste sites are of significant engineering and scientific importance. This study analyzes biodegradation fingerprints in groundwater, 25 years after the accidental leakage of kerosene (jet fuel) at the site in central Serbia. The long-term existence of hydrocarbon contamination and the presence of indigenous microbiological populations capable of biodegradation have been confirmed by the results of GCxGC-MS chromatography and microbiological characterization. Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), geochemical indicators, and other parameters were spatially analyzed to provide insight into biodegradation occurrence. The lowest concentrations of electron acceptors (O-2, NO3-, and SO42-) and the highest concentrations of microbial metabolic products (Mn and Fe) overlap in the piezometers closest to the source of contamination, due to the occurrence of different biodegradation mechanisms. Based on the analysis of redox-sensitive compounds, the mixed oxic-anoxic processes in groundwater also correspond to the aforementioned zone, as confirmed by the redox potential (Eh) measurements. The results of cross-study analysis reveal further reduction of hydrocarbon contamination, the occurrence of less anoxic redox processes, and the increase of oxic conditions in groundwater. Overall, the results provide clear evidence of the biodegradation effects in groundwater and insight into their evolution under natural attenuation processes.

AB  - In 2015, the Expert Panel of the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association (FEMA) initiated a re-evaluation of the safety of over 250 natural flavor complexes (NFCs) used as flavor ingredients, mostly consisting of a variety of essential oils and botanical extracts. This publication, seventh in the series, re evaluates NFCs with constituent profiles dominated by phenolic derivatives including carvacrol, thymol and related compounds using a constituent-based procedure first published in 2005 and updated in 2018. The procedure is based on the chemical characterization of each NFC as intended for commerce and the estimated intake of the constituent congeneric groups. The procedure applies the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) concept and evaluates relevant data on absorption, metabolism, genotoxic potential and toxicology of the constituent congeneric groups and the NFC under evaluation. Herein, the FEMA Expert Panel affirmed the generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status of seven phenolic derivative based NFCs, Origanum Oil (Extractive) (FEMA 2828), Savory Summer Oil (FEMA 3013), Savory Summer Oleoresin (FEMA 3014), Savory Winter Oil (FEMA 3016), Savory Winter Oleoresin (FEMA 3017), Thyme Oil (FEMA 3064) and Thyme White Oil (FEMA 3065) under their conditions of intended use as flavor ingredients.

AB  - Photosynthesis is related to dry matter accumulation in aboveground part of rice plant, which is the direct factor of production. This study carried out research on physiological indicators and the relationship between photosynthesis and dry matter accumulation under different water management in paddy field. In general, the photosynthetic and physiological indicators showed the trend of increasing and then decreasing with the growth stage of rice. Experimental results showed that, chlorophyll content and leaf area index of rice leaves showed a quadratic curve positive correlation. Canopy light transmission reached the maximum at heading-flowering stage, and it had quadratic relationship with leaf area index, while it showed extremely positive correlation under rain-water storage irrigation mode. Photosynthetic rate (P-n) and transpiration rate (T-r) had quadratic curve positive correlation with chlorophyll content. The water condition under rain-water storage was favorable for dry matter accumulation in panicle. After multiple regression and main factor analysis, canopy light transmission, light transmission coefficient and P-n were main factors related to dry matter accumulation. The conclusions in this article were helpful for promoting rice yield in practice.

AB  - The development of tidal energy in Australia is still a challenge with few studies performed on the characterisation of the resource, due to the difficulty to acquire data and uncertainties about the influence of this anthropogenic activity on the marine environment. Changes in flow could lead to alterations in sediment transport and have further influence on the marine habitat. A case study in a promising area, Banks Strait (Australia), was created using high resolution 2D and 3D models validated against in situ data to investigate changes to hydrodynamic conditions with two scenarios of tidal farms (100 and 300 turbines). Comparison between 2D and 3D is performed to find the best compromise between model accuracy and computational time for preliminary assessment. Changes to current speed and bed shear stress over a 35 day period were found to be localised around the tidal farms and did not extent more than 7 km from the farm (300 turbines) for both 2D and 3D. The results showed that for near field and far field, 2D models are sufficient to give a first approximation of the hydrodynamic influence of tidal farm deployment on its environment.

AB  - In the nineteenth century, New Zealand and Uruguay were new European settler societies and rich in natural resources. Both countries engaged with the world economy as producers and exporters of livestock products. However, these countries exhibited divergent long-term development.
   The aim of this article is to identify the main historical tendencies associated with the relative physical productivity of livestock in both countries and to understand convergent-divergent processes in light of their technological trajectories.The main synthetic indicators used in agrarian sciences, such as Livestock Units and Meat Equivalents, are reviewed and a series of corrections that account for the specific features of each agrarian system is proposed for the usual aggregation methods.The technological trajectories that affected livestock productivity growth are also compared.
   The main results indicate that Uruguayan livestock production fell behind that of New Zealand due to the technological trajectory followed by each country. In the nineteenth century, Uruguay had very favourable natural conditions for livestock production. It did not develop technologies to improve soil and land productivity until the second half of the twentieth century. In contrast, New Zealand began to improve grassland productivity during the nineteenth century in order to increase and diversify livestock production.

AB  - In order to achieve homeostasis of soil, the potential of alleviating substances (two innovative: basalt flour and brown algae extract against two classic compounds: barley straw and compost) were analyzed in soil contaminated with cadmium. The studies thus determined the activity of urease, number of ammonification bacteria, nitrogen-immobilizing bacteria, Arthrobacter sp., Azotobacter sp., and spring barley yield. The analyzed parameters were presented as the following indices: RS - resistance of soil; EF - fertilization effect of an alleviating substance; and R:S - rhizosphere effect. Cadmium was applied as CdCl2 center dot 2.5H(2)O at the following doses: 0, 4, 40, 80, 120, 160, and 200 mg Cd2+/kg of soil. Straw increased the values of most examined parameters, mainly at lower doses of cadmium. Among the cultivated plants, resistance was most stimulated by compost. Basalt flour and brown algae extract did not play a major role in the recovery of contaminated soil. Ammonification bacteria were the least sensitive to stress associated with the deposition of cadmium in soil, whereas Azotobacter sp. was the most sensitive. Urease was found to be a reliable indicator of soil condition.

AB  - Agricultural management influences the physical, chemical and biological conditions of the soil, affecting soil quality, the productivity capacity of the agricultural system and its vulnerability to erosion process, frequently increasing it. The purpose of this work was to study the influence of two agricultural management systems on physical soil quality of a Rhodic Hapludox occurring in Campinas, State of Sao Paulo, and their effects not only on corn crop development and yield, but also on soil and nutrient loss by erosion. Two management systems were compared, named direct drilling system (DDS) and conventional system (CS), by applying them in experimental plots having runoff collectors to assess soil and nutrient losses by erosion. Soil physical and chemical attributes were also analyzed, as well as biometrical and yield data of the corn crop. The results indicate that agricultural management has differently influenced soil quality, and that soil physical indicators were better under the conventional system (CS). However, biometrical indicators, especially plant height, were superior under direct drilling system (DDS). There was also influence of agricultural management on erosion control, occurring greater soil losses and particularly larger phosphorous and organic matter losses from plots under conventional system (CS).

AB  - The interaction among building, environment, and socioeconomic matters, results in impacts as complex as the building process itself. A straight analysis of these impacts or effects must consider the whole building life-cycle, building products and building components. Also impacts are found in every level; from a local level, for example, the fingerprints a quarry leaves on the landscape, to a global level, i.e. CO 2 emissions due to energy consumption used to reach wealthy indoor conditions. Every impact must be considered differently in every level and phase.
   In the last years, indicator sets are drawn as appropriate tools in assessment methods for products, processes or activities. Nevertheless, the building process involves other singularities to be considered.
   Within the framework of the R&D National Plan Program, the project titled "Model of sustainable construction for the rehabilitation and protection of environmentally degraded or fragile zones: the Mining Valley of Laciana" (Garcia Navarro et al., 2005-2007) has developed a model following the sustainability criteria in construction, for buildings, existing infrastructures and landscapes in mining regions. This paper analyzes the application of indicator sets in this type of scenarios, and provides practical recommendations in order to develop integrating models or guidelines in the assessment, planning and management of these interventions.

AB  - Ozone (O-3) exposure at Italian background sites exceeds UN/ECE concentration-based critical levels (CLe(c)), if expressed in terms of AOT40. Yet the occurrence of adverse effects of O-3 on forests and crops is controversial. Possible reasons include (i) ability of response indicators to provide an unbiased estimate of O-3 effects, (ii) setting of current CLe(c) in terms of cut-off value and accumulation level, (iii) response functions adopted to infer a critical level, (iv) environmental limitation to O-3 uptake and (v) inherent characteristics of Mediterranean vegetation. In particular, the two latter points suggest that critical levels based on accumulated stomatal flux (CLe(f)) can be a better predictor of O-3 risk than CLec. While this concept is largely acknowledged, a number of factors may limit its applicability for routine monitoring. This paper reviews levels, uptake and vegetation response to O-3 in Italy over recent years to discuss value, uncertainty and feasibility of different approaches to risk assessment.

AB  - A high-resolution dinoflagellate cyst record is detailed for the very latest Holocene sediments preserved in a silled fjord from western Sweden. Koljo Fjord is characterised by brackish water conditions together with intermittent deep-water renewal and oxygen depletion. The data provide information derived from the phytoplankton populations living in the surface waters, including possible changes to the nutrient availability and salinity regimes using an actualistic ecological approach. The cyst record provides evidence that the dinoflagellate populations within the surface waters of the fjord over the last 155 years or so have fluctuated markedly. The dinoflagellate cyst record from Core KG1A demonstrates a 10-fold increase in both total cyst numbers and Lingulodinium polyedrum since c. 1938, and a shift from assemblages with high Pentapharsodinium dalei to those with high L. polyedrum and Protoceratium reticulatum from about 1980. These fluctuations are singly and/or collectively indicative of possible cultural changes within the fjord; the effects of the North Atlantic Oscillation on both deep-water renewal and seasonality; nutrient enhancement (eutrophication?); and increased water column stability.

AB  - In this paper we present results from a theoretical investigation of the scattering of microwave radar signal by the ocean surface. The aim of the research is to generate an improved altimeter wind speed retrieval algorithm, and to achieve this a new theoretical approach to the problem of microwave scattering has been developed. The inadequacy of the assumption of a single valued relationship between surface wind speed and microwave radar backscatter is discussed, and a more complex approach adopted taking into account the nature of the sea surface. Two versions of a two-parameter algorithm ( NA1 and NA2) for near surface wind speed retrieval are developed and presented in a tabular form. Co-located altimeter and buoy data are used to test this new algorithm. Good agreement is found between measured and retrieved values with the new algorithms: NA1 - the mean difference M= -0.03m s(-1) and rms= 1.47 m s(-1); NA2M= 0.03 m s(-1), rms= 1.54 m s(-1). Note, that the currently used algorithm WC91 (see below) has the following characteristics: M= 0.43 m s(-1) and rms= 1.69 m s(-1). The importance of taking into account the regional specific conditions is emphasized.

AB  - The mudrocks associated with the Gastrioceras listeri (G. listeri) Marine Band contain 0 to 200 ppm authigenic uranium. Several geochemical (degree of pyritisation (DOP), C/S ratios and framboidal pyrite size distribution) and palaeontological indicators (oxygen-restricted biofacies (ORB) analysis) suggest that the highest authigenic uranium concentrations are within marine sediments associated with the most oxygen-restricted biofacies (ORBs 2 and 3). The uranium peaks tend to occur at the transition between biofacies rather than within the middle of more persistently anoxic intervals. These horizons may have been deposited when the oxygen minimum zone impinged on the seafloor. Brief oxygenation of an otherwise anoxic environment was conducive to francolite precipitation, which then scavenged dissolved uranium. Slow sedimentation rates are also important in concentrating uranium and francolite. Thus, enriched U values are only encountered under specific conditions of low, but fluctuating, oxygen regime and extremely slow sedimentation rates. Truly euxinic facies. lacking any fossils, and a uniformly small framboid population do not contain high concentrations of francolite and are not U-rich. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Thirty-four Streptococcus thermophilus, 72 lactococci, 27 enterococci, 30 lactobacilli and 30 leuconostocs isolated from natural whey starters for water-buffalo Mozzarella cheese manufacture were screened for antagonistic activity. Antagonistic activity due to acidification was widespread among lactobacilli. No strain among these microorganisms as well as among Str. thermophilus or leuconostocs produced bacteriocins. Lactococci (16.7%) and enterococci (40.7%) were found to produce bacteriocin-like inhibitors in solid media. Four and three different types of bacteriocins, respectively, produced by lactococci and enterococci both on solid and liquid media could be differentiated by cluster analysis considering the inhibitory spectrum against 37 indicators, including lactic acid bacteria, spoilage and pathogenic organisms, cross-inhibition patterns, and sensitivity to heat and proteolytic enzymes. Some substances clearly differed from known bacteriocins. The lactococcins found are of great interest as potential food preservatives because of their activity towards Clostridium spp. Some enterocins showed interesting activity towards Listeria monocytogenes. Media for optimal bacteriocin production varied among strains. In the case of lactococcal strain 140, a surprisingly highly active bacteriocin was produced under all the conditions assayed.

AB  - The amount of waste activated sludge (WAS) is increasing annually, and since it presents potential environmental and health-related risks, an appropriate treatment and stabilization process is needed. It has been shown in numerous studies in the past few decades that amongst the advanced treatment methods of sludge, microwave and ultrasound-based processes offer promising and effective alternatives. The main advantage of these physical methods is that they are energy-efficient, easy to implement and can be combined with other types of treatment procedures without major difficulties. In this review article we would like to present the recent scientific results of the microwave, ultrasound and combined (microwave-alkaline, microwave-H2O2, ultrasound-alkaline and ultrasound-H2O2) treatment of wastewater sludge, in terms of different process-efficiency indicators. Although the obtained results somewhat vary between the different scientific papers, it can be undoubtedly stated that both MW and US-either individually or in combination with chemical treatments-can enhance several aspects of sludge processing, like increasing the SCOD/TCOD rate, disintegration degree (DD), or the anaerobic digestibility (AD), but the extent of these increments clearly depends on the treatment conditions or parameters.

AB  - Workers experiencing high levels of stress may suffer from poor motivation, low level of attention, and physical disorders which, in turn, may lead to work injuries. Respiratory frequency (f(R)) is considered one of the most reliable indicators of the mental load and fatigue state of workers. Monitoring this parameter through wearable devices represents an efficient solution for the maintenance of Occupational Health and Safety. We developed an innovative wearable system equipped with flexible sensors based on fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) to monitor f(R) in static and dynamic conditions characterizing occupational settings. This article provides a description of the system and of the metrological characteristics of the flexible sensors in terms of response to strain and temperature changes, and hysteresis error. The performances of the device, evaluated in a laboratory during the execution of tasks mimicking real work activity, are also reported. The obtained promising results encourage the engineering of the system for use in real workplaces to collect quantitative information on the psychophysical state of workers and its relation to stress level.

AB  - Although sclerotia are known as the resting bodies of fungi, the exact biochemical properties of melanized sclerotia that allow them to remain in the soil and retain their structure are unclear. This study aims to examine the mobility and accumulation of metals in melanin-pigmented sclerotia from low pH forest soils, focusing on Al, Cu, Zn, As, and Pb, and to discuss the regulating factors involved in element transfer from soil to sclerotia. Soil and sclerotia samples were collected from five sites, with soil samples analyzed for pH and element composition and sclerotium samples investigated in terms of element composition and C-14 age. Results from our study indicate that sclerotia may archive the mobilization and availability of metal ions such as Zn, Cu, As, and Pb, as well as major metal ions such as Al and Fe. Although availability and uptake are influenced by environmental conditions, the mechanism of Al accumulation in sclerotia may be abiotically promoted due to melanin in sclerotia found in forest soil. Sclerotia can be a bio-indicator of environmental pollution. Our study makes a significant contribution to environmental toxicology, as few studies have focused on accumulation of metals in each transfer step from soil to sclerotia.

AB  - Organic agriculture offers several options for documenting technological transitions towards new production models, although there are some controversies: low yields, access to standards, effective ecological balance, increased labour... By mobilizing different situations in sub-Saharan Africa, this thematic issue of Cahiers Agricultures provides information on these controversies. The presented papers illustrate how the organic agriculture defined by the standards of industrialized countries cannot reflect the diversity of African agricultural realities. As a result, the need for new certifications and applications for local companies is emerging. However, this emergence is constrained by the lack of comparative knowledge of productive realities between organic and conventional agriculture. Methodological innovations to reduce asymmetries in knowledge about performance comparison are then proposed. The results question the need for new indicators integrating nutrition and health security issues. They show that organic agriculture may also be a mean for increasing yields when the forest rent has been destroyed by export agriculture. While shedding light on the controversies, this thematic issue makes the hypothesis that, under certain conditions, organic agriculture is a breaking opportunity for a technological paradigm that meets the development issues in Africa. It invites us not to confuse this break with the mechanisms of agro-ecology-driven incremental transition.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyze the rate of sporulation, richness, and spore diversity of dematiaceous and Ingoldian fungi colonizing Typha latifolia leaves during a 40-day period of decomposition, as well as the loss of mass in Typha lantana, in four riverine wetlands of Pampean plain (Argentina) with different water quality. Higher sporulation rates, richness, and diversity of the fungi as well as loss of mass of the leaves that they colonized were associated with lower water quality. Anguilospora longissinza, Ardirinium sp., Margaritispora aquatica, and TricelluLa botryosa were dominant taxa. Redundancy analysis showed two fungal assemblages related to different environmental conditions. One assemblage was related to higher nutrient levels and higher temperature, characterized mainly by dematiaceous fungi. The other assemblage was related to higher levels of pH and dissolved oxygen, which was mainly represented by Ingoldian fungi. The results obtained in our study demonstrated the link between these fungal assemblages and changes in water quality, revealing their potential as indicators of environmental changes in rivers exposed to different types of land use.

AB  - THE EFFECT of water quality on the phytoplankton community was investigated in Mariut wetland, Egypt. Water samples were collected from the lake through five stations representing the four basins of the lake (northeast, northwest, southeast and southwest), in addition to Nubaria canal. Eighty-nine phytoplankton species, dominated with bacillariophytes and cyanophytes, were recorded. The northwest basin had the highest number of phytoplankton followed by the northeast basin, Nubaria canal, and the southeast and southwest basins. Holoplanktons dominated over tycoplanktons, meroplanktonic, and epiphetic algae. The dendrograms resulting from the agglomerative clustering technique based on water characteristics and phytoplankton composition had more or less the same trend. Moreover, the application of principal component analysis indicated that water pH, P, Cd, Zn and HCO3 were the most effective variables affecting the distribution of phytoplanktons. Cyanophytes were highly affected by K and salinity, while bacillariophytes were affected by water pH and Pb, euglenophytes by Ca and Mg and chlorophytes by P, Cu and Fe. The predominance of bacillariophytes in the lake indicates the tolerance of this group to the different pollution types, while cyanophytes prefer fresh water and dominates the least polluted wetlands.

AB  - Energy balance method is an effective and simple method which is used in the amplitude calculation of Aeolian vibration in transmission lines with Stockbridge damper. However, the accuracy of the results obtained by this method, heavily depends on the assumed mode shapes of the conductor vibration. In this study, by considering an appropriate model for the conductor vibration, a comprehensive methodology is presented to calculate the steady-state vibration amplitude of a conductor with arbitrary number of dampers. In this proposed method, the effects of traveling waves, variations of amplitude and phase, boundary conditions (finite length of the conductor), as well as the effect of number, location and impedance of the dampers are taken into account. Natural frequencies, damping rates and complex mode shapes are also obtained from forming and solving the nonlinear eigenvalue problem. Using this method, the effects of the damper placement on the vibration amplitude and bending strain are examined to achieve an optimum damper location. The comparison of the obtained values shows that considering the above parameters has a significant effect on the accuracy of the results.

AB  - An inventory of tree microhabitats was done in two unmanaged forests (Kobile and Ravna gora forest reserves) and one managed beech forest in SE Slovenia. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of forest management, natural disturbances, and tree characteristics on microhabitat patterns. Forest structure and microhabitats were recorded in systematically placed plots (500 m(2) in size) across each area. In total, we inventoried 849 trees on 54 plots and 1833 tree microhabitats. The results showed that forest management had no significant influence on the abundance of microhabitats per tree, but there were differences regarding microhabitat type between managed and unmanaged sites. There were substantially more microhabitats related to standing dead and live habitat trees in unmanaged forest (e.g. woodpecker cavities, insect galleries and bore holes, branch holes, dead branches and fruiting bodies of fungi), whereas in managed forests there were more tree microhabitats related to management (e.g. exposed heartwood, coarse bark, and epiphytic plants). The results also indicate that disturbance, tree diameter, vitality, and species influence the density, diversity, and occurrence of tree microhabitats.

AB  - This experiment takes the mass loss rate and relative dynamic elastic modulus as indicators to study the damage degradation process of black bricks in freezing-thawing environment and sulfate corrosion environment under pressure load, it compares and analyzes the characteristics of freezing-thawing damage and mutual influence of various failure factors. This paper also performs experimental research and theoretical analysis of the process of damage degradation of black bricks under action of freezing-thawing cycles. The study finds that under the action of only freezing-thawing factor, the relative dynamic elastic modulus of the black brick test piece decreases to about 0.60 after 80 cycles of freezing-thawing, reaching the failure criteria of the test piece. The coupling effect of the load and sodium sulfate accelerates the decline of the relative dynamic elastic modulus of the test piece under the action of freezing-thawing. Finally, this paper combines with the freezing-thawing fatigue damage equation model, through the number of indoor freezing-thawing cycles of the black brick, uses the Geographic Information System (GIS) software TopMap7 to draw various freezing-thawing life distribution maps of the black bricks under water freezing, load and salt freezing environment.

AB  - In order to asses and evaluate the ecological potential of dammed storage reservoirs we need insight into the spatial structure of their hydrodynamics. This structure is influenced by a number of internal and external factors that may depend on each other. To understand these factors better it is necessary to find dependencies between them, to develop methods and techniques of building scenarios that integrate spatial and temporal features of the subsequent hydrodynamic "states" of the reservoir. These scenarios are meant to be the physical base for any subsequent biochemical water quality assessment within the given reservoir. This article presents the basics of the proposed techniques along with their applications on two multi-purpose storage reservoirs located in southern Poland within the upper Vistula River catchment: Dobczyce and Goczalkowice. Preparing the observational data for their use in numerical models and the application of these models and a few preliminary results obtained for real-life issues regarding the chosen reservoirs are presented and discussed. The possibilities of generalizing the proposed techniques toward a methodology of hydrodynamic conditions assessment for improving the ecologic potential of dammed reservoirs is also briefly outlined.

AB  - In the semi-arid Mixteca Alta, Mexico, complex societies developed sophisticated terrace systems to control erosion and improve rain-fed agriculture. Knowledge regarding the agricultural systems has been crucial in understanding landscape construction through cultivation and social complexity. In this study six sequences on terrace systems were investigated. The samples were analyzed for bulk chemical, textural and micromorphological observations. Soils developed on terraces of the Yanhuitlan river (sequences Y04 and Y05) were dated, respectively, 5,300, 2,700 and 1,100 cal BP, suggesting a possible anthropic use since the early Formative period. These soils are composed of microstratified fine sediments of local origin, reflecting low energy during their deposition; they are weakly structured and developed in anoxic conditions due to saturation during terrace flooding. However, in these soils, a mixture of silt particles and charcoal fragments suggests the influence of anthropic use. On the other hand, sequences Y01 and Y02 are Pleistocene soils developed in an anoxic environment of a swampy landscape; their vertic properties may be related to dry seasonal periods. Knowledge of landscape genesis contributes to the assessment of anthropic impact in the area.

AB  - Microphytobenthos is potentially highly sensitive to environmental alterations, but has been rarely utilized in monitoring studies. Here we investigated the use of microphytobenthos colonizing Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) to assess the marine environmental quality. We analysed microphytobenthic assemblages in terms of abundance, biomass and species composition on ARMS deployed in northern Adriatic Sea along a gradient of increasing impacts. We show that microphytobenthic variables changed significantly across sites, with lowest abundance and biodiversity in the highly impacted site. Moreover, the specific analysis of Diatoms revealed that genera like Entomoneis and Cylindrotheca could be used as indicators of nutrient enriched and stressed conditions. We provide evidence that the analysis of microphytobenthos colonizing artificial substrates could be used as a tool for detecting altered environmental characteristics. We also show that the ARMS, recreating hot spots of microphytobenthic biodiversity, and protect them from grazing, could be potentially utilized to restore degraded hard substrates. Our result indicates that microphytobenthos can be easily incorporated in future monitoring and restoration programmes to assess and improve marine environmental health.

AB  - This article explores whether old, incumbent industries can prevent new, green industries from emerging by studying the rise and fall of the Norwegian advanced biofuel sector. It investigates three competing explanations that have been proposed to account for why Norway failed to develop a vibrant industry within this field: (i) the petroleum industry acquired all available risk capital, (ii) the petroleum industry captured all relevant technological expertise and (iii) the government failed to provide adequate incentives and support measures. The article applies a qualitative event-history analysis to chart the development of the most important Norwegian advanced biofuel companies - Borregaard (bioethanol), Cambi (biogas), Weyland (bioethanol) and Xynergo (biodiesel) - and uses their success and eventual failure as a key indicator of the condition of the emerging technological innovation system within this field. The article finds that the advanced biofuel companies were hampered mostly by inconsistent and unpredictable government incentives, and concludes that the third explanation best accounts for Norway's limited success in advanced biofuels.

AB  - Research suggests that heart rate variability (HRV) is a physiological indicator of the flexibility of the autonomic nervous system and can provide an objective measure of an individual's ability to appropriately match emotional responses to environmental demands. The present study investigated whether angry response to emotional stimuli was related to HRV, and whether manipulation of HRV using biofeedback could change the anger response in a healthy adult population. Fifty-eight participants received HRV biofeedback (n=29) or an active control condition (n=29). HRV measures included standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) power, and was recorded across three sessions: baseline, training, and anger induction. The anger induction procedure resulted in increased subjective experience of anger, as well as physiological changes. The biofeedback group had higher HRV than active controls both during the training session (SDNN and LF HRV) and during anger induction (LF HRV). HRV during anger induction was significantly associated with self-reported emotional response for participants receiving biofeedback but not for active controls. Results provide support for HRV as an index of emotion regulation, specifically anger. Further research is needed to determine whether long-term HRV biofeedback can have a lasting effect on managing anger.

AB  - Spatial and temporal variation of rotifers in Lake Sattal of Western Himalaya was studied from January 2011 to December 2012. A total of 22 rotifer species could be identified in the lake with a biannual mean abundance of 2.07 x 10(6) individuals/m(3) in eastern basin and 1.92 x 10(6) individuals/m(3) in western basin having maximum abundance during summer season. The main factors regulating distribution patterns of rotifers are nutrients, viz. NH4-N, PO4-P, NO2-N, and NO3-N, and turbidity, pH, and transparency. Six species of rotifers were deliberated as important species based on importance value index. Keratella quadrata, Colurella obtusa, and Asplanchna priodonta flourish under low turbid conditions. Philodina roseola demonstrated as a phosphorous-tolerant species, whereas K. quadrata and C. obtusa are thermophilous and their distributions are highly influenced by pH and transparency. The total organic matter (TOM) of the sediment has a significant positive correlation with species richness and diversity. The hierarchical environmental descriptor suggests water chemistry has a greater significant role in assemblages of rotifers as compared to sediment characteristics.

AB  - Choropleth representation has been the most widely applied method to represent rates in disease maps due to its consistency in depicting relative data. However polygons in a choropleth map may give the erroneous notion of homogenous distribution over area in cases where the mapped quantity varies in its spatial distribution. In the case of population maps, choropleth maps suggest uniform distribution of people within large peri-urban administrative areas where population is known to be unevenly distributed within the administrative units. Dasymetric mapping can provide a more accurate and detailed distribution of population data by using ancillary information to spatially disaggregate population within administrative units. We have developed a procedure to use more detailed fiscal cadastre blocks to disaggregate census data within less detailed enumeration and sample areas. Here we explain the procedure and provide simple examples of this dasymetric representation as applied to population density, socioeconomic and health indicators. This approach may help to identify fine-scale risk patterns of infectious and chronic diseases and associated socioeconomic or environmental risk factors. It is hoped that better visualization through this approach will help specialists in planning to reduce social injustice in complex urban environments.

AB  - This study evaluates the feasibility of industrial ethanol production from 10 agroindustrial residues in Colombia by considering production yields, profitability, and environmental impacts. For this analysis, sugar cane bagasse, banana stem, corncob, rice husk, sawdust, woodbark, mango wastes, palm residues, pineapple peel, and plantain peel were considered as feedstocks. For each residue, a techno-economic and environmental assessment was carried out using relevant data generated from process modeling. To do this, diluted acid pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis (using cellulases) of the lignocellulosic materials were selected as technologies. Besides, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia stipitis were selected as fermenting microorganisms under normal conditions. The production obtained from process modeling were compared with experimental ones from other authors. Yields between 0.009 and 0.264 kg of ethanol per kg of residue and production costs about $0.65 per liter of ethanol were obtained. Additionally, an average reduction of 39% on environmental impacts was obtained by the use of raw materials. Finally, it was found that four agroindustrial residues show profit margins and profitabilities of 40% over the cost of commercial raw materials in the process of ethanol production.

AB  - Global change alters the environment, including increases in the frequency of (un)favorable events and shifts in environmental noise color. However, how these changes impact the dynamics of populations, and whether these can be predicted accurately has been largely unexamined. Here we combine recently developed population modeling approaches and theory in stochastic demography to explore how life history, morphology, and average fitness respond to changes in the frequency of favorable environmental conditions and in the color of environmental noise in a model organism (an acarid mite). We predict that different life-history variables respond correlatively to changes in the environment, and we identify different life-history variables, including lifetime reproductive success, as indicators of average fitness and life-history speed across stochastic environments. Depending on the shape of adult survival rate, generation time can be used as an indicator of the response of populations to stochastic change, as in the deterministic case. This work is a useful step toward understanding population dynamics in stochastic environments, including how stochastic change may shape the evolution of life histories.

AB  - The development of drugs for photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an important area of research due to their growing use in medical applications. Therefore, it is important to develop new bioassay methods for PDT photosensitizers that are inexpensive, easy to handle and highly sensitive to environmental conditions. Xanthene dyes (fluorescein, rose bengal B, erythrosine B and eosin Y) with LED light sources were investigated using Artemia salina as a bioindicator of photodynamic activity. In this study, three factors were investigated: (i) photosensitizers concentration, (ii) the LED irradiation time and (iii) the waiting time between the addition of the photosensitizers and the beginning of the irradiation. To analyze the photo-killing of A. salina, it was employed a 23 full factorial design. The death of A. salina was related to dye structure and the interaction between the irradiation time and the photosensitizers concentration. About 60% of crustaceans death was obtained using rose bengal B, which presentes the highest quantum yield of singlet oxygen due to the number of iodide substituents in the xanthenes ring. The proposed bioassay using A. salina, xanthene dyes and LED irradiation was found suitable for quantitative PDT drug evaluation.

AB  - The implications of fin erosion and other injuries that are directly or indirectly caused by the hatchery environment have long been debated. Fin condition has been regarded as an indicator of welfare in fish farms, but until now there has been little evidence that eroded fins have negative effects on survival after stocking in the wild. Based on over 40 years of tagging and recapture data, we show that Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) with dorsal fin erosion and brown trout (Salmo trutta) with any kind of injuries had lower recapture rates than fish without injuries. In salmon, precocious mature males had a lower probability of being recaptured compared with immature fish. Data from a hatchery monitoring program indicated that the degree of fin erosion on the dorsal fin in salmon and on the caudal fin in trout was correlated with the number of other injuries. We conclude that fin erosion and other injuries may reduce the probability of survival after release. All actions in the hatcheries to reduce fin erosion and other injuries will most likely be positive for the long-term outcome of the stocking programs.

AB  - Different precipitation regimes across Patagonia generate an environmental gradient that is expected to reflect upon the solute composition and concentration of lake water through the ensuing differences in water balance. In turn, this hydrochemical gradient could influence the occurrence and distribution of ostracods in the area. A cluster analysis on hydrochemical data of 36 Southern Patagonian waterbodies shows that low salinity, bicarbonate-dominated waters characterize Andean and ecotonal lakes, located in the wetter part of the precipitation gradient, while their steppe counterparts, which receive a much lower precipitation input, are more saline, enriched in all major anions and sodium-dominated. Kruskal-Wallis tests followed by Mann-Whitney pairwise comparisons show statistically significant differences in the ostracod species each water type hosts, with L. patagonica, E. cecryphalium, P. smaragdina and P. incae being found in the more dilute waters characteristic of Andean and ecotonal lakes and Limnocythere rionegroensis in the mesohaline, evaporatively evolved waters typical of steppe lakes. Other species studied do not appear to have such distinct distributions, having been found throughout the range of conditions studied. These findings promote the use of the aforementioned ostracods as semi-quantitative paleohydrological indicators, which could improve paleoclimatic reconstructions in Patagonia.

AB  - Background: Outpatient scheduling has a significant impact on the perceived quality of service by the users and the efficient use of resources in the health system. There are mathematical methods that assist in solving this problem, but are seldom applied. Aim: To propose decision rules that are based on the own conditions of each institution and indicate which appointment system is the most suitable for the decision makers. Material and Methods: Through computer simulation, the effect of a wide range of decision and environmental factors over the appointment systems performance was assessed, in order to determine how these factors affect them. Results: Considering performance indicators associated to the patient's satisfaction and resources utilization, scheduling shorter length patients (e.g. check-up patients) in the beginning of the working day resulted to be in the efficient solutions frontier, as well as scheduling patients in one person blocks (shifting to multiple patient blocks only if resources utilization indicators are prioritized). Conclusions: Performance indicators are more sensitive to the sequence used to schedule different length patients, rather than the number of patients scheduled per block. Moreover, decision rules based on the institution priorities are proposed, which are quite robust to environmental factors. (Rev Med Chile 2012; 140: 867-872).

AB  - We have previously revealed that thimerosal. an organomercurial preservative, increases intracellular Zn2+ concentration in rat thymocytes. Because thimerosal contains ethylmercury that confers the toxicity, it is a possibility that methylmercury (MetHg). an environmental pollutant, also increases intracellular Zn2+ concentration This possibility was tested by measuring intracellular Zn2+ level with FluoZin-3. a fluorescent probe for intracellular Zn2+. MetHg at concentrations ranging from 100 nM to 1 mu M significantly increased the intensity of FluoZin-3 fluorescence, an indicator for intracellular Zn2+ concentration, under external Ca2+- and Zn2+-free condition in a concentration-dependent manner. TPEN, a chelator for intracellular Zn2+, completely diminished the MetHg-induced augmentation of FluoZin-3 fluorescence MetHg at 100 nM or more significantly decreased the intensity of 5-chlormethylfluorescein fluorescence, an indicator for cellular thiol content Such MetHg-induced changes in the fluorescence were correlated with a coefficient of -0.917. Taken together, it is suggested that submicromolar MetHg releases Zn2+ from intracellular thiol, resulting in the increase in intracellular Zn2+ concentration. However, it is unlikely that MetHg at critical maternal blood concentration (27 nM) affects intracellular Zn2+ homeostasis (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd All rights reserved

AB  - Autoinfection (within-host inoculum transmission) allows plant pathogens locally to increase their density on an infected host. Estimating autoinfection is of particular importance in understanding epidemic development in host mixtures. More generally, autoinfection influences the rate of host colonization by the pathogen, as well as pathogen evolution. Despite its importance in epidemiological models, autoinfection has not yet been directly quantified. It was measured here on wheat (Triticum aestivum) leaves infected by a pathogenic fungus (Puccinia triticina).
   Autoinfection was measured either on inoculated leaves or by assessing the local progeny of spontaneous infections, and was described by a model of the form y = mu x(alpha), where alpha accounts for host saturation and mu represents the pathogen multiplication rate resulting from autoinfection.
   It was shown that autoinfection resulted in typical patterns of disease aggregation at the leaf level and influenced lesion distribution in the crop during the first epidemic stages. The parameter mu was calculated by taking overdispersion of the data and density dependence into account. It was found that a single lesion produced between 50 and 200 offspring by autoinfection, within a pathogen generation.
   By taking into account environmental variability, it was possible to estimate autoinfection under optimal conditions for epidemic development.

AB  - In the context of the revision of the Ordinance of Ecological Quality of Ecological Compensation Areas in the Used Agricultural Area 2008 extensive pastures will get extra payment if they're ecologically valuable. The possible keys to assess the quality are all based at least partially on floristic indicator taxa. As the assessment should be objective, a pasture has to be assessed equally irrespective of the basic conditions. Therefore the robustness of the keys was tested in regard to the date of assessment, the altitude, the grazing and the density of vegetation. For that purpose vegetation surveys were done at three times from Mai 10(th) to August 15(th) on totally 31 sites in two different altitudinal levels. The ecological quality of the sites was then identified with the indicator taxa. With 4 % to 16 % wrongly assessed qualities, all tested keys were quite robust. Above 1000 m a.s.l. however with most keys fewer indicator taxa were found before June than on the two later dates. On contrary, below 800 m a.s.l. more indicator taxa were found between the middle of Mai and the beginning of June than on the two later dates. As long as this finding is taken into account, all keys can be recommended for the ongoing elaboration.

AB  - The objective of this work was to characterize iron oxides from B-horizons of three soil profiles developing on gneiss of the Bacao Complex geodomain in the Quadrilatero Ferrifero. Minas Gerais, Brazil. Samples were collected from the uppest, middle and lowest segments along the slope. The earth fine fractions (mean diameter, phi = 2 mm) were separated for all samples. The chemical composition of the major elements was determined with the X-ray fluorescence technique; the mineralogical analysis was performed with powder X-ray diffractomer and Mossbauer spectroscopy. All samples have similar mineralogical composition, with a general occurrence corresponding to the sequence quartz >> gibbsite > kaolinite > goethite. From the 4.2 K-Mossbauer results, the coexistence of goethite (major) and hematite is confirmed. The isomorphic aluminum contents, as they were deduced from the hyperfine fields, lead to the following chemical formulas for goethites: alpha Fe0.79Al0.21OOH (upslope), (alpha Fe0.75Al0.25OOH (midslope) and alpha Fe0.78Al0.22OOH (downslope). The iron oxides transformation dynamics in B horizons along the slope is a useful indicator of the paleo-climatic oscillations in this area: aluminous goethite is an indicator of humid paleo-environments, whereas aluminous-poorer goethite reveals drier pedogenic conditions.

AB  - The impact of disinfection efficacy in natural waters was evaluated by performing disinfection assays using four untreated surface waters of various qualities and ultra-pure buffered waters as a baseline condition for comparison. Bacillus subtilis spores were spiked in these waters and disinfection assays were conducted at 22 degrees C using either free chlorine or chlorine dioxide. Assays using indigenous aerobic spores were also completed. The inactivation kinetics in natural and ultra-pure buffered waters were not statistically different (at p = 0.05) while using free chlorine, as long as disinfectant decay was taken into account. Filtering natural waters through a 0.45 mu m did not improve the sporicidal efficacy of chlorine. For three out of the four waters tested, the efficacy of chlorine dioxide was greater in natural waters compared to that observed in ultra-pure buffered waters. Such results are consistent with previous observations using ultra-pure waters supplemented with NOM-extract from the Suwannee River. Similar to free chlorine results, the impact of filtration (0.45 mu m) on the efficacy of chlorine dioxide was not statistically significant. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Several palaeopathological indicators examined in skeletal samples are caused by stress during childhood and remain visible in adults. In this study, dental enamel hypoplasia was observed in 451 individuals from the Early Mediaeval (8th to beginning of 12th c. AD) Slavic skeletal series at Borovce (Slovakia). The presence of enamel hypoplasia was scored in all types of deciduous and permanent teeth. More than one-fourth (27.2%) of the individuals with preserved permanent teeth showed enamel hypoplasia. No significant differences in the occurrence of the enamel lesions were found between males and females. The age at development of hypoplasias was estimated for 74 individuals by measuring the distance of the defect from the cemento-enamel junction. The hypoplastic defects appeared most frequently between 2.5 and 3.0 years. Following the trends observed in the distribution of age at development of the enamel lesions between subadults and adults, individuals stressed earlier in life had a reduced ability to cope with later insults. High prevalence of enamel hypoplasia, especially among 10-14-year-old growing juveniles, has led to the assumption that the Borovce population lived a considerably long period under conditions of high environmental pathogen load, and probably also Suffered from some nutritional deficiencies.

AB  - During a large-scale ecosystem study on the south-east Australian shelf in spring 1994, we opportunistically sampled a widespread phytoplankton bloom. Thalassiosira partheneia, a small centric diatom, was the primary species in the bloom, indicating that we had sampled the early stage of a typical short-lived spring bloom for the area. Pigment analysis indicated four distinct communities that were coincident with the regional oceanography. The bloom was strongest over the northern shelf where the East Australian Current overlaid uplifted nutrient-rich slope water, but absent at inner stations on the wide southern shelf, where slope water did not reach. The bloom was patchy over the southern outer shelf where slope water was present to the surface and local conditions were influenced by topography. Pigment and stable isotope data indicated that primary production in this area was almost entirely oceanic. A slight trend for seaward enrichment of sediment delta C-13 is best explained by limited macroalgal growth in shallow waters. There was little fresh organic matter in the sediment even for stations under the bloom, suggesting that the bloom did not reach the seabed directly. The lack of specific zooplankton grazing pigments suggests that zooplankton grazing was minimal.

AB  - This research aimed to disentangle the role of the connectivity gradient as a dispersal and environmental filter. This was done by comparing community composition and plant strategies (i.e. competition, stress-tolerance and ruderal) in the soil seedbank (SSB) to that in the standing vegetation (SV). The study took place in a disconnecting side channel of the Loire River (France). SV was recorded in-situ and SSB was analyzed using the seedling emergence method. Seedbank density was 512.80 (SD = 329.43) seeds per m(2), species richness was similar in SSB and SV (42 and 43, respectively), and overall Sorensen similarity between both compartments was 0.45. Species composition in the soil seed bank differed between banks and thalweg while in SV it differed moreover along the side channel. With regard to Grime's C-S-R strategies, ruderal strategy dominated in the SSB, while environmental filters favored stress-tolerators in the SV. Usual indicators in seedbank studies (species richness, density and similarity) were inefficient to describe processes. Results moreover highlighted the prevalence of lotic over lentic conditions in structuring seedbanks and standing vegetation.

AB  - Quantifying bedrock weathering rates under diverse climate conditions is essential to understanding timescales of landscape evolution. Yet, weathering rates are often difficult to constrain, and associating a weathered landform to a specific formative environment can be complicated by overprinting of successive processes and temporally varying climate. In this study, we investigate three sites between 59 degrees N and 69 degrees N along the Norwegian coast that display grussic saprolite, tafoni, and linear weathering grooves on diverse lithologies. These weathering phenomena have been invoked as examples of geomorphic archives predating Quaternary glaciations and consequently as indicators of minimal glacial erosion. Here we apply cosmogenic nuclide chronometry to assess the recent erosional history. Our results demonstrate that all three sites experienced sufficient erosion to remove most cosmogenic nuclides formed prior to the Last Glacial Maximum. This finding is inconsistent with preservation of surficial (<1-2 m) weathered landforms under non-erosive ice during the last glacial period, while simultaneously demonstrating that post-glacial weathering and erosion rates can be locally rapid (4-10 cm kyr(-1)) in cold temperate to subarctic coastal locations.

AB  - Accurately mapping individual tree species in densely forested environments is crucial to forest inventory. When considering only RGB images, this is a challenging task for many automatic photogrammetry processes. The main reason for that is the spectral similarity between species in RGB scenes, which can be a hindrance for most automatic methods. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach to detect an important multi-use species of palm trees (Mauritia flexuosa; i.e., Buriti) on aerial RGB imagery. In South-America, this palm tree is essential for many indigenous and local communities because of its characteristics. The species is also a valuable indicator of water resources, which comes as a benefit for mapping its location. The method is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify and geolocate singular tree species in a high-complexity forest environment. The results returned a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.75 trees and an F1-measure of 86.9%. These results are better than Faster R-CNN and RetinaNet methods considering equal experiment conditions. In conclusion, the method presented is efficient to deal with a high-density forest scenario and can accurately map the location of single species like the M. flexuosa palm tree and may be useful for future frameworks.

AB  - This study aimed to demonstrate the effects of forest-derived visual, auditory, and combined stimulation on brain activity, autonomic nervous system activity, and subjective spatial impressions. The participants included 20 Japanese female university students (age 22.1 +/- 1.8 years). Each participant viewed a gray image for 60 s with no sound (rest period), followed by an image of a forest scene with no sound (visual stimulation), a gray image with forest sounds (auditory stimulation), an image of a forest scene with forest sounds (combined stimulation), and a gray image with no sound (control) for 90 s. As indicators, near-infrared spectroscopy, heart rate variability measurement, heart rate monitoring, and modified semantic differential method were used. Compared to the control condition, combined stimulation significantly decreased oxyhemoglobin (oxy-Hb) concentrations in both prefrontal cortices and increased parasympathetic nervous activity, reflecting a relaxed state; visual and auditory stimulation significantly decreased the oxy-Hb concentration in the right prefrontal cortex; and "comfortable," "relaxed," "natural," and "realistic" feelings increased significantly for all stimulations. In conclusion, forest-derived visual, auditory, and combined stimuli induced physiologically and psychologically relaxing effects, and physiological relaxation was more pronounced under combined stimulus.

AB  - The main objective of the article is an attempt to identify factors/determinants conditioning the development of enterprises in Poland in recent years. The author will also try to indicate the dominant behaviours related to the notion of entrepreneurship among the owners of the enterprises under study. In addition to the literature analysis, the author chosea survey in the form ofa structured interview with business owners as another research method - the survey was carried out in 2015 and 2017 and in 2019/2020 in 200 purposively selected enterprises from the SME sector, which are based in Poland and were established in the last 5 years. After the analysis of the literature and the results of the conducted survey, obviously bearing in mind its pilot character, the author clarified the names of the selected indicators/determinants and expanded their list by those he considered useful from the point of view of the general purpose of the survey - 9 indicators/determinants. In the author's opinion, the developed indicators/determinants make it possible to assess the level of enterprise development (direction and pace of changes) depending on selected factors of the local and institutional environment, internal factors, the level of achieved financial results, sources of financing.

AB  - Strong institutions as well as economic development are gener-ally understood to play critical roles in protecting societies from the adverse impacts of natural hazards, such as tropical cyclones. The independent effect of institutions on reducing these risks, however, has not been confirmed empirically in previous global studies. As a storm's path and intensity influence the severity of the damages and may be spatially correlated with human vulnerabilities, failing to accurately capture physical exposure in an econometric analysis may result in imprecise and biased estimates of the influence of the independent variables. Here, we develop an approach to control for physical exposure by spatially interacting meteorological and socioeconomic data for over 1,000 tropical cyclone disasters from 1979 to 2016. We find evidence that higher levels of national government effectiveness are associated with lower tropical cyclone mortality, even when controlling for average income and other socioeconomic conditions. Within countries, deaths are higher when strong winds are concentrated over areas of the country with elevated infant mortality rates, an indicator of institutional effectiveness through public service delivery. These results suggest that policies and programs to enhance institutional capacity and governance can support risk reduction from extreme weather events.

AB  - The assimilation of technologies and their adaptation to the territories, taking advantage of the scientific potential and resources available for the development of high value-added products that contribute to the substitution of imports, were the fundamental premises on which the insertion of the production processes of native and modified starches and other products based on Manihot esculenta Crantz (cassava) that were developed in this research is based. The technological impacts generated by the effective combination of process development and technological assimilation, applicable as a procedure to the agro-industry in general and validated for the processing technologies of the cassava assortments, were analyzed. The technical-economic feasibility studies were carried out, determining the necessary conditions for the achievement of positive profitability indicators. It was demonstrated the advantage that these products represent for the substitution of imported additives in the food industry, the possibility of the immediate introduction of the results in the productive processes and the environmental compatibility. The study is relevant to address the issue of substitution of stabilizing additives in food production, mainly ice cream, with a high impact by the possibilities of increasing supply, the quality of the basic basket, the substitution of imports and the generation of exports.

AB  - The aim of this research is to establish proper external and internal conditions for conducting pedagogical activity that reveal the value basis of professional education. The research justifies the need to analyse the guidelines of a person's professional self-identity, contents of professional activity motivation, peculiarities of maintaining the mental and physical health of a person, and the capacity of an educational institution's organisational culture. A number of indicators of value mechanisms of a teacher's professional longevity is revealed. A diagnostic program of the project, aimed at studying the value content of a teacher's behaviour strategies during the process of professional activity, was designed. The content of the hypothesis is connected with the assumption of value-semantic inter-conditionality of professional longevity. The research revealed significant interrelations of professional longevity with some psychological factors of value-semantic nature. Analysis of the organisational culture of an educational institution as a factor providing (preventing) the professional longevity of a teacher was carried out. The dominant tendency of describing the interconnection between an educational institution's organisational culture and the level of emotional burnout syndrome of teachers working within certain cultural models is revealed.

AB  - The performance of the Operable Building Integrated Photovoltaic (OBIPV) system applied to the building envelope to reduce the building energy consumption varies significantly depending on the operation method and influence of the surrounding environment. Therefore, optimization through performance monitoring is necessary to maximize power generation of the system. This study used temperature-corrected normalized efficiency (NE*) to evaluate the power generation performance of the operation methods and predict that of the OBIPV system based upon the measured data. It was confirmed that power generation performance decreased when the photovoltaic (PV) operation angle changed, the system remaining the same. A decrease in power generation performance due to partial shading from an overhang was also observed. As a result of the power generation prediction for two months using NE*, the error of the measured values was found to be less than 3%. In addition, with or without any partial shading of the OBIPV system, its performance degradation was predicted with an annual electricity generation decrease by 36 kWh/yr (6.5%). Therefore, NE* can be used as an indicator for evaluating the power generation performance of PV systems, and to predict generation performance considering partial shading.

AB  - A bioclimatic substantiation of the spatial structure of vegetation of the Kodar-Kalar orobiome has been carried out based on altitudinal zonation of the vegetation and using the global climate model (BioClim) and data obtained from weather stations. The results show that mean annual temperatures and mean annual precipitation can be used to identify altitudinal vegetation belts and subbelts of the orobiome. Based on the quantitative data, such as the heat and moisture supply indices and derived parameters (potential evapotranspiration, Mezentsev's moisture coefficient), a climatic ordination of geographic-genetic vegetation complexes has been performed for the Northern Transbaikalia for the first time. A scheme determining the vegetation diversity in the Kodar-Kalar orobiome has been proposed with allowance for vegetation development in various geographical variants within the integral system of bioclimatic factors. According to this system, vegetation complexes are differentiated according to the heat-supply and moisture-supply gradients. A complex analysis of bioclimatic characteristics has identified specific regional features in the structure and diversity of the vegetation of the Northern Transbaikalia mountain systems that confirm the contingency of the biota and abiotic conditions within orobiomes as the ecosystem complexes established at the regional level.

AB  - Context: The stress undergone by sugar cane during the seedling strengthening stage may be caused by various reasons, such as pest infestation, nutritional deficiencies, and mechanical damages due to manipulation that leads to the loss of genetic material.
   Objective: To evaluate the effect of five biostimulants on sugar cane seedling strengthening and resistance to transplantation.
   Methods: A completely randomized experimental design with six treatments (absolute control and samples with the application of azotobacter, phosphorine, improved natural liquid humus, and mineral-fortified liquid humus (BoCalZn), and four repetitions, was used. The seedlings were placed on a 60-well tray filled with a mix of soil and filter cake. Seven foliar applications were made between days 7 and 56 following transplantation. Plant height and thickness, foliar area, root length, number of active roots, and fresh and dry weights were evaluated 50 days after. For evaluation of resistance to transplantation, the strengthened seedlings were placed in the field, and 45 days later, their survival percentage was determined.
   Results: The positive effects of the biostimulants applied were observed on the morphophysiological indicators.
   Conclusions: The application of biostimulants showed the positive effect on the morphophysiological indicators evaluated. The best transplantation resistance of the mineral-fortified liquid humus (BoCalZn) was observed in field conditions.

AB  - The present study is a holistic approach to the relationship between volcaniclastic host rock characteristics and the fossilization processes of short leafy coniferous branches of Squamastrobus tigrensis, preserved as fossilized-cuticles (Lower Cretaceous, Baquero Group, Patagonia, Argentina). The question of diagenetic influences of Aptian volcaniclastic sedimentation on preservation chemistry and taphonomic processes is addressed. Whereas infrared spectroscopy provided chemical information on the leaves, vitrinite reflectance and complementary thermal indicators provided data on the thermal maturity of the dispersed organic matter in the host rock. Three sample types were analyzed: fossilized-cuticle, macerated fossilized-cuticle (by infrared spectroscopy), and associated organic host rock matter (by light microscopy). Results clearly show chemical variability between, and within the fossilized-cuticle and cuticle, as well as a similarity to type I/II kerogen, i.e., high contents of both aliphatic groups and oxygen-containing compounds. Combined with the lower maturity of the host rock, the importance of the depositional environment during burial and taphonomic conditions that affected the fossilization of S. tigrensis arc summarized in a general fossilization model.

AB  - Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a major rodent-borne zoonosis. Each year worldwide, 60,000-100,000 HFRS human cases are reported in more than seventy countries with almost 90% these cases occurring in China. Shaanxi Province in China has been among the most seriously affected areas since 1955. During 2009-2013, Shaanxi reported 11,400 human cases, the most of all provinces in China. Furthermore, the epidemiological features of HFRS have changed over time. Using long-term data of HFRS from 2005 to 2016, we carried out this retrospective epidemiological study combining ecological assessment models in Shaanxi. We found the majority of HFRS cases were male farmers who acquired infection in Guanzhong Plain, but the geographic extent of the epidemic has slowly spread northward. The highest age-specific attack rate since 2011 was among people aged 60-74 years, and the percentage of HFRS cases among the elderly increased from 12% in 2005 to 25% in 2016. We highly recommend expanding HFRS vaccination to people older than 60 years to better protect against the disease. Multivariate analysis revealed artificial area, cropland, pig and population density, GDP, and climate conditions (relative humidity, precipitation, and wind speed) as significant risk factors in the distribution of HFRS.

AB  - The seafloor sediments of Spathi Bay, Milos Island, Greece, are part of the largest arsenic-CO2-rich shallow submarine hydrothermal ecosystem on Earth. Here, white and brown deposits cap chemically distinct sediments with varying hydrothermal influence. All sediments contain abundant genes for autotrophic carbon fixation used in the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) and reverse tricaboxylic acid (rTCA) cycles. Both forms of RuBisCO, together with ATP citrate lyase genes in the rTCA cycle, increase with distance from the active hydrothermal centres and decrease with sediment depth. Clustering of RuBisCO Form II with a highly prevalent Zetaproteobacteria 16S rRNA gene density infers that ironoxidizing bacteria contribute significantly to the sediment CBB cycle gene content. Three clusters form from different microbial guilds, each one encompassing one gene involved in CO2 fixation, aside from sulfate reduction. Our study suggests that the microbially mediated CBB cycle drives carbon fixation in the Spathi Bay sediments that are characterized by diffuse hydrothermal activity, high CO2, As emissions and chemically reduced fluids. This study highlights the breadth of conditions influencing the biogeochemistry in shallow CO2-rich hydrothermal systems and the importance of coupling highly specific process indicators to elucidate the complexity of carbon cycling in these ecosystems.

AB  - This paper describes grass lawn wetlands, which are wetlands subjected to dynamic conditions, particularly highly fluctuating water tables that regularly drop deep below the ground surface. This occurs mostly in flood-plain wetlands, as well as in wetlands in semi-arid regions or coastal plains. These wetlands are often dominated by short lawn grasses, particularly Cynodon dactylon, while other life forms, from taller tufted sedges to trees and shrubs, occur less frequently. A subset of data from a nationwide survey of wetland vegetation representing these grass lawn wetlands was selected for analysis using clustering and ordination techniques. Thirty-seven wetland communities are described and are further summarized into 13 community groups. Wetland communities on the coastal plains were associated with sandy soils whereas most of the other communities had a high clay fraction. Grass lawn wetlands are commonly found in a zone along the central, semi-arid part of the country and for this reason will likely play an important role in wetland monitoring in the long term.

AB  - We studied the morphological and biochemical changes of mitochondria-rich cells (MRCs) of a demersal teleost, Paralichthys olivaceus, during exposure to 0.98, 2.97 and 4.95 kPa pCO(2). The apical opening area of MRCs increased 2.2 and 4.1 times by 24 h exposure to 2.97 and 4.95 kPa pCO(2), respectively, while the cross-sectional area or density of MRCs did not change. Gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity more than doubled at 72 h and then returned to the pre-exposure level at 168 h in 0.98 kPa pCO(2), while it increased 1.7 times at 24 h at 4.95 kPa. These results indicate that the apical opening area of MRCs and the gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity may be used as an indicator of acute (up to 72 h), but not chronic, impacts of high (>1 kPa) seawater CO2 conditions in P. olivacues. Limitations of those parameters as indices of CO2 impacts are discussed. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Vulnerability to climate change of the Moldavian part of the Dniester river was assessed as the function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of its basin's natural and socioeconomic systems. As a spatial "scale" of the assessment, Moldova's administrative-territorial units (ATUs) were selected. The exposure assessment was based on the climatic analysis of baseline (1971-2000) temperature and precipitation and projections of their changes in 2021-2050, separately for cold and warm periods. The sensitivity assessment included physiographical and socioeconomic characteristics, described by a set of specific indicators. The adaptive capacity was expressed by general economic and agricultural indicators, taking into consideration the medical provision and housing conditions. Through a ranking approach, the relative vulnerability of each ATU was calculated by summing its sensitivity and adaptive capacity ranks; the latter were obtained as combinations of their primary indicator ranks, arranged in an increasing and decreasing order, respectively. Due to lack of sound knowledge on these components' importance in overall assessment of vulnerability, their weights were taken as conventionally equal. Mapping of vulnerability revealed that ATUs neighboring to municipalities are the most vulnerable and need special attention in climate change adaptation. The basin's "hotspots" were discussed with public participation.

AB  - Bikaverin is a polyketide-derived pigment produced by multiple species of the fungus Fusarium, some of which can cause ear and kernel rot of maize. A method was developed for the analysis of bikaverin by high-performance liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The quantitative nature of the LC-MS/MS method was demonstrated over a range of concentrations of bikaverin in maize. For spike-recovery experiments utilising maize spiked with bikaverin to a level 5 mu g g(-1) of maize, the measured recovery (%) was 70.6 +/- 10.4. Based on the utilised method, the limit of detection (based on a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) >3) was better than 0.5 mu g g(-1) from bikaverin spiked into uncontaminated ground maize. Further, the limit of quantitation (LOQ) was 3 mu g g(-1) (based on S/N >10) from bikaverin spiked into ground maize. The method was applied to assess contamination of maize with bikaverin following inoculation of developing maize ears with Fusarium verticillioides under agricultural field conditions.

AB  - A description of the future as it might be without forecasts, predictions and trend analysis can be referred to as a 'sfuture scenario'. An abundance of scenarios literature exists in which numerous pictures have been painted of changed future worlds. However, upon closer inspection it becomes apparent that virtually all of this literature refers to changes occurring above ground, ignoring the inevitable consequences (or opportunities) for sustainable use of underground space, not least in densely populated urban areas, some of which may be underlain by complex geological conditions. This paper reports on the development (to date) of an 'Urban Futures' (UF) toolkit for sub-surface environments (including infrastructure and utilities) which, through use of 'key' questions 'sustainable' indicators and a 'contextual' narrative, allows for better definition and measured performance of underground space in the UK, both today and in the future. The toolkit explores possible uses for underground space within 4 plausible and well-cited future scenarios (i.e. New Sustainability Paradigm, Fortress World, Market Forces and Policy Reform). This forms part of a much larger generic toolkit which the UF research team are developing for exploring possible future scenarios over a range of UK urban regeneration case study areas.

TI  - Strategic Environmental Assessment of Mining Activities: A Methodology for Quantification of Cumulative Impacts on the Air Quality
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION
LA  - English
AB  - Environmental impact assessments in Brazil have usually focused solely on project-related issues without considering the regional context. Although required by current environmental legislation, cumulative impact assessments have not been included in the overall environmental assessment of projects. However, in recent Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) studies of policies, plans, and programs undertaken on a voluntary basis in support of the decision-making process, this kind of assessment has been performed especially with respect to air quality. This paper presents the application of a methodology for the quantification of cumulative impacts on air quality under high uncertainty caused by various mining activities in a single region that is recommended for SEA studies. In this way, the methodology presented here is suitable for areas lacking detailed modeling information. The developed approach uses a relatively simplified mathematical model, lowering information gathering costs and requiring little processing time. The application of the methodology is illustrated in the case of a SEA of the Corumba Mining and Industrial Complex Development Program. Despite the lack of data needed for a minimum characterization of conditions of the area surrounding the region modeled, the quantification of impact cumulativeness on air quality has played an important role in the context of the SEA.

AB  - The diversity and distribution patterns of soil nematode communities in phaeozem agroecosystems of Northeast China were assessed to evaluate nematode taxonomic diversity and functional diversity in relation to climatic condition and soil characteristics in human modified landscape. Along the latitudinal gradient, soil samples were collected from north (Hailun) to south (Gongzhuling) down to a depth of 100 cm with intervals of 0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80, and 80-100 cm. The nematode abundance and taxonomic diversity (generic richness) were lower at Hailun than at other sites, and higher values of evenness were observed at Hailun and Harbin than at Dehui and Gongzhuling. Nematode faunal analysis revealed that soil food web at Hailun was successionally more mature or structured, and the environment little disturbed, while at Harbin and Gongzhuling, the soil food web was degraded with stressed environment. The environmental variables relevant in explaining the patterns of nematode distribution and diversity in phaeozem agroecosystems, using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), were the mean annual temperature, total nitrogen, electrical conductivity, mean annual precipitation, and other soil properties. Among these variables, the mean annual temperature was a relatively important factor, which could explain 29.05% of the variations in nematode composition.

AB  - The objectives of this research were to evaluate and compare five configurations of wastewater treatment for on-site or communal applications in various climate conditions: a peat filter, a sand filter, a subsurface flow constructed wetland cell, a peat filter followed by a wetland cell, and a sand filter followed by a wetland cell. Oxygen demand, nitrogen and phosphorus compounds, temperature, and indicator bacteria of the influent and effluent of each treatment stage were monitored over a period of 17 months. The sand and peat filters achieved over 98% reduction in carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand (CBOD5) to <1 mg/L (below detection limits) in most samples. The filters also reduced all indicator bacteria parameters to low levels. Phosphorus removal through the sand filter consistently exceeded 98% but declined rapidly after 14 months, likely due to saturation. Phosphorus reduction in the peat filter averaged 47% with an additional 58% provided by the wetland cell (total 78%); no saturation trend was apparent by the 17th month. The total nitrogen reductions were low initially but improved over time in both filters. The wetland cell provided low to moderate treatment efficiencies for CBOD5 (49%), phosphorus (33%), indicator bacteria (similar to 2 log reduction), and total nitrogen (31%).

AB  - Using a wide range of different methods, researchers have found that the environment inside reverse micelles differs from bulk aqueous solution in many ways. Here, we present a new tool, a series of aqueous oxovanadium(V) reactions, to probe pH, viscosity, and ionic strength in the aqueous interior of reverse micelles. In addition to their potential as anionic probe analogues to phosphates, simple oxovanadium(V) compounds have equilibrium characteristics in aqueous media exquisitely sensitive to their environment. Therefore, the speciation of vanadate equilibria can be used as a parameter to characterize the intramicellar medium. Vanadate speciation is monitored through V-51 NMR spectroscopy, which also yields information through chemical shifts and linewidths of spectral features. The speciation observed suggests that the relative acidity of a basic vanadate stock solution is slightly reduced in large, w(0) >= 12, reverse micelles, but that for smaller reverse micelles, speciation reflects the strong interaction of these negatively charged oxometalates with the reverse micelle and suggest an increased solution viscosity in the reverse micelles. This interpretation is obtained through different responses closely linked to the reverse micellar size and the specific conditions in the stock solutions used to form reverse micelles.

AB  - The effects of weathering on the organic matter within a narrow sediment interval from surficial to 10 m depth belonging to the Lower Toarcian shales of the Paris basin, were studied at a molecular level. Among the compositional changes observed, the most striking feature is a severe breakdown of the metalloporphyrins (Ni and VO) at the surface, as evidenced by quantitative data. In addition, this degradation of the geoporphyrins is accompanied by substantial modification of their composition with preferential degradation of porphyrins with exocyclic rings over polyalkylporphyrins. These quantitative and qualitative changes are thought to result from exposure of the sediment to weathering conditions. More specifically, abiotic oxidation is likely to be the main weathering process responsible for this superficial alteration of the sedimentary porphyrins. This is particularly suggested by oxidation experiments carried out on a mixture of sedimentary nickel and vanadyl porphyrins where oxidation of the former complexes occurs at a faster rate. Thus, geoporphyrins may be used as molecular indicators to evaluate the degree of oxidation of weathered geological samples containing this kind of molecule. Copyright (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study addresses the question of what diatom taxa to include in a modem calibration set based on their relative contribution in a palaeolinmological calibration model. Using a pruning algorithm for Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) which determines the functionality of individual taxa in terms of model performance, we pruned the Surface Water Acidification Project (SWAP) pH-diatom data-set until the predictive performance of the pruned set (as assessed by a jackknifing procedure) was statistically different from the initial full-set. Our results, based on the validation at each 5% data-set reduction, show that (i) 85% of the taxa can be removed without any effect on the pH model calibration performance, and (ii) that the complexity and the dimensionality reduction of the model by the removal of these non-essential or redundant taxa greatly improve the robustness of the calibration. A comparison between the commonly used "marginal" criteria for inclusion (species tolerance and Hill's N2) and our functionality criterion shows that the importance of each taxon in an ANN palaeolimnological model calibration does not appear to depend on these marginal characteristics.

AB  - Sediment cores from tributaries, marshes and the main stem of Chesapeake Bay were analyzed for paleoecological indicators of climate change and land use. Indicators include pollen and seeds of terrestrial and aquatic plants, diatoms, charcoal, nutrients, and trace metals. Two major events, one climatic and the other anthropogenic, occur-red within the last millennium. The Medieval Climatic Anomaly and the Little Ice Age are recorded in Chesapeake sediments by terrestrial indicators of dry conditions for 200 years, beginning about 1000 years ago, followed by increases in wet indicators from about 800 to 400 years ago. There were no corresponding shifts in estuarine diatoms and seeds of submerged macrophytes. During the last few centuries following European settlement, deforestation and agriculture have resulted in the transport of large sediment and nutrient loads to estuarine waters. The terrestrial flora shifted from arboreal to herbaceous, and much of the estuarine benthic biota was replaced by pelagic species. These changes had a profound effect on the Chesapeake fishery. In assessing risks associated with climate change, it must be recognized that changes wrought by human activity are likely to influence effects of future climate change, in ways not evident from the fossil record.

AB  - Samples of plankton. surface sediments and Holocene deposits from the South Alligator River, an energetic macrotidal river in northern Australia, are examined to evaluate the usefulness of estuarine foraminifers for palaeoenvironmental interpretation of sediments deposited in tropical macrotidal conditions. Although marine and estuarine foraminifers in the estuarine channel are mixed by strong tidal currents, there are significant trends along the 80-km length of the tidal river. The relative proportions of marine and porcellaneous taxa decrease upstream from the mouth, but hyaline taxa and those with brackish affinities increase upstream. Foraminifers in intertidal sediments have distinctly different assemblages in the uppermost intertidal, mid-tidal (mangrove), lower intertidal and subtidal zones, In addition to the effects of tidal mixing, preserved thanatacoenoses are affected by selective dissolution and/or pyritisation within the sediment bodies, Despite the effects of adverse taphonomic factors. foraminiferal assemblages preserved in drill cores provide an accurate guide to original depositional environments (intertidal/subtidal; brackish estuarine/coastal marine), in mid-Holocene sediments in the South Alligator area. Foraminifers are found to improve the precision of previous palaeoenvironmental reconstructions made on the basis of sedimentary facies and pollen analyses. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA.

AB  - Recent requirements for biomonitoring of urban stormwater runoff have raised the issue of toxic contributions from mosquito control products. A comparison of seven pesticides for their toxicity to target and nontarget organisms was conducted in field and laboratory trials to determine relative impacts in and around Craighead County, Arkansas. Twenty-four and forty-eight-hour acute toxicity tests using Ceriodaphnia dubia, Daphnia magna, Daphnia pulex, and Pimephales promelas were employed with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) suggested procedures as standard test organisms. Additional tests with resident mosquito fish, Gambusia affinis, and mosquito larvae, Anopheles quadrimaculatus, included ditch-receiving waters to compare the somewhat sterile laboratory exposures to actual field conditions. Exposure to as much as 31.4 mu g/L of the pesticides Dursban(R), malathion, Permanone(R), Abate(R), Scourge(R), B.t.i, and Biomist(R) were required for effective control of An. quadrimaculatus, whereas as little as 2.7 mu g/L resulted in substantial mortality of some nontarget organisms. These data suggest that prevailing application rates for effective mosquito control not only affect nontarget organisms but may also confound stormwater and nonpoint toxicity evaluations that utilize sensitive indicator species.

AB  - The pathogen Escherichia coli O157:H7 has been recovered from various water sources and food samples. The growth potential of this bacterium in nutrient-limited, reconditioned wastewater from a pork-processing plant was determined over a temperature range of 4 to 46 degrees C. Even though the biological oxygen demand of the wastewater was <2 mg/liter, results of bioassays for assimilable organic carbon and the coliform growth response of the water suggested that sufficient nutrients were present to support limited bacterial growth. A three-strain mixture of E. coli O157:H7 grew over the temperature range of 10.2 to 29.4 degrees C. Bioassays appear to be a good indicator of the ability of this wastewater to support growth of this pathogen. Statistically higher levels of bacterial growth (P < 0.05) were detected on a nonselective medium (tryptic soy agar) than on a selective medium (sorbitol-MacConkey agar), suggesting that stress or injury of the bacterium occurs when the organism is exposed to the nutrient-limited conditions of the wastewater. These results indicate that E. coli O157:H7 can survive and grow in this particular nutrient-limited wastewater suggesting a potential hazard if this water becomes contaminated with this pathogen.

AB  - The record of paleoenvironmental change retained within thin sections from loess-paleosol sequences is discussed with reference to case studies from western Europe, China and northwestern USA. The paleoenvironmental significance of individual micromorphological features such as calcitic concentrations, clay coatings and cryogenic structures are first evaluated, and the value of recognising and interpreting microstratigraphic relationships of features in terms of paleoenvironmental change is illustrated, Recent developments have seen a greater emphasis on using micromorphology within a pedosedimentary approach, whereby both pedogenic and sedimentary processes are taken into account when interpreting loess-paleosol sequences. This has led not only to the acquisition of important information on conditions during phases of enhanced loess accretion and periods of climatic transition, but also to an increased awareness of spatial changes in processes and environmental controls during particular time periods, Micromorphologically based reconstructions have enabled the isolation of key stages of pedosedimentary development, although absolute dating of stages is often limited by lack of age controls. A novel approach aimed at addressing this limitation, afforded by presence of datable tephra in microstratigraphic association with key micromorphological features, is discussed.

AB  - The effects of fenvalerate exposure on the net-spinning behaviour of Hydropsyche siltalai were examined in a laboratory study. The larvae were exposed to nominal pulse-doses of 0.25 and 0.5 mu g fenvalerate l(-1). Nets were collected and examined for anomalies after four days of exposure to fenvalerate. Additional nets were collected after another four day of exposure. The fenvalerate dissipated rapidly from the water column, and since only two doses of fenvalerate were given, the larvae were exposed to two pulse-doses of fenvalerate rather than to a constant concentration. In the 0.5 mu g l(-1)-treatment the net-spinning behaviour was significantly affected, expressed as an increased mesh-opening and a decreased symmetry of the nets. No significant effects of fenvalerate exposure on the net-spinning behaviour were detected in the 0.25 mu g l(-1)-treatment. Thus, with the conditions given in this experiment, exposure to fenvalerate starts to affect the net-spinning behaviour of Hydropsyche siltalai at a concentration between 0.25 and 0.5 mu g l(-1). The use of net-anomalies and Hydropsyche as bioindicators for monitoring pollutants in stream ecosystems are discussed.

AB  - The physiological methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) plays a key role in the maintenance of human health and in the prevention of disease, A convenient clinical test for blood SAM does not exist, even though blood SAM is increasingly seen as an important indicator of health. We have developed a simple procedure to extract SAM from small amounts of blood or cells. The extracted SAM is then measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). This measurement is sensitive, precise and uses as little as 200 mu l of blood or 0.5.10(6) cultured cells per determination. SAM, as tested with this method, under acidic conditions, is stable for hours and can be frozen for later analysis. The method has been used to show that blood SAM varies with species, sex and treatment. We have also measured the SAM levels in cultured cells, and have been able to detect wide variations depending upon treatments administered during the growth of those cells. In conclusion, this is a very rapid and easy method to measure SAR I in biological fluids and cell culture and which could be adapted to the clinical setting.

AB  - Physiological indicators of growth and production of faba bean were quantified on the basis of pot and field trials. Pot trials were established by the method of gradual sowing rates during the growing season in partially controlled conditions of external environment. Experimental results on physiological indicators of growth and production: net output of photosynthesis NAR, specific rate of growth RGR, rate of dry matter increment per area CGR, leaf area index LAI, relative leaf area LAR, data on average daily temperature T and intensity of solar radiation I-GR are presented in the paper. Regression dependence of NAR, T and I-GR was found. This information can be used for the needs of mathematical modelling of crop models of growth and production. Field model trials were established to study the effect of density ranging from 23.0 to 139.0 plants per 1 m(2) of stand on physiological characteristics of growth and production. Regression dependence NAR = f(LAI) was set on a broad interval of stand density. It was found that CGR more depends on LAI than on NAR. Stand density control results in the changes of LAI, NAR and other physiological indicators of growth and production.

AB  - Development is the key challenge facing human society. The essence of development is to improve the quality of life, yet the striking technological revolutions of recent years have not resulted in better living conditions for most of the world's population. These contrasts are not limited to comparisons between advanced industrial and developing societies; they are also reflected in starkly differing patterns of development within the third world.
   Five broad theoretical perspectives frame much of the literature on regional paths of development: neoclassical economics, world-systems/dependency theories, the developmental state, institutional analysis, and marxism. While these approaches are general in nature, there are marked affinities between individual theories and the experience of particular regions in the third world.
   Our review focuses on four third-world regions: Latin America, East Asia, South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. East Asia comes out on top according to almost all indicators of economic and social development, followed by Latin America, South Asia, and, at a considerable distance from the rest, Africa. The comparative analysis of the paths of development followed in these regions not only generates useful insights about concrete development processes; it also serves as a tool for refining development theory itself, and points to promising new areas of research.

AB  - The coastline is an indicator line for human exploitation in the coastal zone. With the acceleration of human development and climate change, changes in the coastal zone are more active than ever. Quickly extracting the coastline and monitoring its changes in real time is of great significance for enacting the development and utilisation planning of coastal zones. In this research, we developed an automatic-coastline-extraction technique based on edge detection and object-oriented in complex situations. Meanwhile, on the basis of Landsat TM images, it realised the extraction of the mainland China coastline. Accuracy comparison showed that the matching commission and omission errors between the extracted and reference coastlines within two-pixel radii were 8% and 5%, respectively. The Overall quality reached as high as 87%, achieving an overall mapping accuracy of 1:250,000. We also constructed the index system of coastline exploitation and utilisation to analyse changes of the continental coastline from 2000 to 2015. It was found that natural and economic conditions affected coastline changes, in which the sea-expansion trend of northern China was more concentrated on a larger scale and with a higher load in coastline development and utilisation, while the southern region of China was relatively stable.

AB  - A scale-adaptive model is developed for the representation of dry convective boundary layer (CBL) turbulence in numerical models operating at O(100) m to O(1) km horizontal resolution, also known as the model gray zone of the CBL. The new model is constructed based on a planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme and a large-eddy simulation (LES) closure that are both turbulence kinetic energy-based parameterizations. Scale adaptivity is achieved by "blending" the PBL scheme with the LES closure through an inverse averaging procedure that naturally accounts for vertical variations of the dominant turbulent length scales, hence the gray zone range. High-resolution wide-domain LES benchmark cases covering a broad range of CBL bulk stability are filtered to gray zone resolutions, and analyzed to determine the averaging coefficients. Stability dependence of the dominant length scales is revealed by the analysis and accounted for in the new model. The turbulence model is implemented into a community atmospheric model, and tested for idealized cases. Compared to two established gray zone models, the new model performs equally well under strongly convective conditions, and is more advantageous for the weakly unstable and near neutral CBL.

KW  - Internal Control
AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of internal control on credit risk of joint stock commercial banks in Vietnam from 2007 to 2018. Furthermore, we specify bank-specific characteristics and macroeconomic conditions, and analyze how these factors affect credit risk of banks: the number of board members, the number of board members with banking or finance background as ratio of total board members, loans to total assets ratio, loans to deposit ratio, the number of days between the year-end and the publication of the financial statements, and the use of top four auditing firms proxy for five elements of internal control. By using the dataset of 30 Vietnamese joint stock commercial banks and Bayesian linear regression via Random-walk Metropolis Hastings algorithm, the results of this study show that five elements of internal control have a impact on bank credit risk, namely, control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring activities. For factors of banks' characteristics, bank size and financial leverage have a negative impact on banks' credit risk, and bank age has a positive effect. For macroeconomic factors, inflation has a positive impact and economic growth has a negative impact on banks' credit risk.

AB  - I argue that a dilemma arises for naturalistic philosophers of mind in the naturalised semantics tradition. Giving a naturalistic account of the mind is a pressing problem. Brentano's Thesis - that a state is mental if, and only if, that state has underived representational content - provides an attractive route to naturalising the mental. If true, Brentano's Thesis means that naturalising representation is sufficient for naturalising the mental. But a naturalist who accepts Brentano's Thesis thus commits to an eliminativism about the category of the mental. This is because naturalistic theories of representation are reductive, and so over-generalise by applying to patently non-mental states. According to these theories, it has been argued, phenomena like tree rings and saliva come out as representational. Only proposing further Naturalistic conditions on representation could avoid the eliminativist conclusion. But this shows that Naturalists have made only limited progress towards naturalising the mental. And if a Naturalist rejects Brentano's Thesis, then she gives up on a clear link between representation and mentality. Hence, it is incumbent on the Naturalist to propose another, naturalistically acceptable, mark of the mental. This, again, shows that Naturalists have made only limited progress on the issue of naturalising the mental.

AB  - In this study, taking the SP-1848 plot of the Taiyuan Coal Gasification Plant Area as an example, through the analysis of the site's organic pollution characteristics and soil properties and combining it with the actual conditions of the site, six remediation technologies for cement kiln co-processing, mechanical ventilation, ectopic thermal desorption remediation, ectopic gas phase extraction, ectopic chemical oxidation remediation and microbial remediation were preliminarily screened out. Also, eight indicators were selected as the remediation technology screening index system from four aspects, including economic factors, environmental factors, technical factors and social factors, using a combination of the AHP and TOPSIS methods for the sorting of six re mediation technologies. The results show that the re mediation technologies of ectopic chemical oxidation (lightly polluted soil), ectopic thermal desorption (moderately polluted soil), and cement kiln co-processing (heavily polluted soil) should be adopted in the remediation of the contaminated site. After the remediation was completed, the remediation effect was evaluated on the site, and the test results of all samples were lower than the remediation target value, which met the requirements of remediation and management, and there was no need for further remediation. This study may be used as a reference for the remediation of similarly contaminated sites.

AB  - The present study examined the biological characteristics and nutritional requirements of flax and outlined the most important agrochemical indicators of soil fertility. The study aimed to determine a range of soil parameters suitable for growing flax under conditions of increasing water content. The intention was to reach the full genetic potential and high yields of the given crop without causing damage to the soil. The solution provided for high returns on money spent to reach these parameters. The studies were conducted on dark-chestnut light soils with the presence of carbonate in the dry steppe region of Northern Kazakhstan. Soil parameters were 2.90 to 2.95% humus, 0.17% total nitrogen, 0.15% phosphorus, over 60 mg of mobile potassium per 100 g of soil, slightly alkaline pH at 8.08-8.1 and Ca2+ + Mg(2+)at 20-22 mg-eq/100 g soil. Graphs depicting a quantitative relationship between soil fertility and flax productivity were addressed to determine the optimum level of mobile phosphorus in the soil, which could ensure the maximum yields of flax. An optimisation formula and fertilisation methods proposed in the present study to maximise yield may be relevant for other temperate steppe zones.

AB  - The growing use of carbon and glass fibres has increased awareness about their waste disposal methods. Tonnes of composite waste containing valuable carbon fibres and glass fibres have been cumulating every year from various applications. These composite wastes must be cost-effectively recycled without causing negative environmental impact. This review article presents an overview of the existing methods to recycle the cumulating composite wastes containing carbon fibre and glass fibre, with emphasis on fibre recovery and understanding their retained properties. Carbon and glass fibres are assessed via focused topics, each related to a specific treatment method: mechanical recycling; thermal recycling, including fluidised bed and pyrolysis; chemical recycling and solvolysis using critical conditions. Additionally, a brief analysis of their environmental and economic aspects are discussed, prioritising the methods based on sustainable values. Finally, research gaps are identified to highlight the factors of circular economy and its significant role in closing the life-cycle loop of these valuable fibres into re-manufactured composites.

AB  - The paper studied the impact of agriculture on rural development. The emphasis is on the changes in the development of agriculture in the conditions of Bulgaria's membership in the EU and on their impacts on the economic, social and environmental indicators for the status and development of the rural areas. The object of analysis is the South Central Planning Region of Bulgaria (BG-12) at the NUTS-2 level. This study employed mixed quantitative and qualitative research design. The quantitative part presupposes the presentation and analysis' of statistics on agriculture and rural development at the level of planning region, district and rural area (municipality) in the period of EU membership (2007-2017). Qualitative methods include the use of the experts evaluation method and in-depth interviews with 25 specialists from the regional office "Agriculture" and the regional office of the National Agricultural Advisory System. The conclusions of the analysis reveal that the model of agriculture in the study area is close to the characteristics of the Southern model of agriculture in Europe. Evidence for the more favorable effects of the emerging model of agriculture on rural development compared to other regions in the country (especially the three northern ones) are the slower migration processes, lower unemployment rates in some municipalities and etc.

AB  - To contribute to the economic viability of waste heat recovery systems application based on the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) under real operation condition of natural gas engines, this article presents a thermoeconomic optimization results using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm of a simple ORC (SORC), regenerative ORC (RORC), and double-stage ORC (DORC) integrated to a GE Jenbacher engine type 6, which have not been reported in the literature. Thermoeconomic modeling was proposed for the studied configurations to integrate the exergetic analysis with economic considerations, allowing to reduce the thermoeconomic indicators that most influence the cash flow of the project. The greatest opportunities for improvement were obtained for the DORC, where the results for maximizing net power allowed the maximum value of 99.52 kW, with 85% and 80% efficiencies in the pump and turbine, respectively, while the pinch point temperatures of the evaporator and condenser must be 35 and 16 degrees C. This study serves as a guide for future research focused on the thermoeconomic performance optimization of an ORC integrated into a natural gas engine.

AB  - The relationship between zooplankton community structure and selected environmental conditions was investigated by simultaneous two-day consecutive sampling in the waters overlying Coral and sand sites off Sibu Island and a Seagrass site off Tinggi Island, Johor, Malaysia. A total of 129 taxa were identified, 60 non-Copepod taxa and 69 Copepod species in all samples. Uni- and multi-variate analyses reveal distinct Coral, sand, Seagrass Copepod assemblages with indicator Copepod species and attributes of their size fractions. Small fraction (100-335 mu m) samples contained greatest number of individuals, few rare species and were densest at onshore depths, and the opposite for large fraction (>335 mu m) samples but were densest at nighttime and most species rich in the Coral site at night. Higher species diversity at offshore stations is due likely to ecotonal effects of overlapping oceanic and nearshore communities. This study demonstrates the usefulness of uni- and multi-variate analyses in identifying patterns in Zooplankton community structure in representative shallow tropical habitats, and the need for accurate Zooplankton taxonomy, nighttime and daytime and onshore and offshore sampling, and size fractionation of samples.

AB  - One of the purposes of the economic and financial evaluation is to evaluate the future cash flow generated by the acquisition of a certain investment, as well as the results obtained from its implementation. Thus, this study aimed to verify the feasibility of investing in a central pivot irrigation system in a rural property dedicated to milk production, aiming to assist rural managers in decision making. For this, the methodological classification is applied nature, as far as the objectives is a descriptive, documentary, case study, and qualitative research. The results showed that with the performance analysis from the indicators calculated based on the cash flow and the statement of income for the year, it is possible to verify the company's situation and to make a safe decision from the identified context. From the results obtained it was verified that it is feasible to borrow the value to invest in the acquisition of the irrigation pivot since it increases the possibilities of economic and financial return for the property analyzed. It also provided information on expansion conditions, the need to reduce costs and expenses, and the search for third-party resources. It is inferred that accounting can and should be used as a planning tool.

AB  - Quantifying carotenoid contents has many applications in agriculture, ecology, and health science. Hyperspectral reflectance has been one of the promising tools for this purpose. However, previous studies were based on measurements under relatively low light-stress conditions. Therefore, assessing its robustness by using measurements under various levels of stress is required. In this study, the measurements of reflectance and carotenoid contents were carried out with four shading treatments including open-0%, 35%, 75%, and 90% shading to generate various chlorophyll/carotenoid ratios. Then the performances of 15 published hyperspectral indices and PROSPECT-D inversion were evaluated based on our data set for estimating leaf carotenoid contents. According to the ratio of performance to deviation, R-NIR/R-510, R-720/R-521-1, and PROSPECT-D inversion were applicable for this purpose, although calibration of the absorption coefficients was required for PROSPECT-D. Using them, root mean square percentage errors of 4.53-5.46% were achieved. Given that total chlorophyll/carotenoid ratios could be a good indicator for evaluating environmental stress in plants, PROSPECT-D, which also estimates total chlorophyll and anthocyanin contents, could be a strong tool for controlling the qualities of shade-grown tea.

AB  - Low oxygen conditions occur in grass sites due to high and frequent precipitation, poor soil quality, and over-irrigation followed by slow drainage. Three warm-season and one cool-season grass were analyzed at metabolic level during a time-course experiment performed in a controlled anoxic environment. Prolonged oxygen depletion proved detrimental by leading to premature death to all the species, with the exception of seashore paspalum. Moreover, the anoxia tolerance observed in these grasses has been associated with slow use of carbohydrates, rather than with their relative abundance, which was more important than their antioxidant capacity. Further physiological characterization of eight seashore paspalum genotypes to anoxia was also performed, by examining the variation in photosystem II (PSII) efficiency and gas exchange during post-anoxia recovery. Multivariate analysis highlighted the presence of three main clusters of seashore paspalum genotypes, characterized by different ability to restore the PSII photochemistry during recovery after one day of anoxia. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the analysis of post-anoxia recovery of fluorescence and gas exchange parameters can represent a fast and reliable indicator for selecting species and cultivars more able to acclimate their photosynthetic apparatus.

AB  - The marine environment is vast, harsh, and challenging. Unanticipated faults and events might lead to loss of vessels, transported goods, collected scientific data, and business reputation. Hence, systems have to be in place that monitor the safety performance of operation and indicate if it drifts into an intolerable safety level. This article proposes a process for developing safety indicators for the operation of autonomous marine systems (AMS). The condition of safety barriers and resilience engineering form the basis for the development of safety indicators, synthesizing and further adjusting the dual assurance and the resilience based early warning indicator (REWI) approaches. The article locates the process for developing safety indicators in the system life cycle emphasizing a timely implementation of the safety indicators. The resulting safety indicators reflect safety in AMS operation and can assist in planning of operations, in daily operational decision-making, and identification of improvements. Operation of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) exemplifies the process for developing safety indicators and their implementation. The case study shows that the proposed process leads to a comprehensive set of safety indicators. It is expected that application of the resulting safety indicators consequently will contribute to safer operation of current and future AMS.

AB  - Sugarcane productivity is worldwide subjected to increasing environmental constraints, predominantly to drought and salinity owing to their high magnitude of impact and wide distribution. The present study provides insights into the knowledge of sugarcane responses at germination, tillering and respective recovery stages to high salinity at physio-biochemical and molecular level. Our results indicated that there was a negative relationship between catalase, and peroxidase activity with lipid peroxidation and SOD activity. Increase in MDA and SOD levels at the earlier stages of stress and later increase in CAT and POD levels on prolonged stress was evidenced. Thus they can be used as indicators of stress for sugarcane plants facing unfavourable environmental conditions. At molecular level, we have identified 137 salinity tolerant candidate cDNAs from sugarcane by cDNA-SSH, representing 20% of which are novel sugarcane genes. These unique sequences, never reported elsewhere to be stress related and might provide further understanding on perception, response and adaptations mechanisms of the non-model plant like sugarcane to salinity stress and will be potential candidates for manipulating salt tolerant trait.

AB  - The habitat of the pleurocarpous moss Drepanocladus trifarius is commonly described as mineral-rich wet fens. We sampled individual D. trifarius shoots at 214 pre-defined randomly distributed spots in an area of ca 15 km(2) in a sloping fen in central-western Sweden. We assessed the habitat variation of the sampling spots in this area by means of a multi-variate analysis (DCA) based on the species identity of the ten shoots adjacent to D. trifarius, and by indicator values for light availability and substrate moisture, acidity, and nutrient availability of the associated species. Both approaches indicated that D. trifarius occurred in well lit and constantly moist, wet or submerged places. Most spots were weakly acid to sub-neutral, but some spots had distinctly acid conditions. Generally the spots were nutrient-poor, but a few were nutrientrich. DCA revealed gradients from relatively wet, sub-neutral to basic towards drier and more acid habitats, and from nutrient-poor to -richer environments. The species obviously exhibits a broader than expected niche width with respect to substrate acidity and nutrients. We suggest that succession, disturbance, or climatic factors may explain the species' occurrences in different habitats.

AB  - Groundwater and soil pollution from pyrite oxidation, acid mine drainage generation, and release and transport of toxic metals are common environmental problems associated with the mining industry. Nickel is one toxic metal considered to be a key pollutant in some mining setting; to date, its formation mechanism has not yet been fully evaluated. The goals of this study are 1) to describe the process of nickel mobilization in waste dumps by introducing a novel conceptual model, and 2) to predict nickel concentration using two algorithms, namely the support vector machine (SVM) and the general regression neural network (GRNN). The results obtained from this study have shown that considerable amount of nickel concentration can be arrived into the water flow system during the oxidation of pyrite and subsequent Acid Drainage (AMD) generation. It was concluded that pyrite, water, and oxygen are the most important factors for nickel pollution generation while pH condition, SO4, HCO3, TDS, EC, Mg, Fe, Zn, and Cu are measured quantities playing significant role in nickel mobilization. SVM and GRNN have predicted nickel concentration with a high degree of accuracy. Hence, SVM and GRNN can be considered as appropriate tools for environmental risk assessment.

AB  - A whole-stand growth model, Scube, was developed for spruce-dominated, even-aged, natural and planted stands, using permanent sample plot data from the sub-boreal spruce biogeoclimatic zone of British Columbia, Canada. Available data were limited, with no information on mature planted stands or thinning treatments. A parsimonious model design, incorporating knowledge of stand dynamics and experience from other forests, made possible a logical reproduction of observed behavior and plausible extrapolations to other conditions. Scube consists of a system of four differential equations, describing the evolution of four state variables: top height, trees per hectare, basal area, and a stand closure indicator. Concepts of closure and site occupancy drive the behavior of young stands and the response to thinning. Parameters were estimated through numerical optimization of several residual functions, reflecting different projection interval types and weighting strategies. Differences in estimates among the various criteria were small. Calculations are facilitated through expressions that remain invariant in the absence of disturbances. The methods generalize the algebraic difference approach and related forest modeling techniques, linking them to standard dynamical systems theory. FOR. SCI. 57(4):265-280.

AB  - Artisanal fisheries in Croatia and throughout the Mediterranean coastal region have a long tradition. In recent times the booming growth of human populations along Mediterranean coasts has led to harvesting of its marine resources in almost insupportable quantities, thus placing the research of this topic in a complex context. At the same time, fisheries management throughout the Mediterranean region has remained conventional in its nature, implying that it is almost only based on gear specific management provisions. The current Croatian legislative framework and legislative changes of artisanal fisheries regulation in the last 15 years, as well as how these changes have impacted on the state of coastal fish resources, particularly target species condition, are discussed. The conclusion is that if we want to improve further the state of the resources a more comprehensive set of management measures incorporating closed areas and a new approach actively involving fishers in the management process should be adopted. Finally, guidelines for future management in terms of the monitoring and data collection framework (DCF) proposed by the EU are demonstrated.

AB  - Structure and composition of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages were investigated during three consecutive years in six headwater streams that exhibit a high variation in environmental conditions, habitat structure and predatory pressure. We examined whether the abundance of functional feeding groups could be best predicted by the abundance of predators and some habitat and chemical variables. Mean density and biomass of macroinvertebrate functional feeding groups varied significantly throughout the study area. Stepwise multiple regression analyses revealed that both density and biomass of functional feeding groups was influenced primarily by chemical features of water. Shredder biomass and scraper density were also influenced by habitat features, the abundance of scrapers increasing in deeper localities at lower altitudes and with abundant macrophytes. The abundance of predatory invertebrates was related to the density and biomass of benthic prey. An influence of fish predation on invertebrate communities was not observed in the study streams. The finding that benthic communities in undisturbed headwater streams are mainly affected by water chemistry variables irrespective of fish predation and habitat features clearly highlight the sensitivity of functional feeding groups to changes in chemical features and their role as indicators for bioassessment.

AB  - Socially acquired information improves the accuracy and efficiency of environmental assessments and can increase fitness. Public information may be especially useful during unpredictable food conditions, or for species that depend on resources made less predictable by human disturbance. However, the physiological mechanisms by which direct foraging assessments and public information are integrated to affect behaviour remain largely unknown. We tested for potential effects of public information on the behavioural and hormonal response to food reduction by manipulating the social environment of captive red crossbills (Loxia curvirostra). Red crossbills are irruptive migrants that are considered sensitive to changes in food availability and use public information in decision making. Here, we show that public information can attenuate or intensify the release of glucocorticoids (i.e. stress hormones) during food shortage in red crossbills. The observed modulation of corticosterone may therefore be a physiological mechanism linking public information, direct environmental assessments and behavioural change. This mechanism would not only allow for public information to affect individual behaviour, but might also facilitate group decision making by bringing group members into more similar physiological states. The results further suggest that stressors affecting entire populations may be magnified in individual physiology through social interactions.

AB  - Several ABC transporters have been characterized from many aquatic organisms, but no information is yet available for Antarctic fish. The aim of this work was to identify the expression of genes for ABC proteins in Trematomus bernacchii, a bioindicator species of the Southern Ocean. Partial cDNA sequences of ABCB1, ABCC1, ABCC2, ABCC4 and ABCC9 were cloned from liver. Using RACE technology, 3.5 and 2.2 kb contigs were obtained for ABCB1 and ABCC2. Considering the elevated natural bioavailability of cadmium at Terra Nova Bay, responsiveness of ABCB1 and ABCC2 to this element was investigated under laboratory conditions. ABCB1 and ABCC2 mRNA levels were approximately four-fold higher in Cd-exposed fish compared to the controls. Induction of ABCB1 protein was also found by western blot. This study provides the first identification of five ABC genes in the liver of an Antarctic key species, some of which may be involved in cellular detoxification. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Microbial contaminants in stormwater runoff have the potential to negatively impact public health. Stormwater runoff to coastal waters is increasing in amount and rate of discharge due to loss of vegetated landscape and increasing coastal development. However, the extent and nature of microbial contamination of stormwater runoff in North Carolina (NC) has not been previously characterized. The aim of this study was to measure a range of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and molecular markers at three coastal sites. E. coli and Enterococcus sp. were measured in addition to molecular markers including Bacteroides Human-Specific Marker (HS) and fecal Bacteroides spp. Levels of FIB in stormwater far exceeded recreational water quality guidelines, frequently by several orders of magnitude. High concentrations of fecal Bacteroides spp. and the presence of HS indicated the presence of human fecal contamination in the stormwater runoff, but only during specific storms. Examinations of levels of fecal contamination in stormwater over multiple seasons and a range of storm conditions will allow managers to consider appropriate design of effective mitigation strategies necessary to maintain and restore coastal water quality.

AB  - Selecting plant species that can overcome harsh soil and microclimatic conditions and speed the recovery of degraded minelands remains a worldwide restoration challenge. This study evaluated the potential of three woody species and various organic and inorganic fertilization treatments for revegetating abandoned metalliferous mines in Korea. We compared survival, growth, and heavy metal uptake of species common to Korean minelands in two spoil types and a reference forest soil. Substrate type and fertilization both influenced seedling growth and metal concentrations substantially, but they had little effect on seedling survival. Fertilization increased the growth of all three species when grown in mine spoils but influenced the growth of seedlings grown in forest soil only marginally. Initial seedling survival and growth indicate that the study species can tolerate the heavy metal concentrations and other soil constraints of metalliferous spoil types. We estimate that plants can stabilize 2-22% of various heavy metals contained in spoil materials into plant biomass during 20 years of plantation growth. Combined with the erosion control and site amelioration benefits of mineland reforestation, stabilization of heavy metals in forest biomass justifies this treatment on abandoned Korean metalliferous mines.

AB  - Associations of pteropod, cladoceran, and chaetognath species were analyzed for the southern coast of Brazil in order to present a biological diagnosis of the oceanographic conditions in winter and summer. The density data from the different species were analyzed using nodal and ordination cluster techniques, linking the species associations with salinity and temperature and, consequently, with the water masses occurring in each period. Sagitta tenuis and Pleopsis polyphemoides were found to characterize the coastal water and, when associated with Evadne nordmanni and Pleopsis schmackeri, differentiated between the thermal characteristics of winter and summer, respectively. The Sub-Antarctic Shelf Water was characterized by the association of Sagitta tasmanica and Limacina retroversa in winter. The Tropical Water of the Brazil current presented several different associations, with Penilia avirostris, Sagitta enflata, and Creseis virgula dominating the shelf Tropical Water and Sagitta serratodentata, Limacina trochiformis, and Evadne spinifera characterizing the oceanic Tropical Water. The Sub-tropical Water, typical of upwelling processes, was characterized by the association of the chaetognaths Sagitta decipiens and Krohnitta subtilis, both in winter and summer. The species associations defined in this study agree with others carried out in neighboring areas and in previous sampling periods, characterizing the region as the southern transition zone.

AB  - Traditionally, the benthic foraminifera Hyalinea balthica (Schroter) has been considered a species with high intraspecific variability, possibly related to climatic changes, and, therefore, a potential indicator of paleoclimate in the Mediterranean Sea. However, a stable and characteristic morphology very different from the syntype of the species can be observed in specimens from the Sea of Marmara.
   By identification and documentation of this morphology and a subsequent comparison to specimens similar to the type species, clear differences between the two groups have been established. Hyalinea marmarica n. sp. is proposed as an example of possible environment-related speciation in benthic foraminifera. It differs from H. balthica in having less numerous chambers in the last whorl (maximum of eight), depressed sutures at least in the last four chambers, a moderate increase in chamber size as added, a subacute profile and accessory apertures on the peripheral margin.
   Speciation could have occurred between 14 and 12 ka. At this time, increasingly efficient connections were progressively established between the Sea of Marmara and the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, allowing Hyalinea balthica to migrate into the Sea of Marmara. Here this species might have modified its morphology in response to the extreme environmental conditions.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to explore how aspects and qualities of modern family life influence subjective well-being. Although the patterns of family, work and sexuality have changed dramatically the last four decades, it is here claimed that the family is still an important base of socialization and upbringing. Thus the study of processes within the family can contribute to the understanding of the environment in which many children grow up. In most families, work, partner and family roles are intertwined, and one central hypothesis of this work is that family members influence each other in the individual formation of well-being. The main research question of this study asks: How is life quality affected by the quality of parent-child and the partner relationships and aspects of their shared everyday life? Empirical implications are tested against 2002-data from a representative, Norwegian sample. Analyses conclude that the quality of parent-child and the spousal relationship, and also aspects of families' everyday life such as work-life balance and time pressure influence the subjective life quality, but mother's and father's life quality is affected by differing and partly incompatible conditions.

AB  - This study has been conducted to determine the major contamination sources during frozen snail meat processing. Seventeen different control points and/or sample types (live snail, and snail meats after steaming, after shell removal, after first boiling, after gutting, after second boiling, after packaging and as frozen snail meat; air samples from gutting room, boiling room and packaging room; samples from gutting counter tops, package surfaces, scissors used during processing, forks used during processing, personnel hands, and potable water) have been examined for the enumeration of total aerobic mesophilic bacteria, coliforms, Escherichia coli, Enterobacteriaceae, coagulase positive staphylococci, Salmonella spp., Listeria spp., and yeast and molds. From the control points examined, raw material and environmental air were found as the primary contamination sources. Personnel hands and equipment used were determined as the secondary contamination sources. Second boiling and freezing stages during processing were determined to reduce the overall contamination rate, and therefore had positive effects on the microbiological quality of the final product. Programs approving the acceptance of snails only with low initial microbial counts to the plant, giving emphasis to processing in proper hygiene conditions with sufficient sanitary applications is strongly recommended.

AB  - Pesticides are used not only in agriculture but also by public services and households. Much information is available on the influence of agricultural applications on human health by occupational exposure and on the environment. There is still a need for adequate information on the impact of non-agricultural applications of pesticides. The POCER indicator (Pesticide Occupational and Environmental Risk indicator) has been developed at Ghent University for agricultural situations, as a tool for applicators and decision-makers, by calculating the impact of pesticide treatments on the applicator, the worker, the bystander, groundwater, surface water, bees, earthworms, birds, useful arthropods and persistence in soil. A few adaptations in the POCER calculation method can make the indicator also very useful for non-agricultural conditions. The impact of plant protection products on human health and environment in public services and households can be calculated and the scores can be compared with each other, resulting in an improved pesticide programme. Decision makers might use the POCER indicator to evaluate the reduction programme of public services and communities and offer them measurements to reduce the impact of pesticides. For example, wearing protective clothing or taking into account the distance between application and surface water can greatly reduce the impact score. (c) 2005 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Aryl isoprenoids have been detected for the first time in crude oils from Paleozoic petroleum systems in the Tabei uplift, Tarim Basin, northwestern China. The principal compounds possess the 1-alkyl-2,3,6-trimethyl substitution pattern characteristic of diaromatic carotenoids found in the Chlorobiaceae family of photosynthetic sulfur bacteria, with a predominance Of C-13 - C-23 homologues in these samples. Flash pyrolysates of the asphaltene fractions isolated from crude oils show an unusual abundance of 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, an indicator for a significant contribution of diaromatic carotenoids to the source kerogen of these oils. The wide distribution of these compounds in crude oils reveals that penetration of the photic zone by sulfidic waters during deposition enabled prolific growth of photosynthetic green sulphur bacteria (Chlorobiaceae). This suggests that the source rocks for the Paleozoic petroleum systems in the Tabei uplift were likely deposited under euxinic conditions with sulfate and sulfide-rich water bodies, which doesn't support previously published conclusions of a Middle-Upper Ordovician source that marks the slope facies at the margins of structural uplifts.

AB  - Criteria for removing training set lakes and taxa in chironomid-based inference models, due to low abundances, have largely been ad hoc. We used an anoxia inference model and a hypolimnetic oxygen model from south-central Ontario to determine what effect subfossil head capsule abundance and taxa deletion criteria have on fossil inference statistics. Results from six training set lakes suggest that a minimum abundance of 40-50 head capsules is sufficient for use in inference models, however more diverse samples likely require more than 50 head capsules. Taxa deletion criteria substantially improved the predictive ability of inference models (lowered the root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP)). The common practice of including taxa with only greater than or equal to 2% abundance in at least two lakes was one of the deletion criteria that much improved inference models. Similar deletion criteria, such as greater than or equal to 2% in at least 3 lakes and greater than or equal to 3% in at least 1 lake, produced comparable improvements (up to 18% reduction in RMSEP).

AB  - Indicator species should exhibit sensitivity to certain environmental conditions, for example, habitat fragmentation. Amphibian and reptile species were examined on three island archipelagos (Lake Erie, Georgian Bay and the St. Lawrence River) for sensitivity to insularization and hence, whether any might indicate effects of habitat fragmentation. Species that are most sensitive to habitat fragmentation are expected to be those that disappear first from assemblages as insularization increases (i.e., area decreases). The ranked order in which reptiles and amphibians disappeared from assemblages as island area decreased was positively correlated between two of the three archipelagos (p < 0.002 and p < 0.001). Species such as northern water snake (Nerodia s. sipedon [L.]), bullfrog (Rana catesbeinana Shaw), and American toad (Bufo americanus Holbrook) tended to be present on islands of all sizes; red-spotted newt (Notophthalmus v: viridescens Rafinesque), ringneck snake (Dindophis punctatus edwarsii Merrem) and gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor LeConte, 1825) tended to be absent from smaller islands and are, therefore, area-sensitive. However, variation in life history traits thought to correlate with area-sensitivity (body size, rarity and dispersal ability) could not account for the observed order of species' disappearances with decreasing island area.

AB  - Scottish inshore sea lochs have traditionally provided undisturbed and unpolluted conditions for a variety of marine wildlife species, some of which are internationally important. Marine fish farming, particularly of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) has proliferated along the Scottish coast to the extent that all major sea loch systems are affected. The industry gives rise to a number of environmental impacts which potentially threaten the environmental quality of inshore sea lochs and jeopardise populations of characteristic wild species. In view of the wildlife importance of these areas, consent procedures should give full consideration to potentially damaging environmental effects and operational effects should be assessed thoroughly. It has been suggested that current policy and legislative mechanisms fail to regulate the environmental performance of the marine fish farming industry in any effective way. This paper reviews the current status of marine fish farming in the U.K., identifies the main environmental impacts and summarises the relevant legislative mechanisms for limiting potentially adverse impacts on areas important for native marine wildlife. A framework for the strategic environmental assessment of the industry is proposed to overcome some of the shortcomings identified. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited

AB  - A study was made of the fauna of molluscs and of the temperature reactions of various molluscan species living both in the normal environment and in condition of thermal discharge produced by an atomic electric station.  The temperature reactions were studied on the intact individuals, being at various stages of ontogenesis, and on somatic and sex cells.  In the thermal discharge zone, thermophylic species, originating from the Black Sea and Australia, were registered; unlike, relatively psychrophylic molluscan species were absent.  This evidence may suggest a considerable and prolonged thermal pollution in this zone.  In summer, during the warmest season, some species of molluscs displayed the disappearance of definitive organisms, a high embryonic death, and the reproductive system degeneration.  The latter involves reduced acinus areas in the ovary and oocyte resorption.  The muscle thermostability in these molluscs became also different showingan abrupt change in the angle of slope in the curve characterizing the relation between the Survival time (logarithmic scale) of muscle tissue to the test temperature.  Thus, among the bioindicators of thermal pollution most sensitive are to be considered the cytoecological indices, in particular, the cell thermoresistance.

AB  - Environmental assessments are conducted prior to mineral development at proposed mining operations. Among the objectives of these assessments is prediction of solute release from mine wastes projected to be generated by the proposed mining and associated operations. This paper provides guidance to those engaged in these assessments and, in more detail, provides insights on solid-phase characterization and application of kinetic test results for predicting solute release from waste rock. The logic guiding the process is consistent with general model construction practices and recent publications. Baseline conditions at the proposed site are determined and a detailed operational plan is developed and imposed upon the site. Block modeling of the mine geology is conducted to identify the mineral assemblages present, their masses and compositional variations. This information is used to select samples, representative of waste rock to be generated, that will be analyzed and tested to describe characteristics influencing waste rock drainage quality. The characterization results are used to select samples for laboratory dissolution testing (kinetic tests). These tests provide empirical data on dissolution of the various mineral assemblages present as waste rock.
   The data generated are used, in conjunction with environmental conditions, the proposed method of mine waste storage, and scientific and technical principles, to estimate solute release rates for the operational scale waste rock. Common concerns regarding waste rock are generation of acidic drainage and release of heavy metals and sulfate. Key solid phases in the assessments are those that dissolve to release acid and sulfate (iron sulfides, soluble iron sulfates, hydrated iron-sulfate minerals, minerals of the alunite-jarosite group), those that dissolve to neutralize acid (calcium and magnesium carbonates, silicate minerals), and those that release trace metals (trace metal sulfides, hydrated trace metal-sulfate minerals). Conventional mineralogic, petrographic, and geochemical analyses generally can be used to determine the quantities of these minerals present and to describe characteristics that influence their dissolution. A key solid-phase characteristic is the mineral surface area exposed for reaction, which is influenced by mode of occurrence (included, interstitial, liberated) and the extent of mineral surface coating. Short-term dissolution tests can estimate the extent of hydrated sulfate minerals present. Longer term dissolution tests are necessary to describe the dependence of drainage pH and solute release rates on solid-phase variation. The extensive data compiled from baseline pre-development definition, the operational plan, solid-phase characterization, and dissolution testing are ultimately synthesized by means of a modeling exercise requiring considerable technical and scientific expertise. The predicted rates (model outputs) are expressed as probability distributions to allow assessment of risk. This exercise must be technically defensible and transparent so that regulators can confidently assess the results and evaluate the operational plan proposed. Technical and non-technical challenges involved in implementing such programs are identified to benefit management planning for both industry and government. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background and Objectives Perceived emotion invalidation is linked to the development or worsening of a variety of emotional and physical health conditions. However, prior studies are largely cross-sectional and whether there are day-to-day effects of generally feeling invalidated is unknown. Design We examined the relations between perceived emotion invalidation and momentary affect, average daily affect, and the experience of daily stressors among a sample of young adults using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Methods Participants (n = 86) completed measures of perceived emotion invalidation and emotional reactivity at baseline then completed one week of EMA including: (1) 7x/day reports of current affect and social context and (2) 1x/day index of experienced stressors and their intensity. Results Higher perceived emotion invalidation predicted lower momentary positive affect. Perceived invalidation also interacted with social context such that higher emotion invalidation predicted greater negative affect when participants were with non-close others (i.e., co-workers, acquaintances). Only participants with high perceived emotional invalidation experienced increased stress alongside heightened daily negative affect. Conclusions These results provide preliminary evidence that feeling emotionally invalidated may predict affective experiences, including how emotions are momentarily experienced and how life stressors are interpreted when they are later reflected on.

AB  - In this article, a clear-cut comparative research has been conducted on various types of energy production technologies utilised for bagasse including combustion, pyrolysis, gasification, anaerobic digestion and alcoholic fermentation. Furthermore, these technologies have been analysed and modelled in MATLAB software to select its best usage in the conditions of Iran. Moreover, it takes into consideration three technical, economic and environmental viewpoints along with the development of an essential and acceptable data bank. In the technical study, parameters which are of great significance in implementation and manufacturing the technologies are determined. Then with the help of creditable methods of evaluation such as Delphi and focus group, these parameters are compared and weighted. In the economic study, with the calculation of economic indicators such as break-even point, net present value, internal rate of return and payback period, these technologies were compared. In order to facilitate decision making, three scenarios were considered based on international foreign currency. The environmental comparison of technologies were also made by calculating the degree of greenhouse gases reduction and other polluting gases with regard to the determined emission factors for the power plants in the country and their related external costs.

AB  - Drought is a slow-onset hazard affecting ecosystems and human society. Although it is difficult to assess the uncertainty associated with drought, it is very important to identify the severity of drought. Using a dynamic naive Bayesian classifier (DNBC), this study combined the strengths of three conventional drought indices, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI), and the Vegetation Health Index (VIII), and developed a DNBC-based drought index (DNBC-DI) to identify overall drought conditions. After comparing recent actual drought events with the drought indices, the drought severity was classified into five states using them: severe wet, moderate wet, normal, moderate drought, and severe drought. We evaluated the performance of the DNBC-DI for representing actual hydrological droughts that occurred since 2000. In this study, the actual hydrological drought was represented by the Streamflow Drought Index (SDI). Our results indicated that the accuracy of the DNBC-DI was 60%, which was higher than SPI (40%), ESI (40%), and VHI (0.41%). Even though in practice, the evaluation of drought is highly dependent on the drought index, this study tried to develop a practical drought index that can be used for comprehensive drought assessment.

AB  - How can we measure culture in urban areas? Can empirical metrics on culture function as an urban planning tool for cities' well-being? This paper fits into the research path examining the role of culture as a resource for development, with a specific focus on empirical measurement aspects. A novel dataset (The Cultural and Creative Cities Monitor - CCCM) gathering 29 indicators for 168 cities in 30 European countries is presented. The CCCM measures the presence and attractiveness of cultural venues and facilities (Cultural Vibrancy), the capacity of culture to generate jobs and innovation (Creative Economy), and the conditions enabling cultural and creative processes to thrive (Enabling Environment). Results show that cultural and creative assets are diversely distributed across European cities, which offer local authorities the opportunity to design context-specific development strategies. In particular, many medium-sized cities appear to have, on average, more cultural capital assets per inhabitant than larger cities. On the basis of these findings, we draw conclusions on the conceptual and methodological relevance of the CCCM and advance proposals on how to further use the CCCM data to drive culture-led and evidence-based urban policy design.

AB  - The progressive loss of structure and function of neurons causes various neurodegenerative diseases which need to be examined using measurable indicators, known as biomarkers. Proteins are the building blocks for the cell and are essential as they participate in many processes in the cells. When biologically essential proteins are impaired, it leads to devastating consequences in humans and mammals among which the most prominent is neurodegenerative disease. Proteins conform to three-dimensional structures to enable their functions. Besides, some proteins have the tendency to form self-assembly structures. When these self-assembly proteins assume abnormal conformation, they accumulate and cause pathological conditions. The genetic and molecular origins of protein misfolding in association with their relationship with neurodegeneration and aging are being studied to better understand and develop treatments. Accumulations of these misfolded proteins form aggregates which is considered as the most prominent cause of many neurodegenerative diseases. This article reviews the misfolded proteins in various neurodegenerative diseases and analyzes the diverse aspects of protein misfolding as a potential agent of biomarkers with an approach for finding an inhibitor for misfolding.

T2  - SAE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINES
LA  - English
AB  - Combustion control is key for achieving maximum efficiency in internal combustion engines. For SI (spark-ignition) engines, knocking combustions occurrence can be controlled using a protective closed-loop control system, but additional information, such as combustion angular phase, is needed to minimize brake-specific fuel consumption in the entire engine operating range. The proposed solution is a closed-loop Spark Advance (SA) controller based on pre-defined combustion phase targets, able to react to excessive knocking levels. Pressure- and ion-current-based combustion closed-loop control are compared in the article, by implementing both solutions in Model-In-the-Loop environment and then in real time. Both controllers are characterized by an aggressive strategy, which pursues the optimal combustion angular phase, and by a protective action governed by measured knocking levels. Experimental tests carried out at the engine test bench demonstrate the possibility of using the ionization current signal as the main input to a closed-loop combustion controller, both in knock-free and knock-limited conditions: the considered indicators (mean values and standard deviation of the controlled variables) to estimate the controller performance while using the pressure or the ionization current signal are comparable, confirming the robustness of the ion signal for control purposes.

AB  - There are overwhelming proofs of how urbanization contributes to the increase of carbon emissions. However, it has been unclear how structural and functional changes in urban carbon flows evolve with socioeconomic development in a long run, which is important for a more systemic and efficient carbon mitigation policy. The present study probes into the interaction between urban carbon metabolism and socioeconomic activities from a systems perspective. Taking Beijing as a case study, we model the dynamics between the changing carbon metabolism and variation in socioeconomic conditions over 1985-2030, based on a collection of system-based indicators from ecological network analysis. We find an "inverted V curve" carbon transition in Beijing, and the turning point occurred around 2010. This transition is widely observed in the variation in total embodied emission, total system throughflow, boundary flow and system capacity. Continuing improvement in efficiency is expected to lessen the pressure from carbonization in 2020 and 2030 without sacrificing the diversity of economic activities. We suggest that network analysis has a unique potential in unfolding the interplay between carbon transition and socioeconomic development that most "accounting approaches" fail to penetrate.

AB  - A novel, simple, and accurate colorimetric assay was established for assessments of catalase activity in biological fluids and tissues. H2O2 dissociation rates are directly proportional to catalase activity, and the principle of the present assay is based on reactions of ammonium metavanadate with H2O2 under acidic conditions. The resulting reduction of vanadium (V) to vanadium (III) produces a red-orange peroxovanadium complex with absorbance maxima at 452 nm. Biological samples containing catalase were incubated with 50-mM phosphate buffer solution containing 10-mM H2O2 as a substrate for two min. Subsequently, ammonium metavanadate in sulfuric acid was used as an indicator reagent and was added to reaction mixtures to determine remaining H2O2 concentrations.
   The precision of the present novel assay was indicated by coefficients of variation of 4.09% within runs and 2.56% between runs. Moreover, in experiments with homogenized red blood cell solutions, peroxovanate and dichromate assays of catalase activities were highly correlated (r = 0.993). In further experiments, we demonstrated application of the peroxovanadate method to assessments of catalase activity in bacterial and liver homogenates. The present method is accurate, simple, rapid, and inexpensive and can be used for routine clinical measurements and scientific investigations.

AB  - To promote the development of unmanned ground vehicle technologies, it is necessary to design a scientific and reasonable test method. Road is an important part of test environmental elements, and different road conditions can examine the adaptability of unmanned ground vehicles to the environment. Therefore, the scientific calculation of road complexity is of great importance. Previous studies on road are mainly based on the concept of road roughness; however due to the unicity of road feature indicators, road complexity can only be reflected to a certain extent. This paper proposes a new road-feature-based multiparameter road complexity calculation model of off-road environment to show the complexity of road more comprehensively. First, a multi-sensor-based data acquisition mobile platform is established to obtain more complete road data. Then, based on the analysis of road feature, road indicators like three-dimensional scale, average slope, and adhesion characteristics of travelable area are obtained. According to the analysis methods of road roughness, the principle of analytic hierarchy process, and the data collected from off-road environment, the calculation model of road complexity is determined. Finally, by calculating complexities of several cross-country roads, the feasibility of this model is verified, which provides a theoretical support for the scientific calculation and quantitative analysis of different road complexities.

AB  - Springs are spatially restricted ecotones usually found at the beginning of a headwaters continuum, which provide distinct environmental conditions, and are inhabited by invertebrate spring specialists called crenobionts. Springs along rivers of higher order with short springbrooks oppose the classical eucrenal-hypocrenalepirhithral continuum and may be colonised differently. Here, 35 rheocrene springs along the river Cvrcka in the Dinaric Karst are investigated, with the aim to identify the role of river connectivity on the species assemblages in springs, and to test whether the large proximity of some springs influences the similarity of their species composition. Species assemblages are strongly dominated by generalist rhithrobiontic taxa, which also occur in the adjacent river. Flooding significantly influences the composition of the species assemblages, with a higher share of rhithrobiontic taxa in flooded springs. Connectivity and distance to the river do not have a significant influence, and spatial proximity is not an indicator for assemblage similarity. The springs are strongly influenced by the river Cvrcka. We conclude that dispersal and colonisation mainly take place via the watercourse corridor by insects in adult stages. Conservation strategies must take into account the special character of riparian springs along large rivers.

AB  - This work aims at deepening the understanding of the mode of action of some of the most prominent perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) by detecting in a realistic way their effects. To this end, after adjusting the exposure media taking into account the biological model employed and the physico-chemical properties of PFCs, we evaluated the toxic effects of PFOA, PFOS and PFNA in a human macrophage cell line (TLT cells) and in zebrafish embryos. We performed such evaluation on individual compounds and mixtures. Acute toxicity was greater for PFOS in zebrafish; however, it was greater for PFNA in TLT cells. PFNA was also the compound producing the greatest levels of oxidative stress, both in zebrafish and TLT cells. Additionally, in both biological systems, it showed a much stronger effect on mixtures in comparison to the others PFCs tested in this work. Mixture studies in zebrafish showed that acute toxicity depended on the concentration and that the mixture was far more toxic than the individual compounds. This study highlights the importance of studying PFCs in realistic conditions on various biological models. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are constantly produced in cells, mainly by mitochondria, as a consequence of aerobic respiration. Most ROS derive from superoxide, which is rapidly converted to hydrogen peroxide. ROS are involved in the regulation of several physiological and pathological processes, and the possibility to measure them simultaneously is needed, when the redox status of the cells is modified by experimental/biological conditions. Flow cytometry is the main technology that generates multiple information at the single cell level in a high-throughput manner, and gives rapid and quantitative measurements of different ROS with high sensitivity and reproducibility. Here, we describe a novel approach to detect simultaneously mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide and mitochondrial superoxide in living cells. The staining has been performed by using the fluorescent dyes MitoSOX Red Mitochondrial Superoxide Indicator, Mitochondria Peroxy Yellow 1, Annexin-V Pacific Blue conjugate, TO-PRO-3 iodide, anti-CD4-APC-Cy7 and -CD8-Pacific Orange mAbs. We used this approach to quantify mitochondrial ROS in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells form patients affected by Down syndrome and age-and sex-matched healthy donors.

AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) tumor spheroids are utilized in cancer research as a more accurate model of the in vivo tumor microenvironment, compared to traditional two-dimensional (2D) cell culture. The spheroid model is able to mimic the effects of cell-cell interaction, hypoxia and nutrient deprivation, and drug penetration. One characteristic of this model is the development of a necrotic core, surrounded by a ring of G1 arrested cells, with proliferating cells on the outer layers of the spheroid. Of interest in the cancer field is how different regions of the spheroid respond to drug therapies as well as genetic or environmental manipulation. We describe here the use of the fluorescence ubiquitination cell cycle indicator (FUCCI) system along with cytometry and image analysis using commercial software to characterize the cell cycle status of cells with respect to their position inside melanoma spheroids. These methods may be used to track changes in cell cycle status, gene/protein expression or cell viability in different sub-regions of tumor spheroids over time and under different conditions.

AB  - It is well documented that using exhaustive chemical extractions is not an effective means of assessing exposure of hydrophobic organic compounds in sediments and that bioavailability-based techniques are an improvement over traditional methods. One technique that has shown special promise as a method for assessing the bioavailability of hydrophobic organic compounds in sediment is the use of Tenax-extractable concentrations. A 6-h or 24-h single-point Tenax-extractable concentration correlates to both bioaccumulation and toxicity. This method has demonstrated effectiveness for several hydrophobic organic compounds in various organisms under both field and laboratory conditions. In addition, a Tenax bioaccumulation model was developed for multiple compounds relating 24-h Tenax-extractable concentrations to oligochaete tissue concentrations exposed in both the laboratory and field. This model has demonstrated predictive capacity for additional compounds and species. Use of Tenax-extractable concentrations to estimate exposure is rapid, simple, straightforward, and relatively inexpensive, as well as accurate. Therefore, this method would be an invaluable tool if implemented in risk assessments. Environ Toxicol Chem 2015;34:1445-1453. (c) 2015 SETAC

AB  - The fate and transport of pathogenic bacteria from wastewater treatment facilities in the Earth's subsurface have attracted extensive concern over recent decades, while the impact of treated-wastewater chemistry on bacterial viability and transport behavior remains unclear. The influence of retention time in effluent from a full-scale municipal wastewater treatment plant on the survival and deposition of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli strains in sand columns was investigated in this paper. In comparison to the bacteria cultivated in nutrient-rich growth media, retention in treated wastewater significantly reduced the viability of all strains. Bacterial surface properties, e.g., zeta potential, hydrophobicity, and surface charges, varied dramatically in treated wastewater, though no universal trend was found for different strains. Retention in treated wastewater effluent resulted in changes in bacterial deposition in sand columns. Longer retention periods in treated wastewater decreased bacterial deposition rates for the strains evaluated and elevated the transport potential in sand columns. We suggest that the wastewater quality should be taken into account in estimating the fate of pathogenic bacteria discharged from wastewater treatment facilities and the risks they pose in the aquatic environment.

AB  - Far field modelling of dredging induced suspended sediment plumes is important while assessing the environmental aspects of dredging. Realistic estimation of source terms, that define the suspended sediment input for far field dredge plume modelling, is key to any assessment. This paper describes a generic method for source term estimation as it is used in practice in the dredging industry. It is based on soil characteristics and dredge production figures, combined with empirically derived, equipment and condition specific 'source term fractions'. A source term fraction relates the suspended fine sediment that is available for dispersion, to the amount of fine sediment that is present in the soil and the way it is dredged. The use of source term fractions helps to circumvent modelling of complicated near field processes, at least initially, enabling quick assessments. When further detail is required and extra information is available, the applicability of the source term fractions can/should be evaluated by characterisation monitoring and/or near field modelling. An example of a fictitious yet realistic dredging project demonstrates how two different work methods can trigger two distinctly different types of stress to the environmental system in terms of sediment concentration and duration.

AB  - Bio-monitoring, in the control strategies for pollution, has several advantages over other tests in aquatic organisms. Bio-effects may link the bioavailability of the compounds of interest with their concentration at target organs and intrinsic toxicity. Potential harmful effects of 2,4-difluoroaniline (DFA), on a 96-hour acute static test, on adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were followed. According to OECD 203: Fish Acute Toxicity Test, LC50 was determined using 70 adult zebrafish AB strain and 14 zebrafish as control group, to evaluate the effects and action at different concentrations of DFA. Obtained data were analyzed using Minitab Statistical Software as Goodness-of-Fit correlation tests. Logarithmic value obtained for LC50 was of 2.30311, which corresponded to LC50 of 200.96 mg/L. Results from the performed work reinforce the idea of the zebrafish adults as simple and easy reproducible model organisms in ecotoxicology. Although there are more comprehensive tests available, this particular one is both rapid and relatively cheap. The results obtained for LC50, in our opinion, are useful and applicable to a large number of substances, especially in field conditions when overall effectiveness is more important than meticulousness of the method.

AB  - The freshwater luminescent bacteria Vibrio-qinghaiensis sp.-Q67 test and the Vicia faba root tip test associated with solid-phase extraction were applied for cytotoxicity and genotoxicity assessment of organic substances in three rivers, two lakes and effluent flows from two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Xi'an, China. Although the most seriously polluted river with high chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC) showed high cytotoxicity (expressed as TII50, the toxicity impact index) and genotoxicity (expressed as RMCN, the relative frequency of micronucleus), no correlative relation was found between the ecotoxicity and organic content of the water samples. However, there was a linear correlative relation between TII50 and RMCN for most water samples except that from the Zaohe River, which receives discharge from WWTP and untreated industrial wastewaters. The ecotoxicity of the organic toxicants in the Chanhe River and Zaohe River indicated that cytotoxic and genotoxic effects were related to the pollutant source. The TII50 and RMCN were also found to correlate roughly to the dissolved oxygen concentration of the water. Sufficient dissolved oxygen in surface water is thus proved to be an indicator of a healthy water environmental condition.

AB  - A simple and rapid SPE-HPLC-DAD method was developed for the determination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in surface samples. A C18 column (250 x 4.6 mm i.d., 5 mu m) and a similar pre-column were used for the separation at 25 degrees C, using 20 mM ammonium acetate buffer solution pH 4.7: methanol (95:5, v/v) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. Under optimal conditions, the linearity was 0.9993, in a range of 25-100 mu g/mL. The limits of detection and quantification were 5 and 25 mu g/mL, respectively. The relative standard deviation (%) was below 15 % for the evaluation of precision and the mean recovery was 77 %. The extracting procedure followed HPLC analysis showed their applicability in order to examine 5-FU in surfaces samples. Moreover, it could be suggested that the developed method is an alternative in the monitoring of the occupational exposure to antineoplastic agents, once the analyte in question is considered an indicator for this purpose.

AB  - A new cell primo-culture method was developed for the benthic diatom community isolated from biofilm sampled in rivers. The approach comprised three steps: (1) scraping biofilm from river pebbles, (2) diatom isolation from biofilm, and (3) diatom community culture. With a view to designing a method able to stimulate the growth of diatoms, to limit the development of other microorganisms, and to maintain in culture a community similar to the original natural one, different factors were tested in step 3: cell culture medium (Chu No 10 vs Freshwater "WC" medium modified), cell culture vessel, and time of culture. The results showed that using Chu No 10 medium in an Erlenmeyer flask for cell culture was the optimal method, producing enough biomass for ecotoxicological tests as well as minimising development of other microorganisms. After 96 h of culture, communities differed from the original communities sampled in the two rivers studied. Species tolerant of eutrophic or saprobic conditions were favoured during culture. This method of diatom community culture affords the opportunity to assess, in vitro, the effects of different chemicals or effluents (water samples and industrial effluents) on diatom communities, as well as on diatom cells, from a wide range of perspectives.

AB  - The role of charcoal as a palaeoenvironmental indicator has never been fully or adequately explained. Charcoal fragments are often interpreted as evidence for natural fires caused by lightning strike during drought or dry climatic conditions. Generally, no evidence is presented to show this to be the case. The frequency of lightning strike in New Zealand is not high and the extent to which it is a causal factor in generating forest fire is questioned. The assumption is often made that charcoal fragments found in sedimentary deposits are local, or at least reasonably local, in origin. This assumption is being challenged. Fine charcoal fragments appear to be transported regionally within New Zealand. It is highly likely that fine charcoal fragments are being transported from Australia, both by thermal convection during fires and during dust storm events, to be deposited into New Zealand sediments. The consequences of this in interpreting New Zealand's palaeo-history requires researchers to, at the very least, provide charcoal counts within size parameters. This is particularly so for archaeologists who would definitely need to show the presence of large charcoal fragments before interpreting the possibility of people in the landscape.

AB  - Lipid reserves are a particularly important attribute of fishes because they have a large influence on growth, reproduction and survival. This study analyses the lipid content of red mullet (Mullus barbatus) pre-spawners in three different areas of the northwestern Mediterranean in relation to trawling activities and river runoff. The muscle lipid was considered as an indicator of the somatic condition of individuals whilst the gonad lipid was used as a proxy of the energy invested in reproduction. The results show that fish with the highest muscle lipid levels inhabited the area where fishing impact was lowest. Since the abundance and biomass of polychaetes, which represent the main food source for red mullet, were found to be lower in trawled Zones than in unfished ones, we suggest that differences in the muscle lipid levels between areas might be attributed to variation in prey abundance in relation to fishing impact. However, no impact of river runoff on lipid reserves of red mullet was observed. The results also show that muscle and gonad lipid reserves are not related to each other during pre-spawning.

AB  - Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bacterium with a biphasic life cycle that takes place entirely within a membrane-bound vacuole termed an inclusion. The chlamydial inclusion is non-fusogenic with endosomal or lysosomal compartments but intersects a pathway involved in transport of sphingomyelin from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. The physical conditions within the mature chlamydial inclusion are unknown. We used ratiometric imaging with membrane-permeant, ion-selective fluorescent dyes for microanalyis of the physical environment within the inclusion. Determination of H+, Na+, K+ and Ca2+ concentrations using CFDA (carboxy fluorescein diacetate) or BCECF-AM (2' ,7' -bis (2-carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester, SBFI-AM, PBFI-AM and fura-PE3-acetomethoxyester (Fura-PE3-AM), respectively, indicated that all ions assayed within the lumenal space of the inclusion approximated the concentrations within the cytoplasm. Stimulation of purinergic receptors by addition of extracellular ATP triggered a dynamic Ca2+ response that occurred simultaneously within the cytoplasm and interior of the inclusion. The chlamydial inclusion thus appears to be freely permeable to cytoplasmic ions. These results have implications for nutrient acquisition by chlamydiae and may contribute to the non-fusogenicity of the inclusion with endocytic compartments.

AB  - Species of the marine nematode genus Pontonema have been found to dominate the macrobenthos under abnormally high conditions of particulate organic enrichment. Populations from organically enriched habitats in six localities(Kiel fjord, Germany; the Garroch Head sewage-sludge dump ground in the Firth of Clyde, Scotland; Cornelian Bay, N.E. England; the Tyne estuary, N.E. England; Sete, N.W. Mediterranean, France; Blanes Bay, N.W. Mediterranean, Spain) have been compared. Multivariate analyses of 16 morphometric characters in males, and 13 in females, shows that each population is significantly different morphologically from every other population. However, there is morphological overlap between the populations, and it is considered pragmatic to recognize three species in this group, based on a few stable morphological characters: P. vulgare (Bastian, 1865) from the Baltic, P. alaeospicula Bett and Moore 1988 from the UK sites, and P. mediterranea sp. nov. from the Mediterranean. P. mediterranea sp. nov. is described. The species were not found to have established sympatry in this study, unlike many other opportunistic taxa from organically enriched habitats, and the significance of this is discussed.

AB  - A new type of phenyl substituted ormosils as a matrix for oxygen-sensitive micro-optodes is described. The new ormosils combine features of classical polymers such as solubility in organic solvents and those of sol-gel glasses such as mechanical stability and a porous structure. They make possible a simple and fast fabrication of microsensors with reproducible properties. The influence of the conditions during the polymerisation process (precursor composition and thermal treatment) on the sensing properties has been studied in detail. Oxygen-sensitive films with ruthenium(II)-tris-(4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline) and platinum(II)-octaethylporphyrin as indicators were characterised with respect to their mechanical and photophysical properties. Photostability, oxygen sensitivity, response behaviour and signal intensities of the sensing films and the micro-optodes were examined. Micro-optodes based on the new sensing materials are fast responding, photostable and can be produced with a sufficient batch to batch reproducibility. Compared to previously described oxygen micro-optodes, where polystyrene was used as immobilisation matrix, the new sensors can be autoclaved and show favourable properties such as a faster response and a higher sensitivity. They possess many potential applications in medical and biological research.

KW  - NEUTRON ACTIVATION ANALYSIS
AB  - Neutron activation analysis of samples of the marine phanerogam Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile, collected from a reference zone in Port-Cros National Park of the Mediterranean coast of France, detected 29 elements, bringing the total known elements in this plant to 43.  Significant differences were found in the distribution of these elements in the leaves and flowers, as well as among the different types of leaves in the foliar bundle.  The effect of pollution related to maritime activities was investigated by comparing samples from the reference zone with samples from a bay overcrowded with pleasure boats.  Samples taken in the reference zone under the same conditions before and after the Chernobyl accident were compared to identify elements attributable to the nuclear power industry and in particular to that accident.  The ability of Posidonia oceanica to concentrate elements from sea-water, notably those known for their biotoxicity, shows the advantage of using this plant as a biological indicator for this type of pollution.  The data indicated that the reliability of the results obtained is closely dependent on the sampling methods, particularly when using a sensitive and high-resolution method such as neutron activation.

AB  - Promoting and incorporating the concept of sustainable development and social responsibility into corporate operations and stakeholders' growing demands for non-financial information, have conditioned the emergence of sustainability reporting. Specifically, stakeholders arc louder and louder in the requirement that external reports contain, in addition to financial indicators, criteria related to the environment and society, in order to be able to assess the efficiency of company management and the company's care for the environment and society in which it operates. In line with the above, the main research objective in this paper is to identify possible differences in the number of published reports between old and new EU members, companies of different sizes, and companies from different sectors. Empirical research uses limited version of online Global Reporting Initiative database. Data analysis is done using primarily descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests. The research results point to a statistically significant difference in the number of published sustainability reports between old and new-EU members, as well as that the great influence on report publication comes from sector affiliation and the company size. The main research conclusion is that legal, political, and economic situation in the country affects the number of published sustainability reports.

AB  - Polarimetric Doppler frequency-modulated continuous-wave weather radar produces a tremendous amount of data during the observation of atmospheric conditions. Using conventional signal processing method, the beat signals are sampled at Nyquist rate, so that the range signal can be reconstructed perfectly. We propose compressive sampling (CS) technique to sample and reduce the data simultaneously by exploring the sparsity of the beat signal in transform domain. Reducing the number of the beat signal and the transform coefficients are natural choices, because sparse signals will be obtained by inverse Fourier transforming the beat signals. The proposed techniques are evaluated by constructing the plan position indicator of reflectivity and mean Doppler velocity measurements from real weather polarimetric data. Compared to the conventional method, the CS polarimetric Doppler processing significantly reduce the number of the data while pertaining important weather information. We show that the proposed method works properly to quantify and classify the precipitation, mainly when the number of the samples is above 25% of its original.

KW  - INDICATORS
AB  - Background: Although the Kruger National Park (KNP) is a protected area, it is not exempted from anthropogenically induced impacts, which often compromise river water flow and quality. Measures of river water quality in South Africa have conventionally been based on water chemistry as well as different ecological indicator groups such as fish and macroinvertebrates. Diatoms have been shown to be useful indicators of changes in water quality resulting from pollution and land-use impacts.
   Objectives: To determine the applicability of diatoms for hind-casting water quality in the KNP and to compare recent diatom community composition with those from the 1980s.
   Methods: In this study, pH and electrical conductivity (EC) were used to evaluate temporal changes in water quality of three rivers within the KNP. Additionally, we made use of historic diatom samples from three of the five perennial rivers to evaluate if diatom communities reflected changes in water conditions between 1983 and 2015.
   Results: Diatom community structure was significantly different between 1983 and 2015. Diatom-based index scores (SPI) indicated an improvement in water quality for the Letaba and Olifants rivers.
   Conclusion: Diatoms were shown to be useful indicators of current water quality and are also useful for determining temporal changes.

AB  - Proteins of muscle tissue affect not only the nutritional and biological value of meat, but also predetermine the condition of physico-chemical, structural-mechanical and technological parameters of raw materials (stickiness, viscosity, water binding capacity, pH, etc.) and finished products (juiciness, delicacy, output). They are different in structure, biological functions, physicochemical indicators, including solubility. Using sequential extraction of muscle proteins with water, saline and alkaline it is possible to obtain different protein fractions. Differentiation of proteins by solubility (water-soluble, soluble in salts, alkaline-soluble, albumins, globulins), fractional composition (sarcoplasmic, myofibrillar and connective tissue), peculiarities of the biochemical structure (high-grade and inferior). Protein extracts of muscle tissue of wild and domestic animals obtained during sequential extraction are used to quantify the protein content of a certain fraction, as well as to research the properties of proteins. In this scientific article the comparative analysis of functional and technological emulsions properties of cooked sausages is given. Cooked sausages are manufactured according to the national standard. Hydrated rice and flax flour formulations in a volume of 7% were used instead of semigreasy pork. The rheological properties of cooked sausages' meat emulsions have been studied. The vegetable ingredients addition into the formulation of cooked sausages has been justified in order to stabilize the protein-in-oil emulsion.

AB  - Microorganisms are useful biological indicators of toxicity and play a key role in the functioning of healthy soils. In this study, we investigated the residual toxicity of hydrocarbons in aged contaminated soils and determined the extent of microbial community recovery during in-situ bioremediation at subantarctic Macquarie Island. Previously identified microbial indicators of hydrocarbon toxicity were used to understand interactions between hydrocarbon concentrations, soil physicochemical parameters and the microbial community. Despite the complexity of the field sites, which included active fuel storage areas with high levels of soil heterogeneity, multiple spill events and variable fuel sources, we observed consistent microbial community traits associated with exposure to high concentrations of hydrocarbons. These included; reductions in alpha diversity, inhibition of nitrification potential and a reduction in the ratio of oligotrophic to copiotrophic species. These observed responses and the sensitivity of microbial communities in the field, were comparable to sensitivity estimates obtained in a previous lab-based mesocosm study with hydrocarbon spiked soils. This study provides a valuable and often missing link between the quite disparate conditions of controlled lab-based spiking experiments and the complexity presented by 'real-world' contaminated field sites.

AB  - The management of industrial solid waste demands the establishment of suitable management systems. Such systems must take into consideration multiple factors that allow selecting the most adequate treatment techniques among the ones available. The selection of these techniques is a complex process that not only depends on factors inherent to the treatment or the waste itself, but also on other factors. For this reason, this study analyses the influence of location on the management of an industrial solid waste such as LD sludge. Firstly, we used a methodology developed in a previous part of this study, that can identify six treatment solutions, then, a set of environmental, regulatory and socioeconomic indicators are chosen. Going a step further in this investigation, proves through the application of the methodology in five different locations, that environmental characteristics influence the final treatment solution for the same waste. According to this, two sets of groups can be identified for the best treatment solution: one in which the highest score is 1 A Ceramization and another in which the final result is 1 B Vitrification.

AB  - Lipids are hydrocarbons comprised of long-chain fatty acids and are found in all living things. In the environment, microorganisms degrade them to obtain energy using esterases and lipases. These enzymes are nowadays used in different industrial applications. We report isolation of 24 bacteria with esteresic and lipolytic activity from Lake Magadi, Kenya. The isolates were characterised using morphological, biochemical, and molecular methods. Isolates grew at an optimum salt concentration of 5-8% (w/v), pH range of 8.0-9.0, and temperature range of 35-40 degrees C. The isolates were positive for esterase and lipase assay as well as other extracellular enzymes. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene showed that the isolates were affiliated to the genus Bacillus, Alkalibacterium, Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, Halomonas, and Alkalilimnicola. None of the bacterial isolates produced antimicrobial agents, and all of them were resistant to trimethoprim and nalidixic acid but susceptible to streptomycin, amoxillin, chloramphenicol, and cefotaxime. Growth at elevated pH, salt, and temperature is an indicator that the enzymes from these organisms could function well under haloalkaline conditions. Therefore, Lake Magadi could be a good source of isolates with the potential to produce unique biocatalysts for the biotechnology industry.

AB  - A field experiment was performed in which five different Cotinus coggygria seedling populations were subjected to both drought and well-irrigated treatments. The phenotypic plasticity of leaf and fine root functional traits related with morphology, biomass allocation and seedling overall performance (i.e., seedling total dry biomass) were evaluated. The results showed the plasticity of specific fine root length, root length ratio, root length/leaf area, root biomass fraction, root biomass/leaf biomass and leaf biomass fraction were the key determinants driving the plasticity of seedling overall performance. The correlation between the plasticity of leaf area ratio and fine root length ratio was an indicator of the trade-off between the development of organs required to obtain resources from the light, and those required for soil resource uptake. Seedlings from one of the populations exhibited a relatively low total dry biomass in drought environment, but showed significantly more resources to water uptake from the soil by investing in fine root growth, at the expense of leaf growth, enhancing their potential for better acclimation to future predicted drought events in the context of global warming.

AB  - The recent scientific progress in understanding the hierarchical nature of the lithosphere and its dynamics based on systematic earthquake monitoring helps in designing an improved earthquake forecasting strategy. This study presents a detailed multi-precursory analysis of a shallow, moderate Phalla earthquake (July 24, 2015; Mw 5.1; Depth=10km) near Islamabad, Pakistan, 24km away from the monitoring site within the context of earthquake forecasting. The instrumental setup (soil radon monitor and space-ground-based ionosonde) for precursory monitoring of earthquake activity is installed at the foothills of Margalla along the Main Boundary Thrust. For identification of abnormal behavior of ionospheric parameters and soil radon flux, a statistical criterion consistent with other studies is used. Our analyses reveal the effect of pre- and co-seismic changes in the form of anomalous behavior of local ionospheric perturbations (2-15days prior), soil radon flux (3days prior), and seismic quiescence related to Phalla earthquake. The solar/geomagnetic conditions and meteorological parameters remained normal during the anomalous periods. Moreover, multi-precursory approach adopted in this study for earthquake prediction/forecasting can serve as a potential indicator of seismic activity.

AB  - The rice arable system is of importance to both society and the environment. The emergence of rice paddies was a crucial step in the transition from pre-domestic cultivation to systematic land use and management. However, many aspects of the formation of rice farming systems remain unclear. An important reason is the lack of reliable methods for identifying early rice paddies. One possible means of remedying this knowledge deficit is through analysis of phytolith assemblages, which are closely related to their parent plant communities. In this study, phytolith assemblages from 27 surface soil samples from wild rice fields, 91 surface soil samples from modern rice paddies, and 50 soil samples from non-rice fields were analysed to establish a discriminant function. This discriminant function enabled classification of 89.3% of the samples into appropriate groups. Further, the results suggested that phytolith assemblages can be used to identify rice fields and differentiate between wild rice fields and domesticated rice fields. The method was demonstrated to be an effective way of utilising the large amounts of unidentifiable phytoliths discovered at archaeological sites to provide a modern analogue that may be a valuable key to unlocking the past.

AB  - This paper intends to discuss the economical performances and CO2 reduction potential of two CO2-based dimethyl carbonate (DMC) production processes through rigorous process simulation. One of them is the direct production process with addition of butylene oxide (BO) as dehydrating agent (DIR-BO porocess), while the other is the indirect production process through ethylene carbonate (EC) as an intermediate (IND-EC process). Both processes are systematically optimized and heat integrated. From economical evaluation, the IND-EC process exhibits economical attractiveness, while the DIR-BO process does not. We suggest that once the reaction rate of the DIR-BO process can be improved, the overall economic performance of the direct process can be much better. From the aspect of CO2 reduction, the net CO2 emissions throughout both processes are calculated. We found that DIR-EO process is largely carbon positive, with CO2 emission of 2.242 (kg CO2/kg DMC), yet for the IND-EC process, it is near carbon neutral, with CO2 emission of 0.049 (kg CO2/kg DMC). Thus, from the aspect of achieving CO2 reduction, converting it into DMC provides limited benefits.

AB  - Continuously increasing application of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) requires information on their safety and performance under biological conditions. Assessment of AgNPs in biological systems is also related to availability of robust toxicological methods for evaluation of toxic potential of AgNPs and information on their physicochemical state. Silver nanoparticles were subjected to action of simulated saliva, gastric and intestinal fluids, appropriately supplemented with digestive enzymes pepsin or pancreatin. The behaviour of AgNPs was determined using dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy, and their toxicity as well as capability to induce inflammatory reactions were assessed using reconstructed human tissue models (EpiOral, EpiGingival, EpiIntestinal). The study revealed that during exposure to the fluids, AgNPs size and morphology changed and depended on composition and pH of the respective fluid. If present, the change in terms of growth of AgNPs size occurred immediately after contact of AgNPs with the respective fluid and continued with prolonged time of contact. A pilot study on reconstituted human tissue models revealed low toxicity and inflammatory effects of AgNPs and confirmed the suitability of 3-D models for toxicological studies including bioavailability.

AB  - In this paper, experimental support is provided showing the importance of polyaromaticity on the elastic properties of bituminous binders. Especially the size of the polyaromatic structures seems to play a crucial role. The observations indicate that larger conjugated aromatic structures provide stronger interactions and relate to the elastic behaviour at longer loading times or up to higher temperatures, while smaller aromatic structures determine more the elastic behaviour at short loading times or at low temperatures. In addition to aromatic interactions, natural wax can, upon crystallization, also induce increased elastic effects, especially at low frequencies. A large variety of binders was investigated: bitumen from straight distillation, visbreaking, solvent deasphalting and oxidation were included in the sample set. Average levels of aromaticity were determined by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and by refractive index measurements. Chromatography combined with UV-visible absorption spectroscopy was used as an indicator of the average size of the aromatic structures. Rheological properties were determined using a dynamic shear rheometer, in a temperature range from 0 up to 90 A degrees C. Good relations were observed between the phase angle measurements, at specific test conditions of frequency and temperature, and UV-vis absorption levels at specific wavelengths.

AB  - The combination of flood modelling and socio-economic analysis was used to determine the flood vulnerability of the towns of Santa Maria and Mabitac, Laguna, Philippines. Geograhic Information System (GIS) -hazard mapping and vulnerability-resilience indicator were used to assess the interaction of a flood hazard and the socio-economic conditions of the people in the area. The Hydrologic Engineering Center Hydrologic Modelling System (HEC-HMS) and Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) modelling system was used to derive the synthetic hydrograph and delineated the inundated areas in the flood-prone barangays (village) of Santa Maria and Mabitac. The flood modelling predicted the flood depths in seven out of ten communities and delineated the inundated barangays of the two towns. The social vulnerability analysis indicated that Barangays (village) Jose Rizal, Masinao, Adia and Coralan in Santa Maria and Barangays San Antonio, Libis ng Nayon, Bayanihan, Pag-asa, Nanguma and Lambac in Mabitac are very vulnerable to flooding. The study revealed environment-related aspects that are helpful in reducing the impacts of flooding such as, strengthening the flood warning system and emergency response capacity through flood hazard zonation mapping and rehabilitation of the watershed in Santa Maria.

AB  - Interstudy variation among bioavailability studies is a primary deterrent to a universal methodology to assess metals bioavailability to soil-dwelling organisms and is largely the result of specific experimental conditions unique to independent studies. Accordingly, two datasets were established from relevant literature; one includes data from studies related to bioaccumulation (total obs = 520), while the other contains data from studies related to toxicity (totalobs = 1264). Experimental factors that affected toxicity and bioaccumulation independent of the effect of soil chemical/physical properties were statistically apportioned from the variation attributed to soil chemical/physical properties for both datasets using a linear mixed model. Residual bioaccumulation data were then used to develop a non-parametric regression tree whereby bootstrap and cross-validation techniques were used to internally validate the resulting decision rule. A similar approach was employed with the toxicity dataset as an independent external validation. A validated decision rule is presented as a quantitative assessment tool that characterizes typical aerobic soils in terms of their potential to sequester common divalent cationic metal contaminants and mitigate their bioavailability to soil-dwelling biota.

AB  - This study applied the Water Poverty Index (WPI) in border colonias of west Texas. The colonias are mostly unincorporated communities located primarily in New Mexico and Texas along the border with Mexico and are characterized by high poverty rates and sub-standard living conditions. In Texas, access to drinking water and sanitation services has been identified as one of the most significant determinants of health in over 350 colonias with about 50,000 residents. The WPI is a multidimensional measure that links household welfare with water availability which has been applied primarily in water poor countries. WPI components were identified and prioritized by a wide range of state stakeholders. This study demonstrated that the WPI can be an effective tool in integrating physical, social, economic and environmental information and in determining priorities associated with the water situation in wealthy countries with water poor communities such as colonias. These results highlight the need to classify the water necessities of colonias using a comprehensive but simple assessment tool that integrates several factors and is not based solely on infrastructure. They provide information that can be used by policy makers to provide assistance to Texas border communities with the greatest need.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the influence of inorganic ions on the aggregation and deposition (adsorption) behavior of human adenovirus (HAdV). Experiments were conducted to determine the surface charge and size of HAdV and viral adsorption capacity of sand in different salt conditions. The interfacial potential energy was calculated using extended Derjaguin and Landau, Verwey and Overbeek (XDLVO) and steric hindrance theories to interpret the experimental results. Results showed that different compositions of inorganic ions have minimal effect on varying the iso-electric point pH (pH(lep)) of HAdV (ranging from 3.5 to 4.0). Divalent cations neutralized/shielded virus surface charge much more effectively than monovalent cations at pH above pH(lep). Consequently, at neutral pH the presence of divalent cations enhanced the aggregation of HAdV as well as its adsorption to sand. Aggregation and adsorption behaviors generally agreed with XDLVO theory; however, in the case of minimal electrostatic repulsion, steric force by virus' fibers can increase the energy barrier and distance of secondary minimum, resulting in limited aggregation and deposition. Overall, our results indicated that subsurface water with low hardness residing in sandy soils may have a higher potential of being contaminated by HAdV.

AB  - Pharmacoeconomic analysis is aimed at supporting choices between alternatives available for the efficient management of specific conditions. Aim of the paper is to provide an overview of the main features of pharmacoeconomic evaluations, with the objective of providing the reader with the basic tools necessary to read and interpret or to design and conduct a pharmacoeconomic analysis in RA and in other rheumatic diseases. The paragraphs will cover in detail the definition of health economic evaluation and pharmacoeconomics, the alternatives to be compared, the perspective of the analysis, costs and effects (presenting in detail direct costs and effects, indirect costs and effects, intangible costs and effects and source of data), and pharmacoeconomic techniques.
   Pharmacoeconomic analyses have to be conducted accurately to provide valuable information to guide the choice of options representing the best value for money without compromising the quality of care delivered. For this reason, as these analyses generally present some limitations, a very close and strong relationship between pharmacoeconomists and clinicians is crucial both in the design of pharmacoeconomic studies and in the interpretation of their results, and also in the development of more satisfactory methods and indicators.

AB  - Our aim was to investigate the oviposition and larval habitats of the saltwater mosquito Aedes vigilax (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) in a mangrove forest system in subtropical Queensland, Australia. Eggshells (indicators of oviposition) and larvae were sampled in three habitat classes that were depicted in a schematic model. Two classes were in depressions or basins, either with hummocks or dense pneumatophore substrates, both of which retained water after tidal flooding. The third class was in freely flushed mangroves that corresponded with more frequent tidal connections than the depression classes. ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer tests were used to analyze the data. The null hypotheses were rejected: the hummock class was a significant habitat based on both eggshell and larval data. The conclusion was that mosquito production in the mangrove system was distributed unevenly between habitat classes, and that the hummock class had conditions suited to the requirements of the immature stages of Ae. vigilax. This research has the potential to inform mosquito management strategies by focusing treatment on the problem habitats and underpinning habitat modifications including reducing water retention in the basins.

AB  - There has been an accelerated expansion of deserts in the past five decades. Recent data reveal that the atmogenically formed organic compound, trichloroacetic acid (TCA) is a contributory factor in addition to anthropogenic and natural sources. The aim of this study was to use TCA as an indicator for the possible occurrence of C-2-chloroacetic acids; to assess the burden on the vegetation by using pine needles as a bio-indicator system and to deliberate on the possible role of TCA in the dynamics of the vegetation in southern Africa. Field experiments conducted on pine trees and on C-3 and C-4 crop plants under controlled laboratory conditions, have revealed that plants could be influenced positively or negatively by TCA. To obtain an integrated assessment of the pollution emission over a time span of at least one year, two-year-old pine needles of different Pinus species were used as a bio-indicator for TCA pollution at different measuring sites. The data of our investigation clearly indicate that areas exist in South Africa where the vegetation is burdened by ecotoxicologically relevant TCA contents comparable to those in central Europe and southern Russia where TCA was shown to play a role in the destabilisation of the steppe vegetation.

AB  - Based on architectural element analysis of sandbar-levee deposits an attempt has been made to identify recurring floods in the alluvial rivers. Point bar deposits characterized by low-angled lateral accretion (LA) elements exhibit some channel-ward steeply dipping (19-20degrees) discordant surfaces. These high-angled surfaces are erosional and show change of facies across them. Such discordant planes present within the point bar deposits most probably indicate phases of exceptional floods, when the bar was mostly eroded and remodelled under high-energy conditions. Similarly, in the braid bar deposits superimposed bar-building events separated either by mud drapes or marked erosional contacts are testimony to high-energy floods. At flood times, a new bar may form and can migrate over pre-existing sand bar, forming huge sandflat. Alternatively, a new channel may develop cutting across the existing bar complex producing a channel bar having a different orientation. Multi-storied levee deposits developed at the bank of the channels, and characterized by decimeter to meter scale fining-up sequences, are the best indicators of exceptionally large floods overtopping the channels. The flood events are commonly separated by erosional contacts and mottled horizons containing organic matter, root burrows and faecal-pellet filled earthworm burrow network.

AB  - Hierarchical crop growth models can contribute significantly to land quality research because the yield gap between the estimated optimum and the actual crop production has been identified as a major land quality indicator. This study describes a three-level, hierarchical crop production model, simulating radiation-thermal, water-limited and natural production potentials of annual crops. Input requirements have been kept low to ensure its applicability to developing regions, which often have access only to limited data. The simplicity of this model also has disadvantages: inconsistencies have been reported when applying this model in semiarid regions, which are characterized by very irregular rainfall patterns. Revision of the water balance, which simulates the availability of water, was required. The modified model was validated using the experimental yields of maize and sunflower in Guquka, a semiarid region of South Africa. Yields were estimated very well, possible improvements to crop production were identified and implications for land-use planning highlighted. Yield gap analysis revealed that radiation, sunshine and temperature are favourable for crop production, but the heavy dependence on rainfall makes the region very vulnerable to drought, with devastating impact on yields. The generally low chemical soil fertility further reduces crop performance.

AB  - Depression is often diagnosed in patients nearing the end of their lives and medication or psychotherapy is prescribed. In many cases this is appropriate. However, it is widely agreed that a health care professional should treat sick persons so as to improve their condition as they define improvement. This raises questions about the contexts in which treatment of depression in late life is appropriate. This article reviews a problematic case concerning the appropriateness of treatment in light of the literature in bioethics. Specific attention is paid to the concept of authenticity and the role of suffering. Suffering is often the result of a situation in which one's self is damaged. In some circumstances, this suffering should not be seen as a symptom of illness but as a reflection, in a difficult life context, of the individual's authentic nature. Assessment of depression in the elderly must go beyond a symptom list and must consider both the context of the individual's situation and his or her authentic self. When the symptoms reflect the individual's assessment of the situation in the context of the authentic self, they may be "appropriate." However, even when the symptoms are appropriate, if they interfere with life assessment and adjustment, treatment should be considered.

AB  - This paper describes some new approaches for enhancing infrared thermometry (IRT) as a technique for detecting stomatal closure as a measure of plant water stress in humid environments. Although infrared thermometry has been widely used in arid climates for detecting plant stress (as indicated by stomatal closure) and for irrigation scheduling it has been found to be less reliable in more cooler humid climates. The use of wet and dry reference surfaces to reduce the method's sensitivity to environmental variation is described and indexes based on IRT measurements of the temperatures of individual leaves and of reference surfaces in the same environment are evaluated. Both an index that corresponds to Idso's original crop water stress index, but based on 'wet' and 'dry' reference leaves, and an index that is linearly related to leaf conductance were derived and shown to be closely related to measured leaf conductance in runner bean crops under a range of conditions. Various types of reference surface were evaluated and the use of non-transpiring and wet real leaves was found to be particularly convenient. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hypotheses that dissolved organic carbon (DOG) and electrochemical charge affect the rate of methylmercury [CH3Hg(I)] synthesis by modulating the availability of ionic mercury [Hg(II)] to bacteria were tested by using a mer-lux bioindicator (O. Selifonova, R, Burlage, and T, Barkay, Appl, Environ, Microbiol, 59:3083-3090, 1993), A decline in Hg(II)-dependent light production was observed in the presence of increasing concentrations of DOG, and this decline was more pronounced at pH 7 than at pH 5, suggesting that DOC is a factor controlling the bioavailability of Hg(LI). A thermodynamic model (MINTEQA2) was used to select assay conditions that clearly distinguished among various Hg(II) species, By using this approach, it was shown that negatively charged forms of mercuric chloride (HgCl3-/HgCl42-) induced less light production than the electrochemically neutral form (HgCl2), and no difference was observed between the two neutral forms, HgCl2 and Hg(OH)(2), These results suggest that the negative charge of Hg(II) species reduces their availability to bacteria and may be one reason why accumulation of CH3Hg(I) is more often reported to occur in freshwater than in estuarine and marine biota.

CP  - 3rd International Symposium, IGCP Project 321 - Gondwana Dispersion and Asian Accretion
AB  - Carbonate rocks in the Phatthalung area and others in Peninsular Thailand have been known as the Permian Rat Purl Limestone. The study area is characterized by several isolated limestone mountains and is located in Phatthalung province. Micropaleontological study of these carbonate rocks indicates that they should be assigned a late Early to Late Triassic age. The Chaiburi Formation is newly proposed and divided into three members: the Phukhaothong Dolomite, Chiak Limestone and Phanomwang Limestone in ascending order. The Phukhaothong Dolomite consists of thickly bedded to massive dolomite and yields Neospathodus kummeli Sweet, N. waageni Sweet, N. cfr. waageni Sweet and other conodonts that indicate Dienerian to Smithian (Early Triassic). The Chiak Limestone Member consists of bedded and laminated limestone with intercalated thin chert layers and nodules. This limestone commonly yields Early Triassic to Middle Triassic conodonts such as Neospathodus timorensis (Nogami) and Neospathodus kockeli (Tatge), both reliable indicators of latest Spathian to early Anisian, and rare occurrences of Neogondolella bulgarica (Budurov and Stefanov), an indicator of the middle Anisian. The Phanomwang Limestone Member is mostly massive limestone with intercalated reef limestone (coral buildups) and yields abundant fossils that indicate Carnian (Late Triassic). Microfacies analysis and stratigraphic sequences of carbonate rocks in this area show the gradual change of depositional environment from low to high energy conditions.

AB  - The health assessment index (HAI) is an extension and refinement of a previously published field necropsy system. The HAI is a quantitative index that allows statistical comparisons of fish health among data sets. Index variables are assigned numerical values based on the degree of severity or damage incurred by an organ or tissue from environmental stressors. This approach has been used to evaluate the general health status of fish populations in a wide range of reservoir types in the Tennessee River basin (North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Kentucky), in Hartwell Reservoir (Georgia, South Carolina) that is contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls, and in the Pigeon River (Tennessee, North Carolina) that receives effluents from a bleached kraft mill. The ability of the HAI to accurately characterize the health of fish in these systems was evaluated by comparing this index to other types of fish health measures (contaminant, bioindicator, and reproductive analysis) made at the same time as the HAI. In all cases, the HAI demonstrated the same pattern of fish health status between sites as did each of the other more sophisticated health assessment methods. The HAI has proven to be a simple and inexpensive means of rapidly assessing general fish health in field situations.

AB  - Seagrass ecosystems exist throughout Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs). Despite this area covering nearly 8% of the global ocean, information on seagrass distribution, biogeography, and status remains largely absent from the scientific literature. We confirm 16 seagrass species occur across 17 of the 22 PICTs with the highest number in Melanesia, followed by Micronesia and Polynesia respectively. The greatest diversity of seagrass occurs in Papua New Guinea (13 species), and attenuates eastward across the Pacific to two species in French Polynesia. We conservatively estimate seagrass extent to be 1446.2 km2, with the greatest extent (84%) in Melanesia. We find seagrass condition in 65% of PICTs increasing or displaying no discernible trend since records began. Marine conservation across the region overwhelmingly focuses on coral reefs, with seagrass ecosystems marginalised in conservation legislation and policy. Traditional knowledge is playing a greater role in managing local seagrass resources and these approaches are having greater success than contemporary conservation approaches. In a world where the future of seagrass ecosystems is looking progressively dire, the Pacific Islands appears as a global bright spot, where pressures remain relatively low and seagrass more resilient.

AB  - Wastewater is the remainder of an activity released in the liquid form. Wastewater product is feared to have negative influence on the environmental balance; therefore, it is necessary to measure the quality standards of wastewater as a reference in the disposal and treatment. Bioremediation is an environmentally friendly technology utilizing microorganisms as agents in the process of cleaning or restoring wastewater conditions. The use of microorganism services can reduce the concentration of organic waste into simpler organic compounds by converting organic compounds into CO2, CH4, H-2, and H2S, as well as water and energy intended for the process of growth and production of microorganisms in the remediation process. This study aims to identify the type of dominant bacteria growing in the wastewater of the sugar factory and has a potential role as a bioremediation agent for the waste. The method used in this study is the experimental, by observing several environmental parameters as indicators, among others, BOD, COD, TSS, and pH. The results of this study found two types of dominant bacteria, i.e., Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, then used as bioremediation agents. The bioremediation activity was able to reduce pH, BOD, and COD levels.

AB  - Bridge frequencies and track irregularities are both the focuses of railway bridge condition assessment, which are coupled with each other in a vehicle-bridge system. Available algorithms face a great challenge when applied to simultaneously identify the natural frequencies and track irregularities of railway bridges using on-board measurement data. This paper proposes a novel algorithm for simultaneously identifying the frequencies and track irregularities of high-speed railway bridges using vehicle dynamic responses for the first time. An extended state-space model with unknown input condensation is established for time-dependent vehicle-bridge systems. We subsequently propose a new extended Kalman filter algorithm with an adaptive procedure for accelerating the convergence of estimation, which can simultaneously identify the frequencies and track irregularities of a railway bridge when a vehicle is running on it. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been illustrated via numerical simulations of two real high-speed railway bridges. The proposed algorithm provides a low-cost and high-efficient approach for identifying the natural frequencies and track irregularities of high-speed railway bridges.

AB  - Although methyltrimethyltridecylchromans (MTTCs) have been identified and studied for over 30 years in a large number of sediment extracts and crude oils, their origins and significance for palaeosalinity are still debated. Here, the geochemical features of MTTCs in 133 organic-rich lacustrine sediments obtained from the northern Bohai Bay Basin, China, are studied in detail. The sediment samples are in an immature to early mature stage and primarily enriched in Types I and II organic matter, which were deposited in lacustrine environments with relatively weakly stratified water columns and anoxic to suboxic conditions. The development of photic zone euxinia (PZE) in the water column was indicated by the occurrence of aryl isoprenoids. MTTCs were detected in all samples and characterized by low abundances of delta-MTTC and high abundances of alpha-MTTC. Variations in the relative abundance of MTTCs and calculated MTTCI values, suggest that selected lacustrine sediments were deposited in normal to semi-saline environments. A ternary diagram of mono-, di- and trimethyl-MTTCs was established, and shows potential for application as an indicator of changes in palaeosalinity. Variations in the abundance of MTTCs can effectively indicate palaeosalinity changes in lacustrine environments. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cake layer formation in membrane processes is an inevitable phenomenon. For hard particles, especially cake porosity and thickness determine the membrane flux, but when the particles forming the cake are soft, the variables one has to take into account in the prediction of cake behavior increase considerably. In this work we investigate the behavior of soft polyacrylamide microgels in microfluidic model membranes through optical microscopy for in situ observation both under regular flow and under enhanced gravity conditions. Particles larger than the pore are able to pass through deformation and deswelling. We find that membrane clogging time and cake formation is not dependent on the applied pressure but rather on particle and membrane pore properties. Furthermore, we found that particle deposits subjected to low pressures and low g forces deform in a totally reversible fashion. Particle deposits subjected to higher pressures only deform reversibly if they can re-swell due to capillary forces, otherwise irreversible compression is observed. For membrane processes this implies that when using deformable particles, the pore size is not a good indicator for membrane performance, and cake formation can have much more severe consequences compared to hard particles due to the sometimes-irreversible nature of soft particle compression.

AB  - The point-counts method was used to evaluate the bird community in a small patch of forest (1 ha) restored through reforestation, with more than 40 years of deployment, in Vicosa, MG state. In total, 20 points were sampled in the reproductive period of the birds, during 2011. A total of 31 bird species and 160 contacts were recorded, and all species were identified as typical from a semi-deciduous forest and included five endemic species of the Atlantic forest biome. In the present study, the presence of frugivorous and insectivorous birds in the understory with little tolerance for open environments and strong insolation, suggests the good quality of the sampled habitat, confirming that the restored forest is in an advanced stage of succession. The results of this study also demonstrate that even in a small area, and with a few days of sampling, it is possible to obtain a rapid characterization of the bird community, being possible to associate it to the habitat conditions and allowing a safe evaluation of the success of a forest restoration project.

AB  - Desertification is considered one of the most serious threats to arid, semiarid, and sub-humid environments. In this study, several remote sensing techniques were integrated for monitoring desertification in a semiarid region of the central Mexican plateau ( state of Queretaro). Landsat TM images were used to compute the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ( NDVI), Bare-Soil Index ( BSI), and albedo ( alpha). A change vector analysis ( CVA) examined changes in the direction and magnitude of indicators during the 1993-2011 period in order to detect degradations or improvements in land conditions over a period of time. In addition, a desertification degree index ( DDI) was applied based on the NDVI-alpha relationship. The results indicated that in the semiarid zone of the state of Queretaro, 48.3% of land use corresponds with agricultural areas; 2.7% of the area does not present any degree of desertification, while 49% presents the following degrees of desertification: 5.5% extreme, 10.9% severe, 18.9% moderate, and 13.7% low. The DDI applied in this approach for evaluating this phenomenon at the regional and municipal level is an effective tool for identifying areas at risk of desertification, in addition to monitoring changes in the degree or direction of desertification.

AB  - Wheat is the second most important cereal crop in Bangladesh and production is highly sensitive to variations in the environment. We estimate productivity and energy efficiency of wheat farming in Bangladesh by applying a stochastic production frontier approach while accounting for the environmental constraints affecting production. Wheat farming is energy efficient with a net energy balance of 20,596 MJ per ha and energy ratio of 2.34. Environmental constraints such as a combination of unsuitable land, weed and pest attack, bad weather, planting delay and infertile soils significantly reduce wheat production and its energy efficiency. Environmental constraints account for a mean energy efficiency of 3 percentage points. Mean technical efficiency is 88% thereby indicating that elimination of inefficiencies can increase wheat energy output by 12%. Farmers' education, access to agricultural information and training in wheat production significantly improves efficiency, whereas events such as a delay in planting and first fertilization significantly reduce it. Policy recommendations include development of varieties that are resistant to environmental constraints and suitable for marginal areas; improvement of wheat farming practices; and investments in education and training of farmers as well as dissemination of information.

AB  - Surface hydrology is an important aspect of northern environments on account of the thermal influence of water on permafrost. In this study, we demonstrate the ability of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to map wet terrain within an area of discontinuous permafrost adjacent to the Northwest Territories Highway 3, located west of Yellowknife, Canada. Wet terrain was identified from LiDAR intensity measurements beneath forest canopies and across vegetated surfaces, including peatlands, fens, flooded black spruce and birch forests, and terrain adjacent to the highway embankment. Surface water pathways representing hydrological connections between water bodies and wet terrain were also identified at locations otherwise indiscernible from optical imagery. Statistical separability between terrain types, and thus the ability to map them, was improved by integrating LiDAR all-return and bare-earth intensity with colour orthophotos. The average classification accuracy for wet terrain was 93 per cent. These results indicate that LiDAR intensity can be used for local-scale mapping of wet terrain, as required by northern engineers and scientists. Future integration of LiDAR intensity and elevation measurements may be used to assess changes in surface hydrological conditions impacting permafrost.

AB  - The current public perception is that there is little reason for concern for the conservation of marine invertebrates, in part due to the scarcity of emblematic species to represent that diverse group. This paper shows that giant squid can be considered an emblematic species to represent concern for the conservation of marine invertebrate biodiversity because it satisfies all the requirements of an emblematic species. It shows that Architeuthis attracts public interest and attention and can serve as an indicator of oceanographic conditions and ocean climate change. It asserts that Architeuthis can represent concerns for vulnerable marine ecosystems associated with submarine canyons and that it belongs to a broad diverse phylogenetic group of organisms associated with these canyons, sharing common concerns with that group with respect to vulnerability and conservation. This study also advocates that the giant squid can serve as an indicator of effects of ecosystem stress resulting from anthropogenic effects including ocean acidification and warming. It is also shown to be vulnerable to such anthropogenic effects as fishing, acoustic seismic exploration and, possibly, pollutants. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The fat content of 2945 juvenile albacore and 618 juvenile bluefin tunas caught in the Bay of Biscay was measured. Individuals were caught in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 from June to early November by pelagic trawling, trolling and baitboat gears. The results for the two species show different seasonal trends. The fat content of albacore tuna increased linearly throughout the fishing season, which reflects their feeding migration. The seasonal trend of bluefin tuna showed a minimum in early August, which may be related to a different behaviour, physiology or feeding strategy. An interannual increase of fat content was observed in albacore tuna and in age-2 to age-5+ bluefin tuna, which is possibly related to a density-dependence phenomenon. The seasonal increase of fat content was strongest and appeared in the four years studied for age-3 and age-4 albacore tuna, which can be related to a different vertical habitat or a more efficient use of their ecological niche by the individuals of these age-groups, relatively to the younger age-groups. Condition factor and girth/length ratio do not appear to be relevant indicators of fat content. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A Delphi consultation process was used to examine the validity and feasibility of potential resource-input and animal-based outcome measures of laboratory mouse welfare identified by a comprehensive literature search. The consultation was an iterative two-stage technique that used web and email based questionnaires to gather data. On completion of the second consultation stage a total of 97 measures of mouse welfare, their order of importance, and appropriate sample sizes and sampling times where relevant, were identified. Of these, 55 were resource-input measures that included assessments of the cages, animal rooms environmental conditions, husbandry procedures, provision of food and water, staffing, resources placed into mouse cages, and the establishment policies. The remaining 42 were animal-based outcomes, measures that included assessments of unprovoked behaviour, provoked responses, vocalisations, physical appearance, and health indicators. The measures that were considered by the experts to be appropriate for assessing laboratory mouse welfare measures can be placed into four basic categories: characteristics of the staff performance of husbandry and care procedures, health and well-being of the mice, and the provision and use of cage resources.

AB  - Artificial islands have been constructed next to large cities due to the need for extra space in highly populated areas. These emerged structures have been used by many countries as platforms for developing infrastructure (airports, harbors, highways, etc.), rebuilding ecological areas, and creating new spaces for tourism or residential areas. In this study, two state-of-the-art numerical models for wave propagation and nearshore circulation are used to simulate the effects of an emerged artificial island on the Barcelona coast. Several sea indicators (wave height, intensity and direction of currents, and mean water level) are analyzed to assess the changes likely to be induced by an artificial island. Three different situations are studied and the indicators are compared across the different tests to obtain information that can be used in the planning process of these structures. In two-meter wave conditions, the tests show that wave height is generally reduced in the sheltered area, which leads to improved safety for beach users (bathing is prohibited when wave height exceeds the two-meter threshold). However, the numerical models also reveal that velocities in the sheltered area usually decrease, which must be controlled to prevent stagnation in the bathing area.

AB  - Changes in the physical and chemical environment induced by forcing events such as wind and rain can control the short-term dynamics of the phytoplankton community of inland waters. In two temperate reservoirs, species composition, diversity index, and species dynamics were characterized over periods of 3 weeks during different seasons, in parallel with changes in the physical and chemical structure of the water column. Dominant species and diversity index were shown to be controlled by environmental factors fluctuating on a seasonal and weekly time scale, whereas some rarer species responded to wind events and were indicators of a very short-term environmental change. As a consequence of the response of indicator species, the rate of change in species composition increased following meteorological events. Shifts in species composition were observed during each sampling period, except during the strongest stratification period. The shifts were associated with a modification of resource availability or intensity of stratification. We found that the resistance of the phytoplankton community to short-term physical forcing by wind increased with intensity of stratification. After the forcing event, the community did not return to its original structure because of modifications of the physical and chemical conditions induced by meteorological forcing on a weekly time scale.

AB  - According to indicator models of sexual selection, mates may obtain indirect, i.e. genetic, benefits from choosing partners indicating high overall genetic quality by honest signals. In the scorpionfly Panorpa vulgaris, both sexes show mating preferences on the basis of the condition of the potential partners. Females prefer males that produce nuptial gifts (i.e. salivary secretions) during copulation, while males invest more nuptial gifts in females of high nutritional status. Both characters, males' ability to produce nuptial gifts and high nutritional status of females, are known to be reliable indicators of foraging ability. Thus, besides possible direct benefits, both sexes might also obtain indirect benefits in terms of "good foraging genes" by their choice and thereby increase the fitness of their offspring. A prerequisite for this possibility is the heritability of the respective trait. In the present study, we estimated the repeatability and the heritability of foraging ability. Our results indicate (1) a significant repeatability of individual foraging efficiencies in males and females and (2) a heritable component of this trait by a significant parent-offspring regression. These findings suggest that genetic benefits in terms of increased offspring foraging ability might contribute to selection for mating preferences in both sexes.

AB  - A random block design was used, with factorial arrangement, to determine the effect of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae or its metabolic excretions on the microbial rumen population in in vitro conditions. Five treatments were evaluated: A) filtered rumen liquid (FRL) (control), B) filtered rumen liquid + culture medium (blank), C) filtered rumen liquid + culture medium inoculated with S. cerevisiae, D) filtered rumen liquid + pellet of centrifugation of the culture medium inoculated with S. cerevisiae, and E) filtered rumen liquid + supernatant of the centrifugation of the culture medium inoculated with S. cerevisiae. The inclusion of S. cerevisiae, whether in its culture medium or in the form of pellet, favored the development of total viable bacteria and cellulolytic (bacteria and fungi) populations. However, there was effect on the populations of protozoa. The pH was the highest in the control (7.12) and in the pellet (7.18). This coincides with the minimum values of SCFA (22.14 mmol/L and 27.83 mmol/L) obtained in the control and the pellet, respectively. The results indicated that the activating effect of the yeast is associated with the actions that the live cells may exert on the rumen ecosystem.

AB  - HSP70, a heat shock protein, is a molecular chaperone responsive to various environmental stresses. Here, NtHSP70-1 (AY372069) was a drought-/ABA-inducible gene. We monitored the expression of CaERD15 (early responsive to dehydration, DQ267932) with exposing plants to progressive drought stress. Its activity was used as an indicator of water-deficit conditions. To analyze the protective role of HSP70, we obtained transgenic tobacco plants that constitutively expressed elevated levels of the tobacco HSP70, NtHSP70-1, as well as transgenic plants containing either the vector alone or else having NtHSP70-1 in the antisense orientation. Plants with enhanced levels of NtHSP70-1 in their transgenic sense lines exhibited tolerance to water stress. Under progressive drought, the amount of leaf NtHSP70-1 was correlated with maintenance of optimum water content, with contents being higher in the leaves of dehydrated transgenic sense plants than in those of either the control (vector-only) or the transgenic antisense plants. Moreover, the expression of CaERD15 was considerably reduced in tobacco plants that over-expressed NtHSP70-1. These results suggest that elevated levels of NtHSP70-1 can confer drought-stress tolerance.

AB  - Recent changes in techniques for producing farm-raised baitfish include spawning and hatching indoors, advances that provide better control over these steps during the production cycle. However, developing embryos experience different conditions indoors than in the traditional outdoors pond production technique. Stress during embryological development can result in small random differences between the left and right sides of a bilateral trait. For characters influenced by the environment, the degree of asymmetry can be a measure of the level of stress experienced during embryological development. Asymmetry was compared in morphological characters between two groups of golden shiners Notemigonus crysoleucas representing indoor and outdoor spawning and hatching techniques. Relative weight was also compared in fingerlings produced by the two techniques. There were no differences in asymmetry between the two groups for seven characters. Two characters were significantly more asymmetric in the group produced indoors, but one character was significantly more asymmetric in the group produced outdoors. Relative weight did not differ between the two groups. Based on the assumption that these characters are influenced by the environment and on observed similarities in asymmetry and relative weight, no consistent differences in embryological stress resulting from the two different production techniques were found.

AB  - The two main objectives of this study were to compare cadmium and zinc fluxes from a contaminated sediment to the water column in bioturbated and unbioturbated systems and jointly to analyze accumulation kinetics of these released metals by benthic filter-feeder bivalves. The experimental approach was based on indoor microcosms containing a two-compartment biotope: natural contaminated sediment (45 +/- 5 mug Cd/g, dry wt, and 1,938 +/- 56 mug Zn/g, dry wt) and water column. Four experimental conditions were studied: no organism added to the sediment-water biotope, presence of bivalves Corbicula fluminea, presence of Hexagenia rigida nymphs (bioturbation source), and presence of C. fluminea and H. rigida simultaneously. Results reveal that bioturbation produces a significant metal release into the water column via the resuspended sediment particles. The use of C. fluminea as an indicator of transferred metals in the water column shows that the metal bioavailability is very limited, quantities of cadmium and zinc bioaccumulated in the soft bodies being less than those measured in unbioturbated systems. This experimental study demonstrates that only the dissolved fraction resulting from diffusive metal fluxes across the sediment-water interface is bioavailable for this bivalve species.

AB  - We used natural abundance measurements of nitrogen stable isotope ratios (N-15/N-14, expressed as delta(15)N parts per thousand) to trace nitrogen derived from dairy cattle slurry into two common earthworm species under field conditions. Three annual spring applications of N-15-rich slurry totalling 450 kg N ha(-1) resulted in significantly elevated tissue delta(15)N values in Aporrectodea caliginosa and A. longa collected in the autumn. This suggests that both earthworm species assimilated slurry-derived nitrogen. Earthworm delta(15)N values were unchanged after a single slurry application and in plots receiving inorganic N fertilizer compared to those from control plots. A. caliginosa, an endogeic species, had consistently higher delta(15)N values than the anecic A. longa. Preservation of earthworms in formalin for 58 days did not significantly alter their tissue delta(15)N signatures but affected delta(13)C values. This study demonstrates the potential of the natural abundance stable isotope approach for tracing anthropogenic N inputs through soil food webs in situ, on a field scale.

AB  - A review of potential indicators of biodiversity in British forests is presented, with a focus on the usefulness of selected biotic parameters as surrogate measures of different aspects of biodiversity in managed forests. To be effective in this respect, indicators must satisfy a number of criteria. They must be readily quantifiable, easily assessed in the field, repeatable and subject to minimal observer bias, cost effective, and ecologically meaningful (i.e. close association with, and identification of, the conditions and responses of other species). It is suggested that a combination of structural (physiognomy of stands and associated structures) and compositional indicators (indicator species or species groups) is selected which is appropriate to the aims of management and to the particular forest type in question. A useful approach is to identify two to three key compositional indicators, shown to be functionally linked to a broad range of other species, such as the extent and species composition of the broadleaved component in conifer forests; and two to three key structural indicators, which act as surrogates for general species richness or diversity, such as the quantity and quality of deadwood.

AB  - One hundred and four children suffering from Haemophilus influenzae meningitis were studied in a multi-centre study in France between October 1991 and June 1993. The clinical and bacteriological findings were similar to those usually found in this condition. Fifty three per cent of the H. influenzae strains cultured produced beta-lactamase and 98% were of type b. Forty-six children who had been prescribed oral antibiotics before hospitalisation were analysed in this study. This analysis took into account the nature of the antibiotic and whether it was prescribed as the treatment of first or second intention. Treatment failures, defined according to pre-established criteria, were found to be independent of whether or not the incriminated strain was beta-lactamase producing and whether or not it was sensitive in vitro to the antibiotic prescribed. None of the 46 children who had received pre-hospital oral antibiotics died while three of the 58 who had not received pre-hospital oral antibiotics died. However, it is difficult to establish in our study a clear relationship between the reduction of mortality and previous oral antibiotic treatment in bacteriologically proven cases of H. influenzae meningitis.

AB  - Recent evidence has shown that fish have the ability to develop new nephrons following renal injury. This study evaluated the usefulness of quantifying developing nephrons in mature fish as an ecotoxicological assessment tool. Histological sections of kidney were prepared from Atlantic tomcod and brown bullhead specimens collected from reference and contaminated streams. The numbers of developing nephrons and basophilic cell clusters from which the nephrons arise per section area were determined by image analysis. The numbers of basophilic clusters and developing nephrons in tomcod kidney were found to be one to two orders of magnitude higher than for the bullhead. In tomcod from the Hudson River, the number of both basophilic clusters and developing nephrons were elevated relative to samples from the less contaminated Saco and Royal Rivers. In bullheads, when analysis was conducted over several seasons, the number of basophilic clusters and developing nephrons from Cuyahoga River samples were elevated relative to samples from the less-contaminated Old Women Creek and Toussaint River. Developing nephrons and basophilic clusters seem to have potential as general indicators of ecological condition, but may be better suited for detection of nephrotoxicity at specific sites.

AB  - Prior to the 2013 cantaloupe season, the US Food and Drug Administration notified the industry that inspections of a subset of packinghouses would commence that year in response to the 2011 Listeria monocytogenes outbreak associated with cantaloupe. In May 2013, five Florida cantaloupe packinghouses participated in an environmental monitoring survey to evaluate their sanitary conditions prior to a potential FDA inspection. Two facilities participated again in 2014. Surface swabs (n = 374) were collected in each facility and included up to 60 food contact and non-food contact surfaces, including water. Samples were enumerated for total plate counts (TPC), generic Escherichia coli, and coliforms, and enriched for Listeria. Listeria were confirmed and speciated by sequencing of the partial sigB gene, and further characterized by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (AscI and Apal). In 2013, two zone 1 surfaces in same facility, were positive for L. monocytogenes (2/233). No L. monocytogenes was detected (n = 103) in the two facilities sampled the following year, including the previously L. monocytogenes-positive facility. Prevalence of L. monocytogenes in FL cantaloupe packinghouses was generally low (2/374), compared to other food environments. TPC, coliforms, E. coli and Listeria spp. were poor indicators of L. monocytogenes contamination in Florida packinghouses.

AB  - Runoff processes are the basis for maintaining the safety of river ecosystems. The Yarlung Zangbo River (YZR) faces changes in flow regimes due to the impacts of human activities and climate change#which may threaten its fragile ecosystem. In this study#a new comprehensive system for evaluating runoff variation was constructed to investigate the degree of runoff alternation in the YZR. Based on the data from the primary hydrological stations in the YZR from 1956 to 2000#the assessment indicators of runoff variation were selected by considering the flow#sediment#and water temperature processes. Furthermore#a comprehensive evaluation system for runoff variation was constructed via multiple hydrological analysis methods and vague sets. The results showed that the variation index of the YZR from 2010 to 2013 was 0.15-0.20 compared with the flow regimes of the YZR before 2000#which were within a reasonable range#indicating that the comprehensive runoff conditions of the YZR were not greatly disturbed by human activities such as reservoir construction and river regulation during this period. These results provide a tool for evaluating the runoff change in the YZR and new references for researching runoff variation in other similar watersheds.

AB  - In the last decades, there has been an increase in impacts on the environment, driven by the industrialization process. As a result, society's social and environmental awareness increased, and business organizations began to promote corporate social responsibility initiatives to positively contribute to better working and environmental conditions, and other sustainability issues. This article aims to verify the performance of 217 Brazilian municipalities from 31 indicators segmented in the three dimensions of sustainability (economic, environmental, and social), selected from the literature review, to contribute to the sustainable investment strategy of organizations. To this end, we used the multi-criteria decision making method, Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), and proposed an analytical sustainability dashboard. The main results of this paper were the sustainable performance rankings of the municipalities and the dashboard with three analytical panels that contributed to identifying the points of improvement of each municipality, consequently contributing to the investment strategy in these locations. This research consists, therefore, of an important methodology, combining the multi-criteria method and the sustainability dashboard, to assess the sustainable development of the municipalities in the triple bottom line dimensions.

AB  - As businesses experience greater pressures from a variety of stakeholders concerned with promoting a balanced approach to managing the competing demands for increased profitability, improved social conditions, and restoring the health of planet earth, new opportunities arise for HRM scholars and professionals to contribute to the pursuit of sustainability. However, the foundational logic of sustainability diverges significantly from the dominant perspective in today's business environment. Building upon the institutional theory literature, we introduce the concept of HRM institutional entrepreneurship to examine the paradoxes and emerging opportunities associated with the urgent need for more sustainable approaches for managing business organizations. As a guide to future work, we describe how the actions of HRM scholars and professionals can stimulate evolution from an HRM philosophy that relies on financial indicators to assess effectiveness towards an HRM philosophy that promotes a tripartite approach to sustainability, showing equal concern for economic, environmental and social performance. Focusing on organizational changes that improve environmental performance, we apply the concept of HRM institutional entrepreneurship to consider ways for HRM professionals to engage internal and external stakeholders in order to create value in organizations pursuing sustainability. Ultimately, activities that constitute HRM institutional entrepreneurship for sustainable business drive the development of capabilities that characterize ambidextrous organizations.

AB  - Commensal bacteria have been identified as critical drivers of host resilience to pathogen invasion. The resulting 'competitive exclusion' of pathogens by commensals can arise via multiple mechanisms, including direct competition for sites of colonization, production of metabolic products that inhibit pathogen growth, and modulation of host immune responses (including differential targeting of pathogens). Nonetheless, suppression of pathogens through the combined action of commensals and host immunity is far from inevitable. Here, we utilize a simple, within-host ecosystem model to explore the microbiological and immunological conditions that govern the fate of pathogen colonization. Model analysis leads to the hypothesis that robust elimination of pathogens requires a synergy between host immune defense and commensal bacteria. That is, pathogens can proliferate and establish persistent infections if either the state of the microbiota or the host immune defense falls below critical levels. Leveraging these findings, we advocate for improved integration of nonlinear dynamic models in efforts to understand infection dynamics in an immunological context. Doing so may provide new opportunities to establish baseline indicators for healthy microbiomes and to develop improved therapeutics through targeted modification of feedback amongst commensals and between commensals and the immune system.

AB  - Size-based indicators are used worldwide in research that supports the management of commercially exploited wild fish populations, because of their responsiveness to fishing pressure. Observational and experimental data, however, have highlighted the deeply rooted links between fish size and environmental conditions that can drive additional, interannual changes in these indicators. Here, we have used biogeochemical and mechanistic niche modelling of commercially exploited demersal fish species to project time series to the end of the 21st century for one such indicator, the large fish indicator (LFI), under global CO2 emissions scenarios. Our modelling results, validated against survey data, suggest that the LFI's previously proposed policy target may be unachievable under future climate change. In turn, our results help to identify what may be achievable policy targets for demersal fish communities experiencing climate change. While fisheries modelling has grown as a science, climate change modelling is seldom used specifically to address policy aims. Studies such as this one can, however, enable a more sustainable exploitation of marine food resources under changes unmanageable by fisheries control. Indeed, such studies can be used to aid resilient policy target setting by taking into account climate-driven effects on fish community size-structure.

AB  - The relationships between habitat heterogeneity and the provision of multiple ecosystem services are not well understood. This study investigates the impacts of heterogeneity in surface floodwater inundation on the productive efficiency of ecosystem service provision, and the degree to which the relative provision of these ecosystem services is evenly balanced. We analyse indicators of five services. Field data from 100 floodplain quadrats were first analysed to investigate relationships between ecosystem service indicators and floodplain hydrology. Floodplain mosaics of varying hydrological heterogeneity were then simulated using the empirical data. Simulated floodplains with higher hydrological heterogeneity were generally less efficient in providing the target indicators, because they were adapted to the particular hydrological ranges which best provided the target services. Simulated floodplains that were more heterogeneous generally provided more even levels of the target indicators by segregating provision into different habitat types. Heterogeneity in floodplain hydrology may help to balance provision of multiple ecosystem services. However, management of hydrological heterogeneity to achieve this requires a detailed understanding of the relationships between each service and habitat conditions. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to gauge consumer attitudes to food sharing practices in Italy and to assess the support that digital technologies can offer in to promote more responsible consumption.
   Design/methodology/approach The methodology involves a web-based survey through using specialized online platforms (e.g. websites; Facebook groups; and Facebook pages), which provide content on sustainable and responsible consumption and crowd funding campaigns.
   Findings The research highlights the increasingly aware and attentive consumer attitudes towards collaborative economic practices compared to the past. In Italy, however, digital platforms for exchanging surplus food or goods are still poorly used. In fact, there is still a lack of knowledge, largely conditioned by recent experienced with some apps and by the poor development of this type of market.
   Research limitations/implications The research is a pilot of a small-scale study protocol conducted in January 2017 to ascertain the suitability of a wider project on social food sharing practices and environmental sustainability, by determining its feasibility or obtaining information for identification of the key indicators and analysis of the dimensions of the final study.
   Originality/value The research produces first empirical results that may provide new information, related to the role of digital media, on consumption habits.

AB  - A trend of morphometric characteristic bioindication use and flight ability of the Carabidae is their valuation in relation to land use intensity. There are biotopes that are less disturbed, characterized by the presence of individuals that have a higher body average volume value, the so-called ellipsoid biovolume (EV), more than the presence of apterous and brachpterous species. We undertook a bioindication valuation in 7 types of biotopes in the Juhoslovenska kotlina basin and the Veporske vrchy Mts. In 2015-2016, we recorded 3605 individuals (1682 males, 1923 females) belonging to 54 species. Biotope heterogeneity and natural conditions are very important for locality selection. We tested 3 hypotheses: 1) the average body size value (EV) of ground beetles decreases with the increasing intensity of biotopes disturbance. 2) a higher number of apterous and brachpterous species appears in stable biotopes and continuous forest cover in the country, 3) the macropterous species predominates in unstable biotopes and isolated forest cover. We confirmed different EV and disturbed intensity by the level of significance p alpha=0,05. The apterous and brachpterous species dominated in undisturbed and stable biotopes. The macropterous species dominated in disturbed biotopes.

AB  - Citrus fruits are an important diet for human health by providing some nutritional and antioxidant components, especially ascorbic acid (AsA). As the major antioxidant compound, the concentration of AsA is an important nutritional quality indicator for citrus fruit and its derivative products. Although the emphasis is on vitamin C content of harvested citrus fruit, this review of literature focuses on preharvest factors affecting this nutritional quality variable. The literature reviewed in this study showed that the content of AsA in citrus fruits is influenced by numerous preharvest factors including genotype, cultural practices, climatic conditions, fruit maturity and postharvest management. To better understand the mechanism underlying the vitamin C content of different citrus fruits, the introduction of this paper will first provide an overview of major proposed biosynthetic pathways and genes encoding for enzymes involved in AsA biosynthesis and oxidation. The review will then concentrate on the current state of knowledge regarding inherent genetic, environmental, fertilization, maturity and harvesting factors affecting AsA of citrus fruits. Some suggestions for future research are also highlighted. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pig slurry use as soil fertilizer is a common practice in southern Brazil. In spite of the benefits of reusing waste, this practice poses serious environmental risks. Microbiological indicators of soil quality are very sensitive and allow soil environment conditions to be monitored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiological quality of pasture soils with different histories of successive use of pig slurry. Determinations were made of C content in the microbial biomass, soil microbial respiration, metabolic quotient (qCO(2)), activity of the enzymes beta-glycosidase and urease, and fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis in grazing areas under the use of pig slurry for two (A2) and 14 years (A14) and in a native forest (NF) area. The successive use of pig slurry on pasture did not affect C biomass and soil microbial respiration, which varied according to the time of collection. The qCO2 was not affected by the use of pig slurry in the soil. Soil enzymatic activity was affected by the use of pig slurry; urease and FDA were sensitive in detecting differences in soil activity with the use of pig slurry, whereas the beta-glycosidase enzyme did not allow differentiation among the areas studied.

AB  - High extraversion and conscientiousness and low neuroticism predict successful performance during and after stressful conditions. We investigated whether these personality factors are linked to stress sensitivity and to baseline physiology. Stress was induced through negative feedback on gaming performance. Stress sensitivity was determined as the difference in baseline physiological variables (skin conductance, heart rate and heart rate variability) before and after performing the game, as well as the difference in subjectively reported stress. While physiological results suggest that the game indeed induced stress, subjective reports do not. Maybe due to a low level of experienced stress, stress sensitivity (as indicated by the difference in heart rate) only correlates with conscientiousness and not with extraversion or neuroticism. The baseline measurements show the expected correlations between extraversion and both heart rate and heart rate variability-negative and positive respectively. The negative correlation between neuroticism and skin conductance is opposite to what we expected. While the exact mechanisms are not clear yet, the present results indicate that for healthy individuals, there are indeed measurable and consistent relations between physiology and personality. Hence, physiological indicators of personality may ultimately be of value as predictors of stress resiliency.

AB  - Cell counts and viral load serve as major clinical indicators to provide treatment in the course of a viral infection. Monitoring these markers in patients can be expensive and some of them are not feasible to perform. An alternative solution to this problem is the observer based estimation. Several observer schemes require the previous knowledge of the model and parameters, such condition is not achievable for some applications. A linear output assumption is required in the majority of the current works. Nevertheless, the output of the system can be a nonlinear combination of the state variables. This paper presents a discrete-time neural observer for non-linear systems with a non-linear output; the mathematical model is assumed to be unknown. The observer is trained on-line with the extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based algorithm and the respective stability analysis based on the Lyapunov approach is addressed. We applied different observers to the estimation problem in HIV infection; that is state estimation of the viral load, and the number of infected and non-infected CD4+T cells. Simulation results suggest a good performance of the proposed neural observer and the applicability to biological systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the Mediterranean basin, pine tree reforestation has been the most common management tool in restoring degraded and burnt areas, as well as for economic purposes. However, the quality of the biodiversity of these habitats has undergone little assessment. Terrestrial gastropods are suitable indicators of forest quality and long-term stability because of their strict dependence on microhabitat conditions and their slow dispersal rate. We sampled the gastropod population in a protected Mediterranean area in order to compare the species richness in seven main habitats. Holm oak wood and mixed-pine forests were the habitats with the lowest species density, and areas with a high level of heterogeneity exhibited the richest communities. In recent decades however, land abandonment and pine reforestation are leading to landscape homogeneity, which is perhaps the cause of the extinction of six open-habitat gastropod species in the Park. These results provide park authorities with insights into how to adapt management plans to enhance habitat quality for land snail and slug assemblages. More specifically, our results stress the need to create habitat heterogeneity to increase land mollusc diversity in large and continuous areas of mixed-pine forests.

AB  - Using vegetation databases from Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria, Slovakia and our own material collected during a field work, we have analysed the variability of species composition of Abies alba-dominated communities in Central Europe. Analysis was performed using a modified TWINSPAN algorithm in the JUICE software. Ecological analysis was performed on the basis of mean Ellenberg indicator values with a MoPeT_v1.0.r script prepared in R software. In general, the findings indicated that there are at least 8 types of Central European silver fir-dominated forests with different patterns in species composition and habitat conditions. These are the oligotrophic subcontinental silver fir forests of the Polish highlands, oligotrophic (sub)montane silver fir forest, hygrophilous silver fir forests, oligo-mesotrophic (sub)montane silver fir forests, mesotrophic (sub)montane silver fir forests, submontane and montane calcicolous silver fir forests of the Alps and the Carpathians, eutrophic silver fir-beech forests and silver fir ravine forests. The main conclusion is that the diversity of species composition of Abies alba-dominated forests in Central Europe is lower than described in current regional synthesis, which was confirmed by ecological analyses.

AB  - Termite-derived methane contributes 3 to 4% to the total methane budget globally. Termites are not known to harbor methaneoxidizing microorganisms (methanotrophs). However, a considerable fraction of the methane produced can be consumed by methanotrophs that inhabit the mound material, yet the methanotroph ecology in these environments is virtually unknown. The potential for methane oxidation was determined using slurry incubations under conditions with high (12%) and in situ (similar to 0.004%) methane concentrations through a vertical profile of a termite (Macrotermes falciger) mound and a reference soil. Interestingly, the mound material showed higher methanotrophic activity. The methanotroph community structure was determined by means of a pmoA-based diagnostic microarray. Although the methanotrophs in the mound were derived from populations in the reference soil, it appears that termite activity selected for a distinct community. Applying an indicator species analysis revealed that putative atmospheric methane oxidizers (high-indicator-value probes specific for the JR3 cluster) were indicative of the active nest area, whereas methanotrophs belonging to both type I and type II were indicative of the reference soil. We conclude that termites modify their environment, resulting in higher methane oxidation and selecting and/or enriching for a distinct methanotroph population.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to describe a procedure to obtain maintainability indicators for industrial devices. This analysis can be helpful, among other cases, to compare systems, to achieve a better design regarding maintainability requirements, to improve this maintainability under specific industrial environment and to foresee maintainability problems due to eventual changes in a device operation conditions. This maintainability assessment can be carried out at any stage of the industrial asset life cycle.
   With this purpose, this work first introduces the notion of maintainability and the implementation of assessment indicators, including some important requirements to perform that. Then, a brief literature review is presented, including the definition of the main concepts, which are later used in the paper. After studying the maintenance levels and the maintainability attributes, both terms are linked, leading all this analysis to the assessment of the maintainability indicators. It follows a discussion about the information obtained through the maintainability assessment process and its computation into several maintainability indicators. The paper includes a case study, which implements the defined assessment into a practical scenario. Finally, the work concludes summarizing the more significant aspects and suggesting future researches. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The removal of phytoplankton cells from aquaculture systems generally results in the reduction of nitrogenous waste and improves water quality. With this study, the effects of chitosan concentration, environmental condition and pH adjustment on flocculation of phytoplankton in marine shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) culture tanks were investigated. The remaining phytoplankton and suspended solids in the system were indicators for evaluating the efficiency of chitosan on flocculation. The results indicate that the flocculation efficiency of chitosan was highest (>85%) and remained fairly constant at a chitosan concentration of 40-80 mg L-1 and a pH range of 7-9 after chitosan addition. With this novel technique including 40 mg L-1 chitosan addition, pH adjustment to 6.5 and then to 8.5, high efficiency and consistency of flocculation were achieved. This technique could also be applied with various water alkalinity up to 400 mg CaCO3 L-1. The experiment for phytoplankton removal by chitosan flocculation in the recirculating aquaculture system showed that flocculation efficiency remained constant even though flocculation was repeated several times.

AB  - Acoustic and satellite environmental data as well as bathymetry data were used to model the presence of anchovy, Engraulis encrasicolus during early summer in the northern Aegean Sea (Eastern Mediterranean). Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) were used for modelling and subsequently applied in a predictive mode to identify those areas in the Greek Seas and the entire Mediterranean basin that could support species' presence. Model results were evaluated with the estimation of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)-plots as well as qualitatively, based on (a) acoustic data from concurrent studies in certain areas of the northern Aegean Sea that were not included in the estimation of the GAM model and (b) historical acoustic data from the central Aegean and Ionian Seas. Mapping the estimated environmental conditions in the Mediterranean basin indicated areas that generally agree with the known distribution grounds of anchovy, such as the straits of Sicily and coastal waters of Tunisia, areas in the Tyrrhenian Sea, the Adriatic Sea, the Gulf of Lions and the Catalan Sea.

AB  - Our very own survival on earth essentially depends on the water, nature's valuable gift to all life forms. The optimal and sustainable development of the resource is very crucial so that it is accessed reliably to avoid any future problems regarding its qualitative and quantitative availability. The interpretation of remote sensing data in conjunction with conventional data and sufficient ground truth information makes it possible to identify and outline various ground features such as geological structures, geomorphic features and their hydrologic characters, that may serve as direct or indirect indicators of the presence of ground and surface water. Remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS) have emerged as essential tools to meet ever-increasing demand for more precise and timely information. These techniques permit rapid and cost effective natural resource, survey and management. Remotely sensed data provides unbiased information on geology, geomorphology, structural pattern and recharging conditions, which logically define the groundwater regime of an area. The present study is an attempt to delineate different groundwater potential zones in Sasti watershed, Taluka Rajura of Chandrapur district (Maharashtra) using an integrated approach of Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System.

AB  - Kirikuchi charr, Salvelinus leucomaenis japonicus, is the southernmost population of the genus Salvelinus. It is endemic to the Kii Peninsula, central Honshu Island, Japan. As a consequence of anthropogenic disturbances, a few populations of Kirikuchi charr with low genetic diversity now survive only in small, isolated habitats. This study investigated the occurrence of deformed individuals and assessed differences between deformed and noncleformed fish in fitness-related traits, Le., body size, body condition, growth rate, reproductive traits, survival rate, and habitat use, for two small isolated populations of Kirikuchi charr in the upper drainage of the Totsu River system of the Kill Peninsula. The two populations contained deformed fish in the respective proportions of 8.0-17.4% and 3.0-5.8% between 2003 and 2005. Annual survival rates of deformed fish were approximately half those of nondeformed fish. Other traits were not significantly different between deformed and nondeformed fish. These results indicate that the occurrence of deformities is an important ecological indicator that reflects the decline in fitness of small, isolated populations.

AB  - An similar to 8400 cal yr record of vegetation change from the northern Peten, Guatemala, provides new insights into the environmental history of the archaeological area known as the Mirador Basin. Pollen, loss on ignition, and magnetic susceptibility analyses indicate warm and humid conditions in the early to mid-Holocene. Evidence for a decrease in forest cover around 4600 cal yr B.P. coincides with the first appearance of Zea mays pollen, suggesting that human activity was responsible. The period between 3450 cal yr B.P. and 1000 cal yr B.P. is characterized by a further decline in forest pollen types, includes an abrupt increase in weedy taxa, and exhibits the highest magnetic susceptibility values since the early Holocene, all of which suggest further agricultural disturbance in the watershed. A brief drop in disturbance indicators around 1800 cal yr B.P. may represent the Preclassic abandonment of the area. Changing pollen frequencies around 1000 cal yr B.P. indicate a cessation of human disturbance, which represents the Late Classic collapse of the southern Maya lowlands.

AB  - We used biochemical indicators to assess the physiological status of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) sampled at different sites and times along the Newfoundland coast. The physiological status of cod changed more with time of sampling and size of the cod than with the site of sampling. The levels of muscle glycolytic enzymes and proteins suggest that cod from both near shore and offshore environments experienced the most favorable conditions in late summer and early fall. In small cod sampled near shore, increases in muscle aerobic capacity and protein contents accompanied the decrease in temperature from September to December. The positive allometry of muscle glycolytic capacities was more apparent in samples obtained in early winter than at other times, suggesting that the energetic status of cod affects the expression of this allometric relationship. On the other hand, a negative allometry of muscle aerobic capacities was apparent throughout the study. Reproductive maturity had few effects upon the biochemical parameters measured and tended to favor mature over immature cod. Our results suggest that cod in these areas were only growing in fall.

AB  - Improvement of root lodging resistance is important for the development of good performing cultivars in maize (Zen mays L.). Consequently, methods to evaluate root lodging resistance are necessary. This study examines the performance and environmental consistency of two recently developed root lodging related indicators: dcsh (calculated from c - cycle of stem movement, s - stiffness stern and h - horizontal stem pull resistance) and dph (calculated from p - plant height and h - horizontal stern pull resistance). Fifteen inbred lines were planted in three different environments and the dcsh and dph values were recorded. The values of dcsh and dph were consistent in different climatic conditions, though interactions (line x environment) were detected in both dcsh and dph values. In Trial 3, 22% of the plants were root lodged, and the dcsh and dph values were effective in predicting the occurrence of root lodging on an individual plant basis in inbred lines. The experiment included 15 hybrids showed the coefficient of correlation for both dcsh and dph between midparents and hybrids was r = 0.94**. The dcsh and dph values of hybrids, therefore are highly heritable and can be predicted from their parental inbred lines.

AB  - As current techniques for the quantification of bacteria are laborious and often imprecise, instrumental approaches such as sedimentation field-flow fractionation (SdFFF) are attractive. In this technique, fluorogenic dyes specific for nucleic acids are used to identity bacterial cells. Bacterial biomass can be quantified directly with SdFFF if the specific fluorescence of bacterial cells is constant. The effect of different growth conditions on the specific fluorescence of one strain each of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis stained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was examined. Specific fluorescence varied over a 500-fold range, from 0.22 to 103 arbitrary fluorescence units per cell. Specific fluorescence was highest when cells were in log phase, and lowest when cells were in stationary phase. Specific fluorescence decreased when cells harvested in log phase were starved for 7 d in a carbon-free minimal medium, and increased rapidly (within 2 h) after cells were relieved from carbon limitation. Such variations in specific fluorescence must be considered when using gross fluorescence as a direct indicator of bacterial numbers in the SdFFF technique for quantifying bacterial biomass. Moreover, they have serious implications for the application of fluorescence techniques in other instrumental approaches for bacterial enumeration in environmental samples.

AB  - Activated sludge samples from municipal sewage treatment plants were characterized using 16S and 23S ribosomal RNA targeted oligonucleotide probes specific for defined phylogenetic groups of bacteria. Comparison of in situ community structures as determined by molecular biological methods with the composition of the heterotrophic saprophyte flora isolated on nutrient rich medium revealed large discrepancies. These are caused by the selectivity of media and culture conditions. The most significant effect of cultivation on nutrient rich medium is an underestimation of bacteria belonging to the beta-subclass of Proteobacteria and an overestimation of bacteria belonging to the gamma-subclass of Proteobacteria. Therefore, culture dependent enumerations of the gamma-subclass bacteria of the genus Acinetobacter in plants with enhanced biological phosphate removal (EBPR) resulted in significant overestimations. In situ identification by fluorescent oligonucleotide probing revealed that Acinetobacter numbers were below 8% of the active bacterial cells in the examined EBPR-plants. In situ hybridization techniques also bear the potential for the early and correct identification of filamentous bacteria as indicators for sludge bulking and foaming. A 16S ribosomal RNA targeted oligonucleotide probe specific for Sphaerotilus spec. was developed and successfully applied for in situ investigation of this filamentous bacterium.

AB  - The peak temperature and duration of ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) metamorphism are critical to identify and understand its tectonic environment. The UHT metamorphism of the Jining complex in the Khondalite Belt, North China Craton is controversial on the peak temperature, time and tectonic setting. A representative sapphirine-bearing granulite sample is selected from the classic Tianpishan outcrop for addressing the metamorphic evolution and timing. The rock is markedly heterogeneous on centimetre scale and can be divided into melanocratic domains rich in sillimanite (MD-s) or rich in orthopyroxene (MD-o), and leucocratic domains (LD). On the basis of detailed petrographic analyses and phase equilibria modelling using THERMOCALC, all three types of domains record peak temperatures of 1120-1140 degrees C and a series of post-peak cooling stages at 0.8-0.9 GPa to the fluid-absent solidus (similar to 890 degrees C), followed by sub-solidus decompression. The peak temperature for MD-s is constrained by the coexistence of sillimanite-I + sapphirine + spinel + quartz, where sillimanite-I contains densely exsolved aciculae of hematite, yielding reintegrated Fe2O3 contents up to 2.1-2.3 wt %. The post-peak cooling evolution involves the sequential appearance of K-feldspar, sillimanite-II + garnet, orthopyroxene and biotite, where sillimanite-II is exsolution-free and contains variable Fe2O3 contents of 1.3-1.8 wt %. The peak temperature for MD-o is constrained by the sapphirine + orthopyroxene assemblage, where orthopyroxene has a maximum Al-IV of 0.22 (Al2O3 = 9.5 wt %) in the core. The cooling evolution involves the sequential appearance of K-feldspar, garnet and biotite, and the decreasing Al-IV (0.22 -> 0.17) from core to rim in orthopyroxene. The peak temperature for LD is constrained by the inferred K-feldspar-absent assemblage and the maximum anorthite content of 0.11 in K-feldspar. The cooling evolution involves the crystallization of segregated melts, exsolution of supra-solvus ternary feldspars and growth of biotite. The Al in orthopyroxene, Fe2O3 in sillimanite and anorthite in K-feldspar are good indicators for constraining extreme UHT conditions although they depend differently on bulk-rock compositions. In-situ SHRIMP U-Pb dating of metamorphic zircon indicates that the UHT metamorphism may have occurred at >1.94 Ga and the cooling under UHT conditions lasted over 40 Ma. The extreme UHT metamorphism in the Jining complex is interpreted to be triggered by the advective heating of intraplate hyperthermal mafic magmas together with a plume-related hot mantle upwelling, following an orogenic crustal thickening event.

AB  - Animal welfare can be viewed as the result of integrating repeated affective evaluations of success in coping with environmental challenges, i.e., subjective challenge adequacy. The present work summarizes why established physiological and behavioral welfare parameters are inadequate to assess challenge adequacy. Behavioral tests based on the mood-congruent judgment effect and physiologic parameters based on components of the somatotropic axis are proposed as an alternative. Here, the judgment bias measures an animal's subjective confidence to cope successfully with a challenge, which is in turn modulated by the animal's previous experience. The somatotropic axis incorporates the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and its binding proteins (IGFBP), which are involved in the regulation of metabolism and growth. First results indicate that in particular IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 react with higher latency and higher inertness to short-term stressful events than established physiological stress parameters. Before these indicators can be utilized for overall welfare assessment, further validation studies are necessary that provide more insights into how repeatable the measurements are under different conditions and which other factors may confound the measures.

AB  - High-quality habitats presumably have the resources required to sustain relatively high rates of survival and reproduction. We assessed how habitat type and local environmental conditions determine the distribution of individuals of Canthon cyanellus (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), an eurytopic dung beetle, according to age category and sexual gonadic maturity. Beetles were surveyed in forest fragments, live fences, and pastures in Mexico. Individuals were categorised into six age categories according to the glandular volumes in males and oocyte number and length in females. Mature females in forest fragments were the most abundant females found among the habitats. Air humidity and soil hardness were positively and negatively related to mature female abundance, respectively. Mature beetles were the most abundant among males, and higher abundance of males occurred in forest fragments than in live fences and pastures. Light quantity was negatively related to the abundance of young males. Compared to forest fragments, females in pastures had larger oocytes. However, sites with higher soil hardness and air humidity had females with lower numbers of oocytes. Our results demonstrate that, although C. cyanellus occurs across a wide range of habitats, forest habitats might host sexually mature individuals, which translates into more effective individual dispersion and potential reproduction.

AB  - Previously, we have demonstrated the capability of activated charcoal cloth (ACC) to assess dermal exposure to VOCs. Here we investigated whether ACC patches can be used as an under-glove indicator to evaluate the ingress of toluene through disposable gloves in a controlled environment, and compared these results to the amount of toluene ingress determined from the standardized test methods for determining chemical permeation through PPE. In a test chamber, with plugs for air sampling, five to six ACC patches were placed on a mannequin hand underneath disposable gloves (latex, nitrile, neoprene, polymer laminate). Three work-exposure scenarios were simulated to assess toluene ingress through the different gloves: vapor exposure; spray exposure, and immersion. The standard permeation test, using a diffusion cell, was carried with glove material of the palm, with continuous contact conditions. In all of ACC test, the order of toluene ingress was latex > neoprene > nitrile > Barrier, but for the standardized testing, the order of the neoprene and nitrile was reversed, and nitrile had higher levels of toluene ingress. These results show the need to think beyond standard testing techniques for occupational exposure to hazardous substances, and the added value of ?application style? testing.

AB  - Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD) are still under recognized and undertreated, especially in primary care settings. One of the challenges faced by clinicians is the remarkable inter-individual variability among patients with these conditions. In addition, each patient with MDD and BD experiences a unique pattern of longitudinal changes across time, i.e., intra-individual variability can also be problematic. The immense amount of data generated and collected through the use of smartphones or personal devices offers an opportunity to obtain continuous and reliable information on each individual's behavior, a less burdensome way to capture both intra and inter-individual variability over time. Digital phenotypes (DP) are a promising strategy to be integrated with other "Omics" platforms for prediction of relevant outcomes in mood disorders, including but not restricted to, relapse, recurrence, cognitive decline and functional impairment. Despite existing limitations and some skepticism, digital phenotyping represents a field in great expansion and might eventually constitute a feasible strategy in biomarkers research for mood disorders.

AB  - Detection of pathogens in food processing facilities by routine environmental monitoring (EM) is essential to reduce the risk of foodborne illness but is complicated by the complexity of equipment and environment surfaces. To optimize design of EM programs, we developed EnABLe ("Environmental monitoring with an Agent-Based Model of Listeria"), a detailed and customizable agent-based simulation of a built environment. EnABLe is presented here in a model system, tracing Listeria spp. (LS) (an indicator for conditions that allow the presence of the foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes) on equipment and environment surfaces in a cold-smoked salmon facility. EnABLe was parameterized by existing literature and expert elicitation and validated with historical data. Simulations revealed different contamination dynamics and risks among equipment surfaces in terms of the presence, level and persistence of LS. Grouping of surfaces by their LS contamination dynamics identified connectivity and sanitary design as predictors of contamination, indicating that these features should be considered in the design of EM programs to detect LS. The EnABLe modeling approach is particularly timely for the frozen food industry, seeking science-based recommendations for EM, and may also be relevant to other complex environments where pathogen contamination presents risks for direct or indirect human exposure.

AB  - Wastewater stabilization ponds (WSPs) have been proven to be economical alternatives to conventional wastewater treatment technologies due to their unique advantages including ease of operation, minimal energy input, and minimal maintenance requirements. Their reported high pathogen removal efficiencies have made WSPs a popular choice for wastewater treatment, especially as tertiary lagoons. This paper provides a critical overview of the various disinfection processes and mechanisms that occur in WSPs. A thorough review of the removal or attenuation mechanisms for bacterial, viral, protozoan, and helminthic pathogens is presented. Factors that impact the removal efficiency of pathogenic organisms may include sunlight, pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, sedimentation, attachment, hydraulic retention time, pond depth, predation and nutrient availability; the relationship between these factors is also discussed. The purpose of this review paper is to utilize the current understanding of pathogen removal mechanisms in pond systems to improve the operation and design of WSPs, and more importantly, to provide guidance for the definition of regulations with respect to pathogen removal in eco-engineered wastewater treatment systems such as WSPs.

AB  - Outdoor air pollution is a serious environmental problem in many developing countries; obtaining timely and accurate information about urban air quality is a first step toward air pollution control. Many developing countries however, do not have any monitoring stations and therefore the means to measure air quality. We address this problem by using social media to collect urban air quality information and propose a method for inferring urban air quality in Chinese cities based on China's largest social media platform, Sina Weibo combined with other meteorological data. Our method includes a data crawler to locate and acquire air-quality associated historical Weibo data, a procedure for extracting indicators from these Weibo and factors from meteorological data, a model to infer air quality index (AQI) of a city based on the extracted Weibo indicators supported by meteorological factors. We implemented the proposed method in case studies at Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan, China. The results show that based the Weibo indicators and meteorological factors we extracted, this method can infer the air quality conditions of a city within narrow margins of error. The method presented in this article can aid air quality assessment in cities with few or even no air quality monitoring stations. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The presence of fecal bacteria in seawater is one of the most important bio-indicator parameters of fecal pollution. In this study, the Bay of Izmir (in the eastern Aegean Sea), which is a critical area because of its relationship with marine transportation and industrial and commercial activities, was evaluated for its microbiological and physicochemical parameters through a monitoring program. The data were obtained from seasonally assembled surface seawater samples from 2015 to 2017 at 23 sampling stations. Bacteriological investigations were performed by membrane filtration technique. During the monitoring period, for stations at the inner and middle-outer part, it was found that the inner part is exposed to more number of fecal coliforms (8.8 x 10(2) cfu/100 mL) and fecal streptococci (1.1 x 10(3) cfu/100 mL). The monitoring analysis performed in this study showed that there was negative correlation between physicochemical parameters and the level of fecal bacteria, but no significance was recorded by the Pearson correlation test. Fecal contamination parameters should be routinely monitored for improving the environmental conditions of coastal cities.

AB  - In spite of analog radio frequency identification (RFID) sensors are gaining increasing attention from academic and industrial domains, their true applicability in the real world is still in question, since it is not clear whether and in which conditions the variation of the measured signals related to the sensing activity may be distinguished from the measurement uncertainties. The RFID platform for analog sensing, namely, with no dedicated sensing electronics, is here characterized in term of precision and accuracy with reference to the arrangement and the reproducibility of the setup. Numerical analysis and laboratory experimentations demonstrated that the precision of power metrics measurement is twice the resolution of low-cost readers and that the uncertainty on the distance and the alignment may play a major role on the data accuracy. The environment-independent indicator, such as the analog identifier, revealed once again to be a very stable and robust metric. In overall, the obtained results suggest that analog RFID devices can be used as indicative sensing platform to identify a few levels of the phenomenon under observation. The sensing granularity can be improved using low-power ICs, while classification algorithms could be applied to increase the robustness of the detection.

AB  - This paper suggested multicriteria based evaluation tool to assess the sustainability of three different reaction routes to dimethyl carbonate: direct synthesis from carbon dioxide and methanol, transesterification of methanol and propylene carbonate, and oxidative carbonylation of methanol. The first two routes are CO2-based and in a research and development phase, whereas the last one is a commercial process. The set of environmental, social, and economic indicators selected were renewability of feedstock, energy intensity, waste generation, CO2 balance, yield, feedstock price, process costs, health and safety issues of feedstock, process conditions, and innovation potential. The performance in these indicators was evaluated with the normalized scores from 0 to +1; 0 for detrimental and 1 for favorable impacts. The assessment showed that the transesterification route had the best potential toward sustainability, although there is still much development needed to improve yield. Further, the assessment gave clear understanding of the main benefits of each reaction route, as well as the major challenges to sustainability, which can further aid in orienting development efforts to key issues that need improvement. Finally, it was concluded that a multicriteria analysis such as the one presented in this paper was a viable method to be used in the process design stage.

AB  - In this study, the meiofaunal diversity in Lake Varano (southern Italy) is investigated in detail. Using a statistical approach, these data were coupled with the physicochemical parameters of the bottom water and the sediment characteristics in order to understand the factors influencing meiofaunal biodiversity distribution. The lake is selectively influenced by different factors, namely: organic matter and grain-size, as well as water salinity. Although these assemblages appear to be poorly diversified, the diversity index values are similar to those generally reported in other transitional environments. Relatively higher values of both meiofaunal and benthic foraminiferal diversity were found in front of the Capoiale channel and in the inner part of the lake. The meiofaunal assemblages are mainly dominated by nematodes, copepods, and turbellarians. The benthic foraminiferal assemblages comprise 18 taxa and are mainly represented by calcareous forms, suggesting a relatively low degree of confinement and, consequently, moderately restricted conditions. These assemblages are comparable to the Ammonia assemblages with Haynesina germanica that are characteristic of lagoons along the Mediterranean coasts. On the basis of these findings, coupled with the biotic data, the lake can be regarded as an oligo-mesotrophic environment.

AB  - Counts of immature stages of the mosquito Aedes aegypti have been used to calculate several entomological indices of dengue vector abundance. Some studies have concluded that these indices can be used as indicators of dengue epidemic risk, while other studies have failed to find a predictive relationship. Ecological niche models have been able to predict distributional patterns in space and time, not only of vectors, but also of the diseases that they transmit. In this study, we used Landsat 7 ETM+ images and two niche-modeling algorithms to estimate the local-landscape ecological niche and the dynamics of Ae. aegypti larval habitats in Bello, Colombia, and to evaluate their potential spatial and temporal distribution. Our models showed low omission error with high confidence levels: about 13.4% of the area presents conditions consistently suitable for breeding across the entire study period (20022008). The proportion of neighborhoods predicted to be suitable showed a positive association with dengue case rates, whereas the vector-focused Bretau index had no relationship to case rates. As a consequence, niche models appear to offer a superior option for predictive evaluation of dengue transmission risk and anticipating the potential for outbreaks.

AB  - Increasingly, researchers interested in identifying potentially biased test items are encouraged to use a confirmatory, rather than exploratory, approach. One such method for confirmatory testing is rooted in differential bundle functioning (DBF), where hypotheses regarding potential differential item functioning (DIF) for sets of items (bundles) are developed based on the substantive nature of the items and expected differences in group performance. Most often, analyses of these bundles for DBF have been conducted using simultaneous item bias test (SIBTEST). The goal of the current study was to introduce an alternative methodology for DBF detection based on the multiple indicators multiple cause (MIMIC) model and to compare this alternative with the traditional SIBTEST-based approach using a Monte Carlo simulation study. The results of this study showed that the MIMIC model performed as well as SIBTEST in ideal conditions, and better when the reference and focal groups had different means on the primary latent trait being measured. In addition, the MIMIC model was more accurate at detecting the presence of DBF for two bundles simultaneously than was SIBTEST. The discussion focuses on recommendations for practitioners.

AB  - The attenuation of H2S emissions by various landfill cover materials was evaluated using both laboratory and field experiments. The results demonstrated that cover materials consisting of selected waste products (compost and yard trash) and soils amended with quicklime and calcium carbonate effectively attenuated H2S emissions and detectable H2S emissions were only encountered in a testing plot using a sandy soil cover (average emission rate was 4.67 x 10(-6) mg m(-2) s(-1)). H2S concentration profiles in the cover materials indicated that H2S was removed as it migrated through the cover materials. At the same depth in the testing area, the H2S concentration in the sandy soil field plot was always higher than that of other testing plots because the sand (a) demonstrated less ability to remove H2S and (b) exhibited a higher H2S concentration at the base of the cover. Laboratory experiments confirmed these observations, with a combination of physical adsorption, chemical reactions, and biological oxidation, accounting for the enhanced removal. In addition to removal, the results suggest that some of the cover materials reduced H2S generation by creating less favorable conditions for sulfate-reducing bacteria (e.g., high pH and temperature).

AB  - Features of power flow of an undamped beam at resonance are studied in the present paper. It is found that when an undamped beam undergoes free vibration at one of its natural frequencies, the active component of the power flow becomes zero while the reactive component is of modal pattern, whose characteristic frequency is twice of the natural frequency. The power flow in this case can thus be termed as modal power flow. The instantaneous energy density associated with the vibration mode consists of a static component and a dynamic component, related to the mean total and Lagrangian energy densities, respectively. The modal power flow is relevant to the latter but independent of the former. Potential application of modal power flow to structural damage detection is investigated. Two typical damages, transverse cracks and delaminations, are considered. A damage index based on the modal power flow is proposed, and compared with the damage indices based on the slope, the bending strain, and the strain energy through numerical examples. The imperfection of boundary conditions is also considered. It is shown that the proposed damage index is sensitive to both types of damage, thus can be used as an universal damage indicator.

AB  - Striga hermonthica is a major biotic constraint in the dry and less fertile areas of northern Ethiopia. Emphasis is being placed on improved cropping systems to address the interrelated problems of Striga and soil fertility decline. The potential benefits of intercropping were investigated at two sites representing different environments for crop yield improvement, soil fertility maintenance and Striga control. Ten food legume and oilseed crop species were compared in inter-row arrangement with sorghum under non-fertilized conditions. In most cases, there was no significant negative impact of intercropping on sorghum growth and development. Among the intercrops, two cowpea varieties - cv. TVU 1977 OD and cv. Blackeye bean - produced the highest supplemental yield of up to 329 and 623 kg ha(-1) grain and 608 and 1173 kg ha(-1) biomass at Adibakel and Sheraro respectively. Treatment differences on Striga infestation and measured soil fertility indicators were not significant. Nevertheless, valuable grain and biomass obtained from the legume intercrops, without seriously compromising sorghum yield, could offer multiple benefits as a source of protein, additional income, feeds for animals and manure in the subsistence agriculture regions of northern Ethiopia.

AB  - The responses of cellular C and N, pigments and growth rates of Alexandrium tamarense to different sources of N at high concentrations (6, 12, 25, 50 and 100 muM-N) were examined. Nitrate induced the highest concentration of cellular C (an indicator of biovolume) and cellular N, followed by ammonium and then urea. Cellular C to N ratio (an indicator of physiological status) also varied between N sources. Nitrate grown cells had lower range of C:N ratios and ammonium grown cells had highly variable range. Urea cultures had the highest range of cellular C:N ratio. Pigment composition remained unchanged with all N substrates. The pigments decreased with increasing nitrate concentrations, but with ammonium pigments increased. On the other hand, urea concentrations had no clear relationship with cellular pigments. Variability in the growth of cells was due to both the physiological condition and pigments. When the cells are exposed to different N environments and concentration, they exhibit a physiological acclimation by regulating their cellular materials which is associated with growth.

AB  - Recently, Bums, Kentor, and Jorgenson [Crises and resistance in the 21st century world-system, Greenwood Press, 2003] empirically identified the effects of export commodity dependence on organic water pollution, which has disastrous effects on infant mortality rates in peripheral and semiperipheral countries. In this paper I build upon this recent study, while addressing three limitations in its analyses. First, instead of using per capita GNP as a measure of world-system position, I employ an indicator that captures the economic and political/military dimensions of position in the core/periphery hierarchy. Second, instead of excluding OECD countries from the study, I include all countries that data are available for. Third, I include a critical indicator neglected in Bums et al.'s analyses: agricultural production as a percentage of a country's total gross domestic product. Results of the quantitative cross-national analyses provide additional support for the previous key findings of Bums et al. (2003). Moreover, agriculture production proves to be a significant predictor of both organic water pollution and infant mortality rates, a finding that enhances our overall analytical and empirical accuracy in explaining environmental degradation and disastrous social domestic conditions, particularly in non-core, export commodity dependent societies.
