AB  - Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants. The most toxic PCBs are the non-ortho-substituted ("dioxin-like") congeners that act through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) pathway. In humans, perinatal exposure to dioxin-like PCBs is associated with neurodevelopmental toxicity in children. Yet, the full potential for later-life neurobehavioral effects that result from early-life low level exposure to dioxin-like PCBs is not well understood. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of developmental exposure to low levels of dioxin-like PCBs on early- and later-life behavioral phenotypes using zebrafish as a model system. We exposed zebrafish embryos to either vehicle (DMSO) or low concentrations of PCB126 (0.3, 0.6, 1.2 nM) for 20 h (4-24 h post fertilization), and then reared them to adulthood in clean water. Locomotor activity was tested at two larval stages (7 and 14 days post fertilization). Adult fish were tested for anxiety-related behavior using the novel tank and shoaling assays. Adult behavioral assays were repeated several times on the same group of fish and effects on intra- and inter-trial habituation were determined. While there was no effect of PCB126 on larval locomotor activity in response to changes in light conditions, developmental exposure to PCB126 resulted in impaired short- and long-term habituation to a novel environment in adult zebrafish. Cyp1a induction was measured as an indicator for AHR activation. Despite high induction at early stages, cyp1a expression was not induced in the brains of developmentally exposed adult fish that showed altered behavior, suggesting that AHR was not activated at this stage. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the zebrafish model in detecting subtle and delayed behavioral effects resulting from developmental exposure to an environmental contaminant.

AB  - Many studies have demonstrated linkages between the occurrence of fog and ecophysiological functioning in cloud forests, but few have investigated hydraulic functioning as a determining factor that explains sharp changes in vegetation. The objective of this study was to compare the plant water status during cloud-immersed and non-immersed conditions and hydraulic vulnerability in branches and roots of species across a temperate, mountain fog ecotone. Because cloud forests are often dark, cool and very moist, we expected cloud forest species to have less drought-tolerant characteristics (i.e., lower P-e and P-50-the pressures required to induce a 12 and 50% loss in hydraulic conductivity, respectively) relative to non-cloud forest species in adjacent (lower elevation) forests. Additionally, due to the ability of cloud forest species to absorb cloud-fog water, we predicted greater improvements in hydraulic functioning during fog in cloud forest species relative to non-cloud forest species. Across the cloud forest ecotone, most species measured were very resistant to losses in conductivity with branch P-50 values from -4.5 to -6.0aEuro...MPa, hydraulic safety margins (I-min - P-50) > 1.5aEuro...MPa and low calculated hydraulic conductivity losses. Roots had greater vulnerabilities, with P-50 values ranging from -1.4 to -2.5aEuro...MPa, leading to greater predicted losses in conductivity (20%). Calculated values suggested strong losses of midday leaf hydraulic conductance in three of the four species, supporting the hydraulic segmentation hypothesis. In both cloud forest and hardwood species, I-s were greater on foggy days than sunny days, demonstrating the importance of fog periods to plant water balance across fog regimes. Thus, frequent fog did not result in systemic changes in hydraulic functioning or vulnerability to embolism across our temperate cloud forest ecotone. Finally, roots functioned with lower hydraulic conductivity than branches, suggesting that they may serve as more sensitive indicators of hydraulic functioning in these mesic, foggy ecosystems.

AB  - Bacteria belonging to the genus Bacillus are amongst the most intensively studied group of bacteria for use as probiotics in aquaculture. However, the exact mechanism of action of these bacteria is often not well described, and the microbiota that are naturally present in cultures of test organisms often compromise the interpretation of the results. The present study aimed to evaluate the putative probiotic effect of Bacillus sp. LT3 in a model system with gnotobiotic brine shrimp Artemia franciscana larvae. The strain significantly increased the survival of brine shrimp larvae challenged with Vibrio campbellii when administered 6 h before the challenge. Under these conditions, LT3 was able to colonize the brine shrimp gastrointestinal tract and to decrease the in vivo pathogen activity as indicated by the bioluminescence of the V. campbellii associated with brine shrimp larvae. In order to investigate the effect of the Bacillus strain on the innate immune system of the brine shrimp larvae, prophenoloxidase and transglutaminase mRNA levels were monitored, while heat shock protein 70 mRNA levels were measured as an indicator of physiological stress. Interestingly, 12 h after challenge, the prophenoloxidase mRNA level in the larvae pre-treated with LT3 and challenged with V. campbellii was approximately 8-fold higher than in the other treatments. Further, a decreased mRNA level of transglutaminase gene and heat shock protein 70 gene suggested that pretreatment with LT3 results in less stress and tissue damage in the brine shrimp larvae upon V. campbellii challenge. These results indicated that Bacillus sp. LT3 could improve the survival of brine shrimp larvae when challenged with pathogenic V. campbellii, both by decreasing the in vivo activity of the pathogen and by priming the innate immune response through activating the prophenoloxidase system.

AB  - Economic success of an IOR project primarily depends on the effectiveness of the selected method in the reservoir of interest and the way it is deployed. Due to the heavy computational work required for a large number of simulations, it is rather an arduous task to determine optimum design schemes for a given project. Proxy models that mimic reservoir models can potentially offer an opportunity to reduce the number of simulation runs and allow timely reservoir-management decisions to be made. In this study, a high-performance screening/optimization workflow is presented to narrow the ranges of possible scenarios to be modeled using conventional simulation. The workflow proposed starts with creating a knowledge base with simulations for a wide range reservoir characteristics and design scenarios. Then, neural-network based proxy models are trained with the knowledge base. Finally, the genetic algorithm is used to search for the optimum design scenario by evaluating the objective function via proxy models for increased computational efficiency. This workflow is applied to the cyclic pressure pulsing process with CO2 and N-2 in naturally fractured reservoirs. Developed proxies are universal such that the range of their applicabilities is extended to a wide spectrum of reservoir characteristics, including initial conditions, well spacing and reservoir fluid types (heavy, black, and volatile). Proxy models proved to be able to predict critical performance indicators such as cumulative oil production, and oil flow rates within high levels of accuracy (with a correlation coefficient of 0.91 on average). The genetic algorithm is coupled with proxy models to maximize the discounted oil volume produced per injected volume for a specified period of operation. After utilizing the aforementioned workflow, it is possible to significantly reduce the computational time and manpower expended with an initial screening of the cyclic pressure pulsing process. In this way, more effective design strategies can be structured for the reservoir under consideration. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Trunk diameter fluctuations (TDFs) have been suggested as an irrigation-scheduling tool for several fruit trees, but the works in olive trees has not obtained successful results with any of the indicators (maximum daily shrinkage (MDS) and trunk growth rate (TGR)) that are calculated from the daily TDF curves. No studies of olive trees have ever used reference trees to reduce the influence of the environment, as in work for other fruit trees. In this work, we compare different continuous and discrete water status measurements in a drought cycle. We suggest the calculation of a new and related indicator (DTGR), the difference between the TGR of stressed trees, and the TGR of reference trees. Negative DTGR values always indicate water stress conditions. The current work describes the variations of this new indicator (DTGR) in relation to water stress, and compares DTRG to the midday stem water potential, maximum leaf conductance and to the MDS. The midday stem water potential and the maximum leaf conductance describe the stress cycle clearer than the trunk diameter fluctuation indicators. No significant differences were found in the values of MDS between stressed and reference trees. On the other hand, the DTGR pattern values were near that of the stem water potential, though positive values were recorded in some dates during the water stress cycle. These variations indicate that DTGR is not a cumulative water stress indicators, as is water potential. Therefore, according to our data, water potential is a better indicator than the TDF parameters when no deficit irrigation scheduling is performed in olive trees. DTGR seems to be a good indicator of water stress from a threshold value around -1.4 MPa in olive trees. In addition, higher variability of DTGR than stem water potential may also be reduced with the increase in the number of sensors. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The south region of Sao Paulo city hosts the Guarapiranga dam, responsible for water supply to 25% of the city population. Their surroundings have been subject to intense and irregular occupation by people from very low socioeconomics classes. Measurements undertaken on sediment and particulate materials in the dam revealed concentrations of lead. copper, zinc and cadmium above internationally accepted limits. Epidemiological and toxicological studies undertaken by the World Health Organization in individuals exhibiting lead concentrations in blood, near or below the maximum recommended (10 mu g dl(-1)), surprisingly revealed that toxic effects are more intense in individuals belonging to low socioeconomics classes. Motivated by these facts, we aimed at the investigation of chronic incorporation of lead. as well as the use of our BIOKINETICS code, which is based on an accepted ICRP biokinetics model for lead, in order to extrapolate the results from teeth to other organs. The focus of our data taking was children from poor families, living in a small, restrict and allegedly contaminated area in Sao Paulo city. Thus, a total of 74 human teeth were collected. The average concentration of lead in teeth of children 5 to 10 years old was determined by means of a high-resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). For standardization of the measurements, an animal bone certified material (H-Animal Bone), from the International Atomic Energy Agency, was analyzed. The amount of lead in children living in the surroundings of the dam, was approximately 40% higher than those from the control region, and the average lead concentration was equal to 1.3 mu g g(-1) approximately. Grouping the results in terms of gender, tooth type and condition, it was concluded that a carious molar of boys is a much more efficient contamination pathway for lead, resulting in concentrations 70% higher than in the control region. We also inferred the average concentrations of lead in other organs of these children, by making use of our BIOKINETIC code. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) fertilizer is one of the main growth limiting nutrients in leafy crops and represents one of the highest input costs in horticultural systems and a potential concern for the environment. As a consequence, any environmental and economic considerations need a deep analysis of N fertiliser utilisation in vegetable production. This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of the reduction of N fertilisation on yield, quality, N uptake and N utilisation efficiency of processing spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.). To accomplish this objective two field experiments were carried out in the Foggia Plain (Southern Italy) to determine the optimum N-application level and ways of modulating it during the growing cycle through the application of different N rates. In a completely randomized experimental design with four replications the following three N fertilization treatments were compared: 50% (N 150 kg ha(-1)), 75% (N 225 kg ha(-1)) and 100% (N 300 kg ha(-1)) of the normal rate applied by the farmers in the trial area. Subdividing the total amounts in equal parts, the urea fertiliser was broadcasted in three times: before sowing, at the stage of second couple of leaves (38 days after sowing, DAS) and at fast growing stage (81 DAS). The results indicate that lower N fertilization level ensured a satisfactory yield, quality (dry matter and nitrate contents), N uptake and N utilisation pattern. It also decreased the amount of N available for leaching during the whole cropping cycle. The higher quantity of N applied at the maximum level did not increase the majority of the measured parameters, whereas the N utilization efficiency decreased significantly from the intermediate to the highest N treatment level in both field experiments. The results of this research indicated the way to optimise N fertilisation of processing spinach, in terms of quantity and time of fertiliser application, to obtain satisfactory crop performances and reducing environmental risks.

AB  - For decades, palynologists working in tropical South America are using the genus Podocarpus as a climate indicator although without referring to any modern data concerning its distribution and limiting factors. With the aim to characterize the modern and past distribution of the southern conifer Podocarpus in Brazil and to obtain new information on the distribution of the Atlantic rainforest during the Quaternary, we examined herbarium data to locate the populations of three Brazilian endemic Podocarpus species: P. sellowii, P. lambertii, and P. brasiliensis, and extracted DNA from fresh leaves from 26 populations. Our conclusions are drawn in the light of the combination of these three disciplines: botany, palynology, and genetics. We find that the modern distribution of endemic Podocarpus populations shows that they are widely dispersed in eastern Brazil, from north to south and reveals that the expansion of Podocarpus recorded in single Amazonian pollen records may have come from either western or eastern populations. Genetic analysis enabled us to delimit regional expansion: between 5 degrees and 15 degrees S grouping northern and central populations of P.sellowii expanded c. 16,000 years ago; between 15 degrees and 23 degrees S populations of either P. lambertii or sellowii expanded at different times since at least the last glaciation; and between 23 degrees and 30 degrees S, P. lambertii appeared during the recent expansion of the Araucaria forest. The combination of botany, pollen, and molecular analysis proved to be a rapid tool for inferring distribution borders for sparse populations and their regional evolution within tropical ecosystems. Today the refugia of rainforest communities we identified are crucial hotspots to allow the Atlantic forest to survive under unfavourable climatic conditions and, as such, offer the only possible opportunity for this type of forest to expand in the event of a future climate change.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to develop, evaluate and set up baseline values for reliable acute and chronic stress indicators in sexually immature red porgy, Pagrus pagrus. The effects of anaesthesia, acute (chasing for 10 min followed by air exposure for 3-4 min) and chronic (different stocking densities: 5 vs. 25 kg m(-3) and water temperatures: 15 degrees C, 19 degrees C, 25 degrees C) stressors on stress indicators were studied. Cortisol, lactate, norepinephrine, epinephrine, glucose, electrolytes, and prothrombin time were found to be reliable indicators of acute stress, whereas lactate and catecholamines were found to be reliable indicators of chronic stress. Baseline values were: glucose, 2.05-5.17 mmol l(-1); lactate, 0.15-1.5 mmol l(-1); cortisol, 0.8-24.9 ng ml(-1) - potassium, 1.5-4.5 mmol l(-1); sodium, 167-206 inmol l(-1); chloride, 165-180 mmol l(-1); and prothrombin time, 9.26-14.65 s. Plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations after minimum handling were 2.4-43.2 nM and 9.6-74.5 nM, respectively. The present study also revealed that stocking density expressed in kg m(-3) is not an appropriate measure to describe and compare the physiological status of fish under intensive culture conditions. Results suggested that when group and tank sizes are reduced, even at a low stocking density (5 kg m(-3)), the maintenance cost is higher than the one at high stocking density (25 kg m(-3)). In addition, low (15 degrees C) and high (25 degrees C) water temperatures were important environmental stressors for Pagrus pagrus, as shown by the observed elevated (mean+/-SEM) norepinephrine (15 degrees C: 110.8+/-17.6 nM, 19 degrees C: 84.0+/-6.0 nM, 25 degrees C: 160.8+/-24.6 nM) plasma concentrations.

AB  - Although fungi are known to colonize and decompose plant tissues in various environments, there is scanty information on fungal communities on wetland plants, their relation to microhabitat conditions, and their link to plant litter decomposition. We examined fungal diversity and succession on Phragmites australis leaves both attached to standing shoots and decaying in the litter layer of a brackish tidal marsh. Additionally, we followed changes in fungal biomass (ergosterol), leaf nitrogen dynamics, and litter mass loss on the sediment surface of the marsh. Thirty-five fungal taxa were recorded by direct observation of sporulation structures. Detrended correspondence analysis and cluster analysis revealed distinct communities of fungi sporulating in the three microhabitats examined (middle canopy, top canopy, and litter layer), and indicator species analysis identified a total of seven taxa characteristic of the identified subcommunities. High fungal biomass developed in decaying leaf blades attached to standing shoots, with a maximum ergosterol concentration of 548 +/- 83 mu g g(-1) ash-free dry mass (AFDM; mean +/- SD). When dead leaves were incorporated in the litter layer on the marsh surface, fungi experienced a sharp decline in biomass (to 191 +/- 60 mu g ergosterol g(-1) AFDM) and in the number of sporulation structures. Following a lag phase, species not previously detected began to sporulate. Leaves placed in litter bags on the sediment surface lost 50% of their initial AFDM within 7 months (k = -0.0035 day(-1)) and only 21% of the original AFDM was left after 11 months. Fungal biomass accounted for up to 34 +/- 7% of the total N in dead leaf blades on standing shoots, but to only 10 +/- 4% in the litter layer. These data suggest that fungi are instrumental in N retention and leaf mass loss during leaf senescence and early aerial decay. However, during decomposition on the marsh surface, the importance of living fungal mass appears to diminish, particularly in N retention, although a significant fraction of total detrital N may remain associated with dead hyphae.

AB  - Radiolarian abundance and species composition have been determined in 72 surface: sediment samples from the northeastern East China Sea. The results are compared with chemical and physical properties of the overlying water masses, and with sediment conditions. In the study area, radiolarian abundance and species number increase markedly from northwest to southeast, and their distributions can be divided into three provinces: the low-density zone corresponding to the shelf, the middle-density zone corresponding to the western slope of the Okinawa Trough and the high-density zone corresponding to the central part of the Okinawa Trough. The distribution of radiolarians correlates well with modem sea surface temperature and sea surface salinity, but shows a negative relation with nutrients and primary productivity of the overlying water. This distribution pattern is also strongly affected by the sediment type and terrigenous material input. Also, the Kuroshio Current has an important effect on controlling the distribution and species composition of radiolarian fauna in this area. Based on three Q-mode factors (accounting for 90.2% of the variance), three radiolarian assemblages have been distinguished, and their distributions are clearly correlated with oceanographic current patterns in the region. The mixed water assemblage dominated by Tetrapyle circularis, Tetrapyle quadriloba and Ommatartus tetrathalamus tetrathalamus is restricted to the area of the Mixed Water, but mainly influenced by the Shelf Water. The Kuroshio Water assemblage, which is dominated by Lithelius minor, Dictyocoryne profunda, Stylodictya multispina, Acrosphaera spinosa, Dictyocoryne truncatum, Spongaster tetrars, Stylodictya arachnia and Ommatartus tetrathalamus tetrathalamus, is basically controlled by the Kuroshio Surface Water. And the transition assemblage dominated by Tetrapyle quadriloba and Monozonium pachystylum is associated with the Tsushima Warm Current Water. The boundaries among these assemblages approximately coincide with the oceanographic front. And the changes in the distribution of these assemblages could be,regarded as-not only modifications of the water masses, but also indicators of the possible movements of the oceanic front.

AB  - Abundance of C-3 and C-4 photosynthesis plants can be inferred relatively from stable carbon isotopic composition of organic matter in soils. The samples from five sequences of the last glacial-interglacial loess-soil in the Chinese Loess Plateau have been measured for organic carbon isotopic ratios (delta(13)C(org)). The organic carbon isotope data show that relative abundance (or biomass) of C-4 plants was increased ca. 40% for each sampling site from the last glacial maximum (LGM) to Holocene optimum, and increased southeastward on the Loess Plateau during both periods of LGM and Holocene. Statistic analyses on the steady maximum delta(13)C(org) values of Holocene soils and modern climatic data from the Loess Plateau and Inner Mongolia indicate that the C-4 plant abundance increases with increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation. The C-4 plant abundance is related much closer with mean April temperature and precipitation than annual. These results lead us to deduce following conclusions. First, temperature is the major factor for control on variations in C-4 plant abundance in the Loess Plateau from the last glacial to interglacial. In the absence of favorable temperature condition, both of low moisture and low atmospheric CO2 concentration are insufficient to drive an expansion of the C-4 plants in the plateau. Second, delta(13)C(org) in the loess-paleosol sequences, as a proxy of the relative abundance of C-4 plants in the Loess Plateau, could not be used as an indicator of changes in the summer monsoon intensity unless the temperature had changed without great amplitude. Since all C-4 plants are grasses, finally, the increase of the C-4 plants supports that forest has not been dominant in the ecosystem on the Loess Plateau during Holocene although precipitation and atmospheric CO2 were largely increased relative to those during LGM.

AB  - [1] We assess the possible impact of the distribution of naturally occurring surfactants on the direct integration of the global atmosphere-ocean CO2 flux across the ocean surface. The global atmosphere-ocean CO2 flux is calculated using the monthly mean DeltapCO(2) climatology compiled by Takahashi et al. [1997] as well as satellite wind speed and sea-surface temperature data. In the absence of any global map of surfactant coverage and as it is known that phytoplankton exudates and degradation products are the major sources of marine surfactants, ocean primary productivity, which can be derived from the satellite-based estimate of chlorophyll concentration, is used as an indicator of the presence of surfactants as proposed by Asher [1997]. From the calculated results it is found that suppression of the upward and downward CO2 fluxes by marine surfactants exhibits an asymmetric effect: The average percent reduction of absorption flux by surfactants is about twice that of outgassing, which results in an overall decrease in the net global CO2 uptake by the oceans. For almost half of the year (between January and May) the presence of surfactants does not affect CO2 outgassing from global oceans. In contrast, throughout the entire year the presence of surfactants suppresses CO2 absorption by the oceans. The major reduction in absorption fluxes occurs in the northern Pacific and Atlantic (10degreesN to 70degreesN) in all seasons and in the Southern Ocean (south of 40degreesS) in austral spring and summer. However, the most significant decrease in outgassing fluxes occurs in the equatorial and southern Pacific Ocean (40degreesS to 10degreesN), particularly in the eastern equatorial and subtropical waters off the southern American coast, in the period of austral spring and summer. Annual net CO2 flux is reduced by approximately 20% under the surfactant coverage condition that the primary productivity is above a threshold value of 25 g-C m(-2) mom(-1) and by about 50% with a threshold of 15 g-C m(-2) mom(-1).

AB  - Farmed mink are known for showing stereotypies and tail biting, behaviours that are mostly viewed as indicators of reduced welfare. Among the factors that are often described as being relevant for the welfare of mink are food management systems, age at weaning, and type/presence of nest boxes and bedding. In the present study, of commercially farmed mink, all of these factors have been integrated in one housing system. The occurrence of stereotypies and tail biting were observed at six Dutch mink farms, which differed from one another with respect to the number of modifications and the time since the introduction Of these modifications. Oil each farm, 60 non-lactating female mink were observed during winter and 50 lactating female mink (with kits) were observed during summer. Mink on the farm with the most modifications spent 4.1% and 0.8% of their time performing stereotypies in winter and in summer, respectively. Mink oil the farm with the least modi cations spent 32% and 10.9% of their time performing stereotypies in winter and in summer, respectively. The occurrence of stereotypic behaviour in winter gradually, increased as feeding time approached. This gradual increase was not observed at the farm with the least modifications. In general, mink spent less time performing stereotypies in summer than in winter. No clear differences were found between the farms for the occurrence of tail biting in relation to the modifications of the new system, although one farm showed a lower percentage (4%) of tail biters during summer. In conclusion, the farms that had introduced more modifications into their husbandry system housed animals showing less stereotypic behaviour. The results of this field study demonstrate an inverse relationship between the number of modifications and the occurrence of stereotypies; because of the experimental design, however, a causal relationship is not implied. Further work is required to investigate the impact of each measure both in isolation and in the integrated system under more carefully standardised conditions.

AB  - This study examines how Choristoneura rosaceana male quality, as determined by larval diet, age and mating history, affects the reproductive success of both sexes. While the size of the spermatophore produced at first mating increased linearly with male age, the frequency of mating was significantly higher for middle-aged males (2-4 days old) than younger (0-2 days old) or older (6-8 days old) individuals, when both sexes were fed on artificial diet. However, the duration of copulation was longer in couples with older than younger males. The observed age-related changes in spermatophore size had no significant effect on female longevity, fecundity or fertility, suggesting no direct relationship between male investment and spermatophore size under these experimental conditions, Different larval food sources (artificial diet, maple and hazelnut) did not affect the proportion of 2-day-old virgin males that mated; however, the proportion that remated was significantly higher for males reared on high-quality food (maple and artificial diet) than those on hazelnut, a poorer food source. There was a 5-fold decline in spermatophore size between the first and second matings on all diets, but female reproductive output was reduced by only 25%. In contrast, while the first spermatophore produced by males on hazelnut was 1.5 times smaller than those produced on maple and artificial diet, the fecundity of their mates was 40% less than those mated with high-quality virgin males. These results provide additional support to the idea that spermatophore size is not a valuable indicator of male quality. Most tethered females placed in the field during the first flight period mated with virgin males (based on the size of the spermatophore), suggesting that female choice exists in this species. These results are discussed in relation to the incidence of polyandry in naturally occurring populations of Choristoneura and the potential use of size and/or chemical cues by females to assess male quality.

AB  - Climate and weather fluctuations and changes are the most important environmental drivers of tree canopy defoliation, an indicator of forest health. We examined the relationship between tree defoliation and Basal Area Increment (BAI), a dimension of tree growth related to wood biomass increment and carbon sequestration and therefore to the climate change mitigation potential of forests. We analysed data from mostly even-aged, singlespecies permanent monitoring plots in France over two growing periods (1995-2004: 47 plots, 2008 trees; 2000-2009: 63 plots, 3116 trees) and for which precipitation deficit was identified as the main environmental driver of defoliation. Trees from ten different species were assessed annually for defoliation and measured periodically for growth, from which we derived periodical (10-year) BAI (BAIperiod). We investigated (i) direction and significance of defoliation-BAIperiod relationships and (ii) occurrence, size and significance of BAI deviation of progressively defoliated trees in proportion to the BAI of undefoliated trees (BAIrel). Analyses were first carried out at the level of individual plots, with results subsequently evaluated using meta-analysis and further aggregated at different levels (all species, functional groups, individual species). BAIperiod resulted negatively and significantly related to defoliation, with a significant reduction detected already at slight (15%) defoliation level. A generalized statistically significant reduction of BAIrel was obvious, leading to an estimated reduction of 0.7-0.8% per 1% increase in defoliation for conifers and 0.9% for broadleaves. Considering the observed distribution of trees along the defoliation range, our results indicate an overall growth reduction of ca. 42% in comparison to a theoretical population of undefoliated trees. Shifts in such a distribution can result into loss or gain of growth, which in turn may have cascading effects on carbon sequestration and therefore on land-climate interactions. In the context of the significant increase in defoliation observed in Europe in recent decades, our results suggest that even slight and moderate variations in defoliation may have had a significant impact on tree and forest growth.

AB  - Shell middens, sometimes in the form of mounds of great size, are a ubiquitous indicator of coastal settlement and exploitation of marine resources across the world. However, shell middens are relatively rare before the mid-Holocene because most palaeoshorelines before that time are now submerged by sea-level rise since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Previously reported examples of underwater shell middens are almost unknown and of uncertain status, and it has generally been assumed that such deposits would not survive the destructive impact of sea-level rise or would be indistinguishable from natural shell deposits. Recently, two examples of underwater shell deposits have been independently discovered and verified as anthropogenic midden deposits e a Mesolithic shell midden on the island of Hjarno in the Straits of Denmark, and a Middle to Late Archaic shell midden in the Econfina Channel of the Gulf of Mexico, Florida, USA. We report the comparative geoarchaeological analysis of these deposits, using a sedimentological approach to unravel their formation history and post-depositional transformation. Despite the differences in coastal geomorphology and geology, cultural context, molluscan taxonomy and preservation conditions between these sites, the results demonstrate similar sedimentological profiles that are distinctive of anthropogenic deposits, demonstrate their origin as subaerial deposits at the shore edge before inundation by sea-level rise, and show that these properties can be identified in sediment samples recovered from coring. These findings support arguments that such sites likely exist in greater numbers than previously assumed, that they can be identified from minimally invasive techniques without the need for extensive underwater excavation, and that they should be sought to fill critical gaps in the temporal and geographical record concerning Late Quaternary human use of coastal zones and marine resources.

AB  - The World Health Organization (WHO) classified COVID-19 as a global pandemic, with the situation ultimately requiring unprecedented measures to mitigate the effects on public health and the global economy. Although SARS-CoV-2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19) is primarily respiratory in nature, multiple studies confirmed its genetic material could be detected in the feces of infected individuals, thereby highlighting sewage as a potential indicator of community incidence or prevalence. Numerous wastewater surveillance studies subsequently confirmed detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and wastewater-associated solids/sludge. However, the methods employed in early studies vary widely so it is unclear whether differences in reported concentrations reflect true differences in epidemiological conditions, or are instead driven by methodological artifacts. The current study aimed to compare the performance of virus recovery and detection methods, detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in two Southern Nevada sewersheds from March-May 2020, and better understand the potential link between COVID-19 incidence/prevalence and wastewater concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. SARS-CoV-2 surrogate recovery (0.34%-55%) and equivalent sample volume (0.1 mL(-1) L) differed between methods and target water matrices, ultimately impacting method sensitivity and reported concentrations. Composite sampling of influent and primary effluent resulted in a similar to 10-fold increase in concentration relative to corresponding grab primary effluent samples, presumably highlighting diurnal variability in SARS-CoV-2 signal. Detection and quantification of four SARS-CoV-2 genetic markers (up to similar to 10(6) gene copies per liter), along with ratios of SARS-CoV-2 to pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), exhibited comparability with public health data for two sewersheds in an early phase of the pandemic. Finally, a wastewater model informed by fecal shedding rates highlighted the potential significance of new cases (i.e., incidence rather than prevalence) when interpreting wastewater surveillance data.

AB  - Dredged sediment contains various contaminants that are released during the process of dewatering and subsequent utilization. In this study, two organic polymers-chitosan (CS) and cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM) both in samples of varying molecular weights (MWs)-were used as flocculants to improve dewatering and theological behaviors of dredged sediment, and floc properties were characterized to unravel the mechanisms of flocculation treatment. Moreover, pollutant transfer and release in the flocculation-dewatering process was investigated. Compared to CPAM, CS had better performance in dredged sediment dewatering, and more compact flocs were produced after treatment. The flocculated sediment belonged to the type of yield dilatant fluid and showed good shear resistance. Three-dimensional excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy and PARAFAC showed that protein-like substances were removed after treatment. The MW of CS had insignificant effects on flocculation performance, whereas CPAM removal efficiency for protein-like substances was increased at higher MWs, which may be related to the adsorption bridging effect of CPAM polymer chains. There were significant correlations between the dewatering performance of sediments, MW distribution of organics and rheological properties. CS and CPAM treatments caused the transformation of Fe/Al-P into Ca-P. which could reduce phosphorus release and its ecological risk. The flocculants contributed to the formation of carbonate-bound forms of As, Cr, Pb, and Ni. Ecological risk assessment results of the geo-accumulation index showed that medium- and low-MW CS reduced risk of sediment contamination, whereas CPAM and high-MW CS increased the ecological risk. CS had a greater effect on the release of VOCs than CPAM, with an increased release of total VOCs at higher flocculant MWs. The study was helpful to understand the dewatering mechanism of dredged sediment and provided a new strategy for pollution release management in sediment dewatering. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rotor shafts subjected to severe operating stresses are prone to develop transverse fatigue cracks at the localized stress raisers. Therefore, the ability to identify and locate the incipient fatigue crack is imperative in order to avoid catastrophic failure. The literature on rotor crack detection discussed the importance of monitoring the steady-state 1X, 2X and 3X harmonic response components of rotors. However, the other rotor faults such as misalignment and unbalance, exhibit similar symptoms. Thus, the main aim is to develop new independent fault-related features which measure the driving principle governing the behaviour of various rotor faults. In this article, the application of principal component analysis-based statistical pattern analysis, as a tool for early detection and localization of fatigue-induced transverse crack in a rotor shaft is investigated. To perform this study, accelerated fatigue experiments are conducted on a customized setup. This developed test rig is novel and unique by itself that facilitates generating a fatigue crack in a shaft, under conditions that mimic a real in-service loading environment of industrial rotors. Unlike conventional methods, noise in the acquired vibration and strain data is denoised via classical principal component analysis method. Time- and frequency-domain statistical features extracted from different vibration and strain sensor signals are used for this study. Damage indices such as Hotelling'sT(2)-statistic andQ-index are used to detect the presence of the crack. It is observed that irrespective of the sensor location, damage index such as Q-statistic of all the sensors is very effective to detect the presence and time of incipient crack. Partial decomposition contributions method is found to be very effective in identifying the location of the crack. This article provides the most significant vibration-based statistical features, which are sensitive to shaft transverse cracks, for different sensor types and their mounting location. Finally, a new fused health indicator which is highly sensitive to the presence of rotor shaft crack is defined and is found successful when applied to a new experimental data.

AB  - PurposeCombination of PCI and chemotherapy represents a promising strategy for combating drug resistance of cancer. However, poor solubility of photosensitizers and unselectively released drugs at unwanted sites significantly impaired the treatment efficacy. Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to develop a nano-platform which could efficiently co-entrapping photosensitizers and chemotherapeutics for active targeting therapy of drug resistant cancers.MethodsTwo pro-drugs were respectively developed by covalently linking the Ce6 with each other via the GSH-sensitive linkage and the PTX with mPEG-PLA-COOH through the ROS sensitive-linker. The dual-responsive nanoparticles (PNP-Ce6) was developed by emulsion/solvent evaporation method and further modified with tLyp-1 peptides. Physicochemical properties of nanoparticles were determined by the TEM and DLC. Cellular uptake assay was investigated with the Ce6 acting as the fluorescent probe and cell growth was studied by the MTT experiment. In vivo tumor targeting and anti-tumor assay was investigated on the colorectal cancer-bearing mice.ResultsThe developed tPNP-Ce6 were stable enough under the normal physiological conditions. However, free Ce6 and PTX were completely released when exposed the tPNP-Ce6 to the redox environment. Excellent tumor-targeting drug delivery was achieved by the tPNP-Ce6, which in turn resulted in satisfactory anit-tumor effect. Of great importance, super inhibition effect on tumor progress was achieved by the combination therapy when compared with the group only received with chemotherapy..ConclusionThe results obtained in the present study indicated that the developed tPNP-Ce6 may have great potential in enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of drug-resistant colorectal cancer.

AB  - Recent advances in mechanistic modeling of vegetated filter strips (VFS) have made it possible to incorporate VFS mitigation into environmental exposure assessments (EEAs). However, outside of fixed efficiency approaches, there are no widely adopted and standardized procedures for incorporating VFS quantitative mitigation into long-term, higher-tier EEAs. A source of hesitation involves the use of empirical equations for predicting pesticide trapping by the VFS. A recent study evaluated existing empirical equations and a mechanistic mass-balance approach using the most extensive field database available of VFS pesticide efficiency from single-event storms. That study concluded that an updated empirical equation (Sabbagh equation) and a mechanistic mass-balance approach performed reasonably well. The objective of this research was to study the effect of upscaling the VFS trapping equations from single events into long-term EEAs. The U.S. EPA Pesticide in Water Calculator (PWC) model linked with the Vegetative Filter Strip MODeling system (VFSMOD) long-term EEA modeling framework (30 yr) was updated to incorporate the alternative trapping equations and tested VFS mitigation results under contrasting agroecological settings with varying erosion/sediment transport conditions. Differences in both acute and chronic 90th percentile estimated environmental exposure concentrations (EECs) were relatively small when comparing predictions using the four pesticide trapping equations. A global sensitivity analysis (GSA) also indicated that selection of a specific trapping equation for predicting EECs was less important than other important input factors such as the VFS length and pesticide properties. However, in terms of the percent reductions in EECs, the choice of pesticide trapping equation was as important as the VFS length. This research builds upon the conclusion of previous single-event studies that the mechanistic mass-balance and refit Sabbagh empirical equation were both valid for EEAs. The mass balance approach represents a reasonable option for regulatory agencies that prefer mechanistic approaches. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Evidence for hydrothermal activity, such as siliceous rocks, iron dolomite layer deposits, and hydrothermal mineral combinations of ilmenite + pyrite + anhydrite, has been found in the high-quality source rocks from the Chang 7 layer in the Triassic Yanchang Formation from the southern margin of the Ordos Basin, China. In this paper, elemental geochemical analysis is carried out on a large number of samples collected from an outcrop geological section and drill core from the Chang 7 layer. We use elemental ratios to study the hydrothermal activity; the Al/(Al + Fe + Mn) ratio reflects the paleoproductivity, and the P/Al and P/Ti ratios and total S contents reflect the redox environment. The relationships between the hydrothermal activity and paleoproductivity, redox conditions and organic matter content are discussed. The correlation coefficients between the hydrothermal index Al/(Al + Fe + Mn) and the (Fe + Mn)/Ti ratio and total organic carbon are as high as -0.88 and 0.87, respectively, demonstrating a close relationship between hydrothermal activity and source-rock deposition. The correlation coefficients between the Al/(Al + Fe + Mn) ratio and the P/Al and P/Ti ratios, and total S contents are -0.81, -0.80, and -0.89, respectively, supporting this relationship. Hydrothermal activity can promote productivity at the lake surface and the development of a bottom-water anoxic environment. The paleoproductivity level of the Chang 7 sedimentary period is relatively high and represents an oxygen-poor anaerobic environment. The hydrothermal activity in the southern margin of the basin is strong, whereas the activity in the north is gradually weakened. Studies have shown that the hydrothermal activity at the bottom of the lake plays an important role in promoting the large-scale development of the Chang 7 high-quality source rocks. The organic matter abundance in samples with hydrothermal alteration are greater than in samples elsewhere.

AB  - The dry-wet transition is of great importance for vegetation dynamics, however the response mechanism of vegetation variations is still unclear due to the complicated effects of climate change. As a critical ecologically fragile area located in the southeast Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the Yarlung Zangbo River (YZR) basin, which was selected as the typical area in this study, is significantly sensitive and vulnerable to climate change. The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) based on the GLDAS-NOAH products and the GIMMS-NDVI remote sensing data from 1982 to 2015 were employed to investigate the spatio-temporal characteristics of the dry-wet regime and the vegetation dynamic responses. The results showed that: (1) The spatio-temporal patterns of the precipitation and temperature simulated by the GLDAS-NOAH fitted well with those of the in-situ data. (2) During the period of 1982-2015, the whole YZR basin exhibited an overall wetting tendency. However, the spatio-temporal characteristics of the dry-wet regime exhibited a reversal phenomenon before and after 2000, which was jointly identified by the SPEI and runoff. That is, the YZR basin showed a wetting trend before 2000 and a drying trend after 2000; the arid areas in the basin showed a tendency of wetting whereas the humid areas exhibited a trend of drying. (3) The region where NDVI was positively correlated with SPEI accounted for approximately 70% of the basin area, demonstrating a similar spatio-temporal reversal phenomenon of the vegetation around 2000, indicating that the dry-wet condition is of great importance for the evolution of vegetation. (4) The SPEI showed a much more significant positive correlation with the soil water content which accounted for more than 95% of the basin area, implying that the soil water content was an important indicator to identify the dry-wet transition in the YZR basin.

AB  - The severe shortage of helium resources is an impending global problem. However, the helium accumulation processes and conditions favorable for helium enrichment in reservoirs remain poorly understood, which makes helium exploration challenging. Noble gases are good tracers of subsurface fluids provenance, migration and storage, as well as indicators of the nature and quantity of associated phases. In this study the variation of major gases and noble gases data in Weihe Basin provide us with an excellent opportunity to understand the groundwater evolution and helium accumulation processes. Twelve gas samples collected from wellheads of geothermal wells can be classified into three groups, in which Group A has high concentrations of N-2( )(58.57-91.66%) and He (0.32-2.94%); Group B has high contents of CH4 (52.94% and 69.50%) and low concentrations of He (0.057% and 0.062%); Group C has a high content of CH4 (71.70%) and He (2.11%). Helium isotopic ratios are predominantly radiogenic in origin and therefore crustally derived. Measured elemental ratios of noble gases are compared with multiple fractionation models for Group A and B samples, implying that open system heavy oil-water fractionation with excess heavy noble gases has occurred in the basin with V-oil/V(water )ratios of 0.06-0.18. The amount of helium in Group A and B samples requires the release of all He-4 produced in the crust since 0.30-1.98 Ma into the groundwater. The Group C sample requires an additional He flux from adjacent granitic bodies. The accumulation of helium and hydrocarbon in the Weihe Basin can be explained by a 4-stage process. Accumulation of commercially viable helium requires high He flux from source rocks, the existence of a free gas phase of major gas components (CH4 in most cases, N-2 or CO2) and minimal major gas addition after formation of the free gas phase.

AB  - The utility of trees as bioindicators of atmospheric mercury (Hg) depends upon how accurately tree tissue concentrations reflect air-Hg concentrations at a given location and time. The relationship between air-Hg, and Hg concentration in tree tissues was investigated using potted Pinus nigra (Austrian pine) saplings 6 to 7years in age moved from a tree farm in Oregon, USA, to three locations with different weather, two with different air total Hg (THg) concentrations, all with different predominant gaseous oxidized Hg chemistry, and one being impacted by the marine boundary layer. An aqueous Hg bromide root spike showed no significant effect on above ground tissue concentration. Over two growing seasons, needles, bark, and tree rings were sampled and analyzed for THg concentrations to compare with those collected when the trees originally arrived in Reno, NV (control) versus that measured in the new locations. Overall, foliar Hg concentrations increased significantly at all new locations relative to the control. Spring sample concentrations were lower than fall for foliage at two locations, indicating resorption of Hg along with nutrients. All trees had higher mean Hg concentrations in the outermost tree rings relative to the control, consistent with increased air total Hg concentrations and changing air chemistry. Higher concentrations were measured in the outer bark of trees where ambient GOM concentrations were highest. Higher inner bark concentrations were correlated with the more humid location where high methylmercury concentrations have been measured in fog. Results demonstrated that Pinus nigra tissues are effective biomonitors for air Hg exposures and that translocation from leaves to rings via the phloem is an important pathway for sequestration in plant tissue. We also show that plants are active assimilators of atmospheric Hg, and as such, local environmental conditions influence ring, bark, and foliage concentrations. The latter has important implications for understanding tissue Hg concentrations, and supports the use of tree ring Hg concentrations as archives.

AB  - High quality human capital is becoming the focus of modern ideas about the possible ways and strategies for further development of the Russian society. The capitalization of the human resource involves the presence of certain socio-cultural characteristics directly related to one's values and behavioural attitudes. In this regard, the issues of personality-environment interaction in the context of young people's personal and professional development are of particular relevance. The paper presents the results of comparative analysis of value orientations, features of environmental identity and parameters of personal potential in students of three Russian cities (Tomsk, Barnaul and PetropavlovskKamchatsky). The research tools included a number of questionnaires aimed at studying subjective evaluation of basic values realizability in the urban environment and specific features of university youth's environmental identity, as well as their value orientations and parameters of personal potential. There was a certain imbalance between the expected (the significance of basic values) and the real (the realizability of basic values) in relation to the urban environment potential in the cities examined. According to representatives of the so-called provincial cities, such environmental conditions to a lesser degree allow them to achieve a desired level of material well-being, safety, health and to implement their goals. A possible explanation for this disparity between the degree of significance of these basic values for young people in the regions and the possibility of their realization in their sociocultural environments is the specificity of the socio-economic situation in Russia, when major financial and human resources are concentrated in megapolises. Analysis of the study participants' value orientations, specifics of their environmental identity and parameters of their personal potential showed a rather high potential of the urban environment in Tomsk in the context of students' personal and professional development that corresponds to its status of an educational and innovative centre of Siberia. The study results and research approaches can be the basis for psychological support programs to enhance modern youth's personal and professional development, taking into account the environmental specifics.

AB  - Despite substantial advances in animal production efficiency over the last 40 years, feed still represents the majority of production costs. The negative impacts of animal production on the environment must be reduced, which implies a reduction of nutrient losses to the environment associated with animal production. Feed efficiency, mostly expressed as feed conversion ratio (FCR), is a key indicator to judge the financial and environmental performance of a farming system. In intensive rabbit breeding, the average farm FCR (maternity + fattening units) in European farms improved from 3.8 to 3.4 during the past 15 years. This translates into a drop in nitrogen and phosphorus output of approximately 10%. This improvement can be attributed to progress in health control, nutritional factors and strategies, management and genetics. To optimize rabbit farm FCR, the reproducing stock as well as the fattening unit must be considered. This review summarizes the impact of different strategies to optimize FCR under intensive production conditions, where rabbits are exclusively fed a pelleted diet. High performing reproduction stock results in a lower FCR in maternity. The use of diets with nutrient levels to optimize digestive health, together with an appropriate feeding restriction after weaning, leads to minimal losses and has a large impact on the FCR. If the different fiber requirements are met, an increase of the dietary energy level, especially in the finishing stage, reduces the FCR by approximately 0.15 points, for an increase of 0.5 MJ DE. Future possibilities for genetic selection for feed efficiency are based on improvements to the residual feed intake. It seems possible to improve feed efficiency further by reducing feed intake without affecting weight gain. Such a genetic improvement would reduce both feed input (reducing costs) and output (reducing environmental impacts). An average farm FCR of 3.0, similar to that of pig breeding, can be reached in the next decade for rabbit meat production. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Internet based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) has been demonstrated to be cost-and clinically effective. There is a need, however, for increased therapist contact for some patient groups. Combining iCBT with traditional face-to-face (ftf) consultations in a blended format (B-CBT) may produce a new treatment format with multiple benefits from both traditional CBT and iCBT such as individual adaptation, lower costs than traditional therapy, wide geographical and temporal availability, and possibly lower threshold to implementation. The primary aim of the present study is to compare directly the clinical effectiveness of B-CBT with face-to-face CBT for adult major depressive disorder.
   Methods/Design: The study is designed as a two arm randomised controlled non-inferiority trial comparing blended CBT for adult depression with treatment as usual (TAU). In the blended condition six sessions of ftf CBT is alternated with six to eight online modules (NoDep). TAU is defined as 12 sessions of ftf CBT. The primary outcome is symptomatic change of depressive symptoms on the patient-health questionnaire (PHQ-9). Additionally, the study will include an economic evaluation. All participants must be 18 years of age or older and meet the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental disorders 4th edition. Participants are randomised on an individual level by a researcher not involved in the project. The primary outcome is analysed by regressing the three-month follow-up PHQ-9 data on the baseline PHQ-9 score and a treatment group indicator using ancova. A sample size of 130 in two balanced groups will yield a power of at least 80% to detect standardised mean differences above 0.5 on a normally distributed variable.
   Discussion: This study design will compare B-CBT and ftf CBT in a concise and direct manner with only a minimal of the variance explained by differences in therapeutic content. On the other hand, while situated in routine care, ecological validity is somewhat compromised by the controlled manner in which the study is conducted.

AB  - Ikaite (CaCO3 center dot 6H(2)O) is a metastable phase that crystallizes in nature from alkaline waters with high phosphate concentrations at temperatures close to 0 degrees C. This mineral transforms into anhydrous calcium carbonate polymorphs when temperatures rise or when exposed to atmospheric conditions. During the transformation in some cases the shape of the original ikaite crystal is preserved as a pseudomorph. Pseudomorphs after ikaite are considered as a valuable paleoclimatic indicator. In this work we conducted ikaite crystal growth experiments at near-freezing temperatures using the single diffusion silica gel technique, prepared with a natural aqueous solution from the polymictic lake Laguna Potrok Aike (51 degrees 57'S, 70 degrees 23'W) in Patagonia, Argentina. The ikaite crystals were recovered from the gels and the transformation reactions were monitored by in situ Raman spectroscopy at two different temperatures. The first spectra collected showed the characteristic features of ikaite. In successive spectra new bands at 1072, 1081 and 1086 cm(-1) and changes in the intensity of bands corresponding to the OH modes were observed. These changes in the Raman spectra were interpreted as corresponding to intermediate stages of the transformation of ikaite into calcite and/or vaterite. After a few hours, the characteristics of the Raman spectrum were consistent with those of calcite. While ikaite directly transforms into calcite at 10 degrees C in contact with air, at 20 degrees C this transformation involves the formation of intermediate, metastable vaterite. During the whole process the external shape of ikaite crystals was preserved. Therefore, this transformation showed the typical characteristics of a pseudomorphic mineral replacement, involving the generation of a large amount of porosity to account for the large difference in molar volumes between ikaite and calcite. A mechanism involving the coupled dissolution of ikaite and crystallization of calcite/vaterite is proposed for this replacement. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the nexus between soil quality and productivity is constrained by data artifacts, compounded by limitations of the existing models. Here, we explore the potential of 4 regression methods (i.e., Reduced Regression (RR), SIMPLS, Principal Component Regression (PCR), and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR)), to synthesize 10 soil physical and chemical properties acquired from 3 major management practices and different soil layers, into an unbiased soil quality index (SQI) capable of evaluating soil functions (e.g., biomass production). The data was acquired from privately owned fields within the state of Ohio, USA, at the following land use and management sites: natural vegetation (NV) or woodlands, conventional till (CT), and no-till (NT). The soils were sampled at similar landscape positions (i.e., summit) at depth intervals of 0-10, 10-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm, and analyzed for bulk density (rho(b)), carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio, soil organic C (SOC), total N (TN), available water capacity (AWC), pH and electrical conductivity (EC). Preliminary analyses revealed the PLSR method as the most robust. The PLSR Variable Importance of Projection (VIP) was calculated, transformed into the SQI score and compared with yield data. SOC, rho(b), C/N and EC were identified as the major variables influencing soil quality status. The data shows that the quality of Pewamo silty clay loam (P-w) soil was higher than Crosby Celina loams (CtA), Kibbie fine sandy loam (kbA), Glynwood silt loam (GWA) and Crosby silt loam (CrA), respectively. In 2012, the mean SQI was 42.9%, with corn and soybean yields of 7 and 2Mg/ha. The R-2 of SQI versus yield was 0.74 for corn (Zea mays L.), and 0.89 for soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.). Future studies will investigate techniques for mapping this SQI. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Lindu plain, located in the northern mountainous region of the Lore Lindu National Park in Sulawesi, Indonesia, provides many ecosystem services for the population inhabiting the area and harbours a unique biodiversity. Palynological, charcoal and diatom analyses of a lake sediment core from Lake Lindu (Danau Lindu) reveal that during the last 1,000 years the Lindu plain has been modified by human activities. Evidence of frequent burning and possible shifting cultivation from an earlier phase from ca. AD 1000 to 1200 might be related to the metal age population which erected the megaliths in the province of Central Sulawesi. From ca. AD 1200-1700 there followed 500 years of wetter climate conditions, corresponding to the southward movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. At the same time, decreases of macro-charcoal concentrations and pioneer vegetation indicators show that the use of the landscape of Lindu plain had become more permanent. Following a phase of forest recovery from ca. AD 1730 to 1910, the most recent part of the Lake Lindu record shows a trend towards deforestation that started in the late 20th century, lasting until now. The lake level started to fall at the beginning of the 20th century, as shown by the increase of sedimentation rate and supported by low pollen concentration and palaeomagnetic data. Such a change was unprecedented for the last 1,000 years covered by the record, and it has no link to the climate variability as reconstructed for the last hundred years. If deforestation increases and a larger amount of water is channelled away from the lake for irrigation purposes, the lake level will continue to fall. This suggests that there is a need for better management of the forests surrounding the plain and of the irrigation systems in the area open for cultivation.

AB  - The paper presents an evaluation of subfossil bird bones from archaeological and geological sites in Europe that shows that birds of the genus Pelecanus occurred far out of their present range between 7.4 and 5.0 ka BP in the Danish archipelago. Additionally, from other northwestern European regions mid-Holocene records of pelicans are known. However, due to morphological similarities there are difficulties in species identification. In this paper ancient DNA barcoding techniques were used to clarify the species assignment of one of these records for the first time. Our results show that the bone derives from Dalmatian pelican Pelecanus crispus, a species that today breeds in 15 colonies in the eastern Mediterranean. This species identification is especially remarkable since the Dalmatian pelican is known to be less migratory. We demonstrate that the appearance and disappearance of pelicans in northwestern Europe coincide with climate parameters, since all records fall within warm periods. This applies for the larger group of Danish records during the Holocene thermal maximum in northern Europe as well as for two more groups of records from central Europe and Britain dating to 1.9 and 0.8 ka ago. Recent ecological research on the Dalmatian pelican shows that the species seems to profit from the modern climate changes and is starting to expand its range. Our paper documents that under special circumstances short-distance migrant birds are also able to expand their ranges to areas far outside of the former distribution areas. Finally, the Dalmatian pelican is presented as an indicator species reflecting special climate conditions.
   The present study demonstrates not only the possibility to recover avian DNA from at least 7 ka old bones, but the relevance of such genetic analysis in combination with archaeological data, particularly if bones could not be assigned to species level by morphological features. In such cases, aDNA is shown as a valuable tool for the reconstruction of the avifauna of the past.

AB  - Authigenic carbonate precipitation occurs within marine sediments where sulfate-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation occurs. Geochemical and isotopic analyses of authigenic carbonates are commonly used as indicators of carbon sources and environmental conditions present during carbonate formation, but burial diagenesis and recrystallization can overprint these signals. Plane polarized light (PPL) and cathodoluminescent (CL) petrography allows for detailed characterization of carbonate phases and their subsequent alteration. Petrographic, isotopic, and geochemical characteristics of modern offshore authigenic carbonates from central and northern Cascadia are compared with Oligocene-Pliocene fossil seep carbonates uplifted on the Olympic Peninsula. Coupled analyses show the value and complexity of separating primary vs. secondary signals with relevance to understanding fluid-burial history in methane seep provinces on tectonically active convergent margins. The modern, offshore, near-seafloor diagenetic environment (S. Hydrate Ridge and Barkley Canyon) is dominated by acicular and microcrystalline aragonite and high-Mg calcite (HMC, > 12 mol % Mg). PPL and CL data illustrate that aragonite and HMC phases recrystallize to intermediate-Mg calcite (IMC, 5-12 mol% Mg) during burial and diagenesis and eventually to low-Mg calcite (LMC, <5 mol% Mg). This diagenetic progression is accompanied by a decrease in Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios. Typically an increase in Ba/Ca is consistent with a high-barium content of the methane-bearing pore fluids that drive recrystallization. CL images also discern primary carbonates with high Mn/Ca ratios, including biogenic peloids, from secondary phases related to deep fluid migration through high permeability conduits. In the secondary phases, the Mn/Ca reflects Mn-enrichment that characterizes deep sourced fluids venting at Barkley Canyon. Mn-enrichment is accompanied by depletion in 180 attributable to elevated fluid temperatures during recrystallization. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper, we carried out a laboratory experiment to study changes in canopy reflectance of Tamarugo plants under controlled water stress. Tamarugo (Prosopis tamarugo Phil.) is an endemic and endangered tree species adapted to the hyper-arid conditions of the Atacama Desert, Northern Chile. Observed variation in reflectance during the day (due to leaf movements) as well as changes over the experimental period (due to water stress) were successfully modelled by using the Soil-Leaf-Canopy (SLC) radiative transfer model. Empirical canopy reflectance changes were mostly explained by the parameters leaf area index (LAI), leaf inclination distribution function (LIDF) and equivalent water thickness (EWT) as shown by the SLC simulations. Diurnal leaf movements observed in Tamarugo plants (as adaptation to decrease direct solar irradiation at the hottest time of the day) had an important effect on canopy reflectance and were explained by the LIDF parameter. The results suggest that remote sensing based assessment of this desert tree should consider LAI and canopy water content (CWC) as water stress indicators. Consequently, we tested fifteen different vegetation indices and spectral absorption features proposed in literature for detecting changes of LAI and CWC, considering the effect of LIDF variations. A sensitivity analysis was carried out using SLC simulations with a broad range of LAI, LIDF and EWT values. The Water Index was the most sensitive remote sensing feature for estimating CWC for values less than 0.036 g/cm(2), while the area under the curve for the spectral range 910-1070 nm was most sensitive for values higher than 0.036 g/cm2. The red-edge chlorophyll index (CIred-edge) performed the best for estimating LAI. Diurnal leaf movements had an effect on all remote sensing features tested, particularly on those for detecting changes in CWC. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica, is a cause of significant economic losses in sheep farming. Lack of convenient and sensitive diagnostic tests in the live animal hampers the ability to monitor infection status and treatment efficacy. Use of a coproantigen ELISA and coproantigen reduction test, based on this ELISA, may address these issues but has, to date, only been evaluated in experimental challenge studies. We evaluated the coproantigen ELISA under working farm conditions in Scotland to assess its usefulness as a diagnostic test for liver fluke infection and as a diagnostic test to help determine the efficacy of flukicide treatment in sheep. First, liver fluke infection status was monitored longitudinally in a group of lambs, using monthly blood samples for biochemical assays and serum antibody ELISA and using monthly faecal samples for faecal egg count (FEC) and coproantigen ELISA. The average serum antibody ELISA titre became positive in September, two months ahead of faecal indicators of fluke infection. In contrast to results from experimental challenge studies. FEC and coproantigen ELISA became positive at the same time point. Secondly, treatment efficacy was measured in 100 ewes, from two farms, after treatment with triclabendazole (TCBZ) or closantel. Group level estimates of treatment efficacy were similar between faecal egg count reduction testing and coproantigen reduction testing at 7, 14 and 21 days post treatment. For individual animals, some inconsistencies between tests were observed. TCBZ treatment failure was noted on both farms, despite accurate weighing of animals and dosing of treatment products. We conclude that (1) coproantigen ELISA is a more convenient test than faecal egg counts and holds promise as a diagnostic tool for natural fluke infections in sheep but further evaluation of interpretation criteria may be needed: (2) the coproantigen ELISA has performed differently in the field compared with experimental challenge studies in sheep and (3) TCBZ-resistant fluke were present on both farms.

AB  - Soil fauna have been receiving more and more attention because they play an important role in nutrient cycling. However, there is a lack of information on soil arthropods in the forest-steppe ecotone in the mountainous region of northern Hebei, which makes it difficult to meet the need of protecting biodiversity in this area. Soil arthropod communities were investigated in the forest-steppe ecotone in northern Hebei province to provide basic information on changes in mountain soil fertility, which could promote the development of soil arthropod communities in mountain ecotones. From the preliminary identification, a total of 7994 individual soil arthropods were collected, which belonged to 25 groups, 6 classes and 24 orders. Acarina, Hymenoptera and Collembola were the dominant groups in the ecotone. The number of Acarina was higher than Collembola, and this phenomenon was obviously different from other areas in the same climate zone. The increased abundance of rare groups in the Forest zone with the richer vegetation, higher arthropod abundance and more substantial litter depth, could be interpreted as a reaction to the suitable soil environment and food supply. And these rare groups were sensitive to environmental changes, which could be regarded as biotic indicators for evaluating soil quality. The analysis of community diversity showed that the abundance index (d), the Shannon-Wiener index (H'), the evenness index (J) and the density-group index (DG) were significantly higher in the forest zone, lower in the forest-steppe zone, and lowest in the meadow-steppe zone. Seasonal variations in community composition correlated with changes in average air temperature and precipitation in this ecotone. Groups and individuals of soil arthropod communities in the three zones were present in greater numbers in the middle of the rainy season than in the early or late periods of the rainy season as a whole. At the same time, seasonal changes in soil arthropod communities from different plots were also influenced by habitat condition.

AB  - Soils of the semi-arid area of the El Melah coastal lagoon (NE Tunisia), with a closing evolution dynamic. were studied aiming: (1) the chemical and mineralogical characterization of surface and subsurface layers of soil profiles from locations previously submerged and of soils developed on dunes: (2) to evaluate the dependence on the environment conditions of the geochemical patterns of the soils; and (3) to determine chemical and mineralogical variations with the emersion of the sediments resulting from the decrease in the extent of the area permanently covered by water in the lagoon. The compositional results obtained showed significant differences depending on the environment (littoral plain, old dunes and sandy spit), but soils of the different environmental zones studied do not appear to be significantly polluted as far as trace elements are concerned. Among the elements studied, high element/Sc ratios and variations were found for As, Sb and Zn. Antimony is more concentrated in coarser samples suggesting its adsorption in Fe or Mn oxides coating quartz grain surfaces. Arsenic and zinc may be incorporated into the carbonates structure, as well as adsorbed on, or coprecipitated with, iron oxides. Zinc may also be significantly incorporated in clay minerals. Iron was found to be more oxidized in the cultivated soil from the old dune strand; and more reduced in the sandy spit where ankerite occurs suggesting the reduction of Fe3+ in oxide/hydroxides by microorganisms and incorporation of Fe2+ in carbonates. REE patterns, particularly the HREE/LREE are correlated with carbonates, indicating preferential incorporation of the HREE in carbonates, and of the LREE in clay minerals/iron oxides. High Ga contents were found in soils and sediments rich in clay minerals/Al, suggesting its incorporation in clay minerals structure. Therefore, Ga may be used as an indicator of the clay minerals proportion in sediments and soils. Carbonates, sulphates, besides Fe and/or Mn oxides and clay minerals, appear to play an important role on the trace elements distribution. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Animals are exposed to environmental factors that influence their life history and body size. Here we used the Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) as an indicator of the complex links between largescale environmental variables that influence both marine and tundra trophic dynamics to demonstrate how they affect the fox's body size and abundance. The Arctic fox inhabits throughout Iceland, where it preys mainly on birds. We studied the effects of the Sub-Polar Gyre (SPG), winter and summer North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), mean annual winter and summer temperature, and geographic sector (eastern and western Iceland, which differ in their ecology) on variations in mandible size (6345 specimens) and body mass (2732 specimens) as well as abundance on the Arctic fox in Iceland. We found that (a) SPG index negatively affected male mandible length as well as body mass of both sexes. SPG was also negatively related to fox abundance. (b) Summer NAO had a negative effect on Arctic foxes, that is, cold summers were correlated with shorter mandibles and lower body mass. (c) Winter NAO had a significant negative effect (although weaker than that of summer NAO) on female mandible length, but not on body mass. (d) Summer temperature had a positive effect on female mandible length, but no effect on body mass. However, winter temperature had no effect on either the mandible or body mass. (e) Foxes in the eastern sector had shorter mandibles and were of lighter mass than those in the western sector. We suggest that climate conditions during the growth period of the young affected their final size both directly, by influencing energy metabolism for maintenance, but mainly through their effects on food availability. As far as we are aware, this is the first report that the SPG has an effect on vertebrates, let alone terrestrial ones.

AB  - A detailed knowledge on decay or inactivation kinetics of faecal indicator microorganism in rivers is essential for control of bathing water quality. Both reliable inactivation rate coefficients for such kinetics and the knowledge on pathogen accumulation in benthic biofilms are needed for the assessment of river self purification capability and for being able to make decisions for an optimized water management. Therefore, the inactivation kinetics for main indicator microorganisms like faecal coliforms and intestinal Enterococci in water and on stones of the river Isar (Germany) were measured at artificial sunlight radiation. A flume was built, containing Isar water and sediment. By adding a pulse of pretreated sewage water, the subsequently change of indicator bacteria levels in the bulk and biofilm phase is measured. Bacterial inactivation was mainly dependent on sunlight intensity. Mean inactivation rate coefficients in the experimental set up with river water obtained for a radiation intensity comparable to average midday sunlight in June in 50 degrees north latitude (I(290-390 nm) = 40.0 W/m(2)) were found to be 21.4 d(-1) for faecal coliforms and 20.0 d(-1) for intestinal Enterococci. For a radiation intensity conform with the annual mean radiation in Germany (I(290-390 nm) = 8.0 W/m(2)) inactivation rate coefficients were 12.7 d(-1) for faecal coliforms and 9.3 d(-1) for intestinal Enterococci. A measurement without direct artificial sunlight (I(290-390 nm) = 0.08 W/m(2)) yields inactivation rate coefficients of 3.4 d(-1) for faecal coliforms and 1.7 d(-1) for intestinal Enterococci, which were similar to those found in wastewater treatment ponds. Due to re-growth and better environmental conditions the concentrations of faecal coliforms and intestinal Enterococci within the biofilm were 10(2) to 10(4) fold higher compared to the bulk water depending on the exposure time.

AB  - The influence of natural disturbance on biodiversity is poorly known in the intensively cultivated landscape of Europe. As an example of insect disturbance we studied effects of gaps generated by outbreaks of the spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) on biodiversity in the area of the National Park "Bavarian Forest" and compared them with openings (e.g. meadows) created by humans in these forests. Insects were sampled using flight interception traps across twelve ecotones between edges of closed forest, six bark beetle gaps and six meadows. The diversity and species density of true bugs and of bees/wasps increased significantly from the closed stand to the edge, and continued to increase inside the openings at interior and exterior edges. Species density in saproxylic beetles also increased significantly from closed forest to opening, but only across ecotones including bark beetle gaps. Similarly, the number of critically endangered saproxylic beetles increased significantly in bark beetle gaps. Using indicator species analysis a total of 60 species were identified as possessing a statistically significant value indicating preference for one of the habitat types along the ecotones: 29 of them preferred gaps, 24 preferred meadows, three were characteristic for edges of meadows, three for edges of bark beetle gaps, but only one was typical of closed forest. Most of our results support the thesis that I. typographus fulfils the majority of criteria for a keystone species, particularly that of maintenance of biodiversity in forests. Our results emphasize the value for the study and conservation of insect diversity of the policy of non-interference with natural processes pursued in some protected areas. As a recommendation to forest management for increasing insect diversity even in commercial forest, we suggest that logging in recent gaps in medium aged mixed montane stands should aim at retention of a part of the dead wood. Planting should be avoided, to lengthen the important phase of sunlit conditions.

AB  - Continuous phytoextraction has lately drawn a lot of attention due to its potential for the remediation of metal polluted soils. Although when assessing the success of a phytoextraction process, up till now, emphasis has mostly been placed on metal removal, it is important to highlight that the ultimate objective of a phytoextraction process must be to restore soil health. Consequently, a short-term microcosm study was carried out to evaluate the capacity of an actively growing ecotype of the Zn and Cd hyperaccumulator Thlaspi caerulescens (Lanestosa ecotype) to phytoextract metals from soil and, above all, to assess the potential of soil functional diversity (through the determination of soil enzyme activities and community level physiological profiles) to both determine the toxic effect of metals on soil condition and to monitor the efficiency of a metal phytoextraction process. T. caerulescens plants grown in metal polluted soils showed a shoot metal concentration of 337 mg of Cd, 5670 mg of Zn and 76.6 mg of Pb per kg of dry weight tissue. Apart from confirming its great potential for Zn and Cd phytoextraction, the presence of T. caerulescens, as compared to the metal phytoextraction itself, had the major effect on soil biological parameters. Actually, in metal polluted soils, the presence of T. caerulescens led to a 154, 115, 140, 37 and 164% increase in the activity of beta-glucosidase, arylsulphatase, acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase and urease, respectively. Metal pollution did not cause a clear inhibition of soil enzyme activities. Contrasting results were obtained with EcoPlates (TM) versus soil enzyme activities. Actually, the presence of metals led to significantly lower values of Shannon's index calculated from enzyme activities and non-significant higher values of this same index when calculated from EcoPlates (TM) data. It was concluded that biological indicators of soil health are valid tools to evaluate the success of a metal phytoextraction process. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A selection of the milk production technologies most used in Cuba was assessed to estimate the main economic and financial indicators and determine the best alternatives according to the level of profitability in the current conditions of the Cuban cattle rearing. Fourteen technologies, designed from experimental results obtained at the Institute of Animal Science (ICA) and the Experimental Station of Pastures and Forages "Indio Hatuey" were selected. These technologies were based on pasture and forage intake and the use of Cuban by-products. Three groups were established according to the range of production (lower than 8 L/cow, 8-10 L/cow and more than 10 L/cow). The costs were considered and the fixed and variable expenses in the process of milk production were evaluated. The indicators cost/animal, cost/ha, cost/dollar invested and the ratio benefit/cost were estimated taking as currency pattern the American dollar (USD). The technique of multivariate analysis was used to determine the resemblance between the technologies studied. The technologies with systems of natural pastures, with productions lower than 8 L/cow, had a negative ratio income/expenses (lower than 1) and the use of protein banks raised the unitary costs of production up to 25 cents of dollar. Generally, the economic indices were satisfactory for the productive group between 8 and 10 L, although it was evidenced that, in the dry season, the cost/L was higher in one cent in the system with silage, compared to the price in foreign currency, established by the national dairy industry. The technologies of intensive type showed a better economic response in the system with fertilization and irrigation. In the dry season, lower costs/ha were recorded and the unitary with 22 cents did not produce losses or gains for the farmer. The results show the possibility of using different productive alternatives to guarantee satisfactory levels of production, with unitary costs lower than the price per kilogram of the imported milk. Further studies addressed to go deeper into the different factors affecting the competitiveness of milk production may be conducted to have more elements available leading to better economic and productive decisions.

AB  - The Karoo Supergroup in the Tuli Basin (South Africa) consists of a sedimentary sequence (similar to450-500 m) composed of four stratigraphic units, namely the informal Basal, Middle and Upper Units, and the formal Clarens Formation. The units were deposited in continental settings from approximately Late Carboniferous to Middle Jurassic. This paper focuses on the similar to60-m-thick Basal Unit, which was examined in terms of sedimentary facies and palaeo-environments based on evidence provided by primary sedimentary structures, palaeo-flow measurements, palaeontological findings, borehole data (59 core descriptions) and stratigraphic relations.
   Three main facies associations have been identified: (i) gravelstone (breccias and conglomerate-breccias), (ii) sandstone and (iii) fine-grained sedimentary rocks. The coarser facies are interpreted as colluvial fan deposits, possibly associated with glaciogenic diamictites. The sandstone facies association is mainly attributed to channel fills of low sinuosity, braided fluvial systems. The coal-bearing finer-grained facies are interpreted as overbank and thaw-lake deposits, and represent the lower energy correlatives of the sandy channel fills. Sediment aggradation in this fluvio-lacustrine system took place under cold climatic conditions, with floating lake ice likely associated with lacustrine environments. Palaeo-current indicators suggest that the highly weathered, quartz-vein-rich metamorphic rock source of the Basal Unit was situated east-northeast of the study area.
   The accumulation of the Basal Unit took place within the back-bulge depozone of the Karoo foreland system. In addition to flexural subsidence, the amount of accommodation in this tectonic setting was also possibly modified by extensional tectonism in the later stages of the basin development. Based on sedimentological and biostratigraphic evidence, the coal-bearing fine-grained facies association displays strong similarities with the Vryheid Formation of the main Karoo Basin to the south. The lowermost non-fossiliferous breccias have been correlated before with the Dwyka Group in the main Karoo, and hence the Basal Unit may be regarded as the distal equivalent of the Dwyka and Ecca groups to the south.

AB  - The use of macroinvertebrates as indicators of water quality is an effective and low-cost tool, which is widely implemented in biomonitoring programmes. Certain taxa are characteristic of impaired watercourses (e.g. Oligochaeta, Chironomidae and Amphipoda), while others are characteristic of good-quality watercourses (e.g. Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera; EPT). In this work, we evaluated the response of the macroinvertebrate assemblages to different land uses. For this purpose, artificial substrate colonization experiments were conducted in streams including urban (U, n = 3), intensive agriculture and dairy production (AD, n = 4) and extensive cattle ranching (CR, n = 4) land uses. Because in Uruguay pristine ecosystems are practically non-existent and streams of low order streams associated with extensive cattle production represent the lowest deterioration water quality condition, CR sites were used as control reference streams. Physicochemical water parameters were measured. For macroinvertebrate sampling, 10 artificial substrates were installed in each stream. A total of 110 artificial substrates were analysed. Each sample/site consisted of a plastic mesh bag of 1.2 cm opening, which were filled with 160 cm(3) (including 73.3 +/- 5.8 cm(3) interstitial water) of stones sieved between 1.3 and 1.5 cm. During the summer of 2018 (February), devices were left in streams for 15 days for communities to colonize them. U and AD land use represented the stressors with the highest impact on the attributes and composition of the macroinvertebrate communities. Abundance of EPT was higher in CR, meanwhile Caenogastropoda dominated in AD, and Amphipoda in U sites. Macroinvertebrate groups to order level classification were able to effectively discriminate between different land uses. The use of artificial substrate also demonstrated to be efficient method for monitoring macroinvertebrate community. We did not find a correlation between the physicochemical water parameters and the macroinvertebrate community. In this context, we propose a rapid and cost-effective biomonitoring approach, capable of estimating the degree of impact of different land uses.

AB  - A large proportion of rural households, particularly in the dry land areas, representative for more than 10% of the world's land surface and up to 80% in Morocco, depend for their livelihoods on livestock. They exploit livestock's capacity to live in very harsh environments using herd-mobility at multiple scale level. Understanding the multiple contributions of livestock to the household and national economy raises complex research issues and challenges linked with the multitude of goods and services derived from livestock, their interactions with other family activities, and the local and national context. The objective of our research was therefore to analyse the diversity and assess the resilience of livelihood strategies of farming households oriented to livestock using a set of data collected in the dry land areas (oases and mountainous zones) of Morocco and discuss the livelihood outcome indicators. To achieve this, we have realized a cross-sectional analysis of livelihoods and adaptive capacity, to select a set of pertinent indicators. These indicators have been developed using an adapted version of the Rural Household Multi-Indicator Survey (RHoMIS) toolkit for pastoral and agropastoral household systems. Our results highlight the critical importance of livelihood diversification (off-farm diversification, livestock diversification, and crop diversification) in building household resilience and the livelihood outcomes. While livelihood strategies undoubtedly contribute to livelihood outcomes, there is also a critical iterative process, i.e., livelihood outcomes also influence the livelihood strategies at the farming households. The present work proposes an aggregated indicator of livelihood outcomes allowing us to capture the heterogeneity of living conditions of agropastoral systems by considering the main drivers of this system, i.e., mobility, livestock species, and physiological stage composition of the herd. This approach could constitute a valuable contribution to help fill the knowledge gaps that do not allow policy makers in developing contextualized rural development policies and instruments in these very harsh environments.

AB  - Farmland land consolidation can effectively improve the quality of farmland soil and the agricultural production level, and can effectively guarantee farmland ecology and food security, which has been widely used in the world. A large number of studies have shown that farmland consolidation has certain adjustments to the basic physical and chemical properties of soil and the content of heavy metals. As a key indicator of soil quality and ecological conditions, soil microorganisms play an important role in soil pollution restoration and the promotion of crop growth. However, there are few domestic and foreign studies on how farmland consolidation affects soil microbial properties, and there are no related reports on the mechanism of action between them, which is a blank in the field of agricultural land consolidation and soil microecology, especially in heavy metal contaminated areas. Therefore, we used the DNA sequence technology to compare fungal community structure in farmlands with and without consolidation in heavy metal contaminated areas. Our results showed that (1) farmland consolidation had a significant impact on soil microbial characteristics, which were mainly manifested as changes in microbial biomass, microbial diversity and community structure. (2) Farmland consolidation had an indirect impact on soil fungal community structure by adjusting the soil physical and chemical properties. (3) The impact of heavy metals on the fungal community structure varied significantly under different levels of heavy metal pollution in farmland consolidation areas. When the pollution was at the highest level, there existed 7 fungus genera showing a strong tolerance to heavy metals and consuming a lot of soil nutrients, of which were Melanospora, Pseudeurotium, Guehomyces, Schizothecium, Gibberella, Myrothecium, and Neurospora. In this study, an analytical method was proposed to analyze the effects of farmland consolidation on soil fungi, and the mechanism was discussed from two aspects-soil physical and chemical properties, and heavy metal content. The results shed some light on farmland consolidation, cultivated land quality evaluation and territorial space ecological restoration.

AB  - Basal stem rot (BSR) disease of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) spreads through the contact of the plant roots with Ganoderma boninense (G. boninense) Pat. inoculum in the soil. The soil properties can be altered by growing seedlings with or without G. boninense inoculum. In the early stage of infection, the symptoms are difficult to detect. Therefore, an understanding of the environmental soil conditions of the plant is crucial in order to indicate the presence of the fungus. This paper presents an analysis of the temporal changes of the soil properties associated with the G. boninense infection in oil palm seedlings. A total of 40 seedlings aged five months were used in the study, comprising 20 inoculated (infected seedlings: IS) and 20 control (healthy seedlings: HS) seedlings. The seedlings were grown in a greenhouse for six months (24 weeks) under a controlled environmental temperature and humidity. The data of the soil moisture content (MC in %), electrical conductivity (EC in mu S/cm), and temperature (T in & DEG;C) for each seedling were collected daily using three MEC10 soil sensors every hour and then transferred to the ThingSpeak cloud using a 3G Internet connection. Based on the results, the mean MC and EC showed a decreasing trend, while the mean T showed an increasing trend in both HS and IS during the six-month monitoring period. The overall mean in both the monthly and weekly analysis of MC, EC, and T was higher in HS than IS. However, in the monthly analysis, a Student's t-test at a 5% significance level showed that only the soil MC and EC were significantly different between HS and IS, while in the weekly analysis, HS was significantly different from IS in all parameters. This study suggests that soil MC, EC, and T can be used as indicators of the G. boninense infection, especially for the weekly data.

AB  - The levels of natural organic chlorine (Clorg) typically exceed levels of chloride in most soils and is therefore clearly of high importance for continental chlorine cycling. The high spatial variability raises questions on soil organic matter (SOM) chlorination rates among topsoils with different types of organic matter. We measured Clorg formation rates along depth profiles in six French temperate soils with similar Cl deposition using Cl-36 tracer experiments. Three forest sites with different humus types and soils from grassland and arable land were studied. The highest specific chlorination rates (fraction of chlorine pool transformed to Clorg per time unit) among the forest soils were found in the humus layers. Comparing the forest sites, specific chlorination was highest in mull-type humus, characterized by high microbial activity and fast degradation of the organic matter. Considering non-humus soil layers, grassland and forest soils had similar specific chlorination rates in the uppermost layer (0-10 cm below humus layer). Below this depth the specific chlorination rate decreased slightly in forests, and drastically in the grassland soil. The agricultural soil exhibited the lowest specific chlorination rates, similar along the depth profile. Across all sites, specific chlorination rates were correlated with soil moisture and in combination with the patterns on organic matter types, the results suggest an extensive Cl cycling where humus types and soil moisture provided best conditions for microbial activity. Clorg accumulation and theoretical residence times were not clearly linked to chlorination rates. This indicates intensive Cl cycling between organic and inorganic forms in forest humus layers, regulated by humic matter reactivity and soil moisture, while long-term Clorg accumulation seems more linked with overall deep soil organic carbon stabilization. Thus, humus types and factors affecting soil carbon storage, including vegetation land use, could be used as indicators of potential Clorg formation and accumulation in soils.

AB  - Fungi are an important component of ecosystems. Some fungi are widely distributed, while others are limited to certain habitats. Studies based on airborne fungal spores can help to know the geographical distribution of fungi in the territory. Our aim was to show that a gamma probability density function (gpdf) based on a database of 20 airborne fungal spore taxa concentrations in eight localities of Catalonia (NE Spain) for a period of 20 years was a useful tool to map the distribution of these taxa in this region, as well as to establish a general classification on their sporulation through the alpha parameter of the validated model. This allows a more efficient study of the atmospheric dynamics of the different taxa, since the number of taxa is reduced to a representative taxon for each of the categories of the generic classification. In general, the results obtained confirmed that the scale parameter of the gamma distribution changes from year to year, depending on the meteorological conditions, while the shape parameter remains fairly stable. At the temporal scale, airborne fungal spores of Agrocybe sp. showed the highest stability; at the spatial scale, Cladosporium sp. showed the highest stability. Regarding localities, Girona was the station with greater interannual variation, while Barcelona and Vielha showed the lowest. In addition, the results obtained allowed a non-subjective classification of these taxa in five groups, based on the gamma (shape) parameter. The taxa Alternaria sp., Cladosporium sp., Ganoderma sp., Pleospora sp., Leptosphaeria sp., Aspergillus sp.-Penicillium sp. were cosmopolitan and showed a similar behavior across the whole study area, with any of them possible candidates for used in predictive models; airborne fungal spores of Agrocybe sp., Arthrinium sp., Epicoccum sp., Drechslera sp.-Helminthosporium sp., Pithomyces sp., Thelephoraceae, Stemphylium sp., Xylariaceae can be used as meteorological indicators and Agaricus sp., Coprinaceae sp., Torula sp. can be used as indicators of anthropogenic activities. The results obtained could be used to reduce the number of spore taxa analyzed and subsequently develop generic predictive models.

AB  - Soil quality is fundamental for ecosystem long term functionality, productivity and resilience to current climatic changes. Despite its importance, soil is lost and degraded at dramatic rates worldwide. In Europe, the Mediterranean areas are a hotspot for soil erosion and land degradation due to a combination of climatic conditions, soils, geomorphology and anthropic pressure. Soil organic carbon (SOC) is considered a key indicator of soil quality as it relates to other fundamental soil functions supporting crucial ecosystem services. In the present study, the functional relationships among SOC and other important soil properties were investigated in the topsoil of 38 sites under different land cover and management, distributed over three Mediterranean regions under strong desertification risk, with the final aim to define critical SOC ranges for fast loss of important soil functionalities. The study sites belonged to private and public landowners seeking to adopt sustainable land management practices to support ecosystem sustainability and productivity of their land. Data showed a very clear relationship between SOC concentrations and the other analyzed soil properties: total nitrogen, bulk density, cation exchange capacity, available water capacity, microbial biomass, C fractions associated to particulate organic matter and to the mineral soil component and indirectly with net N mineralization. Below 20 g SOC kg- 1, additional changes of SOC concentrations resulted in a steep variation of all the analyzed soil indicators, an order of magnitude higher than the changes occurring between 50 and 100 g SOC kg- 1 and 3?4 times the changes observed at 20?50 g SOC kg- 1. About half of the study sites showed average SOC concentration of the topsoil centimetres <20 g SOC kg- 1. For these areas the level of SOC might hence be considered critical and immediate and effective recovery management plans are needed to avoid complete land degradation in the next future.

AB  - The tropical montane cloud forest is one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth and is one of the areas most threatened by anthropogenic disturbance. This study assessed the temporal impact on soil properties (organi << arbon, total nitrogen, cation exchange capacity, bulk density) following establishment of native tree species in two degraded tropical montane cloud forest areas with different soil types and land-use intensities in south-east Mexico. In Pueblo Nuevo, Chiapas, Pinus chiapensis and Alnus spp. were established at two sites with humic Nitisols with low and moderate disturbance levels, respectively. In Xalapa, Veracruz, plum pine (Podounpus rnatudae), American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), Oaxaca walnut (Juglans pyriformis Liebm.), and sweetgum (tiquidambar styraciflua) were established on a grassland-covered humic Andosol with a high level of disturbance. After 16 years, soil properties had generally improved, although in the initial years after planting, the values declined, indicating a possible negative impact because of disturbance during tree establishment. Land-use intensity prior to tree establishment influenced the level of recovery in soil properties. The Pueblo Nuevo sites, with low to moderate disturbance levels, regained soil quality faster than the highly disturbed Xalapa site, despite better initial soil quality in the latter.
   Study Implications: In Mexico, most of the forest is owned by indigenous peoples who often clear the forest to produce staple food. For some decades, the Mexican government has been concerned with the high rate of deforestation in the country. Therefore, and with the intention of halting this problem, it encourages forest owners to plant trees through subsidy programs regulated by the Forest National Council (CONAFOR). The results of the present study, which are important in terms of soil and forest restoration management, could be used by CONAFOR in subsidized reforestation programs and in similar projects in other countries with similar bio-physical and socioeconomic conditions. The results could also be used by forestry technicians from the communities that own the forests.

AB  - Fishway research has long focused on post-establishment assessments to optimize fish passage efficiency. Model-based optimization with the use of hydrodynamic-habitat models (HHMs) has rarely been employed to investigate passage suitability based on key hydraulic variables. In this study, a vertical slot fishway was designed, the hydraulic properties of twelve types that varied by slope, slot width and pool size were simulated using a two-dimensional HHM, and the suitability of macroinvertebrates and of seven fish groups, encompassing various guilds and size classes, was assessed for each fishway type at seven discharge scenarios, ranging from 0.1 m(3)/s to 1.3 m(3)/s. Suitability was primarily influenced by water depth. At optimal depths, suitability was fine-tuned by flow velocity to different optima per biotic group based on fixed interplays between discharge, slope and slot width: water depths were higher at high discharges, low slopes and narrow slots; flow velocities were higher at high discharges, high slopes and wide slots. Our ecologically optimal, multispecies, vertical slot fishway, had 5% slope and 30-cm wide slots, with discharges shifting between 0.15 m(3)/s and 0.6 m(3)/s to balance the needs of all species and life stages studied. Yet, even this optimal fishway could not guarantee 100% suitability for all species. The overall suitability was moderate (approx. 50-60%), higher at the pools and lower at the slots, and critically influenced by the type of substrate. We conclude that technical fishways cannot be simultaneously ideal for all species and life stages of a river reach/basin, due to the often-contrasting habitat preferences that need to be adapted to fixed interplays of hydraulic conditions. Within these limitations, however, model-based ecological pre-optimization is crucial for optimizing and deploying fishways that will guarantee suitable passage routes for a wide range of species and life stages, ultimately restoring the hydromorphological and ecological connectivity of dammed rivers.

AB  - Litter decomposition is a major component of the nutrient cycle in forest ecosystems. It is generally accepted that higher initial quality and litter mixture contribute to increased mass loss, and the effects of soil fauna on litter decomposition is context-dependent. Meanwhile, the formation of gaps alters the hydrological and thermal conditions of the forest through the redistribution of light and precipitation, ultimately influencing the distribution and activity of the soil biota. Previous studies have focused on the effects of either litter species or forest gaps on soil microbes. However, the combined effects of litter species and gap size on the composition and structure of the soil fauna during litter decomposition have not been thoroughly examined. By analyzing litter collected over the course of one year from a Pinus massoniana plantation, shifts in the soil fauna, including indicator groups and guilds based on feeding habits, were correlated with changes of litter substrate, gap size, and incubation time. It was also observed that mesofauna (including microarthropods, nematodes, etc.) were more susceptible to these examined factors than macrofauna. Furthermore, litter type has higher influence on the abundance and richness of soil fauna than litter diversity. In general, small to intermediate sized gaps improved soil fauna diversity, richness, and functional diversity of indicator taxa. The relative abundance of guilds varied with gap size, litter species, and incubation time. The relative abundance of carnivores increased with gap size, whereas fungivores and detritivores increased with incubation time. The observed relative abundance of herbivores was higher in P. massoniana leaf litter than in Cinnamomum camphora and mixed-species leaf litters. Overall, the data presented here indicated that the creation of small to intermediate sized gaps will increase the diversity of soil fauna and accelerate litter mass loss in P. massoniana plantations. The subsequent effects on the return of bioavailable nutrients and soil carbon storage require additional long-term studies.

AB  - The transitional climate zone (TCZ) over East Asia is an interface area between monsoon circulation and westerly circulation, making it highly susceptible to natural disasters and climate change. This study explores the spatial-temporal variation of the summer (May-September) TCZ during 1961-2018 and its response to monsoon rainy season. The summer Aridity Index (AI) instead of annual amount is used to recognize summer TCZ, with similar domain produced. However, differing from the annual total, the summer evaporation remains stable during the whole period, despite global warming. Hence, the summer TCZ has experienced little significant long-term trends toward wetter or drier, since it is predominantly driven by precipitation that shows no clear tendency. The EOF decomposition reveals three key patterns accounting for 58.2% of the total variance: spatially uniform, south-north dipole and meridional tripole, which shows the complexity of spatial-temporal variation in TCZ. TCZ is characterized by interdecadal mutations and periodical oscillations of 3 or 8 years. There exist remarkable 3 years interannual periods, with the greatest contribution stemming from the south-central part of TCZ. In comparison, the northeast part exhibits a significant interdecadal band of about 8 years, which promotes the regime shift from wet to dry in the late 1990s over TCZ. Furthermore, the onset, retreat, and duration of the rainy season of TCZ in response to summer monsoon are examined, based on EEMD filtered 4 mm/day precipitation. All three indicators are subjected to strong interannual dispersion, without any significant overall trends. Only the retreat date of the western part of TCZ (100-110 degrees E) is significantly correlated with the onset date. Dry-wet condition in TCZ is more closely associated with the duration length of the monsoon influence. And we also notice that the westmost part of TCZ shows a greater sensitivity to monsoon activity than the east part.

AB  - The role of microbial processes in bioaccumulation of major and trace elements has been broadly demonstrated. However, microbial communities from marine sediments have been poorly investigated to this regard. In marine environments, particularly under high anthropogenic pressure, heavy metal accumulation increases constantly, which may lead to significant environmental issues. A better knowledge of bacterial diversity and its capability to bioaccumulate metals is essential to face environmental quality assessment. The oligotrophic westernmost Mediterranean, which is highly sensitive to environmental changes and subjected to increasing anthropogenic pressure, was selected for this study. A sediment core spanning the last two millennia was sampled at two intervals, with ages corresponding to 140 (S1) and 1400 (S2) yr BP. High-throughput sequencing showed an abundance of Bacillus, Micrococcus, unclassified members of Planococcaceae, Anaerolineaceae, Planctomycetaceae, Microlunatus, and Microbacterium in both intervals, with slight differences in their abundance, along with newly detected ones in S2, i.e., Propionibacterium, Fictibacillus, Thalassobacillus, and Bacteroides. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and co-occurrence patterns confirmed strong correlations among the taxa and the environmental parameters, suggesting either shared and preferred environmental conditions, or the performance of functions similar to or complementary to each other. These results were further confirmed using culture-dependent methods. The diversity of the culturable bacterial community revealed a predominance of Bacillus, and Micrococcus or Kocuria. The interaction of these bacterial communities with selected heavy metals (Cu, Cr, Zn and Pb) was also investigated, and their capacity of bioaccumulating metals within the cells and/or in the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) is demonstrated. Interestingly, biomineralization of Pb resulted in the precipitation of Pb phosphates (pyromorphite). Our study supports that remnants of marine bacterial communities can survive in deep-sea sediments over thousands of years. This is extremely important in terms of bioremediation, in particular when considering possible environmentally friendly strategies to bioremediate inorganic contaminants. (C) 2019 Elsevier BM.

AB  - Quantifying the impact of habitat disturbance on ecosystem function is critical to understanding and predicting the future of tropical forests. Many studies have examined post-disturbance changes in animal traits related to mutualistic interactions with plants, but the effect of disturbance on plant traits in diverse forests has received much less attention.
   Focusing on two study regions in the eastern Brazilian Amazon, we used a trait-based approach to examine how seed dispersal functionality within tropical plant communities changes across a landscape-scale gradient of human modification, including both regenerating secondary forests and primary forests disturbed by burning and selective logging.
   Surveys of 230 forest plots recorded 26,533 live stems from 846 tree species. Using herbarium material and literature, we compiled trait information for each tree species, focusing on dispersal mode and seed size.
   Disturbance reduced tree diversity and increased the proportion of lower wood density and small-seeded tree species in study plots. Disturbance also increased the proportion of stems with seeds that are ingested by animals and reduced those dispersed by other mechanisms (e.g. wind). Older secondary forests had functionally similar plant communities to the most heavily disturbed primary forests. Mean seed size and wood density per plot were positively correlated for plant species with seeds ingested by animals.
   Synthesis. Anthropogenic disturbance has major effects on the seed traits of tree communities, with implications for mutualistic interactions with animals. The important role of animal-mediated seed dispersal in disturbed and recovering forests highlights the need to avoid defaunation or promote faunal recovery. The changes in mean seed width suggest larger vertebrates hold especially important functional roles in these human-modified forests. Monitoring fruit and seed traits can provide a valuable indicator of ecosystem condition, emphasizing the importance of developing a comprehensive plant traits database for the Amazon and other biomes.

AB  - The orchid species Dactylorhiza majalis is endangered by continuing habitat destruction and fragmentation. This requires more detailed information with respect to its sexual reproduction, which is especially relevant for Germany, where from 10 % to 30 % of the world-wide remaining populations grow. In the present study, we determined both the numbers of growing and flowering individuals per stand with regard to D. majalis at 12 localities of Upper Lusatia, Saxony, Germany, during the season 2014. For up to 25 plants per stand, sexual reproduction was assessed by checking over the numbers of blossoms and fruits per inflorescence and by calculating percentages of seed fertilities from embryo-viability stains. Applying pair-wise statistical analyses, we found correlations between two of the above-mentioned traits as well as among the above-cited population-specific reproduction parameters and four out of six Ellenberg's indicator values, which have been calculated to characterize local site conditions. We furthermore recorded both very poor and enhanced seed fertilities, clustering into two groups which were associated with the Ellenberg's indicator value thermal continentality. Lower seed fertilities were generally detected in the northern lowlands, whereas D. majalis is probably able to compensate the unpleasant environments of the southern highlands by bearing more fertile seeds. Conducting genetic inventories with three nuclear microsatellites, the sampled seed-producing mother plants of both fertility groups differed by the opposite frequency distribution of two prominent genotypes DD and EE at locus ms14. These findings indicate a genetic selection due to adaptation to climatical stresses. Based on the additionally detected aberrant megasporogenesis, we propose that mother plants of homozygous genotype EE and their germ-cells are less affected by both aneuploidy and large deletions on the remaining chromosomes, and we assume that a linkage disequilibrium exists between such advantageous karyotypes and the studied microsatellite locus. Regarding the challenges of global warming, repeated inventories are finally recommended at all 12 stands in order to validate the long-term indicative properties of the discovered findings.

AB  - European standards for the protection of forests from ozone (O-3) are based on atmospheric exposure (AOT40) that is not always representative of O-3 effects since it is not a proxy of gas uptake through stomata (stomatal flux). MOTTLES "MOnitoring ozone injury for seTTing new critical LEvelS" is a LIFE project aimed at establishing a permanent network of forest sites based on active O-3 monitoring at remote areas at high and medium risk of O-3 injury, in order to define new standards based on stomatal flux, i.e. PODY (Phytotoxic Ozone Dose above a threshold Y of uptake). Based on the first year of data collected at MOTTLES sites, we describe the MOTTLES monitoring station, together with protocols and metric calculation methods. AOT40 and PODY, computed with different methods, are then compared and correlated with forest-health indicators (radial growth, crown defoliation, visible foliar O-3 injury). For the year 2017, the average AOT40 calculated according to the European Directive was even 5 times (on average 1.7 times) the European legislative standard for the protection of forests. When the metrics were calculated according to the European protocols (EU Directive 2008/50/EC or Modelling and Mapping Manual LTRAP Convention), the values were well correlated to those obtained on the basis of the real duration of the growing season (i.e. MOTTLES method) and were thus representative of the actual exposure/flux. AOT40 showed opposite direction relative to PODY. Visible foliar O-3 injury appeared as the best forest-health indicator for O-3 under field conditions and was more frequently detected at forest edge than inside the forest. The present work may help the set-up of further long-term forest monitoring sites dedicated to O-3 assessment in forests, especially because flux-based assessments are recommended as part of monitoring air pollution impacts on ecosystems in the revised EU National Emissions Ceilings Directive.

AB  - As a major element of the lithosphere and minor element of the hydrosphere, magnesium (Mg) migrates and transforms during various geological processes, especially in the low-temperature processes. Magnesium has three stable isotopes, Mg-24, Mg-25, and Mg-26, with the relative abundances of 78.99%, 10.00% and 11.01%, respectively. Mass differences between Mg-24 and Mg-26 are more than 8%, thus significant mass fractionation could occur under changing chemical-physical conditions in different geological environments. As such, ratios between different Mg isotopes could be powerful indicators and tracers for geological processes. In this review, we summarize geochemical behaviors of Mg isotopes during magmatic, metamorphic, weathering, and diagenetic processes, to constrain the geological cycle of Mg isotopes. Mg isotopic fractionation occurs strongly during weathering process and precipitation and dissolution of carbonates and moderately during magmatism. There is limited Mg isotopic fractionation during metamorphism. A summary of Mg isotopic distribution and geochemical behaviors in the Earth system allow us to establish a Mg isotopic cycling model, and the geological applications to petrology, mineralogy, and mineralization processes are further reviewed. As a promising geo-thermometer, Mg isotopes are useful to calculate the temperature of different geological processes. Mg isotopes could be used to trace the magmatic history, petrogenesis, material circulation and mantle metasomatism, and genesis of ore deposits. Generally, the Mg isotopic composition of mantle is relatively homogeneous, which is similar to that of igneous rocks and metamorphic rocks. Some basalts and granites show heterogeneous Mg isotopic ratios resulting from incorporation of surficial materials. Carbonatites and carbonate rocks have very large variations in Mg isotopic compositions and are the main sink of light Mg isotopes in the Earth system. Siliceous sediments and sedimentary rocks contain clay minerals and have relatively heavy Mg isotopic compositions than the mantle. Soils and rivers from different regions have heterogeneous Mg isotopic compositions, whereas seawater has generally homogenous Mg isotopic composition. Surficial processes and chemical diffusion play a significant role in producing extremely variable Mg isotopic compositions.

AB  - Increased interest for enhancing food quality during storage, using affordable, natural solutions lead to studies assessing Nigella sativa for its antibacterial effect. The present study is focused on challenge testing of Nigella sativa fortified Cyprinus carpio fillets quality. The challenge testing involved accelerated tests at temperature conditions other than those anticipated in the food industry (5-10 degrees C), including stress temperature trial (exposure to storage temperature variations) for fresh carp fillet supplemented with 0.6% v/w Nigella sativa seed oil (NSSO).
   Bacterial growth and freshness indicators were monitored over two weeks, with testing at days 1, 3, 6, 9 and 14. The carp fillets were divided into two groups: control group (C), without NSSO and test group (T), fortified with 0.6% v/w NSSO, which was further divided into 4 groups, subjected to different storage temperatures: 3 degrees C -group T1, 5 degrees C -group T2, 7 degrees C -group T3 and stress temperature trial (STT) -group T4.
   Group C (control) was stored at 0 degrees C throughout the monitoring period. Freshness indicators (TVB-N and pH) as well as APC and coliform counts all suggest that NSSO fortification of carp fillets exposed to temperature challenge testing and even to extreme stress temperature trial (STT), helps maintain the level of the analysed parameters close to those of control group. Most studies indicate 14-15 days of adequately refrigerated storage as maximum time frame for good quality fresh fish, while marginally acceptable products may be obtained by day 24-25 of 0-4 degrees C storage.
   Our results indicate that, except for the coliform count criteria, all treatment groups are fit for consumption by day 3 of storage (including the ST group), or by day 6 (except for the ST group).
   This study shows promising results for the possible use of Nigella sativa seed oil, as a natural solution for promoting longer shelf life and better quality for cold-stored fresh fish.

AB  - Based on 3D and 2D high-resolution multichannel seismic reflection data in the Western High-Sea of Marmara, this study reviews shallow gas occurrence and related structures and classifies gas conduit systems within the upper, few hundred meter-thick sediment layers below the seafloor. Acoustic anomalies including high amplitude-reverse polarity reflections (bright spots), low amplitude transparent zones, chaotic or discontinuous reflections, pull-down effects, and plumes in the water column are interpreted in terms of natural gas occurrence and fluid flow structures (e.g., mud volcanoes, pockmarks). The gas occurrence is thought to be mostly of thermogenic origin. Mud volcanoes are one of the primary gas conduits forming craters on the seabed due to overpressure of fluidized gassy sediment flows. Following the reach of the Northern Branch of the North Anatolian Fault (NAF-N) to the Western High, the thermogenic fluids are believed to migrate vertically and horizontally to shallow depths mainly through the faults. Natural gas most probably originates from the Thrace Basin Eocene source rock or the Eocene-Oligocene reservoir rock, which extends below the Western High. Shallow gas is distributed by minor faults and gas pipes. Gas, to some extent, emanates from the seafloor via pockmarks and mud volcanoes or is trapped by the crests of the anticlines coinciding with erosional surfaces, impermeable sediments, and gas hydrate-bearing layers. Shallow traps below the tectonized "Western High" structure are likely located in thin layers of sands imbedded with impermeable silty clay layers. However, there is no shallow reservoir in the usual sense within the upper layers imaged by the 3D seismic data (< 300 ms two-way travel time). The existence of gas is an indicator of hydrocarbon-rich layers at depth and of active tectonics, and it also impacts the global climate and marine life conditions.

AB  - Heterogeneous uptake of dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) and production of nitryl chloride (ClNO2) are important nocturnal atmospheric processes that have significant implications for the production of secondary pollutants. However, the understanding of N2O5 uptake processes and ClNO2 production remains limited, especially in China. This study presents a field investigation of the N2O5 heterogeneous uptake coefficient (gamma (N2O5)) and ClNO2 production yield (phi) in a polluted area of northern China during the summer of 2014. The N2O5 uptake coefficient and ClNO2 yield were estimated by using the simultaneously measured ClNO2 and total nitrate in 10 selected cases, which have concurrent increases in the ClNO2 and nitrate concentrations and relatively stable environmental conditions. The determined gamma (N2O5) and phi values varied greatly, with an average of 0.022 for gamma (N2O5) (+/- 0.012, standard deviation) and 0.34 for (15 (+/- 0.28, standard deviation). The variations in gamma (N2O5) could not be fully explained by the previously derived parameterizations of N2O5 uptake that consider nitrate, chloride, and the organic coating. Heterogeneous uptake of N2O5 was found to have a strong positive dependence on the relative humidity and aerosol water content. This result suggests that the heterogeneous uptake of N2O5 in Wangdu is governed mainly by the amount of water in the aerosol, and is strongly water limited, which is different from most of the field observations in the US and Europe. The ClNO2 yield estimated from the parameterization was also overestimated comparing to that derived from the observation. The observation-derived phi showed a decreasing trend with an increasing ratio of acetonitrile to carbon monoxide, an indicator of biomass burning emissions, which suggests a possible suppressive effect on the production yield of ClNO2 in the plumes influenced by biomass burning in this region. The findings of this study illustrate the need to improve our understanding and to parameterize the key factors for gamma (N(2)O5) and phi to accurately assess photochemical and haze pollution.

AB  - This study covers the application of biomarkers as stratigraphic markers in a Lower Permian marine section from the Parana Basin, southern Brazil. The biomarker variations reveal changes in sedimentary environment that were not detected by sedimentological and paleontological methods and will contribute to high resolution stratigraphy. The Irati Formation contains two lithostratigraphic units: (1) the lower unit (Taquaral Member) is composed of shales, deposited in a marine epicontinental to restricted environment and (2) the upper unit (Assistencia Member) which consists of carbonates interbedded with shales and organic -rich shale intervals deposited in a restricted marine environment. The biomarker differences observed in the Taquaral Member can be explained by two different types of organic matter. The lower and upper parts are characterized by a high relative abundance of high molecular weight n-alkanes, C-27 (17 alpha) trisnorhopane, C-31 alpha beta R homohopane, high hopanes/steranes ratio, and low hydrogen index values. This facies contains greater relative amount of terrestrial organic matter. The low hopanes/steranes ratio, together with the high hydrogen index values and amorphous organic matter relative proportion observed in the middle part of the Taquaral Member indicate a more marine organic matter contribution. In the Assistencia Member based on gammacerane/C-30 af3 hopane ratio, C(28)aaa (20R) methylcholestane/C-29 alpha alpha alpha (20R) methylcholestane ratio, total organic carbon, hydrogen index values, palynofacies and sedimentary structures it was possible to distinguish changes in salinity and redox conditions. The bituminous shales intervals were deposited in an anoxic environment (high total organic carbon, high hydrogen index values, high preserved amorphous organic matter content) with lower salinity (lower gammacerane/C-30 al3 hopane and C-28 alpha alpha alpha (20R) methylcholestarte/C-29 alpha alpha (20R) ethylcholestane ratios) on the other hand, the limestones intervals were deposited in an aerobic environment (low total organic carbon, low hydrogen index values, high oxidized organic matter content) with higher salinity (higher gammacerane/C-30 al3 hopane and C-28 alpha alpha alpha (20R) methylcholestane/C-28 alpha alpha alpha (20R) methylcholestane ratios).

AB  - Coral is commonly selected as a bioindicator of detecting a variety of adverse factors such as photosystem II herbicide Irgarol 1051, through measuring pan-type biomarkers. To improve the effectiveness of biomonitoring, omic technologies have recently been applied to model the systemic changes in an organism. Membrane lipids create a dynamic cell structure based on the physiological state, which offers a distinct lipid profile to specifically detect environmental threats and assess the associated health risk. To demonstrate the potential of a lipidomic methodology for biomonitoring, the glycerophosphocholine (GPC) profiles of the coral Seriatopora caliendrum were observed during 3 days of Irgarol (0.1-2.0 mu g/L) exposure. The lipid profile variations were modeled based on the Irgarol dose and the coral photoinhibition levels to develop an excellent quantitative model. The predominant changes correlated with the photoinhibition, decreasing the lyso-GPCs and GPCs with lower unsaturated chains and increasing GPCs with highly polyunsaturated chains, can be related to the consequence of blocking the photosynthetic electron flow based on the associated physiological roles. Other dose-specific lipid changes led to the partial exchange of PC(O-16:0/20:5) for PC(16,0/20:5) as a first-line response to counteract the membrane opening caused by Irgarol. Increased levels of the GPCs with 20: 4 or 22:6 chains, which can promote mitochondrial functionality, confirmed an elevated respiration level in the coral exposed to Irgarol levels of >0.5 mu g/L. Notably, plasmanylcholines with 20:4 or 22:6 chains and phosphatidylcholines with 22:6 or 22:5 chains, which can alter their membrane material properties to mitigate organelle pre-swelling and swelling in different ways, formed in the coral exposed to the 0.5 and 2.0 mu g/L Irgarol levels. Such coral adaptations further predict the health risks associated with altered physiological conditions.

AB  - Numerous interceptions of Perna viridis on vessels entering Western Australian waters prompted the development of a rapid field-based assessment technique for determining reproductive status and hence spawning likelihood of P. viridis. The visual assessment tool and spawning likelihood matrix were developed using correlations between laboratory-based assessments of P. viridis size, colour and egg size in combination with field-based validations from mussels collected on vessels in Western Australian waters. The spawning likelihood matrix provides an immediate indicator of whether the mussel is low, medium or high likelihood of spawning. Mussels were recorded initiating gonad tissue development from approximately 6.5 mm in length, with the mean size of mature animals 59.6 mm. There was a positive correlation between mussel size and stage of reproductive development. Gonad colour, however, appeared to be a more accurate indicator of gonad maturity than mussel size. Female mussels showed a decrease in gonad colour intensity following spawning. Mussels that scored 1 for colour (potential score 1-3) generally had a low proportion of mature eggs (< 70 % mature eggs). Over 60% of the mussels with a colour score of 2 contained 70-100% mature eggs, indicating the capacity for further spawning. Mussels were assigned an overall spawning likelihood score (through the spawning likelihood matrix) based on the proportion of the visceral mass occupied by gonad tissues (% gonad cover, value from 1-3) and overall colour of gonads (value from 1-3). The spawning likelihood score was significantly related to the percentage of mature eggs present, and hence the spawning potential of the mussel. The matrix provides an immediate indicator of the risk of spawning posed by the sample. As such, it is expected that application of the matrix in situ would enable the potential likelihood posed by P. viridis translocated on vessels to be determined quickly and efficiently.

AB  - The exploration of catalytic isomerization reactions of an allylic alcohol to ketone, in the presence of mu-oxotriruthenium acetate as a precatalyst in alcohol solvents, has established that the catalyst is heterogeneous in nature and proceeds by means of the in situ formed Ru-0 nanoparticles (Ru(0)NPs). This reaction is used as an indicator for evaluating the kinetics and mechanism for metallic NP formation and self-assembly. In ethanol, complete conversion of the reactant is achieved under all experimental conditions tested. Conversely, in iso-propanol or n-pentanol the catalytic particles swiftly lose activity and the reaction arrests after partial conversion. We conclude that, in ethanol the process of NP self-assembly results in the formation of active and stable NPs of a specific size, named C-particles. Consequently, we propose an additional step for the established mechanism of NP self-assembly, namely the aggregation of C-NPs to inactive bulk-metal, labeled as D (C + C -> D). D-particles differ from other NPs present in the catalytic cycle in size and in the catalytic activity. The effect of surfactant and mixing is also explored and the acquired observations strongly support the proposed mechanism of catalyst formation and decay. Addition of surfactants and/or mixing slowed down the reaction rate but dramatically improved the lifetime of the catalyst and the observed conversions. We attribute this phenomenon to the inhibition of the aggregation step of the active C-NPs to inactive D bulk-metal. The aggregation step of C-NPs to inactive D-bulk is assumed for the first time. This assumption prompts all the experimental data to be consistent. Introduction of the new kinetic step enables the use of the proposed mechanism with the reactions, where the catalyst loses its activity in the course of the reaction, and it converts the mechanism of the metal NP self-assembly into the more universal form.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether stroke survivors could maintain workloads during functional task practice that can reach moderate levels of cardiometabolic stress (i.e., >= 40% oxygen uptake reserve (VO2R) for >= 20 min) without the use of ergometer-based exercise.
   Design: Cross-sectional study using convenience sampling.
   Setting: Research laboratory in a tertiary rehabilitation hospital.
   Participants: Chronic hemiparetic stroke survivors (> 6-months) who could provide consent and walk with or without assistance.
   Intervention: A single bout of intermittent functional training (IFT). The IFT protocol lasted 30min and involved performing impairment specific multi-joint task-oriented movements structured into circuits lasting similar to 3 min and allowing 30-45 s recovery between circuits. The aim was to achieve an average heart rate (HR) 30-50 beats above resting without using traditional ergometer-based aerobic exercise.
   Outcome measures: Attainment of indicators for moderate intensity aerobic exercise. Oxygen uptake (VO2), carbon dioxide production (VCO2), and HR were recorded throughout the 30 min IFT protocol. Values were reported as percentage of VO2R, HR reserve (HRR) and HRR calculated from predicted maximum HR (HRRpred), which were determined from a prior maximal graded exercise test.
   Results: Ten (3-female) chronic (38 +/- 33 months) stroke survivors (70% ischemic) with significant residual impairments (NIHSS: 3 +/- 2) and a high prevalence of comorbid conditions (80% >= 1) participated. IFT significantly increased all measures of exercise intensity compared to resting levels: VO2 (Delta 820 +/- 290ml min(-1), p < 0.001), HR (Delta 42 +/- 14 bpm, p < 0.001), and energy expenditure (EE; Delta 4.0 +/- 1.4 kcal min(-1), p < 0.001). Also, mean values for percentage of VO2R (62 +/- 19), HRR (55 +/- 14), and HRRpred (52 +/- 18) were significantly higher than the minimum threshold (40%) indicating achievement of moderate intensity aerobic exercise (p = 0.004, 0.016, and 0.043, respectively).
   Conclusion: Sufficient workloads to achieve moderate levels of cardiometabolic stress can be maintained in chronic stroke survivors using impairment-focused functional movements that are not dependent on ergometers or other specialized equipment.

AB  - The conventional fixed acoustic sensors leak detection methods have been demonstrated to be very practical for locating leakages in water distribution pipelines. However, these methods demand proper installation of sensors, and therefore cannot be implemented on buried long water distribution pipelines for condition assessment, early leak detection, and the estimation of leak size effect. Due to these limitations, a free-swimming device is developed. The free-swimming device with the potential of high acoustic sensitivity is capable of detecting the small underwater leakages in the plastic water-filled pipes. Despite the fact that a number of factors influence the underwater acoustic signals, such as water flow noise. Therefore, the interpretation of the leakage and influence of leakage size is considerably challenging from the underwater measured signals. The new method is proposed for reliable leakage detection by tuning the wavelet transform to underwater water acoustic signals. In this method, firstly, Short-Time Fourier Transforms (STFT) of underwater acoustic signals over a relatively long time-interval is monitored to capture the leakage-signals signature. The captured signals efficiently lead in the selection of mother wavelet (tuned wavelet) for the excellent signal localization in the time-frequency domain. Finally, the acoustic signals are analyzed in the tuned wavelet transform to detect the events. In this paper, the practical application of the proposed method, the controlled experiments are designed, and acoustic signals are collected from an experimental setup by launching the free-swimming device. The measured acoustic signals are used to identify the leakage-signals signature from unwanted interfering signals (instantaneous pipe vibrations, water flow noise, pipe's natural frequencies, and background noise). The evaluation of results validated that the free-swimming device and the tuned wavelet transform together can efficiently lead to reliable underwater leakage detection, as well as the influence of the leakage size in plastic water-filled pipes.

AB  - Specific environmental release categories (SPERCs) are an instrument for lower-tier environmental emissions assessments. They support chemical safety assessments under the European Union (EU) regulation Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals. SPERCs have been developed by industry and subjected to regulatory review. Within the framework of the Chemical Safety Report/Exposure Scenario Roadmap, the EU Chemicals Agency (ECHA), the EU Member State authorities, and European industry sector associations collaborate to improve the quality of the SPERCs. Following up on the outcome of ECHA's SPERC Best Practice Project, industry, together with ECHA, developed an updated SPERC factsheet template and guidance on how to fill it out. In addition, industry developed 2 sets of SPERC factsheet examples and the corresponding SPERC background documents. These documents were submitted to a multistakeholder review process. The comments fromthe reviewwere discussed at a workshop in spring 2016. The workshop participants acknowledged the revised factsheet format including the corresponding guidance, the 2 SPERC factsheets, and the 2 SPERC background documents as best practice examples. The package is expected to support further improvement of the quality of the SPERCs. A common understanding was achieved of the need to match the level of detail of the use conditions description with the risk to be controlled (i.e., the emission intensity and hazard profile of the substances) and with the level of conservatism of SPERC release factors. The complete and transparent documentation of the derivation of the release factors and of their conservatism is conceived as crucial for the credibility of the SPERCs, such that they can be trusted by partners in the chemicals supply chain and by regulators. To that end, background documents will include a dedicated section describing the conservatismof SPERCs. Theworkshop concludedwith an outline of the practicalway forward for the improvement of SPERC documentation. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Gene co-expression, the similarity of gene expression profiles under various experimental conditions, has been used as an indicator of functional relationships between genes, and many co-expression databases have been developed for predicting gene functions. These databases usually provide users with a co-expression network and a list of strongly co-expressed genes for a query gene. Several of these databases also provide functional information on a set of strongly co-expressed genes (i.e., provide biological processes and pathways that are enriched in these strongly co-expressed genes), which is generally analyzed via over-representation analysis (ORA). A limitation of this approach may be that users can predict gene functions only based on the strongly co-expressed genes.
   Results: In this study, we developed a new co-expression database that enables users to predict the function of tomato genes from the results of functional enrichment analyses of co-expressed genes while considering the genes that are not strongly co-expressed. To achieve this, we used the ORA approach with several thresholds to select co-expressed genes, and performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) applied to a ranked list of genes ordered by the co-expression degree. We found that internal correlation in pathways affected the significance levels of the enrichment analyses. Therefore, we introduced a new measure for evaluating the relationship between the gene and pathway, termed the percentile (p)-score, which enables users to predict functionally relevant pathways without being affected by the internal correlation in pathways. In addition, we evaluated our approaches using receiver operating characteristic curves, which concluded that the p-score could improve the performance of the ORA.
   Conclusions: We developed a new database, named Co-expressed Pathways DataBase for Tomato, which is available at http://cox-path-db.kazusa.or.jp/tomato. The database allows users to predict pathways that are relevant to a query gene, which would help to infer gene functions.

AB  - Numerical sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) are frequently used to interpret site-specific sediment chemistry and predict potential toxicity to benthic communities. These SQGs are useful for a screening line of evidence (LOE) that can be combined with other LOEs in a full weight of evidence (WOE) assessment of impacted sites. Three common multichemical hazard quotient methods (probable effect concentration [PEC]-Q(avg), PEC-Q(met), and PEC-Q(sum)) and a novel (hazard score [HZD]) approach were used in conjunction with a consensus-based set of SQGs to evaluate the ability of different scoring metrics to predict the biological effects of sediment contamination under field conditions. Multivariate analyses were first used to categorize river sediments into distinct habitats based on a set of physicochemical parameters to include gravel, low and high flow sand, and silt. For high flow sand and gravel, no significant dose-response relationships between numerically dominant species and various toxicity metric scores were observed. Significant dose-response relationships were observed for chironomid abundances and toxicity scores in low flow sand and silt habitats. For silt habitats, the HZD scoring metric provided the best predictor of chironomid abundances compared to various PEC-Q methods according to goodness-of-fit tests. For low flow sand habitats, PEC-Q(sum) followed by HZD, provided the best predictors of chironomid abundance. Differences in apparent chironomid toxicity between the 2 habitats suggest habitat-specific differences in chemical bioavailability and indicator taxa sensitivity. Using an IBI method, the HZD, PEC-Q(avg), and PEC-Q(met) approaches provided reasonable correlations with calculated IBI values in both silt and low flow sand habitats but not for gravel or high flow sands. Computation differences between the various multi-chemical toxicity scoring metrics and how this contributes to bias in different estimates of chemical mixture toxicity scores are discussed and compared.

In this study, we investigated the effects of size, surface coating (charge) of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) - a most commonly-used nanoparticle-type, on the bioaccumulation in, and toxicity (survival, growth, cocoon production) to the earthworm Lumbricus rubellus. AgNPs were synthesized in three sizes: 20, 35 and 50 nm. Surface-coating with bovine serum albumin (AgNP_BSA), chitosan (AgNP_Chit), or polyvinylpyrrolidone (AgNP_PVP) produced negative, positive and neutral particles respectively. In a 28-day sub-chronic reproduction toxicity test, earthworms were exposed to these AgNPs in soil (0-250 mg Ag/kg soil DW). Earthworms were also exposed to AgNO3 at concentrations below known EC50. Total Ag tissue concentration indicated uptake by earthworms was generally highest for the AgNP_BSA especially at the lower exposure concentration ranges, and seems to reach a plateau level between 50 and 100 mg Ag/kg soil DW. Reproduction was impaired at high concentrations of all AgNPs tested, with AgNP_BSA particles being the most toxic. The EC50 for the 20 nm AgNP_BSA was 66.8 mg Ag/kg soil, with exposure to <60 mg Ag/kg soil already showing a decrease in the cocoon production. Thus, based on reproductive toxicity, the particles ranked: AgNP_BSA (negative) > AgNP_PVP (neutral) > Chitosan (positive). Size had an influence on uptake and toxicity of the AgNP_PVP, but not for AgNP_BSA nor AgNP_Chit This study provides essential information on the role of physicochemical properties of AgNPs in influencing uptake by a terrestrial organism L. rubellus under environmentally relevant conditions. It also provides evidence of the influence of surface coating (charge) and the limited effect of size in the range of 20-50 nm, in driving uptake and toxicity of the AgNPs tested.

AB  - While the urban runoff are increasingly being studied as a source of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), less is known about the occurrence of FIB in watershed with mixed land use and ongoing land use and land cover (LULC) change. In this study, Escherichia coli (EC) and fecal streptococcus (FS) were monitored from 2012 to 2013 in agricultural, mixed and urban LULC and analyzed according to the most probable number (MPN). Pearson correlation was used to determine the relationship between FIB and environmental parameters (physicochemical and hydrometeorological). Multiple linear regressions (MLR) were used to identify the significant parameters that. affect the FIB concentrations and to predict the response of FIB in LULC change. Overall, the FIB concentrations were higher in urban LULC (EC = 3.33-7.39; FS 3.30-7.36 log(10) MPN/100 mL) possibly because of runoff from commercial market and 100% impervious cover (IC). Also, during early-summer season; this reflects a greater persistence and growth rate of FIB in a warmer environment. During intra-event, however, the FIB concentrations varied according to site condition. Anthropogenic activities and IC influenced the correlation between the FIB concentrations and environmental parameters. Stormwater temperature (TEMP), turbidity, and TSS positively correlated with the FIB concentrations (p > 0.01), since IC increased, implying an accumulation of bacterial sources in urban activities. TEMP, BOD5, turbidity, TSS, and antecedent dry days (ADD) were the most significant explanatory variables for FIB as determined in MLR, possibly because they promoted the FIB growth and survival. The model confirmed the FIB concentrations: EC (R-2 = 0.71-0.85; NSE = 0.72-0.86) and FS (R-2 = OL5-0.83; NSE = 0.66-0.84) are predicted to increase due to urbanization. Therefore, these findings will help in stormwater monitoring strategies, designing the best management practice for FIB removal and as input data for stormwater models. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Coral reefs within 10 degrees of the equator generally experience <= 3 degrees C seasonal variation in water temperature. Ectotherms that have evolved in these conditions are therefore expected to exhibit narrow thermal optima and be very sensitive to the greater thermal variability (>6 degrees C) experienced at higher latitudes (>= 10 degrees N/S). The impact of increased thermal variability on the fitness and distribution of thermally sensitive reef ectotherms is currently unknown. Here, we examine site-attached planktivorous coral reef damselfishes that rely on their physiological capacity to swim and forage in the water column year round. We focus on 10 species spanning four evolutionarily distinct genera from a region of the Great Barrier Reef that experiences >= 6 degrees C difference between seasons. Four ecologically important indicators showed reduced performance during the winter low (23 degrees C) compared with the summer peak (29 degrees C), with effect sizes varying among species and genera, as follows: (i) the energy available for activity (aerobic scope) was reduced by 35-45% in five species and three genera; (ii) the energetically most efficient swimming speed was reduced by 17% across all species; and (iii) the maximal critical swimming speed and (iv) the gait transition speed (the swimming mode predominantly used for foraging) were reduced by 16-42% in six species spanning all four genera. Comparisons with field surveys within and across latitudes showed that species-specific distributions were strongly correlated with these performance indicators. Species occupy habitats where they can swim faster than prevailing habitat currents year round, and >95% of individuals were observed only in habitats where the gait transition speed can be maintained at or above habitat currents. Thermal fluctuation at higher latitudes appears to reduce performance as well as the possible distribution of species and genera within and among coral reef habitats. Ultimately, thermal variability across latitudes may progressively cause sublethal changes to species performance and lead to a contraction of biogeographical range.

AB  - In western societies, the combined effects of climate warming, proceeding urbanization, and demographic change (e.g. population aging) increase the risk of city populations to be subjected to heat-related stress. To provide a scientific fundament for city-wide and spatially explicit adaptation planning, urban heat distribution and the population at risk need to be studied at small spatial scale. This study pursued to (a) investigate the land surface temperature (LST) distribution with regard to underlying effects of urban land use patterns, and to (b) identify areas at potential risk towards heat stress based on temperatures distribution and demographic vulnerability. We used LST maps as derived from two Landsat thermal satellite images for 10 pm and 10 am at two subsequent summer days and examined land use patterns through land use types, landscape metrics, and structural parameters via statistical and GIS analysis. Using linear regressions we obtained the degree of soil sealing to be the best predictor of LST-variations. However, under certain conditions, NDVI, distance to city center and floor area ratio (FAR) were better predictors. Water bodies had beneficial effects at 10 am and inverse effects at 10 pm, vice versa for arable land. The cooling effects of green areas were more significant in the morning than in the evening. Residential uses were among the most heat affected land use types at 10 pm, with different intensities according to their density level. For the identification of risk areas at the building scale, we introduced a matrix to combine simulated air temperature with population age and density. Results showed higher potential risk in central inner-city areas of dense residential uses, in particular for areas with high amounts of elderly residents, and for two major residential building types. The identified building blocks of specific heat stress risk provide urban planners with useful information to mitigate adverse effects caused by future heat waves. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Peak power production in hydroelectric storage power plants results in frequent and intense flow variations in the rivers downstream of the plants. Fish populations can be negatively impacted when subjected to these so-called hydropeaking phenomena. In researching mitigation solutions, shelters in the riverbanks of channelized rivers have been identified as a means of protecting fish from excessive flow velocities. These shelters were studied systematically using juvenile brown trout (Salmo trutta fario) in an experimental configuration in which a straight channel was equipped with a lateral embayment. The purpose of the experiments was to generate hydrodynamic hydropeaking conditions in the channel that are undesirable for juvenile trout, thereby causing them to enter the shelter. The flow velocity distribution in the intersection plane between the main channel and the lateral shelter was found to be a significant parameter for attracting fish to the shelter. The utilization rate of trout in the shelter was used as a performance indicator. Using a basic rectangular shelter configuration without forced water exchange between the shelter and the channel, the utilization rate was only 35 %. This rate was more than doubled by introducing a deviation groyne to force water exchange between the channel and the shelter. The position and orientation angle of this groyne were systematically varied to maximize the utilization rate. Maximum utilization rates approaching 90 % were obtained for an optimum configuration in which an island-type groyne was placed in the shelter. The results of the systematic channel tests showed the potential of the shelter to attract fish. Such a shelter could be used in channelized rivers both for morphological revitalization and to improve fish habitats. As a next step in this research, prototype shelters will be built on a natural river and monitored for 2-3 years under a hydropeaking flow regime.

AB  - Red spruce (Picea rubens) populations experienced a synchronous rangewide decline in growth and vigor starting in the 1960s, likely caused by climate change and a combination of environmental disturbances. However, it is not yet known if populations continue to decline or have recovered. Red spruce growing near its southern range margin in Massachusetts is a species of concern, in light of the vulnerability to climate change. This study uses population data from 17 permanent plots coupled with tree-ring data to examine radial growth rates, determine the growth-climate relationship, and document disturbance events. Red spruce at these plots ranged from 90 to 184 years old, and comprised 15 to 29 m(2)/ha basal area. Red spruce seedlings and saplings were common at plots with previously high overstory spruce abundance, indicating it could return to a more dominant position under favorable growing conditions. However, permanent plot measures over a 50 year time span did not indicate any consistent trends for changes in basal area or density for red spruce or other woody species. Climate data show that mean annual minimum, maximum, and summer temperatures have increased over the last 100 years. Dendroclimatological analyses indicated that red spruce growth was sensitive to both temperature and precipitation. Prior to the 1960s, spruce at these sites showed a positive response to precipitation; however after amulti-year drought in the 1960s showed an increasingly negative correlation with precipitation. There has been a negative growth response to regional warming, as spruce radial growth was mostly constrained by increasing temperatures, potentially coupled with the associated increasing drought-dress. I suggest the change in climate response is potentially due to a physiological threshold response to increasing temperatures, which may cause spruce to continue to decline or be lost from the lower elevation sites, while the high elevation sites has a persistent spruce population.

AB  - Lameness in dairy cows is a serious welfare and economic problem in dairy production. The majority of all lameness cases seem to stem from claw and leg diseases. Indirect selection on claw health potentially might be feasible with lameness as indicator trait. Therefore, the genetic parameters for the 2 traits were estimated by applying both linear and threshold models. In addition, the impact of environmental effects, parity, and stage of lactation was analyzed. In total, 8,299 locomotion scores (1-5) of 326 dairy cows and 708 claw and leg disease diagnoses or treatments of 335 dairy cows from the dairy research farm Karkendamm (Institute of Animal Breeding and Husbandry, Christian-Albrechts-University, Kiel, Germany) were analyzed. Lameness was defined by a locomotion score of >= 3. Days in milk were limited to the range of 10 to 350 d. To quantify the effect of the claw disease digital dermatitis, a second data set without this disease was built; 52.8 and 36.4% (without digital dermatitis) of the cows were treated at least once; 47.2% of the cows were clinically lame at least at one time. Genetic parameters were estimated bivariately using the average information restricted maximum likelihood procedure as implemented in the DMU software package. The heritability estimates derived from the threshold model were about twice as large as the values based on the linear model. For lameness, the threshold heritability increased from 0.15 to 0.22 and decreased for the diseases from 0.24 to 0.22 after exclusion of digital dermatitis. The genetic correlations were high and even increased from 0.60 to 0.72 after the exclusion of digital dermatitis, which suggests that lameness (locomotion score) seems to be a good indicator for claw and leg diseases. Digital dermatitis seems to affect the mobility of the dairy cow less strongly than other claw and leg diseases.

AB  - Species present in communities are affected by the prevailing environmental conditions, and the traits that these species display may be sensitive indicators of community responses to environmental change. However, interpretation of community responses may be confounded by environmental variation at different spatial scales. Using a hierarchical approach, we assessed the spatial and temporal variation of traits in coastal fish communities in Lake Huron over a 5-year time period (2001-2005) in response to biotic and abiotic environmental factors. The association of environmental and spatial variables with trophic, life-history, and thermal traits at two spatial scales (regional basin-scale, local site-scale) was quantified using multivariate statistics and variation partitioning. We defined these two scales (regional, local) on which to measure variation and then applied this measurement framework identically in all 5 study years. With this framework, we found that there was no change in the spatial scales of fish community traits over the course of the study, although there were small inter-annual shifts in the importance of regional basin- and local site-scale variables in determining community trait composition (e.g., life-history, trophic, and thermal). The overriding effects of regional-scale variables may be related to inter-annual variation in average summer temperature. Additionally, drivers of fish community traits were highly variable among study years, with some years dominated by environmental variation and others dominated by spatially structured variation. The influence of spatial factors on trait composition was dynamic, which suggests that spatial patterns in fish communities over large landscapes are transient. Air temperature and vegetation were significant variables in most years, underscoring the importance of future climate change and shoreline development as drivers of fish community structure. Overall, a trait-based hierarchical framework may be a useful conservation tool, as it highlights the multi-scaled interactive effect of variables over a large landscape.

AB  - Benthic invertebrates, water quality variables, chlorophyll a and particulate organic matter (POM) were studied in 18 sites of mountain streams in Patagonia (Argentina) subjected to six different land uses: native forest, pine plantation, pasture, harvest forest, urban and reference urban. Three streams of each land use were studied in March 2006. Macroinvertebrates were sampled in three riffles and three pools (n = 108) and biomass of detrital fractions of POM were quantified. Overall benthic POM biomass was higher at native and harvest forest than pastures, whereas fine fraction (FPOM) was higher in harvest forest than in pastures. Regarding to autotrophic Subsidies bryophytes were the only that changed consistently among uses. These differences in energy resources were correlated with changes in community attributes. Shredder richness was clearly higher at native and harvest forest than exotic pine plantations, collector gatherers density was consistently high at harvest sites, and total density was significantly higher at urban and harvest forest. Multidimensional scaling ordination based on macroinvertebrate density data showed a clear separation of forested (either native or exotic species) from riparian modified areas (pasture, urban and harvest sites). Environmental variables having explanation power on macroinvertebrate assemblages were mostly related with: detritus availability (wood and leaves biomass) and impairment (total phosphorous and % sand). These results confirm that macroinvertebrate assemblage structure in Patagonian low order streams can be altered by land use practices. Among guild structure measures, those indicators based on benthic community functional attributes. shredders richness and collectors density, resulted good candidates to assess land use impacts. On account of riparian corridor management may be critical to the distribution of benthic taxa, the maintenance of good conditions of vegetation adjacent to rivers will enhance water quality and the environment for highly endemic headwater communities of Patagonian streams.

AB  - 1. Ariake Bay, which is located in western Japan, has a large tidal range ( > 6 m) and a vast tidal flat (200 km). In the early 1990s, the government-managed Isahaya Reclamation Project began in the western part of Ariake Bay. A 16-km(2) area of tidal flat in the inner part of Isahaya Bay was destroyed through reclamation and separated from the sea by a dyke, which created land and a freshwater reservoir.
   2. Since the initiation of the project, fishery yields around Isahaya Bay have dramatically decreased. The objective of this study was to clarify the relationship between the work associated with the Isahaya Reclamation Project and the recent environmental deterioration in Ariake Bay, with references to present sediment thickness and organic matter content, and hypoxic water distributions in Isahaya Bay.
   3. The organic matter load from the reservoir has increased since the initiation of the reclamation project and has been associated with a thick layer of fine sediment at the bottom of Isahaya Bay. The thickness of fine sediment and the total organic carbon content were higher in Isahaya Bay than in the freshwater reservoir.
   4. Based on measurements in August 2001, hypoxic water spread widely in and around Isahaya Bay; the lowest dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration (0.53 mg L-1) was observed just outside the dyke. An analysis based on a two-layered box model using data obtained in August 2001 showed that the DO consumption rate in the bottom layer was high (0.61 mg O-2 L-1 day(-1)), and that 22-41 % of the total organic carbon load needed to induce the hypoxic water was derived from the reclamation area.
   5. Our findings strongly suggest that enclosed seas may suffer from eutrophic and hypoxic conditions because of their low seawater-exchange rate. A comprehensive conservation programme and environmental assessment including physical and material transport processes in the system is needed to manage the environment of the enclosed sea.

AB  - Lac Saint-Augustin provides a unique record of anthropogenic change during the settlement and evolution of Quebec City, one of North America's oldest cities. Lac Saint-Augustin is an urban lake that has been subject to three centuries of direct human impacts, with the most pronounced changes in trophic status and chemistry occurring within the last few decades. This accelerated eutrophication has greatly limited the present recreational opportunities for lake visitors and residents. A paleolimnological study of Lac Saint-Augustin was undertaken to identify the causes of this degradation and to place these changes within the context of historical development in the lake's catchment. Biological and chemical indicators identified three major periods in the recent history of Lac Saint-Augustin. The first period (1670-1750) corresponds to the arrival of the first settlers at the lake and the construction of a diversion canal; at that time, the lake was characterized by oligo- to meso-trophic conditions (as indicated by diatom species of the genus Aulacoseira) and low concentrations of chlorophyll a, total carotenoids, total phosphorus, and metals. The second period (1750-1904) corresponds to increased human colonization and was marked by slight increases in sedimentary metal and total phosphorus concentrations. The third period (1904-2002) coincides with an intensification of agriculture, the expansion of Quebec City, and the urbanization of the catchment. At this time, there was a complete change in the diatom flora (predominance of Stephanodiscus hantzschii) as well as major increases in fossil pigment concentrations, nutrients, and sedimentary chemical levels. Diatom species typical of saline waters also appeared coincident with the use of road salts on a highway that passes through the lake's catchment. With the increasing demands for greater use of inland waters, multiproxy, long-term data of the kind provided here are essential to make informed management decisions.

AB  - delta N-15 values in modem sediments of the northern Indian Ocean range from < 4 parts per thousand in the northern Bay of Bengal to > 11 parts per thousand in the central Arabian Sea due to the strong spatial variability of processes influencing nitrogen cycling in the region. Suboxic conditions in Arabian Sea intermediate water lead to denitrification and accumulation of isotopically enriched nitrate in the water column. Upwelling of this enriched nitrate into the euphotic zone results in high delta N-15 values in Arabian Sea particulate matter and surface sediments. delta N-15 minima in the northern Bay of Bengal are caused by input of terrestrial organic matter as well as depleted nitrate from rivers. delta N-15 is about 8 parts per thousand in the equatorial Indian Ocean as the influence of oxygen deficiency and river input ceases.
   delta N-15 of recent sediments correlates with the weighed mean delta N-15 of sediment trap material caught 500-1000 rn above the sea floor, but with an enrichment of 2-3 parts per thousand between deep traps and underlying sediments. Only at two locations characterised by high sedimentation rates, there is no significant offset of delta N-15 values between traps and sediments. delta N-15 of sediments and trap samples from the Arabian Sea are correlated to the Degradation Index (DI) [Dauwe, B., Middelburg, J.J., Hermann, P.M.J., Heip, C.H.R., 1999. Linking diagenetic alteration of amino acids and bulk organic matter reactivity. Limnology and Oceanography, 44, 18091814], an indicator of amino acid degradation intensity, confirming the sensitivity of the delta N-15 to degradation.
   These results have to be considered for the interpretation of the delta N-15 record in sediment cores with large variations of diagenetic intensities. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Gibberella ear rot, caused by the fungus Fusarium graminearum Schwabe, is a serious disease of corn (Zea mays) grown in northern climates. Infected corn is lower yielding and contains toxins that are dangerous to livestock and humans. Resistance to ear rot in corn is quantitative, specific to the mode of fungal entry (silk channels or kernel wounds), and highly influenced by the environment. Evaluations of ear rot resistance are complex and subjective; and they need to be repeated over several years. All of these factors have hampered attempts to develop E graminearum resistant corn varieties. The aim of this study was to identify molecular markers linked to the genes for resistance to Gibberella ear rot. A recombinant inbred (RI) population, produced from a cross between a Gibberella ear rot resistant line (CO387) and a susceptible line (CG62), was field-inoculated and scored for Gibberella ear rot symptoms in the F-4, F-6, and F-7 generations. The distributions of disease scores were continuous, indicating that resistance is probably conditioned by multiple loci. A molecular linkage map, based on segregation in the F-5 RI population, contained 162 markers distributed over 10 linkage groups and had a total length of 2237 cM with an average distance between markers of 13.8 cM. Composite interval mapping identified I I quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for Gibberella ear rot resistance following silk inoculation and 18 QTLs following kernel inoculation in 4 environments that accounted for 6.7%-35% of the total phenotypic variation. Only 2 QTLs (on linkage group 7) were detected in more than I test for silk resistance, and only I QTL (on linkage group 5) was detected in more than I test for kernel resistance, confirming the strong influence of the environment on these traits. The majority of the favorable alleles were derived from the resistant parent (CO387). The germplasm and markers for QTLs with significant phenotypic effects may be useful for marker-assisted selection to incorporate Gibberella ear rot resistance into commercial corn cultivars.

AB  - Alkenone Unsaturation indices (U-37(K) and (K)(37) have long been used as proxies for surface water temperature in the open ocean. Recent studies have suggested that in other marine environments, variables other than temperature may affect both the production of alkenones and the values of the indices. Here, we present the results of a reconnaissance field study in which alkenones were extracted from particulate matter filtered from the water column in Chesapeake Bay during 2000 and 2001. A multivariate analysis shows a strong positive correlation between U-37(K) (and U-37(K)) values and temperature, and a significant negative correlation between U-37(K) (and U-37(K) values and nitrate concentrations. However, temperature and nitrate concentrations also co-vary significantly. The vs. U-37(K) (U-37(K) =0.018 (T)-0.162 R-2 = 0.84, U-37(K) =0.013 (T)-0.04, R-2 =0.80) have lower slopes than the open-ocean equations of Prahl et al. [1988. Further evaluation of long-chain alkenones as indicators of paleoceanographic conditions. Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 52, 2303-2310] and Muller et al. [1998. Calibration of the alkenone UK paleotemperature index 37 based on core-tops from the eastern South Atlantic and the global ocean (60 degrees N-60 degrees S). Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 62, 1757-1772], but are similar to the relationships found in controlled studies with elevated nutrient levels and higher nitrate:phosphate (N:P) ratios. This implies that high nutrient levels in Chesapeake Bay have either lowered the U-37(K) VS, UK temperature slope, or nutrient levels are the main controller of the index. In addition, particularly high abundance, (> 5% of total C-37 alkenones) of the tetra-unsaturated ketone, C-37(K) were found when water temperatures reached 25 degrees C or higher, thus posing further questions about the controls on alkenone production as well as the biochemical roles of alkenones.

AB  - The biological control agent (BCA) Pseudomonas fluorescens DR54 was applied to seeds (experiment 1) or roots (experiment 2) of barley growing in microcosms, while noninoculated plants served as controls. The fate of the BCA and its effects on the rhizosphere microbial community was evaluated in microcosms destructively sampled at days 2, 4, 6, and 9 after inoculation. In both experiments the number of P. fluorescens DR54 cells decreased immediately after application as enumerated by immunostaining and microscope direct counting. Substrate-induced respiration (SIR) was taken as a measurement of the active microbial biomass, while indicators of the total microbiota (and main taxonomic groups) were obtained using the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) technique. In experiment 1, these parameters were unaffected by the relatively small number of BCA cells applied, whereas in experiment 2, the larger BCA input resulted in an enhanced level of both SIR and PLFAs from Gram-negative bacteria (which included the BCA itself). However, at day 9 after inoculation, treatments with P. fluorescens DR54 and controls were similar in all measured parameters in both experiments. This was also illustrated very clearly by principal component analysis of the PLFA data, which in both experiments were able to discriminate between treatments in the first days after BCA inoculation, thus confirming the sensitivity of this method. Laccase activity has a potential as an indicator of fungal stress, e.g., when challenged with an antifungal BCA. This seemed to be supported in experiment 2, where the activity of this enzyme was enhanced four-fold in the BCA treatment at day 2. Our study shows that under the present conditions, P. fluorescens DR54 disappears from the soil and causes only transient effects on the soil microbiota. It also shows that the PLFA technique is a sensitive and reliable monitoring tool in in situ assessment of BCA nontarget effect on indigenous microorganisms in soil.

AB  - One cycle of high-intensity selection on BW was conducted to study correlated effects on performance under high ambient temperature (AT). From a large flock of a commercial sire-line, 3 males and 15 females with the highest BW at 35 d of age were mated and produced a group of 120 BW-selected chicks. Three average-BW males and 15 average-BW females from the same flock were mated to produce a control group of 120 chicks. On Day 17, the two groups were equally divided between two temperature-controlled chambers and housed in individual cages. One chamber was set to a normal AT (NAT; constant 22 C) and the second chamber to high AT (HAT; constant 32 C).
   Under NAT, the relative advantage of the selected broilers over the controls did not change from 17 to 42 d of age, averaging about 15% for BW gain and 9.7% for feed consumption. These differences were halved under HAT from Days 17 to 28 and were reversed from 28 to 42 d of age, when the selected broilers consumed significantly less feed and gained less BW than the controls. Water-to-feed ratio was measured in each AT treatment. From 28 to 42 d of age, averaged over the two groups, birds under HAT consumed 2.5 g water/g of feed compared to only 1.5 g water/g feed under NAT.
   The diminished superiority of the selected broilers under HAT led to a substantial genotype-by-environment interaction involving high AT and within-stock genetic differences in growth rate. It appears that broilers selected for rapid growth under optimal conditions do not achieve their genetic potential under high AT. Thus, specific indicators of adaptation to heat, possibly water consumption or body temperature, should be added to commercial selection for rapid growth to improve broiler performance in hot climates.

AB  - Lake eutrophication is a problem in many areas of Ontario, although the history of nutrient enrichment is poorly documented. The aim of this study was to construct a diatom-based transfer function to infer past phosphorus levels in Ontario lakes using paleolimnological analyses. The relationship between diatom assemblages and limnological conditions was explored from a survey of diatoms preserved in the surface sediments of 64 Southern Ontario lakes, spanning a total phosphorus gradient of 0.004 to 0.054 mg L-1. Over 420 diatom taxa were identified, 98 of which were sufficiently common to be considered in statistical analyses. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) determined that pH, ammonium, aluminium, spring total phosphorus(TP), strontium, total nitrogen (TN), maximum depth (MaxZ), chlorophyll a (Chla) and mean depth were significant variables in explaining the variance in the diatom species data. The environmental optima of common diatom taxa for the limnologically important variables (TP, pH, TN, MaxZ, Chla) were calculated using weighted averaging (WA) regression and calibration techniques, and transfer functions were generated. The diatom inference model for spring TP provided a robust reconstructive relationship (r(2) = 0.637; RMSE = 0.007 mg L-1; r(boot)(2) = 0.466; RMSEboot = 0.010 mg L-1). Other variables, including pH (r(2) = 0.702; RMSE = 0.208; r(boot)(2) = 0.485; RMSEboot = 0.234), TN (r(2) = 0.574; RMSE = 0.0899 mg L-1; r(boot)(2) = 0.380; RMSEboot = 0.127 mg L-1) and MaxZ (r(2) = 0.554; RMSE = 1.05 m; r(boot)(2) = 0.380; RMSEboot = 1.490 m), were also strong, indicating that they may also be reconstructed from fossil diatom communities. This study shows that it is possible to reliably infer lakewater TP and other limnological variables in alkaline Southern Ontario lakes using the WA technique. This method has the potential to aid rehabilitation programs, as it can provide water quality managers with the means to estimate pre-enrichment phosphorus concentrations and an indication of the onset and development of nutrient enrichment in a lake.

AB  - The Tool for Exploratory Landscape Scenario Analyses (TELSA) is a spatially explicit model of vegetation succession, natural disturbances, and forest management activities. TELSA is a strategic planning tool designed to support adaptive management by projecting the consequences of alternative scenarios at the scale of landscape units (i.e. 10 000-200 000 ha) over time frames of decades to centuries. Scenario combine user-specified assumptions about natural disturbances and management activities, and can include 'no action' or historic disturbance scenarios. The simulation model is at the core of a set of tools that also includes a geographic information system, databases, and several user interfaces for scenario definition, data analysis, spatial analysis and the display of results. Spatial characteristics of landscapes, such as fragmentation, patch-size distribution and connectivity are largely determined by management actions and their interaction with natural disturbances. The TELSA toolbox includes a tool for the automated design of management units (i.e. harvest cutblocks), based on user-defined criteria and scenario objectives. TELSA easily evaluates strategic alternatives regarding the size range of management units, their spatial aggregation, the use of adjacency constraints, and the application of different silvicultural systems. TELSA represents vegetation succession as changes in species composition and structural stages of stands, thus projecting landscape conditions in a format that is relevant for the analysis of wildlife habitat and many other resource indicators. Succession pathway diagrams define the transition times between successional classes and, for each class, the probabilities and impacts of disturbance by insects, fire or other agents. These diagrams also define the impacts of management actions on stand structure and vegetation composition. Diagrams can be defined for forests and other vegetation types such as shrub and rangelands. Wildfires and other natural disturbance events that affect vegetation dynamics are inherently unpredictable. The model can use multiple stochastic simulations of each scenario to provide estimates of the mean, range and variability of selected performance indicators. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Aim. To compare the total and organic mercury content in sea-fish samples from Croatia, where fishing occurs in a closed part of the Mediterranean Sea, and from other countries fishing mostly in the oceans.
   Method. During 1997, we collected at the Zagreb fish market a total of 115 samples of fifteen kinds of fish including bathypelagic, pelagic and elasmobranch fish, caught in the wider coastal areas of Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Argentina, Belgium, and Croatia. Total mercury and organic methyl-mercury in the fish were determined at the laboratory for testing of food and other common use material at the Zagreb Institute of Public Health. Total mercury was determined by the method of atomic absorption spectrometry. Methyl-mercury was determined by the method of gas chromatography. The mean annual fish consumption in each country was used to calculate the mean weekly intake of mercury and methyl-mercury in each individual country relative to the recommended values.
   Results, The mean content of total mercury and organic mercury in pooled samples was 111 +/- 100 mu g/kg and 95 +/- 87 mu g/kg (85.6%), respectively. The highest values were found in the fish from Croatia (170 +/- 124 mu g/kg and 150 +/- 107 mu g/kg; 88.2%, respectively). This concentration did not exceed the maximal allowed level of 500 mu g/kg for total and 400 mu g/kg for organic mercury in any of the samples examined. The highest values of total mercury (119 +/- 111 mu g/kg) and organic mercury (103 +/- 96 mu g/kg; 86.6%) were found in bathypelagic fish. According to the mean annual per capita fish consumption in each country, the mean weekly mercury intake was highest in Spain (49.8 mu g) and lowest in Croatia (19.0 mu g)
   Conclusion. At present conditions of mercury content and its mean annual consumption, dietary use of sea-fish can still be recommended, even from the seas with closed circulation, such as Adriatic.

AB  - The present study analyzed the impact of business operations, work and family circumstances, and well-being on the risk of sickness presenteeism for Swedish self-employed workers during the Covid-19 pandemic. It is of great importance to investigate the impact of the pandemic on the self-employed and their enterprises because they are seen as key drivers of economic growth and constitute an expanding group in many countries. Data were obtained from 845 self-employed workers by a web-based survey including questions about background information, work and family circumstances, well-being, sickness presenteeism, and questions about the pandemic. Results were that around 40% of the self-employed introduced new products, processes, and marketing methods, and just over 50% attempted to get new customers during the pandemic. Nearly half of the self-employed people reported that they lost contracts, and 22% judged the risk of bankruptcy to be quite or highly likely. Regression analyses showed that the more the self-employed reported impact on business indicators, increased work hours, a higher level of work-family conflict, and a lower level of mental well-being, the higher the risk of sickness presenteeism. The most common reasons given by the participants for sickness presenteeism during the pandemic were "nobody else can carry out my responsibilities," "I can't afford to take sick leave" and "I enjoy my work." Conclusions are that a critical event such as the pandemic probably adds to an already high workload for the self-employed. Impact on business operations such as developing new products/services and marketing, risk of bankruptcy and increased work hours seems to be important factors for explaining sickness presenteeism among the self-employed. Theoretical contributions from the study suggest that critical events such as the Covid-19 pandemic should be considered as an important environmental factor when studying sickness presenteeism among self-employed.

AB  - Diatoms (Bacillariophyceae) are characterized by silicified cell walls that favor their long-term preservation in sediments, therefore widely used as bioindicators of present and past water conditions. Alongside with traditional morphological analyses, metabarcoding has become a valuable tool to study the community structures of various organisms, including diatoms. Here, we test whether the quantity of sediment sample used for DNA extraction affects the results obtained from high-throughput sequencing (metabarcoding) of the diatom rbcL region by isolating DNA from 10 g and 0.5 g (wet weight) of lake surface sediment samples. Because bioinformatics processing of metabarcoding data may affect the outcome, we also tested the consistency of the results from three different pipelines: 1) ESVs (exact sequence variants) pipeline; 2) clustering sequences at 95% sequence identity to form OTUs (operational taxonomic units; 95% OTUs); and 3) 97% OTUs pipeline. Additionally, the agreement between metabarcoding data and morphological inventories of corresponding samples were compared. Our results demonstrate highly uniform patterns between the diatom rbcL amplicons from 10 g and 0.5 g of sedimentary DNA (sedDNA) extracts (HTS 10 and HTS 0.5, respectively). Furthermore, after the careful curation of the sequencing data, metabarcoding results were highly consistent among the data sets produced by different bioinformatics pipelines. Comparing results from metabarcoding and microscopy, we identified some taxonomic mismatches: morphological analyses identified 59 diatom genera, whereas metabarcoding 49 to 54 genera. These mismatches are related to incompleteness of the sequence databases, but also to inconsistencies in diatom taxonomy in general and potential dissolution effects of diatom valves caused by high alkalinity of the investigated lake waters. Nevertheless, multivariate community analysis revealed consistent results between data sets identified by microscopy and metabarcoding - water depth and conductivity as the most significant variables in driving diatom communities in Lake Nam Co - further confirming that metabarcoding is a viable method for identifying diatom-environment relationships.

AB  - The dynamic and hierarchical structure of rivers, together with disruption of the natural river continuum by human activities, makes it difficult to identify and locate sources of nutrient pollution affecting receiving waters and observe its dispersion, thus impairing monitoring efforts. The identification of reliable indicators of anthropogenic nitrogen inputs in catchments is therefore key to achieving effective management of polluted rivers. We tested the capacity of N isotopic signatures (delta N-15) of epilithon and snails to provide useful indications of organic and inorganic anthropogenic N inputs in three Mediterranean rivers differing in terms of surrounding land use and physicochemical conditions. We used a combined approach based on (i) analysis of nutrient concentrations in water, (ii) CORINE land cover classification and drainage patterns in catchments and (iii) isotopic analysis of river biota to verify whether isotopic variations were indicative of anthropic activities in the watershed, the associated alteration of water quality, and the consequent impact on snail abundance and diversity.
   Variation in the delta N-15 of epilithon within and between rivers reflected localised and diffuse N inputs from inorganic and organic sources. Negative epilithon delta N-15 values (<0 parts per thousand) indicated inorganic pollution from agriculture. Values between 4 parts per thousand and 8 parts per thousand and those above 8 parts per thousand respectively indicated moderate organic pollution from urban areas, and high organic pollution, mostly from waste waters. The diversity and abundance of snails decreased with increasing water pollution. While their isotopic variations reflected between-river differences, they failed to indicate within-river variations in anthropogenic N inputs, since the proportion of epilithon in their diet varied along the rivers. Concluding, epilithon was a reliable indicator of anthropogenic N sources across a wide range of nutrient concentrations and anthropogenic inputs, and the proposed approach allowed us to determine the nature of nitrogen pollutants, their sources, location and dispersion along rivers embedded in complex human landscapes.

AB  - The expansion of ballan wrasse farming, used as a biological control against sea lice in Atlantic salmon, is constrained by the slow growth rate in the species and extended period required to reach deployment size. Rearing temperature and diets are the two main growth limiting factors in fish. In this study, farmed ballan wrasse juveniles were reared at 10, 13 and 16 degrees C over a period of 3 months and fed two different commercial diets commonly used in marine finfish, Otohime S2 and BioMar Symbio. At the end of the trial, fish growth was + 125, + 75 and + 25% compared to their initial weight in 16, 13 and 10 degrees C treatments, respectively. It was suggested that temperatures above 16 degrees C may promote growth even further. Furthermore, feed conversion ratio was significantly improved in fish reared at 16 degrees C. However, diets did not impact on any of the growth performance indicators although a significantly higher daily feed intake was observed in fish fed BioMar Symbio. Importantly, no significant effects of temperature and diets on mortality and condition factor were observed. No differences were found in the fish (whole-body) macronutrient composition between diets. Analysis of the protein, lipid and energy digestibility revealed lower apparent digestibility coefficients than normally observed in marine species, suggesting the diet formulation is not optimised for the species. Finally, fish reared at 10 degrees C showed increased hepatosomatic index, suggesting fat storage in the liver under cold temperatures. These results showed that the production cycle could be shortened by > 4 months in fish reared at 16 degrees C. This could contribute to increase hatchery productivity and meet demand from the salmon production sector while reducing costs associated with the nursery phase although maintaining a constant high temperature would increase operational costs.

AB  - The mineralogical and geochemical analyses of Pleistocene sediments and mollusks shells (gastropods and bivalves) from the archaeopaleontological site of Oued Sarrat (Tejerouine, NW Tunisia) permitted us to determine the paleoenvironmental conditions and to reconstruct the local depositional environment during the Middle and Late Pleistocene. The mineralogical cortege of the sediments, for all the analyzed samples, records the characteristics of a mixture of silica and calcite dominance with a small fraction of gypsum and aragonite. The mineralogical analyses of all mollusk species reflect a cortege dominated by aragonite, associated with low amounts of calcite, silica, hematite and goethite. We consider that the dominance of aragonite indicates that the tests have not yet or little undergone mineralogical transformations linked to the phenomena of fossilization, as evidenced by the absence or low calcite content. On the other hand, the low percentages of silica, goethite and hematite are probably related to the existence of impurities and sediments trapped in lodges, or adhered to the shell surface. The mineralogical data confirm a composition dominated by calcium carbonates, expressed by high contents of CaO and CO2, reflecting a chemical test of organisms' development in continental environment.This kind of environment is characterized by the absence of MgO, which is usually present in the organisms' tests developed in marine environment. However, the contents of SiO2, Fe2O3, Al2O3 are related, as it was reported during the mineralogical study, to the lithological impurities trapped mainly in the lodges of helicides. Mineralogical and geochemical data tracing, carried out on sediments and tests, converge to deduce the establishment of paleoenvironment attributable to fluvial deposition of sufficiently high energy where the ultrafme fractions of clay minerals are remarkably lacking. The absence of indicators of marine chemistry such as magnesium in sediments and in the tests of organisms confirms almost total contribution of the continental meteoric water without marine influence. Such environment, however, is affected by intermittent episodes of aridity as attested by the presence of evaporate minerals such as gypsumand aragonite.

AB  - Soil salinity is one of the common factors leading to land degradation problems on earth, especially in arid and semiarid regions. There is an urgent need for rapid, accurate and cost-effective monitoring and assessment of soil salinization. Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are employed as viable technologies for detecting, monitoring, and predicting spatial-temporal patterns of soil salinization. The purpose of this study is to establish partial least squares regression (PLSR) models that are based on remotely sensed data and field measured electrical conductivity (ECa) and to retrieve soil salinity estimates by constructing an optimal model. First, the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) was calculated based on WorldView-2 images. Second, a statistical regression method was applied to analyze the correlation between ECa and SAVI under different parameters. The SAVI that was measured as the most stable parameter was an optimum index. Finally, a PLSR prediction model of soil salinity was established based on the sensitivity bands, the optimum index and ECa. The results of this study are the following: ( a) According to the adjusted parameter (L = 100), the SAVI index illustrated the best correlation with ECa, and ECa was also significantly related to the bands (( Red Edge) Band6, ( Near-IR1) Band7 and ( Near-IR2) Band8) derived from a World-view-2 image. (b) The results of the PLSR predictive model calibration showed that the model-D performed best through the sensitivity bands and optimal index, with the highest coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.67) and the smallest root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.19 dS center dot m(-1). The results indicated that the model-D that is constructed and applied in this paper could provide quantitative information for detecting and monitoring soil salinization in the Keriya Oasis and could also supply examples for the study of soil salinization in arid and semiarid regions with similar environmental conditions.

AB  - The paper investigated a possibility of implementing electrochemical methods (electroreduction, electrocoagulation, indirect anodic oxidation) by using iron and aluminium electrode sets, with or without the addition of electrolytes for treatment of wastewater generated in the process of surface protection of metals. The wastewater is characterized by high values of zinc (2029 mg dm(-3)) and iron (78.4 mg dm(-3)) as well as increased values of Cr(VI) (5.4 mg dm(-3)) and chemical oxygen demand (820 mg dm(-3)) that exceed limit values for discharge into the environment by 1014, 39, 56 and 6.6 times, respectively. In order to optimize the process, the paper investigated the impact of electrode type (iron, aluminium), contact time (5-30 minutes), electrolyte mass (0.5-1.5 g NaCl) and amperage (20-50 A) on the removal level of the stated four indicators. Of the two tested electrode types, iron electrodes proved to be significantly more efficient in the removal of all measured indicators, in particular Cr(VI) and COD. A statistically significant improvement of the results in COD removal for both electrode types was achieved by the addition of electrolytes and increased amperage from 20 to 40 A. The majority of inorganic pollution is removed in the first 5 minutes of treatment. The best results are achieved by a combination of the two electrode types, with the addition of chloride as an electrolyte. After 15 minutes of electroreduction / electrocoagulation / indirect anodic oxidation by iron electrodes, 15 minutes of electrocoagulation by aluminium electrodes and 20 minutes of coagulation / flocculation and oxidation by air, 99.79% Cr(VI), 99.97% Fe, 98.23% Ni, 99.23% Cu, 99.999% Zn, 98.00% Pb and 86.46% COD were removed. All measured indicators complied with the conditions for discharge into the environment whereas all output concentrations of heavy metals ranged from 0.009 to 0.023 mg dm(-3).

AB  - Humus forms, especially the occurrence and the thickness of the horizon of humified residues (OH), provide valuable information on site conditions. In mountain forest soils, humus forms show a high spatial variability and data on their spatial patterns is often scarce. Our aim was to test the applicability of various vegetation features as proxy for OH thickness. Subalpine coniferous forests dominated by Picea abies (L.) H. Karst. and Larix decidua Mill. were studied in the Province of Trento, Italian Alps, between ca. 900 and 2200 m a.s.l. Braun-Blanquet vegetation relev,s and OH thickness were recorded at 152 plots. The vegetation parameters, tested for their suitability as indicators of OH thickness, encompassed mean Landolt indicator values of the herb layer (both unweighted and cover-weighted means) as well as parameters of vegetation structure (cover values of plant species groups) calculated from the relev,s. To our knowledge, the predictive power of Landolt indicator values (LIVs) for humus forms had not been tested before. Correlations between OH thickness and mean LIVs were strongest for the soil reaction value, but indicator values for humus, nutrients, temperature and light were also significantly correlated with OH thickness. Generally, weighting with species cover reduced the indicator quality of mean LIVs for OH thickness. The strongest relationships between OH thickness and vegetation structure existed in the following indicators: the cover of forbs (excluding graminoids and ferns) and the cover of Ericaceae in the herb layer. Regression models predicting OH thickness based on vegetation structure had almost as much predictive power as models based on LIVs. We conclude that LIVs analysis can produce fairly reliable information regarding the thickness of the OH horizon and, thus, the humus form. If no relev, data are readily available, a field estimation of the cover values of certain easily distinguishable herb layer species groups is much faster than a vegetation survey with consecutive indicator value analysis, and might be a feasible way of quickly indicating the humus form.

AB  - Accurately monitoring of tree phenological dynamics is crucial for understanding how forest ecosystems respond to various climate changes, and a variety of methods recently have been established for accomplishing this task. However, efficient techniques for featuring conifer phenology are still lacking. In fact, characterizing conifer phenological variations have long been an issue, because conifers tend to show hard-to-discern changes in terms of no matter color or crown morphology for different seasons. To address this conventional "conifer issue", this study attempted the state-of-the-art remote sensing technology of mobile terrestrial light detection and ranging (LiDAR) (also termed as mobile terrestrial laser scanning, MLS) to reflect the seasonal-scale phenological variations of conifers, specifically in a case of Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris) growing under the Mediterranean climate in Perth, Australia. The MLS-collected data shows that for the conifers growing under different temperature and precipitation conditions, lasers, in a statistical sense, behave with different penetrations into their crowns. In light of this phenomenon, a new seasonal-scale conifer phenological indicator (CsPI) was proposed, i.e. the ratio between the average of the horizontal penetration distances for the entire laser points backscattered from a crown and its diameter calculated along with the horizontal direction of laser incidence. The performance of the newly-proposed CsPI was assessed by the means of meta-analysis, i.e. comparing the CsPI-indicated conifer response to seasonal climate changes in Perth with the derived rule of stem radial growth rates at different seasons in Mesic, Spain, both in the Mediterranean climate scenarios. The correlations with positive results showed that the proposed schematic plan of applying MLS and the developed phenological indicator both are validated, and this study has opened a new way for reflecting the seasonal-scale phenological variations of conifers.

AB  - As a result of climate change a large reduction of agricultural water through improved irrigation management is a major need for agriculture sustainability. To this aim, always more sensitive sensors to monitor plant water status have been developed in recent years. Among them, the leaf patch clamp pressure probes are very promising for water management of olive but until now have been tested only in few environmental and management conditions.
   In this work these sensors have been tested for two consecutive years on two completely different management systems: a traditional rainfed orchard and a super high density (SHD) drip irrigated orchard. Within the SHD orchard the probes have been installed on two different genotypes characterize by different vigor and productive potential.
   Stem water potential and gases exchange have been measured at regular intervals and used as reference to detect water status of the trees.
   The high correlation observed between the leaf patch clamp pressure probes and Psi(swp), independently from the year and the treatment, confirmed the high potential of the continuous system.
   The inversion of the daily curve of the leaf patch clamp pressure probes reading was observed when Psi(swp) decreased under the value of -2.2/-2.5 MPa suggesting the possibility to use this indicator to detect high water stress levels. Anyway, considering that at this level of stress the plants had already strongly reduced the gas exchanges by 40-50% with respect to their values at Psi(swp) above -2 MPa, with consequence on carbohydrate production that can affect productivity, rise the need to find other indicators that enable to differentiate water status at lower stress levels. From the result of this work a promising indicator seems the relative increase of the daily minimum value of the leaf patch clamp pressure probe readings, as suggested by its correlation with Psi(swp).

AB  - Background: Neurodevelopmental disorders are increasing in prevalence worldwide. Previous work suggests that exposure to the environmental air pollutant and greenhouse gas- nitrous oxide (N2O)- may be an etiological factor in neurodevelopmental disorders through the targeting of several neural correlates.
   Methodology: While a number of recent systematic reviews have addressed the role of general anesthesia in the surgical setting and neurodevelopmental outcomes, a narrative mini-review was conducted to first define and characterize the relevant variables (i.e., N2O, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] and autism spectrum disorders [ASD]) and their potential interactions into a coherent, hypothesis-generating work. The narrative mini-review merges basic principles in environmental science, anesthesiology, and psychiatry to more fully develop the novel hypotheses that neurodevelopmental impairment found in conditions like ADHD and ASD may be due to exposure to the increasing air pollutant, N2O.
   Results: The results of the present mini-review indicate that exposure to N2O, even at non-toxic doses, may modulate central neurotransmission and target many neural substrates directly implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, including the glutamatergic, opioidergic, cholinergic, and dopaminergic systems. Epidemiological studies also indicate that early and repeated exposure to general anesthesia, including N2O, may contribute to later adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in children.
   Conclusions: The current evidence and subsequent hypotheses suggest that a renewed interest be taken in the toxicological assessment of environmental N2O exposure using validated biomarkers and psychiatric endpoints. Given the relevance of N2O as a greenhouse gas, societies may also wish to engage in a more robust monitoring and reporting of N2O levels in the environment for climactic benefit as well.

AB  - To provide growing population with sufficient food, greenhouse vegetable production has expanded rapidly in recent years in China and sustainability of its farming practices is a major concern. Therefore, this study assessed the sustainability of greenhouse vegetable farming practices from environmental, economic, and socio-institutional perspectives in China based on selected indicators. The empirical data were collected through a survey of 91 farm households from six typical greenhouse vegetable production bases and analysis of environmental material samples. The results showed that heavy fertilization in greenhouse vegetable bases of China resulted in an accumulation of N, P, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn in soil, nutrient eutrophication in irrigation water, and high Cd in some leaf vegetables cultivated in acidic soil. Economic factors including decreased crop yield in conventional farming bases, limited and site-dependent farmers' income, and lack of complete implementation of subsidy policies contributed a lot to adoption of heavy fertilization by farmers. Also, socio-institutional factors such as lack of unified management of agricultural supplies in the bases operated in cooperative and small family business models and low agricultural extension service efficiency intensified the unreasonable fertilization. The selection of cultivated vegetables was mainly based on farmers' own experience rather than site-dependent soil conditions. Thus, for sustainable development of greenhouse vegetable production systems in China, there are two key aspects. First, it is imperative to reduce environmental pollution and subsequent health risks through integrated nutrient management and the planting strategy of selected low metal accumulation vegetable species especially in acidic soil. Second, a conversion of cooperative and small family business models of greenhouse vegetable bases to enterprises should be extensively advocated in future for the unified agricultural supplies management and improved agricultural extension service efficiency, which in turn can stabilize vegetable yields and increase farmers' benefits.

AB  - Understanding concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) in lakes is an important part of a comprehensive global carbon budget. We estimated data on the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) and CH4 (pCH(4)) from sampling with 95 lakes in semi-humid/semi-arid region of Northeastern China during ice free period. Both pCO(2) and pCH(4) varied greatly among the study sites. p(CO2) values in these lakes ranged from 21.9 to 30,152.3 mu atm (n = 403), and 91% of lakes in this survey were supersaturated with CO2. p(CH4) values ranged from 12.6 to 139,630.7 atm with all sites in this study of CH4 sources to the atmosphere during the ice-free period. The collected urban lakes samples exhibited higher pCO(2) and pCH(4) than wild lakes samples. Either the mean value of p(CO2) or p(CH4) in saline waters is higher than in fresh waters. Correlation analysis implied that the partial pressure of the GHGs (CO2 and CH4) showed statistically correlations with water environment indicators like pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and chlorophyll a (Chla). However, the most of the relationships showed a high degree of scatter, only pH might be used as the predictor of the gas partial pressure based on the result of this study (r(pCO2) = -0.437, p < 0.01, n = 382; r(pCH4) = -0265, p < 0.01, n = 400). Furthermore, salinity could be a good predictor for p(CO2) and p(CH4) in 83 freshwater lakes in our study (r(pCO2) = 0.365, r(pCH4) = 0.323, p < 0.01, n = 348). The mean CO2 flux increased with the decreasing lake area size. The calculated annual areal carbon emission rate is 560.2 g C m(-2) from 95 lakes in Northeastern China. We could not extrapolate carbon emission from these lakes to the boreal region or a wider scale because of the change of environmental conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background
   Truck drivers have unique health needs, and by virtue of their continuous travel, experience difficulty in accessing healthcare. Currently, planning for effective care is hindered by lack of knowledge about their health needs and about the impact of on-going programmes on this population's health outcomes. We reviewed healthcare programmes implemented for sub-Saharan African truck drivers, assessed the evaluation methods, and examined impact on health outcomes.
   Methods
   We searched scientific and institutional databases, and online search engines to include all publications describing a healthcare programme in sub-Saharan Africa where the main clients were truck drivers. We consulted experts and organisations working with mobile populations to identify unpublished reports. Forest plots of impact and outcome indicators with unadjusted risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals were created to map the impact of these programmes. We performed a subgroup analysis by type of indicator using a random-effects model to assess between-study heterogeneity. We conducted a sensitivity analysis to examine both the summary effect estimate chosen (risk difference vs. risk ratio) and model to summarise results (fixed vs. random effects).
   Results
   Thirty-seven publications describing 22 healthcare programmes across 30 countries were included from 5,599 unique records. All programmes had an HIV-prevention focus with only three expanding their services to cover conditions other primary healthcare services. Twelve programmes were evaluated and most evaluations assessed changes in input, output, and outcome indicators. Absence of comparison groups, preventing attribution of the effect observed to the programme and lack of biologically confirmed outcomes were the main limitations. Four programmes estimated a quantitative change in HIV prevalence or reported STI incidence, with mixed results, and one provided anecdotal evidence of changes in AIDS-related mortality and social norms. Most programmes showed positive changes in risk behaviours, knowledge, and attitudes. Our conclusions were robust in sensitivity analyses.
   Conclusion
   Diverse healthcare programmes tailored to the needs of truck drivers implemented in 30 sub-Saharan African countries have shown potential benefits. However, information gaps about availability of services and their effects impede further planning and implementation of effective healthcare programmes for truck drivers.

AB  - The composition of microbial communities and the level of enzymatic activity in the soil are both important indicators of soil quality, but the mechanisms by which a soil bacterial community is generated and maintained are not yet fully understood. Two soil samples were collected from the same location, but each had been subjected to a different long-term fertilization treatment and was characterized by different microbial diversity, biomass and physicochemical properties. These samples were gamma-sterilized and swap inoculated. Non-sterilized soil samples along with sterilized and inoculated soil samples were incubated for eight months before their nutrient content, microbial biomass, enzymatic activity and bacterial composition were analyzed. Total phosphorus, and potassium concentrations along with the overall organic matter content of the non-sterilized soil were all equal to those of the same soil that had been sterilized and self/swap inoculated. Additionally, the microbial biomass carbon concentration was not affected by the specific inoculum and varied only by soil type. The activities of catalase, invertase, urease, protease, acid phosphatase and phytase were smaller in the sterilized soils that had been inoculated with organisms from chemical fertilizer amended soil (NPK) when compared to sterilized soil inoculated with organisms from manure and chemical fertilizer amended soil (NPKM) and non-sterilized soil samples. Bacterial 16S rRNA examined by 454-pyrosequencing revealed that the composition of bacterial community reconstructed by immigrant microbial inoculum in the soil was mainly influenced by its physicochemical properties, although the microbial inoculum contained different abundances of bacterial taxa. For example, the pH of the soil was the dominant factor in reconstructing a new bacterial community. Taken together, these results demonstrated that both soil microbial composition and functionality were primarily determined by soil properties rather than the microbiatinoculum, which contributed to our understanding of how soil microbial communities are generated and maintained.

AB  - In this study, aerosols spatial, seasonal and temporal variations over Sindh, Pakistan were analyzed which can lead to variations in the microphysics of clouds as well. All cloud optical properties were analyzed using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for 12 years from 2001 to 2013. We also monitored origin and movements of air masses that bring aerosol particles and may be considered as the natural source of aerosol particles in the region. For this purpose, the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model was used to make trajectories of these air masses from their sources. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) high values were observed in summer during the monsoon period (June-August). The highest AOD values in July were recorded ranges from 0.41 to 1.46. In addition, low AOD values were found in winter season (December-February) particularly in December, ranges from 0.16 to 0.69. We then analyzed the relationship between AOD and Angstrom exponent that is a good indicator of the size of an aerosol particle. We further described the relationships of AOD and four cloud parameters, namely water vapor (WV), cloud fraction (CF), cloud top temperature (CTT) and cloud top pressure (CTP) by producing regional correlation maps of their data values. The analyses showed negative correlation between AOD and Angstrom exponent especially in central and western Sindh. The correlation between AOD and WV was throughout positive with high correlation values >0.74 in whole Sindh except eastern most arid strip of the Thar Desert in the region. The correlation between AOD and CF was positive in southern Sindh and goes to negative in northern Sindh. AOD showed a positive correlation with CTP and CTT in northern Sindh and a negative correlation in southern Sindh. All these correlations were observed to be dependent on the meteorological conditions for all of the ten sites investigated.

AB  - The principal drivers that effectively determine the vitality of semi-arid grassland ecosystems are the amount and timing of precipitation. In contrast to well-established relationships between precipitation and some vegetation biophysical properties such as vegetation productivity and biomass, the effect of precipitation on percent vegetation cover in semi-arid grasslands are poorly understood. The percent green vegetation cover is an important indicator of ecosystem health, especially in a protected semi-arid grassland where dead material dominates vegetation canopy. Consequently, this study used field data, high spatial resolution SPOT satellite images, and low spatial but high temporal resolution AVHRR images to (1) analyze temporal variations in maximum percent green vegetation cover over three landscape units in a protected grassland from 1988 to 2007, and (2) investigate the performance of three commonly used climatic moisture indexes (accumulated precipitation P; climate moisture index - CMI; and the modified Palmer drought severity index - MPDSI) in estimating percent vegetation cover. The results revealed moderate to strong links between percent vegetation cover and climate conditions in three landscape units. The selected indices were able to explain a relatively high proportion of variation in percent vegetation cover in the upland/sloped grassland (R-2 = 0.41 for P, 0.45 for CMI, and 0.53 for MPDSI), low variation in the riparian shrub (R-2 = 0.25 for P, 0.28 for CMI, and 0.32 for MPDSI), and even lower variation in the valley grassland (R-2 = 0.09 for P, 0.14 for CMI, and 0.21 for MPDI). In comparison with accumulated precipitation, the CMI and MPDSI which considered water availability, were able to explain a much higher variation in percent vegetation cover over the three grassland landscape units. The results from this work provide new insight into the effects of precipitation/climatic factors upon different landscape units and further aid to establish a more complete picture in this field.

AB  - We present the first modern calibration dataset linking ostracod assemblage composition to water chemistry, and other site-specific variables, in the hydrologically and geopolitically sensitive southern Levant region. A total of 42 ostracod taxa were recorded from the 178 sampled sites in Israel and Jordan. Ilyocypris spp., Heterocypris salina and Cypridopsis vidua are the most abundant taxa. Species strictly confined to freshwater conditions are Prionocypris zenkeri, Gomphocythere ortali and Prionocypris olivaceus. In contrast, H. sauna, Bradleytriebella lineata and Cyprideis torosa show high frequencies in brackish waters (waters with higher conductivity). Humphcypris subterranea, G. ortali, P. olivaceus and Cypridopsis elongata apparently prefer flowing waters. Specific conductivity optima and tolerance ranges were calculated for the recorded ostracod species and may be used for the palaeoenvironmental assessment of fossil ostracod assemblages. In addition, a transfer-function for quantitative specific conductivity estimation based on 141 samples was established with weighted averaging partial least squares regression (WA-PLS). The resulting coefficient of determination r(2) between observed and predicted conductivity values (0.72) and the root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP) in % gradient length (13.1) indicate that conductivity may be reliably estimated from ostracod assemblage data. The transfer function was first applied to last glacial ostracod assemblage data from an archaeological trench in the Sea of Galilee (northern Israel). Relatively large conductivity fluctuations between ca 1 and 7 mS cm(-1) were inferred for the period 24-20 cal ka BP. In addition, four episodes of freshwater influx near the site of the trench were identified from the presence of shells of freshwater and stream-dwelling species intermingled with very abundant shells of Cyprideis torosa. The results of our study allow a better use of Quaternary ostracods from the Levant as palaeoenvironmental indicators of water-body types and past conductivity levels and will contribute to a better understanding of Quaternary environmental and climate change in the Levant.

AB  - Recent studies from mountainous areas of small spatial extent (<2500km2) suggest that fine-grained thermal variability over tens or hundreds of metres exceeds much of the climate warming expected for the coming decades. Such variability in temperature provides buffering to mitigate climate-change impacts. Is this local spatial buffering restricted to topographically complex terrains? To answer this, we here study fine-grained thermal variability across a 2500-km wide latitudinal gradient in Northern Europe encompassing a large array of topographic complexities. We first combined plant community data, Ellenberg temperature indicator values, locally measured temperatures (LmT) and globally interpolated temperatures (GiT) in a modelling framework to infer biologically relevant temperature conditions from plant assemblages within <1000-m2 units (community-inferred temperatures: CiT). We then assessed: (1) CiT range (thermal variability) within 1-km2 units; (2) the relationship between CiT range and topographically and geographically derived predictors at 1-km resolution; and (3) whether spatial turnover in CiT is greater than spatial turnover in GiT within 100-km2 units. Ellenberg temperature indicator values in combination with plant assemblages explained 4672% of variation in LmT and 9296% of variation in GiT during the growing season (June, July, August). Growing-season CiT range within 1-km2 units peaked at 6065 degrees N and increased with terrain roughness, averaging 1.97 degrees C (SD=0.84 degrees C) and 2.68 degrees C (SD=1.26 degrees C) within the flattest and roughest units respectively. Complex interactions between topography-related variables and latitude explained 35% of variation in growing-season CiT range when accounting for sampling effort and residual spatial autocorrelation. Spatial turnover in growing-season CiT within 100-km2 units was, on average, 1.8 times greater (0.32 degrees Ckm1) than spatial turnover in growing-season GiT (0.18 degrees Ckm1). We conclude that thermal variability within 1-km2 units strongly increases local spatial buffering of future climate warming across Northern Europe, even in the flattest terrains.

AB  - Timely assessment of canopy nitrogen content (CNC) in crops is critical for growth diagnosis and precision management of crops to generate higher yield and better quality while also minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The objective of this study was to determine the most suitable algorithm, using hyperspectral reflectance data, for the regional assessment of CNC at a critical growth stage in paddy rice. Ground-based hyperspectral datasets were obtained during the panicle formation stage under a wide range of plant and environmental conditions in Japan and China using spectroradiometers. A hyperspectral airborne dataset was obtained over a typical rice-growing region in Japan using the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager 3 (CASI-3). On the basis of a comprehensive analysis of the hyperspectral data, significant spectral indices (SIs) such as the normalized difference spectral index (NDSI) and ratio spectral index (RSI) were explored to provide an accurate and robust assessment of CNC. The capability of multivariable regression approaches, such as partial least-squares regression (PLSR) using the whole hyperspectral data or interval PLSR (IPLSR) using selected wavebands was also examined. Among various SIs, a simple index, RSI (D740, D522) using the first derivative (D) values at 740 nm and 522 nm, was found to be most accurate and robust for the assessment of CNC. The predictive ability of the index was comparable to those of PLSR and IPLSR. Independent validation using the airborne dataset supported the robust applicability of the new SI. The CNC was closely related to the conventional diagnostic indicators based on direct plant measurements. The results demonstrated the operational applicability of hyperspectral measurements for diagnostic mapping of CNC on a regional scale. The investigation based on the precise dataset for rice will be a good basis for remote sensing of canopy nitrogen content in a wide range of vegetation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi m) is critical for maintaining the physiological function of the respiratory chain to generate ATP. A significant loss of..m renders cells depleted of energy with subsequent death. Reactive oxygen species ( ROS) are important signaling molecules, but their accumulation in pathological conditions leads to oxidative stress. The two major sources of ROS in cells are environmental toxins and the process of oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress have been implicated in the pathophysiology of many diseases; therefore, the ability to determine..m and ROS can provide important clues about the physiological status of the cell and the function of the mitochondria. Several fluorescent probes ( Rhodamine 123, TMRM, TMRE, JC- 1) can be used to determine..m in a variety of cell types, and many fluorescence indicators ( Dihydroethidium, Dihydrorhodamine 123, H2DCF- DA) can be used to determine ROS. Nearly all of the available fluorescence probes used to assess..m or ROS are single- wavelength indicators, which increase or decrease their fluorescence intensity proportional to a stimulus that increases or decreases the levels of..m or ROS. Thus, it is imperative to measure the fluorescence intensity of these probes at the baseline level and after the application of a specific stimulus. This allows one to determine the percentage of change in fluorescence intensity between the baseline level and a stimulus. This change in fluorescence intensity reflects the change in relative levels of..m or ROS. In this video, we demonstrate how to apply the fluorescence indicator, TMRM, in rat cortical neurons to determine the percentage change in TMRM fluorescence intensity between the baseline level and after applying FCCP, a mitochondrial uncoupler. The lower levels of TMRM fluorescence resulting from FCCP treatment reflect the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential. We also show how to apply the fluorescence probe H2DCF- DA to assess the level of ROS in cortical neurons, first at baseline and then after application of H2O2. This protocol ( with minor modifications) can be also used to determine changes in..m and ROS in different cell types and in neurons isolated from other brain regions.

AB  - Native Neotropical trees are being increasingly planted for restoration purposes and timber production, but we lack species-specific data on growth responses to different regional climates and local environmental variation. We used regression trees and variance components to quantify the effects of within and among-site environmental variation on the basal area (BA) of 21 Neotropical and two exotic tree species at three selection trials in the Republic of Panama. Sites represented distinct regional climates in which annual rainfall varied from 1100 to 2226 mm, with dry seasons of 4.1-6.7 months. Local environmental variables included measures of slope steepness and position, soil texture, soil color, and indicators of soil condition, such as subsoil rockiness.
   Basal area in 17 species responded primarily to regional differences among sites, and explained between 32% and 72% of species BA. Low BA plots of most species were located in the driest site, while high BA plots were found in the two wetter sites (mean BA difference = 117 +/- 20.6 cm(2)). Local variables also influenced the growth of 12 species, with percent slope, soil texture at 5-10 cm, subsoil rockiness and Munsell value from 20 to 50 cm explaining between 0.2% and 24.5% of within-site variance in BA. For these variables, BA differences across adjacent branches of regression trees ranged from 59 +/- 23.4 cm(2) (subsoil rockiness) to 176 +/- 45.9 cm(2) (Munsell value). Our results support the growing evidence that local as well as regional environmental variation influences tree community composition, growth and survival in mature forests. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of responses to local variables among environmentally sensitive species allowed us to make some preliminary site and species-specific silvicultural recommendations. For site generalists, future research should extend the current trials to multiple sites within each regional climate to separate climatic influences from those of the local environment.

AB  - Desalination plants are processing huge quantities of sea water for the production of high quality potable and process water. With regard to environmental impact the main concerns are the increased temperature and salinity of the process effluent (brine, cooling water) which has to be rejected to the sea.
   Many national and international environmental regulations and guidelines are Stipulating discharge limits for temperature and salinity to be complied with by the projected desalination plant in order to obtain the environmental approval for operation. The World Batik guidelines, as well as many national regulations, assume a so called "Mixing Zone" around the point of water discharge, within which initial mixing with ambient sea water takes place, and Stipulate limits for temperature and salinity increase over ambient conditions at the edge of this mixing zone.
   However, the size of this mixing zone is not clearly defined and the procedures by which the temperature and salinity values are to be determined are missing. In consequence compliance with the stipulated discharge limits can hardly be proven in quantitative terms and the results of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) reports are usually rather imprecise in this regard.
   This presentation describes in a simplified manner an alternative approach for assessment of the environmental impact and corresponding limitation of temperature and salinity increase due to water discharge from desalination and power plants, which is considered more adequate for this purpose. It is proposed to Substitute the Unclear criterion of a "Mixing Zone" size by the water Volume available for dilution of the discharged effluent. A basic procedure for the determination of a minimum dilution water Volume is outlined, considering the temperature or salinity increase between intake and outfall and the discharged water flow rate.
   The described general approach may be considered by both environmental authorities stipulating discharge limits and the responsible project parties to enable a more adequate assessment regarding compliance of a desalination project with applicable environmental regulations on a sound data basis.

AB  - The forest growth model 4C was used to investigate how conversion management of a Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L) stand towards a mixed oak-birch stand would affect stand structural development - and hence biodiversity and productivity - in the long term. For this purpose the 4C model was parameterised for natural regeneration of light demanding species and extended for management of multi-layered stands. A series of structural indicators was selected to describe key factors of forest biodiversity at the stand scale. Two consecutive aspects of Scots pine conversion were tested: (1) the choice of conversion strategy between thinning and gap creation and (2) the choice of conversion regime in terms of cutting cycle, thinning type and pine tree retention. Three simulated conversion strategies aim at the gradual removal of the pine canopy but differ in the spatial organisation of pine cuttings and hence result in different light conditions for regeneration. Only the directed gap creation strategy was able to maintain and increase birch admixture to the stand and to approach natural stand structural development. Simulation of 12 conversion regimes for the directed gap creation strategy indicated that thinning type (from above or from below), pine tree retention at final felling (50% of the standing volume or none) and cutting cycle (6,9 or 12 years) all significantly influence stand structural development. These effects were clearest for oak development. Birch occurred in a few mixed clusters, but tended to disappear when-criteria analysis we conclude that the optimal longer cutting cycles were used. Based on a multi conversion regime - in which both stand productivity and biodiversity objectives can be combined implies thinning from above, pine tree retention, and cutting cycles of 6 years. The conceptual validity of the model as well as the applicability of the results are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The temporal evolution in Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) content is often used in estimations of greenhouse gas fluxes and is an important indicator of soil quality. Regional estimates of SOC changes can only be obtained by analyzing very large number of samples over large areas due to the strong spatial variability in SOC contents. Visible and Near Infrared Spectroscopy (VNIRS) provides an alternative to chemical analyses. The benefits of this technique include a reduction of the sampling processing time, an increase of the number of samples that can be analyzed within time and budget constraints and hence an improvement of the detection of small changes in SOC stocks for a given area. Carbon contents are predicted from spectra through Partial Least Square Regressions (PLSR). The performance of three different instrumental settings (laboratory, field and airborne spectroscopy) has been assessed and their relative advantages for soil monitoring studies have been outlined using the concept of Minimal Detectable Difference. It appears that ground-based spectrometers give Root Mean Square Errors of Cross-Validation similar to the limit of repeatability of a routine SOC analytical technique such as the Walkley and Black method (+/- 1 g C kg(-1)). The airborne spectrometer, despite its greater potential to cover large areas during a single flight campaign, has some difficulties to reach such values due to a lower Signal-to-Noise Ratio. Because of its statistical nature, the method and its potential rely on the stability of the calibrations obtained. It appears that calibrations are currently site-specific due to variation in soil type and surface condition. However, it is shown that PLSR can take into account both soil and spectral variation caused by different measuring campaigns and study areas. Further research is needed to develop regional spectral libraries in order to be able to use VNIRS as a robust analytical technique for precisely determining the SOC content and its spatial variation.

AB  - In order to develop a method of measuring the level of microbial activity in soil that is suitable for use by farmers, land managers, and other non-scientists, a simple method for determining soil microbial activity was evaluated and compared with two standard techniques. Soils sampled from vegetable farms in south east Queensland were incubated in the laboratory under controlled moisture and temperature conditions. Three methods were used to measure soil microbial activity, a respirometry method and two methods using the cotton strip assay (CSA) technique (image analysis and tensometer). The standard CSA method measured loss of tensile strength over a 35 day incubation period of buried cotton strips using a tensometer. The new CSA technique measured the intensity of staining by microbes using a flatbed scanner to create an image of the cotton strip whose staining percentage was determined using Photoshop (R) software. The respirometry method used the substrate induced respiration rate (SIR) to determine microbial biomass in the soil at day 12 of incubation. The strong correlation between the image analysis method and the tensometer method (r(2)=0.81), a technique used by scientific researchers, suggests that the image analysis method could be used to monitor aspects of soil biological health by general community land-care groups and farmers. The image analysis method uses equipment which is readily available and, while not strongly correlated with more precise measurements of soil biological activity such as microbial biomass (r(2)=0.26), it can detect gross trends in biological health in a soil monitoring program. The CSA method using image analysis was the cheapest technique to measure soil microbial activity. CSA using image analysis can be a valuable tool in conjunction with other simple indicators of soil physical and chemical health such as slaking and pH to monitor soil amelioration or rehabilitation programs.

AB  - Phenology models are useful tools for various sectors of human activity, particularly for all environmental studies. An historical, 46-year phenological record, and meteorological data set for period 1955-2000 were used to analyse the abilities of the statistical models to predict flowering and leaf unfolding time for a set of wild and cultivated plants in Slovenia. With single phenological model, we have predicted timing of phenophase for particular plant on the base of previous phenological data of the same plant or on the base of previous phenological data of the other plants. The most frequently included independent variables in such models were common silver birch, dandelion and horse-chestnut. It was stated that these plants may be used as phenological indicators in given conditions. Correlation analysis and linear multiple regression were applied to establish the relationship among phenological development and climatic variables (temperature, rainfall, North Atlantic Oscillation, day length). Different thresholds temperatures have been selected for eight different locations with the smallest standard deviation in growing degree day's method to calculate thermal time. Various plant species responded differently to the same climatic factors and were best fitted to certain geographic region. The timings of spring phenophases strongly correlated with temperature of the precedent months, on the other hand rainfall and North Atlantic Oscillation explained smaller part of phenological variability. Photothermal time significantly improved results of phenoclimatic models when taken into account instead of thermal time. The validity of the results was tested with cross validation method and using independent data set for the year 2000, respectively Considering the high year-to-year variability of phenological events, the models presented provide satisfactory estimations of the leaf unfolding and flowering dates. Formal equations presented in this study could be powerfully extended and applied to other sites and plants, provided that a sufficiently long time series of phenological and meteorological data were available.

AB  - Field studies have established high potential for hybridization between two important and often coexisting weedy species, Amaranthus hybridus and Amaranthus tuberculatus. Prezygotic reproductive barriers between these species are believed to be limited to pollen competition and availability. A greenhouse study showed that a herbicide-resistance gene (ALS) from A. hybridus could be introgressed into an advanced A. tuberculatus background (BC2). However, evidence is lacking in support of such transfer in nature. Postzygotic reproductive barriers may minimize, if not preclude, natural introgression. Indeed, A. hybridus xA. tuberculatus hybrids are characterized by reduced fertility and even floral neuterism. The purpose of this study was to assess hybrid fertility in the BC1 generation and its relationship with genome structure and segregation at ALS. Fertility was assessed by measuring seed output and by pollen evaluation, and segregation at ALS was determined via a molecular marker system. The two parental species have the same ploidy (2n = 32) but differ in DNA content (2C) values, with A. tuberculatus chromosomes being on average 29% greater than those of A. hybridus. Given that most (98%) BC(1)s were homoploid, 2C values were used as indicators of relative genomic constitution. Fertility in the BC1 generation was greater than that of F(1)s, and 3% of BC(1)s had seed output similar to that of the parental species. Fertility in the BC1 did not correlate (in a strict way) with reconstitution of parental genomes. Hybrid sterility appeared to be controlled by relatively few loci. Heterozygosity at ALS was negatively correlated with fertility. Also, the A. tuberculatus ALS allele was not observed in the A. hybridus sexual condition, monoecism. Linkage of ALS to a locus associated (directly or via epistasis) with hybrid sterility may explain the fertility penalty observed with ALS introgression. Moreover, this linkage might explain why sequenced herbicide-resistance ALS alleles from sympatric A. tuberculatus and A. hybridus populations show independent evolution.

AB  - In the Pleistocene-Holocene section of the Baikal deep-water sediments shales are periodically enriched with the siliceous shells of diatomic algae up to nearly pure diatomite. As the terrigenous shale-silty material is diluted with amorphous silica, the concentrations of all chemical elements, except for organic carbon and uranium, decrease in the sediments. As in seas and oceans, the blossom of diatomic algae in the Baikal basin is associated with the intensification of a supply of dissolved silica and nutrients under the climatic conditions close to the present-day ones, and the uranium concentration in the diatomic silts resulted from the formation of humic acids, which served as a precipitant. In the glacial periods, when erosion in the catch basins stopped, the contents of silicon, nitrogen, and phosphorus decreased below the level of their concentrations necessary for the vital activity of diatoms. That is why the diatom appearance in the section is a sign of paleoclimate. The diatomic muds, as compared with shales, are characterized by increased concentrations of U and reduced contents of Th; therefore, the Th/U ratio is a contrasting indicator of the chemical differentiation of the section. By configuration, the distribution curves for the Th/U ratio, biogenic silica, and organic carbon are consistent with the isotope-oxygen curves constructed on the chronological scale developed in detail in the last 20 years. This permitted establishment of the age boundaries of paleoclimatic epochs in the Baikal section, which are in good agreement with the chronostratigraphic constructions carried out by S. A. Arkhipov for the West-Siberian plain and are comparable with the West-European glaciation ages. Direct dating of the sediments by non-equilibrium uranium is hampered by the high content of terrigenous admixture in the diatomic silts and by the nonstationary initial U-234/U-238 ratio. It is shown that direct radiometric dating of the Baikal sediments will be favored by obtaining agreed age estimates by U-234 and Th-230 (or Ra-226).

AB  - The aquatic environment of black-lipped pearl oysters (Pinctada margaritifera) in the Takapoto lagoon was studied to determine the cause of their recent diseases, Both N and P limitations were observed, and the oligotrophy was known from previous reports. The low N concentration appeared to affect the volumes of the various picoplankton compartments more than their numbers, whereas the P concentration affected phytoplankton, estimated as chlorophyll a. The values for the resulting biomasses of phytoplankton (3.8 mu g C 1(-1)) and bacteria (2.8 mu g C 1(-1)) were amongst the lowest reported values, as were the respective production rates (2.2-3.5 mu g C 1(-1) reported and 1.22 mu g C 1(-1) current work). Although unexpectedly low, the values for biomass and production of bacteria are consistent with the close relationship observed between phytoplankton and bacteria.
   Waste products from the reared P. margaritifera stock enhanced the growth rates of phytoplankton and picoplankton as shown when incubating in unpoisoned sediment traps, even though the concentrations of both populations were lower than those achieved in the surrounding wafer, Oyster filtering affected not only phytoplankton, but also smaller-sized plankton, including flagellates and the viable heterotrophic bacteria, but had a significant impact on total counts of bacteria only in the 0-7 m layer, The density of the pearl oysters appeared to exceed the nutritional potential of the lagoon. Owing to the oligotrophic conditions, phytoplankton and even bacteria were unable to sustain their grazing.
   The 0-7 m depth appeared to be more favourable to oyster growth than the bottom, despite the higher amount of pigments collected in bottom traps. The suspended material in the upper layer was less degraded and showed a higher potential for microbial multiplication. The lack of exchange between the intermediate layer of 18 m and the upper and lower levels suggested that during our study, the suspended material at the bottom did not originate directly from the 0-7 m level owing to the particular circulation of water in the lagoon.

AB  - Two extensive forest vegetation survey datasets are explored. using ordination and classification, for evidence of in situ regeneration by Pinus strobus (Eastern white pine) and P. resinosa (Red pine). Ordination of tree species contributions to total basal area in 320 upland northern hardwood-conifer stands produced distinct stand groups for P. hanksiana, P. resinosa, P. strobus and mesic hardwoods in an ascending sequence along the first axis. Quercus rubra (red oak), Q. alba (white oak) and tolerant conifer groups formed segregates from the hardwood complex alone the second axis. P. strobus mixes with all other forest types, but P. resinosa is restricted to its own group. Seedlings and trees of P. strobus are more abundant than saplings, which are restricted to the pine and oak forests. Therefore, seed production, dispersal and seedling establishment seem to be less of a barrier to in situ regeneration by P. strobus than subsequent survival and growth.
   Canonical correspondence analysis of 170 pine-dominated stands from the Canadian Shield of Ontario, in which tree species variables are segmented into height-class pseudo-species, yielded no linear relationship between environmental features or stand structure and seedling densities of P. strobus. However, total tree basal area appears to impose an upper limit to seedling density on the forest floor. Strong correlations emerged between pine seedling density and understorey veg etation. Stand classification of the understorey vegetation, using constrained indicator species analysis, yielded distinct high and low seedling groups. Low pine seedling density was associated with abundant broadleaved shrubs, herbs and seedlings as well as feathermosses and tolerant conifers. High seedling density could not be ascribed to the presence of seedbed taxa, such as Polytrichum, but is ascribed to the absence of competition and other forms of inhibition in the understorey vegetation and down through the canopy profile. In situ regeneration of P. strobus does, therefore, occur but conditions over the forest landscape are largely restrictive.

AB  - Holocene sediments of the wetlands around the inner Severn estuary, UK, demonstrate a consistent stratigraphy of a single woody peat layer, up to at least 3.5 m thick, capped with a grey, silty clay. The pear directly overlies sand and gravel or bedrock. This differs from the multiple pear beds and sands and gravels described from the outer estuary. The contact between the pear and clay is sharp, and the altitude of that contact is around 5 m ODN throughout the area. Fifty-right boreholes at three principal study sites suggest that the contact decreases in altitude inland, nor seawards. Palaeoecology of the sediments around the contact shows a decline in alder and rise in sedge prior to the clay deposition. There are no salt-marsh indicators, and diatoms of the clay layer, although scarce, suggest nutrient-rich, fresh or only very slightly brackish conditions for the environment of clay deposition. The change from alder fen ro sedge fen, and then to standing fresh water, indicates a rising water table. The silty clay does not show a fining upwards, nor away from the river, and the sediment source is thought to be estuarine, not fluvial. A rising relative sea level eventually allowed sediment-charged tidal waters to penetrate inland across former fenland. It is proposed that the inner Severn estuary acted as a series of basins, and the expansion of the tide into each basin led io a decrease in tide height. Flooding began after 3110 BP, and was later further inland. Each basin may have been hooded fairly suddenly, accounting for the sharp contact. The topographic controls make correlation with regional sea-level curves difficult. Above the silty clay there are distinct overbank deposits, suggesting that the phase of standing, tidal water was directly succeeded by fluvial sedimentation. Reclamation of the wetlands took place during this last phase.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a key soil quality indicator, as it is a source and storage of plant nutrients and plays a vital role in soil fertility and productivity maintenance. Intensification of agriculture is known to cause SOC decline; however, much of the evidence stems from field-scale experimental trials. The primary aim of this study is to investigate how more than 20 years of agricultural land use intensification in Bangladesh has influenced SOC levels at landscape levels. This was achieved by revisiting in 2012 four sub-sites from the Brahmaputra and Ganges alluviums which were previously sampled (1989-92) by the Soil Resource Development Institute and collecting 190 new samples. These were located at different elevations and subjected to differing amounts of inundation. The SOC was determined using the same method, potassium dichromate wet oxidation, used in the 1989-92 campaign. A comparison of the SOC in the 2012 samples with their historic levels (1989-92) revealed that overall SOC declined significantly across both alluviums as well at their four sub-sites. Further analysis, however, showed that SOC has declined more at higher sites. The higher sites are inundated to a limited level, which makes them suitable for growing multiple crops. Among the land types considered here, the low land sites (because of their topographical position) remain inundated for a greater part of the year, allowing a maximum of only one crop of submerged rice. As a result of reduced biomass decomposition due to anaerobic conditions when inundated, and lower land use/cropping intensity, SOC accretion has occurred in the lower land sites.
   The SOC levels in South Asian countries are inherently low and agricultural land use intensification fuelled by growing food production demand is causing further SOC loss, which has the potential to jeopardise food security and increase the environmental impact of agriculture.

AB  - Ecosystems in the arid/humid transition zone (AHTZ) of northern China are highly sensitive to climate change and human activities. Accurately assessing the impact of climate change on these ecosystems is important for effectively reducing the risks faced by them under future climate change. In this study, the leaf area index during the selected growing season (LAIGS) was used as an indicator for vegetation activity. After comparison different potential indicators, the growing season temperature (TGS) was used to indicate temperature, and the growing season aridity index (AIGS), which considers the regional water budget, was used to indicate moisture rather than precipitation, which is used more commonly. Correlation analysis and residual trends were used to study the influence of climatic and non-climatic factors on vegetation activity in the AHTZ from 1982 to 2016. The results for regions where LAIGS increased significantly (0.037/10 yr, 53.58% of the study area), the regions where LAIGS dominated by non-climatic factors (18.40%) was larger than areas dominated by climatic factors (9.61%). However, most (25.57%) of the regions in the selected study area were mainly driven by both climatic and non-climatic factors. In about half (49.73%) of the climate-affected regions, significant changes in LAIGS were driven jointly by TGS and AIGS. These regions were mainly in the northern and western Loess Plateau. The regions where changes were driven mainly by AIGS, and those where changes were driven mainly by TGS, each accounted for nearly a quarter of climate-affected regions (24.87% and 25.40%, respectively). The former regions were on the western Songliao Plain, the northern North China Plain, and the northern Loess Plateau, and the latter regions were in the northern Greater Khingan Mountains, on the southern North China Plain, in the western mountains of North China, and on the southern Loess Plateau.

AB  - Soil friability (F) is one of the key indicators of soil structural conditions and can be used to assess the environmental impacts of different tillage and no-tillage practices on crop growth and yield. F can be affected by several driving factors such as soil (physical and chemical parameters) and topographic attributes and different land uses as well. Few studies have been carried out to identify those driving factors as well as to quantify their relationships with F at watershed scale. The objectives of this study were (i) to characterize the spatial variability of F and further soil and topographic attributes across a spatial transect of 11.2 km in length using classical statistics; (ii) to quantify the spatial relationships of F and driving factors using the state-space approach; and (iii) to compare the performance of state-space models in estimating F with those of corresponding linear and multiple regression models. The transect was established in the Micaela river watershed (MRW), Southern Brazil, with equidistantly distributed soil sampling points. Soil textural fractions (sand, clay and silt contents), organic matter content, bulk density, macroporosity, and F were determined in the 0-0.10 m layer at each sampling point. The digital elevation model provided elevation and soil slope as topographic attributes while a land use map was obtained from satellite images. All state-space models achieved better results in describing the spatial relationships of F and the further soil and topographic attributes than the corresponding multiple linear regression models. State-space analysis showed that soil slope could be used as a proxy to predict local variations of F in the MRW. The spatial covariance information should be included in the development of pedotransfer functions for estimating the spatial variation of F and the type of land use (as a soil structural indicator) should be investigated in future studies at watershed scale.

AB  - The main aim of the research was to analyse the variability of the beach litter items, both in terms of categories and top items collected on the southern Baltic coast, based on a 5-year series of data. Research on beach litter collected in 15 sections with a length of 1 km in four seasons has shown that the dominant is artificial polymer materials with the percentage share of 68.5%. The proportions of other categories were at the levels of 10% in the case of processed/worked wood, 8% -metal, 4% -glass/ceramics and paper/cardboard, 2% -cloths/textiles and 1% -rubber. Unidentified items constituted about 3%. 53% of the top 10 litter types were cigarette butts and filters. Linking the litter types with their potential sources allowed for the identification of tourism and recreational activities as the main source with the percentage from 58.1% to 71.6%. There is no clear link between the number of tourists and the amount of litter, mainly due to the beach clean-up companies coordinated by local authorities. A comparison of urban and rural areas showed differences in the total beach litter number, while the percentage share of individual categories and litter sources was similar. The marine environment's status in terms of beach litter was assessed based on national and EU threshold values. The assessment based on the national threshold values indicates the poor environmental conditions along the southern Baltic coast, regarding both total number litter items per 100 m and artificial polymer materials. In the case of assessments based on the EU threshold value set -for the total number of litter per 100 m the environmental status of the southern Baltic coast was considered good throughout the entire study period.

AB  - The relevance of this research lies in the need to develop a scientifically-grounded methodology for designing the optimal profile of the contact frontal surface of an energy-efficient earthmoving machine operating device, which ensures the redistribution of resistance forces along the cutting elements during the excavation of frozen soil when extracting hydrocarbons. The relevance is confirmed by the need to improve domestic methods for designing the profiles of effective operating devices, ensuring the excavation of frozen soils during the laying of oil and gas pipelines and geological exploration in permafrost areas. Increasing the energy efficiency and service life of highly loaded ripper teeth is done by optimizing the geometric profile and designing a spatial shape that provides minimal resistance to cutting the soil. The object of the research is the process of dynamic interaction of the ripper tooth cutting profile with the frozen soil environment. The research method used was kinematic analysis and force calculation. The cyclic process of dynamic loading of the ripper operating device was investigated. The methodology of system analysis, as well as the method of distribution of resistance forces over the geometric elements of the cutting edge, were used. The mathematical apparatus has been effectively applied to establish the dependences of the change in energy and power properties on performance indicators, soil rheology, and dynamic loads of the ripper tooth. The process of interaction of the ripper tooth tip with frozen soil was investigated. A method for substantiating the design parameters of the operating device by using Legendre polynomials was proposed. Separate calculation results subject to the introduced restrictions were presented for the condition for solving the problem. The optimal parameters of the transverse profile of the contact frontal surface of the earth-moving machine operating device were determined taking into account the coefficient of reducing the fracture resistance of frozen soils.

AB  - Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers use tracking loops to lock onto GNSS signals. Fixed loop settings limit the tracking performance against noise, receiver dynamics, and the current scenario. Adaptive tracking loops adjust these settings to achieve optimal performance for a given scenario. This paper evaluates the performance and complexity of state-of-the-art adaptive scalar tracking techniques used in modern digital GNSS receivers. Ideally, a tracking channel should be adjusted to both noisy and dynamic environments for optimal performance, defined by tracking precision and loop robustness. The difference between the average tracking jitter of the discriminator's output and the square-root Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) indicates the loops' tracking capability. The ability to maintain lock characterizes the robustness in highly dynamic scenarios. From a system perspective, the average lock indicator is chosen as a metric to measure the performance in terms of precision, whereas the average number of visible satellites being tracked indicates the system's robustness against dynamics. The average of these metrics' product at different noise levels leads to a reliable system performance metric. Adaptive tracking techniques, such as the fast adaptive bandwidth (FAB), the fuzzy logic (FL), and the loop-bandwidth control algorithm (LBCA), facilitate a trade-off for optimal performance. These adaptive tracking techniques are implemented in an open software interface GNSS hardware receiver. All three methods steer a third-order adaptive phase locked loop (PLL) and are tested in simulated scenarios emulating static and high-dynamic vehicular conditions. The measured tracking performance, system performance, and time complexity of each algorithm present a detailed analysis of the adaptive techniques. The results show that the LBCA with a piece-wise linear approximation is above the other adaptive loop-bandwidth tracking techniques while preserving the best performance and lowest time complexity. This technique achieves superior static and dynamic system performance being 1.5 times more complex than the traditional tracking loop.

AB  - Climate conditions in Africa have varied substantially during the Late Quaternary with alternating humid and arid periods controlled mainly by the African monsoonal regime. However, the duration and termination of the last African Humid Period (14-6 ka BP) and its internal climatic variability are still debated. Using a laminated sequence from the Nile Deep-Sea Fan, we reconstruct for the first time the monsoon-induced frequency of exceptional Nile floods at centennial resolution during the African Humid Period. By combining sedimentological, geochemical and microscopic tools and comparing our record with two proximal piston cores and with regional paleoclimatic records, we show: a) the occurrence of recurrent high-energy floods between 10.1 and 9 ka BP, during the height of the African Humid Period; b) a shift in the hydro-climatic regime as early as 9 ka BP, with a progressive reduction in flood frequency and magnitude until 8.2 ka BP, likely related to a southward migration of the monsoon rainfall belt; c) a drastic reduction of flood activity between 8.2 and 7.8 ka BP; d) an unstable Ethiopian-Nile hydrological system from 7.8 ka BP, followed by a further decrease in river runoff until similar to 4 ka BP. The occurrence of a stepwise hydro-climatic deterioration over the Ethiopian Highlands from similar to 9 ka BP brings into question the climatic linkages and feedbacks between low and high latitudes during the Early to Mid-Holocene and in particular around the 8.2 ka BP North Atlantic cooling event. Our unique record of flood frequency at centennial-resolution therefore allows us to draw new insights on fluvial and geomorphic feedbacks of the Nile hydrologic system to monsoonal regimes during a period of major environmental shifts.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease may pose a major threat to the health and welfare of farmed fish. By investigating a range of established cardiovascular disease indicators, we aimed to determine the prevalence, severity and consequences of this affliction in farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) from an open cage farm in the Baltic Sea, an open cage farm in a freshwater lake, and a land-based recirculating aquaculture system. We also aimed to identify environmental, anthropogenic and physiological factors contributing towards the development of the disease. The majority of trout possessed enlarged hearts with rounded ventricles (mean height:width ratios of 1.0-1.1 c.f. similar to 1.3 in wild fish) and a high degree of vessel misalignment (mean angles between the longitudinal ventricular axis and the axis of the bulbus arteriosus of 28-31 degrees c.f. similar to 23 degrees in wild fish). The prevalence and severity of coronary arteriosclerosis was also high, as 92-100% of fish from the different aquaculture facilities exhibited coronary lesions. Mean lesion incidence and severity indices were 67-95% and 3.1-3.9, respectively, which resulted in mean coronary arterial blockages of 19-32%. To evaluate the functional significance of these findings, we modelled the effects of arterial blockages on coronary blood flow and experimentally tested the effects of coronary occlusion in a sub-sample of fish. The observed coronary blockages were estimated to reduce coronary blood flow by 34-54% while experimental coronary occlusion adversely affected the electrocardiogram of trout. Across a range of environmental (water current, predation), anthropogenic (boat traffic intensity, hatchery of origin, brand of feed pellets) and physiological factors (condition factor, haematological and plasma indices), the hatchery of origin was the main factor contributing towards the observed variation in the development of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, further research on the effects of selective breeding programs and rearing strategies on the development of cardiovascular disease is needed to improve the welfare and health of farmed fish.

AB  - Combined heat and power generation traditionally allows for higher energy performance than separate production of heat and electricity. However, the significant increase of the renewable energy sources contribution in electricity production has spatially and temporally modified the context in which polygeneration systems operate and the energy and environmental profitability of these technologies could be undetermined.
   In such a situation it seems interesting to investigate the influence of the power grid efficiency variation on the polygeneration systems performance. For this purpose energy and environmental performance of a proposed system based on combined production are compared to those achieved by a conventional system based on separate production. The primary energy demand of conventional and proposed systems due to electricity depends on the efficiency of the national electric energy system features. In this paper, this efficiency is considered to be time-varying (hour-by-hour) and it is further taken into account that the electric system efficiency changes in different regions of the same Country. According to Italian day ahead market of electricity the national territory is divided in 6 zones; two of them (Centre-North zone and Centre-South zone) will be specifically considered and compared hereinafter. The differences that arise in results are also assessed with respect to the case in which national and local average efficiency is taken into account. The environmental analysis is performed considering the average and the time-varying Italian and local electricity emission factors. The results have highlighted that the cogeneration system feasibility depends upon the variability of these factors. Indeed, referring to thermoelectric-based power grid efficiency, only in Centre-North zone is more energetically convenient to produce heat and power by separate production systems. The environmental analysis outcomes have showed the same trend of energy analysis results in all the considered zones underlining that the evolution towards sustainability in Smart Grids requires an integrated approach.

AB  - According to the latest statistics, cancer is expected to account for nearly 1800000 new cases and about 607000 deaths in the US in 2019. Approximately 40% of people with cancer survive. This means that life expectancy is a little more than 1 in 3. Therefore, it is essential to detect this malignancy in early stage and predict therapeutic responses in patients in order to enhance the efficiency of treatment, decrease side-effects and optimize the cure process. One of the best solutions for early cancer diagnosis and management is tracking tumor markers. Cancerous or noncancerous cells produce these substances in response to cancer or some specific conditions. Although, onco-biomarkers are generated in normal situations, their concentration is much higher in the presence of tumors. These materials which most of them are proteins can be spotted in body fluids such as blood, serum and urine. An increased level of an oncobiomarker may be associated with the presence of cancer, however, it is not a definite indicator. For that reason, a combination of biomarkers and other diagnostic tests are always preferred. Due to the high cost, low speed and intricate instrumental requirements of existing assays such as enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay, fluorescence and radiometric immunoassay for measurement of biomarkers, there is an extreme need for more inexpensive, swift, simple and portable detection methods. In recent years, the popularity of electrochemical biosensors are increasing in diagnostic fields. Significant improvements in electrochemical techniques, biological instrumentation and nanotechnology have paved the way for the emergence of novel platforms for detection of tumor markers. Importance of measurement of biomarkers by electrochemical-based affinity biosensors for early cancer diagnosis and monitoring have been emphasized by numerous articles. The main purpose of the present review is to give researchers a general idea of the recent studies about early cancer detection by EC-based biosensing devices, being pursued globally.

AB  - Background: Cities face rapid changes leading to increasing inequalities and emerging public health issues that require cost-effective interventions. The urban exposome concept refers to the continuous monitoring of urban environmental and health indicators using the city and smaller intra-city areas as measurement units in an interdisciplinary approach that combines qualitative and quantitative methods from social sciences, to epidemiology and exposure assessment.
   Methods: In this proof of concept study, drinking water and quality of life indicators were described as part of the development of the urban exposome of Limassol (Cyprus) and were combined with agnostic environment-wide association analysis. This study was conducted as a two-part project with a qualitative part assessing the perceptions of city stakeholders, and quantitative part using a cross-sectional study design (an urban population study). We mapped the water quality parameters and participant's opinions on city life (i.e., neighborhood life, health care, and green space access) using quarters (small administrative areas) as the reference unit of the city. In an exploratory, agnostic, environment-wide association study analysis, we used all variables (questionnaire responses and water quality metrics) to describe correlations between them.
   Results: Overall, urban drinking-water quality using conventional indicators of chemical (disinfection byproducts-trihalomethanes (THM)) and microbial (coliforms, E. coli, and Enterococci) quality did not raise particular concerns. The general health and chronic health status of the urban participants were significantly (false discovery rate corrected p-value < 0.1) associated with different health conditions such as hypertension and asthma, as well as having financial issues in access to dental care. Additionally, correlations between THM exposures and participant behavioral characteristics (e.g., household cleaning, drinking water habits) were documented.
   Conclusion: This proof-of-concept study showed the potential of using integrative approaches to develop urban exposomic profiles and identifying within-city differences in environmental and health indicators. The characterization of the urban exposome of Limassol will be expanded via the inclusion of biomonitoring tools and untargeted metabolomics.

AB  - An important problem limiting productivity and profitability of sea urchin aquaculture is the inability of producers to predetermine if sea urchins are ready for harvest. One way to overcome the 10-100% of lost production due to inopportune harvest times is to use external morphological characteristics to determine harvest readiness. To determine whether spine colour may be a useful indicator of harvest readiness, we tested whether there are relationships between spine colour and the size and colour of gonads of the commercially important sea urchin Tripneustes gratilla. Adult T. gratilla were grown in all combinations of three densities and three seawater exchange rates, simulating a range of environmental conditions occurring in culture systems. After six weeks, we measured the size and colour of gonads using standard protocols, quantified spine colour using colour rating and RGB (red, green, blue) intensity, and tested for relationships among these variables using linear models. The models identified significant positive relationships between spine colour predictors and gonad index and gonad colour rating. Our models indicated higher gonad indices were associated with brighter coloured spines, whilst gonads with the highest colour ratings were associated with stronger orange or red coloured spines. Patterns in spine colour identified by our models may reflect variation in colour producing pigments, carotenoids and naphthoquinones, in the epithelium. It is not clear why colour pigments in spines may depend on the colour and size of gonads, but it may be that healthy sea urchins that can grow large gonads also have sufficient energy to obtain and store colour pigments. Alternatively, colour pigments may provide health benefits that facilitate greater gonad size. Overall, our findings suggest that spine colour may be a suitable proxy for determining the harvest readiness of T. gratilla and possibly other sea urchins, but improvement in the reliability of our models and full automation of colour assessments are required before this novel technique can be implemented at commercial scales.

AB  - Within developing countries, wastewater treatment (WWT) has improved in recent years but remains a high priority sustainability challenge. Accordingly, life cycle assessment (LCA) studies have recently started to analyse the environmental impacts of WWT technologies on the specific context of less developed countries, mainly in China and India. This work presents a comprehensive review of this knowledge with the aim of critically analysing the main conclusions, gaps and challenges for future WWT-related LCAs in developing countries. The most commonly assessed technologies in the 43 reviewed articles are different variations of activated sludge and extensive treatments applied in decentralized systems; however, studies focused on advanced technologies or new sources of pollution (e.g. micropollutants) are still lacking. Goal and system boundaries are normally clearly defined, but significant stages for some technologies such as the construction and sludge management are frequently not included and functional units should be defined accordingly to specific conditions in developing countries. At the inventory level, a more concise description of sources and technical parameters would greatly improve the quality of the LCAs along with accountability of direct greenhouse gas emissions. Eutrophication and global warming are the two most commonly assessed impacts; however, the calculation of terrestrial ecotoxicity when the sludge is used for agricultural purposes, of water use and of the land use change impacts associated to extensive technologies should be encouraged. The estimation of more site-specific databases, characterization factors (especially for eutrophication) or normalization and weighting values combined with more affordable access to background databases and LCA software, would deeply increase the accuracy of WWT-related LCAs in developing countries. An increased usage of the uncertainty analysis should be encouraged to assess the influence of these gaps in the final interpretation of the results. The review finishes with a summary of the main challenges and research gaps identified and with specific guidelines for future researchers to avoid the most common shortcomings found in the reviewed studies.

AB  - The negative effect of heat stress on dairy cows, with a temperature humidity index (THI) over 72, has been extensively studied. However, there are few studies on THI values under 72 that compare the effect of heat stress in different lactation stages. The objective of this study was to determine the heat stress effect on two lactation stages with a THI below the threshold 72. Thirty-nine multiparous, non-pregnant Holstein cows with more than 30 kg/cow.day of solid-corrected milk were used in a randomised complete block design to evaluate six treatments. The experimental design had a 3 by 2 factorial arrangement with three heat stress mitigation strategies: No shade (CON), access to shade only, and access to shade combined with sprinkling and ventilation, and two stages of lactation: early (S1) and late (S2), 12 +/- 10.3 and 201 +/- 45.8 days in milk respectively, for a duration of 81 consecutive days. All treatments, except CON had access to artificial shade from 0900 hours to 0500 hours next day. From 0500 hours to 0900 hours all cows were managed together in a grazing session. Additionally, sprinkling and ventilation cows had two 30-min sessions of ventilation and spray (0900 hours, 1530 hours). The average THI was 70.1 +/- 4.46 (minimum THI: 60.4; maximum THI: 81.7) and the average hours above 72 were 7.8 +/- 5.98. Animals in S1 presented higher solids-corrected milk reduction (P < 0.0001; 5.4 and 1.9 kg/cow.day), and protein yield (<0.0001; 0.13 and 0.54 kg/cow.day) than animals in S2 when shade was not allowed (CON). It was concluded that under these conditions, animal productivity is more negatively affected in early lactation animals. The use of shade with or without spray and ventilation mitigates heat stress effects on both stages of lactation.

AB  - Droughts are natural disasters that pose significant threats to agricultural production as well as living conditions, and a spatial-temporal difference analysis of agricultural drought risk can help determine the spatial distribution and temporal variation of the drought risk within a region. Moreover, this type of analysis can provide a theoretical basis for the identification, prevention, and mitigation of drought disasters. In this study, the overall dispersion and local aggregation of projection points were based on research by Friedman and Tukey (IEEE Trans on Computer 23:881-890, 1974). In this work, high-dimensional samples were clustered by cluster analysis. The clustering results were represented by the clustering matrix, which determined the local density in the projection index. This method avoids the problem of determining a cutoff radius. An improved projection pursuit model is proposed that combines cluster analysis and the projection pursuit model, which offer advantages for classification and assessment, respectively. The improved model was applied to analyze the agricultural drought risk of 13 cities in Heilongjiang Province over 6 years (2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014). The risk of an agricultural drought disaster was characterized by 14 indicators and the following four aspects: hazard, exposure, sensitivity, and resistance capacity. The spatial distribution and temporal variation characteristics of the agricultural drought risk in Heilongjiang Province were analyzed. The spatial distribution results indicated that Suihua, Qigihar, Daqing, Harbin, and Jiamusi are located in high-risk areas, Daxing'anling and Yichun are located in low-risk areas, and the differences among the regions were primarily caused by the aspects exposure and resistance capacity. The temporal variation results indicated that the risk of agricultural drought in most areas presented an initially increasing and then decreasing trend. A higher value for the exposure aspect increased the risk of drought, whereas a higher value for the resistance capacity aspect reduced the risk of drought. Over the long term, the exposure level of the region presented limited increases, whereas the resistance capacity presented considerable increases. Therefore, the risk of agricultural drought in Heilongjiang Province will continue to exhibit a decreasing trend.

AB  - Surface flow types (SFTs) are advocated as ecologically relevant hydraulic units, often mapped visually from the bankside to characterize rapidly the physical habitat of rivers. SFT mapping is simple, non-invasive and cost-efficient. However, it is also qualitative, subjective and plagued by difficulties in recording accurately the spatial extent of SFT units. Quantitative validation of the underlying physical habitat parameters is often lacking and does not consistently differentiate between SFTs. Here, we investigate explicitly the accuracy, reliability and statistical separability of traditionally mapped SFTs as indicators of physical habitat, using independent, hydraulic and topographic data collected during three surveys of a c. 50m reach of the River Arrow, Warwickshire, England. We also explore the potential of a novel remote sensing approach, comprising a small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) and structure-from-motion photogrammetry (SfM), as an alternative method of physical habitat characterization. Our key findings indicate that SFT mapping accuracy is highly variable, with overall mapping accuracy not exceeding 74%. Results from analysis of similarity tests found that strong differences did not exist between all SFT pairs. This leads us to question the suitability of SFTs for characterizing physical habitat for river science and management applications. In contrast, the sUAS-SfM approach provided high resolution, spatially continuous, spatially explicit, quantitative measurements of water depth and point cloud roughness at the microscale (spatial scales 1m). Such data are acquired rapidly, inexpensively and provide new opportunities for examining the heterogeneity of physical habitat over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Whilst continued refinement of the sUAS-SfM approach is required, we propose that this method offers an opportunity to move away from broad, mesoscale classifications of physical habitat (spatial scales 10-100m) and towards continuous, quantitative measurements of the continuum of hydraulic and geomorphic conditions, which actually exists at the microscale.

AB  - Animal waste, stream water, and streambed sediment from 19 small (<32 km(2)) watersheds in 12 U.S. states having either no major animal agriculture (control, n = 4), or predominantly beef (n = 4), dairy (n = 3), swine (n = 5), or poultry (n = 3) were tested for: 1) cholesterol, coprostanol, estrone, and fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) concentrations, and 2) shiga-toxin producing and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Campylobacter, and pathogenic and vancomycin-resistant enterococci by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on enrichments, and/or direct quantitative PCR. Pathogen genes were most frequently detected in dairy wastes, followed by beef, swine and poultry wastes in that order; there was only one detection of an animal-source-specific pathogen gene (stx1) in any water or sediment sample in any control watershed. Post-rainfall pathogen gene numbers in stream water were significantly correlated with FIB, cholesterol and coprostanol concentrations, and were most highly correlated in dairy watershed samples collected from 3 different states. Although collected across multiple states and ecoregions, animal-waste gene profiles were distinctive via discriminant analysis. Stream water gene profiles could also be discriminated by the watershed animal type. Although pathogen genes were not abundant in stream water or streambed samples, PCR on enrichments indicated that many genes were from viable organisms, including several (shiga-toxin producing or enterotoxigenic E. cob, Salmonella, vancomycin-resistant enterococci) that could potentially affect either human or animal health. Pathogen gene numbers and types in stream water samples were influenced most by animal type, by local factors such as whether animals had stream access, and by the amount of local rainfall, and not by studied watershed soil or physical characteristics. Our results indicated that stream water in small agricultural U.S. watersheds was susceptible to pathogen gene inputs under typical agricultural practices and environmental conditions. Pathogen gene profiles may offer the potential to address both source of, and risks associated with, fecal pollution. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Diversity patterns and dynamics at forest edges are not well understood. We disentangle the relative importance of edge-effect variables on spatio-temporal patterns in species richness and occupancy of deadwood-dwelling fungi in fragmented old-growth forests. We related richness and log occupancy by 10 old-growth forest indicator fungi and by two common fungi to log conditions in natural and anthropogenic edge habitats of 31 old-growth Picea abies forest stands in central Sweden. We compared edge-to-interior gradients (100 m) to the forest interior (beyond 100 m), and we analyzed stand-level changes after 10 yr. Both richness and occupancy of logs by indicator species was negatively related to adjacent young clear-cut edges, but this effect decreased with increasing clear-cut age. The occupancy of logs by indicator species also increased with increasing distance to the natural edges. In contrast, the occupancy of logs by common species was positively related or unrelated to distance to clear-cut edges regardless of the edge age, and this was partly explained by fungal specificity to substrate quality. Stand-level mean richness and mean occupancy of logs did not change for indicator or common species over a decade. By illustrating the importance of spatial and temporal dimensions of edge effects, we extend the general understanding of the distribution and diversity of substrate-confined fungi in fragmented old-growth forests. Our results highlight the importance of longer forest rotation times adjacent to small protected areas and forest set-asides, where it may take more than 50 yr for indicator species richness levels to recover to occupancy levels observed in the forest interior. Also, non-simultaneous clear-cutting of surrounding productive forests in a way that reduces the edge effect over time (i.e., dynamic buffers) may increase the effective core area of small forest set-asides and improve their performance on protecting species of special concern for conservation.

AB  - Sediments can act as long-term sinks for environmental pollutants. Within the past decades, dioxin-like compounds (DLCs) such as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have attracted significant attention in the scientific community. To investigate the time- and concentration-dependent uptake of DLCs and PAHs in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and their associated toxicological effects, we conducted exposure experiments using suspensions of three field-collected sediments from the rivers Rhine and Elbe, which were chosen to represent different contamination levels. Five serial dilutions of contaminated sediments were tested; these originated from the Prossen and Zollelbe sampling sites (both in the river Elbe, Germany) and from Ehrenbreitstein (Rhine, Germany), with lower levels of contamination. Fish were exposed to suspensions of these dilutions under semi-static conditions for 90 days. Analysis of muscle tissue by high resolution gas chromatography and mass spectrometry and of bile liquid by high-performance liquid chromatography showed that particle-bound PCDD/Fs, PCBs and PAHs were readily bioavailable from re-suspended sediments. Uptake of these contaminants and the associated toxicological effects in fish were largely proportional to their sediment concentrations. The changes in the investigated biomarkers closely reflected the different sediment contamination levels: cytochrome P450 1A mRNA expression and 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity in fish livers responded immediately and with high sensitivity, while increased frequencies of micronuclei and other nuclear aberrations, as well as histopathological and gross pathological lesions, were strong indicators of the potential long-term effects of re-suspension events.
   Our study clearly demonstrates that sediment re-suspension can lead to accumulation of PCDD/Fs and PCBs in fish, resulting in potentially adverse toxicological effects. For a sound risk assessment within the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive and related legislation, we propose a strong emphasis on sediment-bound contaminants in the context of integrated river basin management plans.

AB  - Due to the intensive mixing polymictic lakes should be homogenous. However, morphometric diversity and high water dynamics contribute to the differentiation of many parameters in various areas of the lakes. This study analyzes both phytoplankton and zooplankton to assess differences in water quality along the north-south axis of the longest lake in Poland. New phytoplankton indicators were applied for determining the lake's ecological status: the Q index based on functional groups and the PMPL (Phytoplankton Metric for Polish Lakes) index based on phytoplankton biomass. TSIROT index (Rotifer Trophic State Index), which comprises the percentage of species indicating a high trophic state in the indicatory group and the percentage of bacteriovorus in the Rotifera population, was used for zooplankton analysis.
   TP content was different at different sites - we observed its gradual increase from the south to the north. Spatial variation of phosphorus did not considerably affect plankton diversity. The phytoplankton was dominated by Oscillatoriales, typical of shallow, well-mixed eutrophic lakes. The ecological status of the lake based on the EQR (Ecological Quality Ratio) was poor or moderate. The zooplankton was dominated by rotifers (at almost all sites), which indicates a eutrophic state of the lake. The values of phytoplankton indices at the studied sites did not differ considerably; the differences resulted more from local conditions such as the contaminant inflow and the macrophyte development than water dynamics.
   We have demonstrated that in the lake dominated by filamentous Cyanobacteria the ecological status should be determined according to the PMPL index or other indices dependent on the dominant Cyanobacteria species. Since the Qindex does not include the functional group S1, the results can lead to the false conclusion that water quality improves with an increased amount of phytoplankton. The high abundance of Cyanobacteria in the lake may have contributed to the poor growth of rotifers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Global warming has led to significant vegetation changes in recent years. It is necessary to investigate the effects of climatic variations (temperature and precipitation) on vegetation changes for a better understanding of acclimation to climatic change. In this paper, we focused on the integration and application of multi-methods and spatial analysis techniques in GIS to study the spatio-temporal variation of vegetation dynamics and to explore the vegetation change mechanism. The correlations between EVI and climate factors at different time scales were calculated for each pixel including monthly, seasonal and annual scales respectively in Qinghai Lake Basin from the year of 2001 to 2012. The primary objectives of this study are to reveal when, where and why the vegetation change so as to support better understanding of terrestrial response to global change as well as the useful information and techniques for wise regional ecosystem management practices. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) Overall vegetation EVI in the region increased 6% during recent 12 years. The EVI value in growing seasons (i.e. spring and summer) exhibited very significant improving trend, accounted for 12.8% and 9.3% respectively. The spatial pattern of EVI showed obvious spatial heterogeneity which was consistent with hydrothermal condition. In general, the vegetation coverage improved in most parts of the area since nearly 78% pixel of the whole basin showed increasing trend, while degraded slightly in a small part of the area only. (2) The EVI change was positively correlated with average temperature and precipitation. Generally speaking, in Qinghai Lake Basin, precipitation was the dominant driving factor for vegetation growth; however, at different time scale its weight to vegetation has differences. (3) Based on geo-statistical analysis, the autumn precipitation has a strong correlation with the next spring EVI values in the whole region. This findings explore the autumn precipitation is an important indicator, and then, limits the plant growth of next spring.

AB  - The occurrence of microbial colonisation on artificial surfaces in urban areas (building facades, roof tiles) and interiors (damp rooms: silicone sealings, wallpaper) causes not only an aesthetically unacceptable discolouration of the surface, it also represents a conspicuous problem in terms of biodeterioration, accelerated weathering and a potential health risk for humans by fungal mycotoxines. The most conspicuous organisms responsible for biofouling terrestrial surfaces are fungi and green microalgae as well as cyanobacteria. Microorganisms are often estimated by cultivating, but the biomass can be Misjudged because of contaminations or the existence of nonculturable cells and spores. By using ergosterol as a specific biomarker for living fungi and yeasts in combination with chlorophyll a for aeroterrestrial microalgae it is possible to quantify fungal and algal infection independent from cultivation and undisturbed by surface (dis)colouration. Using HPLC and photometric methods, conversion factors for microbial biomass were determined in representative fungal and algal species: 5 mg ergosterol g(-1) fungal dry biomass and 23 mg chlorophyll a g(-1) algal dry biomass. The applied wipe technique allowed a non-invasive sampling and evaluating of infections per square meter. Very low detection limits for ergosterol and chlorophyll a permitted determining fungi and algae before they become macro scopically visible. Up to 36 mg ergosterol m(-2) and 180 mg chlorophyll a m(-2) were detected on outdoor artificial surfaces, equivalent to approximately 7 g m(-2) fungal dry biomass and 8 g m(-2) algal dry biomass. The distribution and the composition of the microbial communities varied strongly between the sampling locations. Fungi were observed above windows of damp rooms or at more sun-exposed locations, whereas algae covered more wet and shadowed surfaces. The established methods are well suited for the precise joint determination of fungal and algal biomass in microbial communities of natural biofilms on artificial surfaces as a pre-condition for the development of prevention strategies against microbial colonisation.

AB  - There are many indicators that human activity may change climate conditions all around the globe through emissions of greenhouse gases. In addition, aerosol particles are emitted from various natural and anthropogenic sources. One important source of aerosols arises from biomass burning, particularly in low latitudes where shifting cultivation and land degradation lead to enhanced aerosol burden. In this study the counteracting effects of greenhouse gases and aerosols on African climate are compared using climate model experiments with fully interactive aerosols from different sources. The consideration of aerosol emissions induces a remarkable decrease in short-wave solar irradiation near the surface, especially in winter and autumn in tropical West Africa and the Congo Basin where biomass burning is mainly prevailing. This directly leads to a modification of the surface energy budget with reduced sensible heat fluxes. As a consequence, temperature decreases, compensating the strong warming signal due to enhanced trace gas concentrations. While precipitation in tropical Africa is less sensitive to the greenhouse warming, it tends to decrease, if the effect of aerosols from biomass burning is taken into account. This is partly due to the local impact of enhanced aerosol burden and partly to modifications of the large-scale monsoon circulation in the lower troposphere, usually lagging behind the season with maximum aerosol emissions. In the model equilibrium experiments, the greenhouse gas impact on temperature stands out from internal variability at various time scales from daily to decadaland the same holds for precipitation under the additional aerosol forcing. Greenhouse gases and aerosols exhibit an opposite effect on daily temperature extremes, resulting in an compensation of the individual responses under the combined forcing. In terms of precipitation, daily extreme events tend to be reduced under aerosol forcing, particularly over the tropical Atlantic and the Congo basin. These results suggest that the simulation of the multiple aerosol effects from anthropogenic sources represents an important factor in tropical climate change, hence, requiring more attention in climate modelling attempts.

AB  - The dominant landscape process on the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska is the formation and drainage of thaw lakes. Lakes and drained thaw-lake basins account for approximately 75% of the modem surface expression of the Barrow Peninsula. The thaw-lake cycle usually obliterates lacustrine or peat sediments from previous cycles, which could otherwise be used for paleoecological reconstruction of long-term landscape and vegetation changes. Several possible erosional remnants of a former topographic surface that predates the formation of the thaw lakes have been tentatively identified. These remnants are characterized by a higher elevation, a thick organic layer with very high ground ice content in the upper permafrost and a plant community somewhat atypical of the region. Ten soil cores were collected from one site, and one core was intensively sampled for soil organic carbon content, pollen analysis and C-14 dating. The lowest level of the organic sediments represents the earliest phase of plant growth and dates to ca. 9000 cal BP. Palynological, evidence indicates the presence of mesic shrub tundra (including sedge, birch, willow and heath vegetation), and microfossil indicators point to wetter eutrophic conditions during this period. Carbon accumulation was rapid due to high net primary productivity in a relatively nutrient-rich environment. These results are interpreted as the local response to ameliorating climate during the early Holocene. The middle Holocene portion of the record contains an unconformity, indicating that between 8200 and 4200 cal BP sediments were eroded from the site, presumably in response to wind activity during a drier period centered around 4500 cal BP. The modem vegetation community of the erosional remnant was established after 4200 cal BP and peat growth resumed. During the late Holocene, carbon accumulation rates (CARs) were greatly reduced in response to the combined effects of declining productivity associated with climatic cooling, and increased nutrient stress as paludification and permafrost aggradation sequestered mineral nutrients.

AB  - In a long-term, spatially comprehensive beam trawl survey of the Navesink River-Sandy Hook Bay estuary, the blue crab Callinectes sapidus was one of the most abundant species. Seasonal changes in abundance were evident, with low abundances in summer followed by peak abundances in the fall, after juveniles recruited to the estuary. We saw no long-term trends in abundance during the 5 yr study. Location in the Navesink River or Sandy Hook Bay explained most of the variance in abundance within any one survey. In diet analyses, we found evidence of cannibalism in all seasons, but in the size range of crabs caught in this study (10-180 mm), we did not find a relationship between cannibalism and juvenile crab abundance. Within surveys, crabs divided into 20 mm size categories showed no size-related differences in location within the estuary or among 7 habitat types examined (algae bed, amphipod bed, beach, channel, marsh edge, mid-depth, and sandbar). Channels and sandbars tended to exhibit lower crab abundance than other habitats. Shallow habitats with and without cover were equally preferred by juvenile blue crabs, implying that the presence of structure was not critical. Spatial models of crab abundance (less than or equal to 80 mm carapace width) to environmental data were fit from several seasons of intensive sampling in the Navesink River-Sandy Hook Bay estuary between summer 1996 and spring 1998. These models indicated that fine-grained sediments, temperature, depth, and salinity were good indicators of crab abundance in spring, summer, and fall. Using these spatial models and environmental data collected in subsequent seasons (summer 1998-fall 1999), we were able to predict blue crab abundance in the river as evidenced by significant correlations between predicted and observed abundances. For the size range of crabs examined here, physical conditions may be as important as structural habitat types or cannibalism in determining habitat use in northerly estuaries.

AB  - A circadian pacemaker within the central nervous system regulates the approximately 24-h physiologic rhythms in sleep cycles, hormone secretion, and other physiologic functions. Because the pacemaker cannot be examined directly in humans, markers of pacemaker function must be used to study the pacemaker and its response to environmental stimuli. Core body temperature (CBT), plasma cortisol, and plasma melatonin are three marker variables frequently used to estimate the phase of the human pacemaker. Measurements of circadian phase using markers can contain variability due to the circadian pacemaker itself, the intrinsic variability of the marker relative to the pacemaker, the method of analysis of the marker, and the marker assay. For this report, we compared the mathematical variability of a number of methods of identifying circadian phase from CBT, plasma cortisol, and plasma melatonin data collected in a protocol in which pacemaker variability was minimized using low light levels and regular timing of both the light pattern and the rest/activity schedule. We hoped to assess the relative variabilities of the different physiological markers and the analysis methods. Methods were based on the crossing of an absolute threshold, on the crossing of a relative threshold, or on fitting a curve to all data points. All methods of calculating circadian phase from plasma melatonin data were less variable than those calculated using CBT or cortisol data. The standard deviation for the phase estimates using CBT data was 0.78 h, using cortisol data was 0.65 h, and for the eight analysis methods using melatonin data was 0.23 to 0.35 h. While the variability for these markers might be different for other subject populations and/or less stringent study conditions, assessment of the intrinsic variability of the different calculations of circadian phase can be applied to allow inference of the statistical significance of phase and phase shift calculations, as well as estimation of sample size or statistical power for the number of subjects within an experimental protocol.

AB  - The study on magnetic properties of the red clay indicates that the red clay and loess-paleosol sequence have a common magnetic mineralogy, with magnetite, maghemite, hematite (and possibly goethite) contributing to the magnetic behavior. The red clay magnetic susceptibility is also found to have a positive relation with extrafine superparamagnetic grains. This suggests that, like the Quaternary loess-paleosols, an ultrafine ferrimagnetic component produced during pedogenesis in the red clay under humid conditions also plays an important role in susceptibility enhancement in the soil units. This is supported by the correlation between Rb/Sr ratio and magnetic susceptibility. This signifies that, like the above loess-paleosol sequence, the magnetic susceptibility of the red clay can be used as a general proxy paleoclimatic indicator, although whether its susceptibility in the red clay is comparable to pedogenesis intensity and requires further investigation. Magnetic susceptibility variation in the red clay thus also provides an eolian/pedogenic record of paleoclimatic evolution. Study of the background susceptibility indicates that, on average, the absolute scale of the paleoclimatic shift from red clay development to Quaternary loess deposition is similar to the climatic shift from stage 5 (S1) to stage 2-4 (L1). This may suggest that during the Quaternary there is an evident strengthening of the absolute wind intensity to bring more (about double) coarser and less weathered (non-SP fraction) eolian magnetic input from the source regions to the Loess Plateau than during the Pliocene. The presence of eolian red clay since 7.5 Ma BP in central-northern China implies an important environmental change from the underlying Cretaceous red sandstone. The red clay development was closely related to global drying and climate cooling since the Cretaceous and closely associated with the abrupt uplift of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau at about that time. This uplift of the plateau intensified the East Asia monsoon system and started red clay deposition.

AB  - Poultry feeding is at the same time a simple (one single feed) and sophisticated (precisely controlled) model, Feed pecking, a bird specific activity, if complex and requires a detailed analysis to define methods of evaluation of feed prehension. Chicks hatch thanks to their beak. Their first activity after hatch is to peck, Sensorial and metabolic reinforcements are more or less rapidly acting on feed selection depending on the growth potential of the chick.
   Feed pecking is a discontinuous, anticipated; heterogeneous and selective activity. Rhythms of access to the feeder rather depends an adaptation of the animal to its environment than on an internal regulation of appetite, Slow motion video observation of feed pecking confirms that during the two third of the pecking time, the head of the chicken remains in a steady position which permits observation of the particles, The particle to be takes or touched is chosen prior to the peck which is performed with closed eyelid, Most of the pecks do not seize a particle but can be characterised as "exploratory" pecks and correspond to a global requirement for "beak related activities". Strength of a peck call bo measured by a fast balance, Strength and rhythm of feed pecks vary according to the type of feed particles eaten.
   Three measurements can be done to quickly characterise feed prehension:
   Feeding rate = Amount of feed eaten/Time eating,
   Pecking rate = Number of pecks at feed/Time eating,
   Pecking efficiency = Amount of feed eaten/Number of pecks at feed.
   These measurements will be further improved taking into account ratios between exploratory and intake pecks and pecking strengths. Under practical rearing conditions, scanning of the number of chicken at feeders in several sites of the shed give am estimation of the time spent eating, Increased number of social interactions at the feeder and floor pecking just after eating are indicators of a problem of adaptation to the diet, Control of feed prehension in fowls will contribute to a better assessment of physical structure of feed particles which will complement the already available extended knowledge of biochemical nutrition.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the epidemiological characteristics of emergency readmissions due to digestive and hepatobiliary diseases within the hospitals of the Valencian Health Service (VHS), Spain, an to examine their relationship with defined variables related to patients or to previous periods of hospitalization.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS:Out Of the 212,947 episodes of patient hospitalization included in the Uniform Hospital Discharge Data Set of the VHS, excluding those persons under 16 years of age, those who han died in hospital or were discharged due to being transferred to another hospital and also excluding the two hospitals whose record were of poor quality, 18,075 patients were chosen whose principal diagnosis on first admission was one of a digestive or hepatobiliary disease. After a descriptive analysis the relationship was explored between risk of readmission and the variables of age, gender, hospital funding, wheter the environment is a rural or urban one, the hospital itself, the diagnostic group, comorbidity, type of admission, length of stay, presence of surgical procedure, discharge criteria and service using an independent Cox Proportional Hazards analysis for each variable and a second Cox analysis adjusted for selected variables.
   RESULTS: 16.9% Of those patients discharged for digestive disorders are re-admitted within a year. The risk of readmission is associated with age, comorbidity, male sex and chronic diseases and, with respect to the previous episode of hospitalization, it is associated with emergency admission, longer period of hospitalization, non-surgical discharge and admission to certains hospitals.
   CONCLUSIONS: The risk of emergency readmission is associated with defined variables relating to patient or previous episodes of hospitalization connected with a more serious condition. The risk adjustment carried out could be used in order to identify high-risk cases which could then be paid special attention in order to delay or prevent readmission and as an indirect indicator for use in monitoring the quality of hospital care.

AB  - Medicine lake is a small (about 1 km(2)), shallow (up to 10 m deep), saline (50-170 gl(-1)) and meromictic lake formed after the retreat of the Wisconsin ice in the north American Great Plains. Based on a detailed sedimentological analysis of cores, we describe and interpret 13 sedimentary subfacies grouped in 9 associations which characterize the following lacustrine subenvironments: elastic littoral (freshwater and saline), springs, microbial mats, bench slope, and pelagial toxic, alternating oxic-anoxic, anoxic and hypersaline, and organic-dominated). Lateral distribution and vertical evolution of subfacies in our model are controlled by climate fluctuations, climate-related limnological parameters (lake level, TDS and brine composition, and redox conditions), and autocyclic processes (progressive infilling of the basin and higher sedimentation rate in the pelagial realm). Microbial and chemical processes govern deposition in this system, and meromixis plays a decisive role in lake dynamics. Phototropic bacterial plate communites at the chemocline dominated as pelagial organic producers during stable meromictic periods, whereas benthic microbial communities developed during mixed water periods. Water stratification during the Holocene was mainly controlled by three parameters: I) basin morphometry, 2) lake level, and 3) differences in TDS values between mixolimnion and monimolimnion waters. Sedimentary facies analyses is a powerful descriptive and interpretative tool that greatly contributes to deciphering the high resolution paleoenvironmental information archived in lake sequences. Depositional and paleoenvironmental models provide a dynamic framework for integrating paleolimnological data and other proxy paleorecords. Medicine lake serves as a facies model for shallow, perennial hypersaline, meromictic lakes in modern and ancient lacustrine basins. The sediment sequence from Medicine lake cores is consistent with the general paleoclimatic evolution of the northern Great Plains since the retreat of ice sheets. Our study reveals a plethora of rapid fluctuations in the water cycle both during the middle and the late Holocene, These augment prior paleoclimate reconstructions based on diatom studies of the lower Holocene freshwater to saline transition and on pollen profiles which show little variability during the subsequent long prairie grass episode.

AB  - The steel sector is one of the most carbon-intensive industries, and the sustainable strategies to reduce CO2 emission on integrated mill plants are discussed continuously. By renewable H-2 utilization on blast furnace (BF), it is expected to achieve both sustainable operation and CO2 emission reduction. We evaluate the application of the solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) process as a source of H-2 for use as an alternative to CO as the reductant in a BF. We mathematically formulated a BF model and developed an integrated BF-SOEC process. We performed techno-economic analysis to suggest the maximum H-2 injection for the technical aspect, and demonstrated the process' economic viability, considering the learning-by-doing effects on the price of the SOEC system. We also estimated the net reduction of global warming potentials and carbon intensity. Our findings showed that the coke replacement ratio ranged from 0.255 similar to 0.334 kg(Coke).kg(H)(-1) depending on injection conditions and that 25 kg(H2).t(HM)(-1) was an acceptable maximum injection rate within the stable range of BF operating indexes. We calculated H-2 production cost to be US$ 8.84 similar to 8.88 kg,121 in the present, but it is expected to be decreased to US$ 1.41 similar to 4.04 kg(H2)(-1) H-2 by 2050. Economic parity with the existing BF process will be reached between the years 2036 and 2045, depending on the maturity of the SOEC process. Injection of 25 kg(H2)center dot(-1) can reduce CO2 emission by 0.26 similar to 0.32 t(CO2-eq).center dot t(HM)(-1) We expect that this sustainable strategy to reduce CO2 emission from integrated mill plants will widen applications of H-2 utilization in BFs if the economic efficiency of SOEC systems can be increased.

AB  - Eutrophication is one of the main threats to seagrass meadows, but there is limited knowledge on the interactive effects of nutrients under a changing climate, particularly for tropical seagrass species. This study aimed to detect the onset of stress in the tropical seagrass, Halophila stipulacea, by investigating the effect of in situ nutrient addition during an unusually warm summer over a 6-month period. We measured a suite of different morphological and biochemical community metrics and individual plant traits from two different sites with contrasting levels of eutrophication history before and after in situ fertilization in the Gulf of Aqaba. Nutrient stress combined with summer temperatures that surpassed the threshold for optimal growth negatively affected seagrass plants from South Beach (SB), an oligotrophic marine protected area, while H. stipulacea populations from North Beach (NB), a eutrophic and anthropogenically impacted area, benefited from the additional nutrient input. Lower aboveground (AG) and belowground (BG) biomass, reduced Leaf Area Index (LAI), smaller internodal distances, high sexual reproductive effort and the increasing occurrence of apical shoots in seagrasses from SB sites indicated that the plants were under stress and not growing under optimal conditions. Moreover, AG and BG biomass and internodal distances decreased further with the addition of fertilizer in SB sites. Results presented here highlight the fact that H. stipulacea is one of the most tolerant and plastic seagrass species. Our study further demonstrates that the effects of fertilization differ significantly between meadows that are growing exposed to different levels of anthropogenic pressures. Thus, the meadow's "history" affects it resilience and response to further stress. Our results suggest that monitoring efforts on H. stipulacea populations in its native range should focus especially on carbohydrate reserves in leaves and rhizomes, LAI, internodal length and percentage of apical shoots as suitable warning indicators for nutrient stress in this seagrass species to minimize future impacts on these valuable ecosystems.

AB  - Background and Aims Root sprouting (RS), i. e. the ability to form adventitious buds on roots, is an important form of clonal growth in a number of species, and serves as both a survival strategy and a means of spatial expansion, particularly in plants growing in severely and recurrently disturbed habitats. Occurrence and/or success of plants in severely and recurrently disturbed habitats are determined by two components, namely the ability to produce adventitious buds on roots and the vigour of their production. As mechanisms behind different magnitudes of RS remain unclear, our study investigates: (1) whether the presence or absence of specific tissues in roots can promote or limit RS; and (2) whether there is some relationship between RS ability, RS vigour and species niche.
   Methods We studied RS ability together with RS vigour in 182 Central European herbaceous species under controlled experimental conditions. We used phylogenetic logistic regressions to model the presence of RS, RS vigour, the relationship between RS and anatomical traits and the relationship between RS and parameters of species niches.
   Key Results A quarter of herbs examined were able to produce adventitious buds on roots. They were characterized by their preference for open dry habitats, the presence of secondary root thickening and the occurrence of sclerified cortical cells in roots. Root sprouting vigour was not associated with any specific anatomical pattern, but was correlated with the environmental niches of different species, indicating that preferred disturbed and dry habitats might represent a selection pressure for more vigorous root sprouters than undisturbed and wet habitats.
   Conclusions Our study shows that sprouting from roots is quite common in temperate dicotyledonous herbs. Two components of RS - ability and vigour - should be considered separately in future studies. We would also like to focus more attention on RS in herbs from other regions as well as on external forces and internal mechanisms regulating evolution and the functions of RS in both disturbed and undisturbed habitats.

AB  - Aerosol sulfate is a major component of submicron particulate matter (PM1). Sulfate can be present as inorganic (mainly ammonium sulfate, AS) or organosulfate (OS). Although OS is thought to be a smaller fraction of total sulfate in most cases, recent literature argues that this may not be the case in more polluted environments. Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometers (AMSs) measure total submicron sulfate, but it has been difficult to apportion AS vs. OS as the detected ion fragments are similar. Recently, two new methods have been proposed to quantify OS separately from AS with AMS data. We use observations collected during several airborne field campaigns covering a wide range of sources and air mass ages (spanning the continental US, marine remote troposphere, and Korea) and targeted laboratory experiments to investigate the performance and validity of the proposed OS methods. Four chemical regimes are defined to categorize the factors impacting sulfate fragmentation. In polluted areas with high ammonium nitrate concentrations and in remote areas with high aerosol acidity, the decomposition and fragmentation of sulfate in the AMS is influenced by multiple complex effects, and estimation of OS does not seem possible with current methods. In regions with lower acidity (pH > 0) and ammonium nitrate (fraction of total mass < 0.3), the proposed OS methods might be more reliable, although application of these methods often produced nonsensical results. However, the fragmentation of ambient neutralized sulfate varies somewhat within studies, adding uncertainty, possibly due to variations in the effect of organics. Under highly acidic conditions (when calculated pH < 0 and ammonium balance < 0.65), sulfate fragment ratios show a clear relationship with acidity. The measured ammonium balance (and to a lesser extent, the HySOx+/SOx+ AMS ratio) is a promising indicator of rapid estimation of aerosol pH < 0, including when gas-phase NH3 and HNO3 are not available. These results allow an improved understanding of important intensive properties of ambient aerosols.

AB  - The water-climate-agriculture nexus quantifies synergies, trade-offs, advantages and disadvantages that arise between water management, food production, and climate change consequences taking into account the environmental impacts, economic conditions, and population growth. This work evaluates the water-climate-agriculture nexus in the Gharanghu basin, Iran, seeking to achieve sustainable management of its water system. An optimization model solves for water release adaptive strategies corresponding to five nexus scenarios to cope with reduced water resources under climate change. The scenarios are as follows (Afshar et al., 2006): change in cropping pattern (Asadieh and Afshar, 2019), reduction of areas under cultivation (Asgari et al., 2015), reuse of agricultural wastewater in irrigated land (Ashofteh et al., 2017), combination of scenarios (Afshar et al., 2006) and (Asgari et al., 2015), namely change in cropping pattern and reuse of agricultural wastewater simultaneously, and (Bates et al., 2008) integration of scenarios (Asadieh and Afshar, 2019) and (Asgari et al., 2015) namely, reduction of areas under cultivation and reuse of agricultural wastewater simultaneously. The nexus scenarios are evaluated with the time reliability index (the ratio of the number of months in which water is supplied to the total months of reservoir operation) based on changes in water supply and agricultural water demand. Results show the time reliability index in the climate change interval (monthly time series for the period 2040-2069) without implementing any nexus scenario equals 28%, and it increases with the implementation of the water-climate-agriculture nexus scenarios. The time reliability of the system equals 85% implementing scenario (Bates et al., 2008) (reducing the area under cultivation and reusing agricultural wastewater in irrigated land). The authors? previous research projects that climate change impacts in the study region would be severe. This paper?s findings provide water managers and planners with useful strategies for optimal reservoir operation that rely on decreasing water demand and increasing water supply. The approach introduced and applied in this study, which develops modeling adaptation policies to increase the synergies of the water-climate-agriculture nexus, is applicable to other basins.

AB  - Adaptation of plant communities is an important factor for maintaining their functioning and stability in changing conditions. The aim of our research is study of the effect of soil moisture regime on the species richness and biomass of the herb layer for old-growth coniferous forests in the Ural Mountains (Russia). The research has been carried out between 57 degrees 00'N; 60 degrees 15"E and 57 degrees 05'N; 60 degrees 25'E. The studied area is part of the Zauralsky hilly piedmont province, the Southern boreal forest region. Sample plots (0.25 hectares) were laid in pine forests growing in habitats with different moisture regimes: insufficient, optimal (stable), and excessive. The research was conducted in 2010. To determine the herb layer productivity, 10-20 subplots 1x1 m in size were laid on each sample plot. Data analysis is based on the One-way ANOVA and species abundance distributions. It has been established that species richness in extreme (insufficient and excessive soil moisture regime (Cowberry pine forest and Pine forest with shrubs and sphagnum) and optimal (stable) soil moisture regime (Multi-herb pine forest) were found to vary significantly, with soil moisture regime being a statistically significant factor. By contrast, herb layer biomass is maintained fairly stable regardless of the soil moisture regimes. ANOVA showed no significant differences between pine forests growing under different soil moisture regimes. It has been found that biomass is maintained by increasing of the dominant species contribution to the overall biomass and increasing of the approximation function graph slope. At the same time, the parameter beta of exponential and power approximating functions is increased and can be considered as an indicator of influencing on forest ecosystems and a measure of their adaptation to insufficient and excessive soil moisture. Thus, species abundance distributions can be used as method to measure the effects of factors that determine forest ecosystem composition and functioning.

AB  - Zooplankton plays an important role in aquatic food webs and changes in its abundance and diversity under changing climatic conditions can significantly affect the abundance and diversity of other aquatic organisms. The aim of the study was to assess quantitative and qualitative parameters of zooplankton development, dynamics of development of its dominant groups and the effect of water temperature. Species composition and abundance of zooplankton of the Kremenchuk Reservoir were studied in 2006, 2010-2012 and 2020 in relation to water temperature and pollution. Zooplankton species diversity fluctuated significantly over the years of the study. A total of 46 taxa were recorded in the reservoir during the study period. The number of recorded zooplankton taxa ranged 26 to 32 depending on the year. The most abundant zooplankters were Chydorus sphaericus, Copepoda nauplii, Brachionus diversicornis. The abundance of zooplankters in the reservoir during the study period ranged 23.10(3) to 256.10(3) ind./m(3), and biomass 0.14 to 0.89 g/m(3). A significant positive relationship was observed between the abundance of cladocerans, including some individual species (Ch. sphaericus and Ceriodaphnia sp.), and water temperature. Indicator species of water pollution in different years and in different parts of the Kremenchuk Reservoir differed significantly, which probably depended on the presence or absence (in a certain period of time) of polluting discharges. The total saprobity index in different years in different parts of the reservoir was in the range of 1.5-1.9. Structural indicators of zooplankton and its dominant complexes characterize the water in the Kremenchuk Reservoir as beta-mesosaprobic. It is probably too early to assess the impact of climate change zooplankton as these changes are still unstable and short in time, but it is necessary to constantly monitor the biota of aquatic ecosystems to further study and summarize the data, which could later allow an identification of such changes.

AB  - Post-combustion flue gas desulfurization and denitrification technologies are essential in achieving the full compliance of fine particulate matter (PM2.5, aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 mu m) air quality standards by 2030 in China as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) are the main precursors of PM2.5. Some studies have addressed the performance evaluation of desulfurization technology, but none included the water-soluble ions (sulfate (SO42-), nitrate (NO3-), etc.) as an indicator nor accounted for uncertainty involved. In this study, we present a multilevel fuzzy method that integrates the analytic hierarchy process with fuzzy theory, defines SO(4)(2-)concentration as a new environmental indicator, and is supplemented with an uncertainly analysis and apply the method for the techno-economic and environmental evaluation of desulfurization and denitrification technologies in six typical enterprises (including two power plants and three industrial production plants and a waste incineration plant) in Chengdu, China. The evaluation shows that first, the fluctuating desulfurization rate and the dosage leads to changed ranking of the economic and technical secondary evaluation results, with the overall comprehensive evaluation ranks unchanged. Second, from the perspective of environmental protection agency and the public, if the environmental indicators are empowered, the lower the SO(4)(2-)concentration of an enterprise, the better its evaluation ranking will be and vice versa. Third, if we re-empower from the perspective of the enterprise, under the condition that the technical feasibility is met and the environmental indicators are basically up to standard, the low-cost removing process is more likely to be the tendency of the enterprise. In summary, the findings of the study have led to the conclusions that (1) for the power industry, the integration of desulfurization, denitrification, and dedusting technologies should be promoted rigorously; (2) the non-power industry should continue the end-of-pipe treatment and environmental protection regulatory policies of the power industry; and (3) the energy industry structure should be optimized with enhanced end-of-pipe control technologies to achieve deep reduction of air pollutants.

AB  - Size heterogeneity can affect social interactions and growth performance of intensively reared fish species, while it creates difficulties in fish feeding as well as in harvesting fish of uniform size. The present study aims to investigate the effects of size variability on individual growth and feeding behavior of European seabass Dicentrarchus labrax. Fifty four fish (age 1 +) were selected and distributed in nine tanks in groups of six, so as to form three triplicated different initial coefficient of mass variation, i.e. CV1: 1.6 % (80.5 +/- 0.28 g), CV2: 11.5 % (82.3 +/- 2.09 g) and CV3: 22.7 % (82.5 +/- 4.14 g). Fish were individually marked with coloured beads in order to evaluate individual growth performance and behavior during feeding (video recordings). The experiment lasted for 75 days. Individual food consumption was used to rank individuals in the feeding hierarchy (Feeding Rank, FR). The individual assessment of growth and feeding behavior parameters showed that in all treatments a feeding hierarchy was established where fish of the highest FRs had the higher body mass and SGR, consumed the most part of food offered with little daily variation and made more efforts to claim food. This hierarchy was weaker in CV3 (lower correlation coefficients). Correlation coefficients between mean share of meal and coefficient of daily food consumption variation, which have been used as indicators of the strength of the social hierarchy, indicate CV3 as the condition creating the milder social environment and CV1 and CV2 as the ones leading to more intense social disturbance. In CV3 a greater percentage of fish showed satisfactory feed efficiency. On the other hand, in CV2 a greater percentage of fish lost weight, did not consume the ideal amount of food and had very low feed efficiency. CV1 presented intermediate results. Present results indicate that social hierarchies of different strength are present among treatments and may compromise fish welfare during their rearing.

AB  - Accurate and reliable estimation of kinetic parameters of pollutant biodegradation processes is essential for environmental and health risk assessment. Common biodegradation models proposed in the literature, such as the nonlinear Monod equation and its simplified versions (e.g. Michaelis-Menten-like and first-order equations), are problematic in terms of accuracy of kinetic parameters due to the parameter correlation. However, a comparison between these models in terms of accuracy and reliability, related to data imprecision, has not been performed in the literature. This task is necessary, mainly because the model selection cannot be straightforward, as shown in this work. To facilitate the comparison, novel statistics summarising the accuracy and reliability of estimations are introduced. The main objective is to establish relationships between these statistics (trough new diagnostic indicators) to limit the probability of pitfalls or to avoid the negative impact of an improper model selection. Such anticipation is an imperative need in the biodegradation modelling framework and, to the best of our knowledge, it has never been performed. In order to account for accuracy, simulated data in realistic conditions are used to highlight the magnitude of pitfalls related to the model selection for estimation of the main kinetic parameters (K-s, mu(m) and/or V-m). Four scenarios related to model selection are compared for the first time and, diagnostic indicators able to anticipate relevant aspects related to accuracy and reliability are introduced. Moreover, first evidences of the impact of measurement errors in other intrinsic Monod parameters (the initial biomass concentration and the microbial yield coefficient, Y), as well as the impact of the simultaneous mu(m), K-s and Y estimation, on the accuracy and reliability of the estimations are reported. Despite the pitfalls shown, specific applicability of even unreliable models is highlighted, and suggestions for environmental and health risk modellers are provided accordingly.

AB  - An analysis of the condition of implementation of projects in agricultural production is carried out. The disadvantages of existing methods and models of planning of the content and time of execution of works in the projects, which mostly do not take into account the changing components of their project environment, are substantiated. The proposed methodology for justifying the models of a changing project environment for harvesting grain, oilseed and legume crops is based on the analysis of official statistics of agrometeorological stations and involves the implementation of production experiments, which makes it possible to increase the accuracy of the results. It has been established that the dewy periods of time in the projects for the collection of early oilseeds, cereals and legumes are characterized by a probabilistic distribution of the time of occurrence of dew and its duration. The indicated regularity and the established correlation relationship between the occurrence of dew and its duration are the main components of the model. The substantiated model of the pink period of time allows to take into account the changing events of the project environment and to improve the quality of the content management process and the time of performance of the harvesting work.
   It is established that the deficit of humidity in the air, in which the performance of harvesting is effective, changes over the course of the day by parabolic dependence. Its maximum value depends on the agrometeorologically acceptable duration of the works in the projects of harvesting early oilseeds, grain and legume crops, which is the basis for substantiating the model of the air humidity deficit and taking into account its impact on the implementation of works in these projects. The obtained results of the research are the basis of development of simulation models of projects for the collection of early oilseeds, grain and legume crops to improve the accuracy of determining the use indicators and resource requirements for the implementation of these projects. The obtained models increase the quality of management decision making in the projects of harvesting early oilseeds, grain and legume crops.

AB  - Very large to moderate earthquakes in the 2010-2011 Canterbury sequence induced liquefaction in parts of Christchurch city and the surrounding region on the South Island of New Zealand. Detailed information gathered about this case of recurrent liquefaction offers important lessons for the study of paleoliquefaction features and the paleoearthquakes that caused them. The Canterbury case demonstrates that liquefaction features are important indicators of strong ground shaking in regions where fault ruptures do not necessarily propagate to the surface, may be masked by later sedimentation, or are otherwise difficult to recognize. Comparison of the liquefaction fields produced by the 2010 M 7.1 Darfield and 2011 M 6.2 Christchurch earthquakes in the Canterbury sequence highlights the influence of site conditions on the geographical distribution of liquefaction features and underscores the need to consider liquefaction susceptibility of sediment and depth of the water table when using paleoliquefaction features to interpret the source area and magnitude of paleoearthquakes. The epicentral distance and size of liquefaction features that formed during the Darfield and Christchurch earthquakes corroborate and further constrain empirical relations used to estimate source areas and magnitudes of paleoearthquakes. Formation of compound sand blows, composed of multiple sand-silt couplets resulting from repeated liquefaction during the Canterbury earthquakes, supports previous interpretations of compound sand blows in the central and western United States. In addition, paleoliquefaction features found in excavations of sand blows that formed during the 2010-2011 Canterbury earthquakes indicate that sites of modern liquefaction are prime targets for paleoliquefaction studies. The depositional environments where liquefaction features form and are preserved help to guide searches for paleoliquefaction features. Information from many sites across a region is needed to develop a chronology of past liquefaction events, to define their liquefaction fields, and to estimate the source areas and magnitudes of paleoearthquakes.

AB  - In tropical forests, deciduousness is an outcome of integrated effect of drought, tree characteristics and soil moisture conditions and thus it is a reliable indicator of seasonal drought experienced by different tree species. Variations in the deciduousness are associated with several ecophysiological characteristics, such as varying allocation pattern of metabolic products, resource capture and conservation, water relations and stem water storages, annual carbon sequestration, timing of reproductive event initiation, extent of separation of vegetative and reproductive events and leaf strategies, and it helps in maintenance of water balance and protection of tree organs during the seasonal drought. Tropical forests support mosaics of tree functional types showing marked differences in the duration of deciduousness (from leaf exchanging to >8 months deciduous), as a result of varying degree of water stress experienced by physiognomy, distribution and wood anatomy of tropical trees. Wide variations in deciduousness in the same species growing at different sites suggest the high sensitivity of tropical trees to small changes in growing habitat. In the present review we have explored the ecological significance of deciduousness in tropical trees with emphasis on: (a) inter- and intraspecies plasticity in deciduousness, (b) various capacity adaptations related with the duration of deciduousness, (c) relationship between tree stem water status and deciduousness, and (d) probable effect of impending climate change on tropical trees. An attempt has also been made to establish deciduousness as climate change indicator in the dry tropics. There is need to develop capabilities to detect and predict the impact of climate change on deciduousness through long-term phenological network in tropics. Remote sensing techniques can generate valuable ecological information such as leaf level drought response and phenological patterns. Deciduousness has the potential to emerge as an important focus for ecological research to address critical questions in global modeling, monitoring, and climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - As coastal populations increase, considerable pressures are exerted on estuarine environments. Recently, there has been a trend towards the development and use of estuarine assessment schemes as a decision support tool in the management of these environments. These schemes offer a method by which complex environmental data is converted into a readily understandable and communicable format for informed decision making and effective distribution of limited management resources. Reliability and effectiveness of these schemes are often limited due to a complex assessment framework, poor data management and use of ineffective environmental indicators. The current scheme aims to improve reliability in the reporting of estuarine condition by including a concise assessment framework, employing high-value indicators and, in a unique approach, employing fuzzy logic in indicator evaluation. Using Sydney estuary as a case study, each of the 15 sub-catchment/sub-estuary systems were assessed using the current scheme. Results identified that poor sediment quality was a significant issue in Blackwattle/Rozelle Bay, Iron Cove and Hen and Chicken Bay while poor water quality was of particular concern in Duck River, Homebush Bay and the Parramatta River. Overall results of the assessment scheme were used to prioritise the management of each sub-catchment/sub-estuary assessed with Blackwattle/Rozelle Bay, Homebush Bay, Iron Cove and Duck River considered to be in need of a high priority management response. A report card format, using letter grades, was employed to convey the results of the assessment in a readily understood manner to estuarine managers and members of the public. Letter grades also provide benchmarking and performance monitoring ability, allowing estuarine managers to set improvement targets and assesses the effectiveness of management strategies. The current assessment scheme provides an effective, integrated and consistent assessment of estuarine health and provides an effective decision support tool to maximise the efficient distribution of limited management resources.

AB  - Marine Carboniferous shales are proven hydrocarbon source rocks in central Britain. In this contribution the depositional environment and shale gas/liquid potential of the lower Namurian part of the Bowland Shale Formation is studied using 77 thermally immature samples from the Duffield borehole.
   The Bowland Shale Formation comprises mudstone and turibidite lithofacies reflecting a pronounced sea level controlled cyclicity. The total organic carbon (TOC) content of the mudstones lithofacies (including marine bands) and of fine-grained rocks within the turibidite lithofacies varies between 1.3 and 9.1%. Hydrogen index (HI) values imply the presence of kerogen type III-II.
   According to biomarker ratios and bulk geochemical parameters, marine bands (maximum flooding surfaces, mfs) were deposited in deep water with slightly enhanced, normal, or slightly reduced salinity. Mudstones of the highstand systems tract (HST) were deposited in environments with normal to reduced salinity, whereas photic zone anoxia favoured the preservation of marine organic matter during deposition of the mfs and the HST. The supply of landplant debris increased during the HST. Turbidites and their non-calcareous mudstone equivalents represent lowstand systems tracts deposited in low salinity environments. Terrestrial organic matter dominates in turbiditic sediments, marine organisms prevail in time-equivalent mudstones. Mudstone beneath marine bands represents transgressive systems tracts when normal marine conditions and photic zone anoxia were reestablished.
   The mudstone lithofacies exhibits a very good to excellent potential to generate conventional mixed oil and gas. TOC content of fine-grained rocks in the turbidite lithofacies depends on the amount of detrital minerals supplied from the south. Moreover, their organic matter is gas-prone. High TOC contents and large thicknesses of the mudstone lithofacies show that the Bowland Shale Formation holds a significant shale gas/liquid potential in areas with appropriate maturity. A relatively low average HI and high clay contents may have negative effects on the shale gas potential. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A series of large earthquakes struck the city of Christchurch, New Zealand in 2010-2011. Major damage sustained by the sewerage infrastructure required direct discharge of up to 38,000 m(3)/day of raw sewage into the Avon River of Christchurch for approximately six months. This allowed evaluation of the relationship between concentrations of indicator microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and F-RNA phage) and pathogens (Campylobacter, Giardia and Cryptosporidium) in recreational water and sediment both during and post-cessation of sewage discharges.
   Giardia was the pathogen found most frequently in river water and sediment, although Campylobacter was found at higher levels in water samples. E. coli levels in water above 550 CFU/100 mL were associated with increased likelihood of detection of Campylobacter, Giardia and Cryptosporidium, supporting the use of E. coli as a reliable indicator for public health risk. The strength of the correlation of microbial indicators with pathogen detection in water decreased in the following order: E.coli > F-RNA phage > C. perfringens.
   All the microorganisms assayed in this study could be recovered from sediments. C perfringens was observed to accumulate in sediments, which may have confounded its usefulness as an indicator of fresh sewage discharge. F-RNA phage, however, did not appear to accumulate in sediment and in conjunction with E. cob, may have potential as an indicator of recent human sewage discharge in freshwater. There is evidence to support the low-level persistence of Cryptosporidium and Giardia, but not Campylobacter, in river sediments after cessation of sewage discharges. In the event of disturbances of the sediment, it is highly probable that there could be remobilisation of microorganisms beyond the sediment-water exchange processes occurring under base flow conditions. Re-suspension events do, therefore, increase the potential risk to human health for those who participate in recreational and work-related activities in the river environment (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The increasing interest in agro-environmental management entails having tools to assess, monitor and map agro-environmental functions (AEFs) in different regional contexts. In Europe, decision-making in agro-environmental policies generally targets single functions instead of multiple ones and rarely considers the regional variability of agricultural or geo-physical conditions that may influence the fulfillment of functions. We propose and test a method to assess the potential of farming regions to fulfill a set of AEFs. The method was applied in the "Collina interna grossetana" farming region (Italy) and concerned three functions: protection of surface water from nitrates, protection of soil from erosion, and conservation of landscape diversity. These functions were qualified and mapped using various geo-physical and land cover descriptors from common geographical datasets. All of the descriptors were combined using geographical cluster analysis to identify their contribution to the three functions, and thus to assess the potential of the farming region to fulfill these functions. Three levels of potential were calculated, according to the more or less favorable fulfillment of soil and water functions. No totally favorable contribution to the functions was identified in the studied area. Moreover, we mapped the spatial patterns obtained for the different levels of potential. The landscape diversity function was found to be the least variable in the study area, while different patterns were identified for the other functions. In fact, the northern and central sections of the study region were organized more in the form of large core areas of different levels of potential, whereas the southern section presented more boundary areas, small core areas and isolated pixels. The method may help to establish local priorities in agro-environmental management pointing out where the set of functions is completely or partially fulfilled, as well as where and how it is more or less necessary to focus support measures afforded by environmental policies. Such information could help to palliate the current poor consideration of the spatial variability of functions in regional policies.

AB  - Allelopathy is defined as the capacity that a specific plant has of directly or indirectly interfering in another one's metabolism, by liberating chemical compounds elaborated by itself in the environment, influencing in plant domination, plant community formation and vegetation climax, as well as in the productivity and handling of cultures. The objective of this work was to assess the allelopathic effect of the aqueous extract of jatropha (Jatropha curcas L.), at different concentrations, over the germination of seeds, aerial and radicular part of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) variety 'Grand Rapids', which is considered a bioindicator species. The experiment was carried out at CEDETEC (Center of Diffusion and Development of Technologies) of Assis Gurgacz College (FAG), Cascavel, Parana, Brazil, during April 2012. Each treatment was applied to four replications with thirty-two lettuce seeds, totalizing 128 seeds per treatment. Grand Rapids seeds were sown in specific trays for the production of lettuce seedlings containing 28 cells, and kept in a greenhouse with micro-sprinkler irrigation. The aqueous extract of jatropha was made by milling leaves in a blender at the concentration of 200 g L-1, strained and vacuum filtered, what provided extract concentration of 20%. That extract was diluted in distilled water for lower concentrations of 15%, 10%, 5%, 1% and 0% (control). Twenty-four hours after sowing, the number of germinated seeds subjected to different concentrations of the extract was analyzed daily, for ten days. The length of the primary root and the aerial part of five lettuce seedlings were also verified by replication on the tenth day after the beginning of the experiment. Comparison between treatment averages was performed with the application of Tukey's test, at 5% of probability. The results in the experimental conditions adopted indicate that the extract of jatropha leaves does not present allelopathic effect on the germination of lettuce seeds, but at 15% concentration, it significantly inhibits the development of the aerial and radicular part.

TI  - Property-based rainwater drainage design and the impacts of climate change
T2  - BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - SYSTEMS
AB  - Property-based rainwater drainage provision comprises a number of components broadly categorised as roof, surface or underground drainage. These systems are relied upon to prevent water ingress to the building and to avoid localised ponding or flooding. Recognition of the inherently unsteady response of the integrated network, in part driven by a particular rainfall event but also due to the transient nature of the fluid flows therein, is important in allowing an understanding of system performance under both current and future climate conditions. Codes and standards suggest that roof drainage systems, conventional or siphonic, are designed using a single rainfall intensity figure, representative of the most intense part of a longer storm, whereas runoff to surface and underground drainage is typically based on a single-peaked rainfall profile. Together with the difference in event duration typically adopted as part of the design process, this means that, unless a straightforward uplift factor is applied, then understanding the potential impacts of climate change on overall system performance can be difficult. Using numerical modelling techniques to analyse the performance of a case study site located in Edinburgh, this research identifies an appropriate common rainfall event from which a system-specific exceedance threshold is identified. Specification of this rainfall intensity facilitates an exploration of the impacts of climate change undertaken within the context of UKCP09 projections. Using gutter overtopping as an indicator of failure, this paper explores possible changes in the frequency of system under-capacity under varying future climate change scenarios.
   Practical application: Engineers are encouraged, in relevant codes and standards, to take account of the potential impacts of climate change when designing rainwater drainage systems for buildings. However, little guidance is offered therein on how to achieve this. This paper presents an example of UKCP09 climate change projections, specifically Weather Generator precipitation data, applied to a case study site that integrates roof, surface and underground drainage networks. Results illustrate the possible change in frequency of system failure, identified in this case as gutter overtopping.

Here, we compare sediment records from two small, nearby, closed crater lakes in western Uganda (Lake Kasenda and lake Wandakara), spanning the last 700 (Wandakara) and 1200 years (Kasenda) respectively. Multiproxy analyses of chemical sedimentary parameters (including C/N ratios, delta C-13 of bulk organic matter and delta C-13 and delta O-18 of authigenic carbonates) and biotic remains (diatoms, aquatic macrofossils, chironomids) suggest that Kasenda has been sensitive to climate over much of this period, and has shown substantial fluctuations in conductivity, while Wandakara has a more muted response, likely due to the increasing dominance of human activity as a driver of change within the lake and catchment over the length of our record. Evidence from both records, however, supports the idea that lake levels were low from similar to AD 700-1000 AD, with increasing aridity from AD 1100-1600, and brief wet phases around AD 1000 and 1400. Wetter conditions are recorded in the 1700s, but drought returned by the end of the century and into the early 1800s, becoming wetter again from the mid-1800s. Comparison with other records across eastern Africa suggests that while some events are widespread (e.g. aridity beginning similar to AD 1100), at other times there is a more complex spatial signature (e.g. in the 1200s to 1300s, and from the 1400s to 1600s). This study highlights the important role of catchment-specific factors (e.g. lakemorphometry, catchment size, and human impact) in modulating the sensitivity of proxies, and lake records, as indicators of environmental change, and potential hazards when regional inference is based on a single site or proxy.

AB  - Integration of CO(2) flux observations with remote sensing technique and ecosystem modeling is expected to be useful for estimation of gross primary production (GPP). We focused on the changes in the two main parameters for the canopy-scale light-response curve-P(max) (maximum GPP at light saturation) and phi (initial slope) as indicators to represent canopy photosynthetic capacity. We hypothesized that P(max) and phi could be evaluated by using spectral reflectance related to the changes in the levels of canopy nitrogen and chlorophyll. We analyzed the relationships between P(max) and phi, derived from tower-based CO(2) flux observations, and ground-based spectral vegetation indices (VIs) in a temperate deciduous coniferous forest.
   The canopy-scale P(max) and phi showed clear seasonal changes accompanying phenological stages. Both the variations in P(max) and phi were strongly correlated with VIs, especially with the ratio vegetation index (RVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), independent of the growth stages. Moreover, day-to-day short-term variations of P(max) and phi were affected by meteorological conditions such as vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and relative solar radiation which was calculated as the ratio of monitored radiation per theoretical maximum radiation.
   Thus, seasonal changes of P(max) and phi were effectively assessed by RVI or EVI, and their short-term variations were evaluated by the empirical relationships with VPD and relative solar radiation. We propose a new simple method for estimating GPP with good precision; by fitting the light-response function with the evaluated parameters, the estimated GPP reflects 3 types of temporal variation: diurnal, day-to-day, and seasonal.

AB  - Measurements of gaseous pollutants (O-3, SO2 and NOx) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) were performed by means of an aircraft-sampling platform during the Program of Regional Integrated Experiments of Air Quality over Pearl River Delta 2004 (PRIDE-PRD2004, from 4 October 2004 to 5 November 2004). The objective was to characterize the spatial and vertical distributions of these air pollutants, and to analyze the associated trace elements and chemical species of PM10 and PM2.5. These vertical distributions are essential to understand, e.g. regional transport as well as the impact of aerosol on climate. The results indicate that the air pollution levels were severe over the PRD with the concentrations of NOx and O-3 reaching up to 160 and 100 ppb, respectively. The pollutants' concentrations were generally decreasing with altitude in the boundary layer. Under certain meteorological conditions, vertical mixing plus horizontal transport can cause a high pollution level at the top of boundary layer. The pollutant concentrations were low over less industrialized and upwind regions. This suggests that local emission sources were the dominant cause of high pollution levels over the PRD. PM2.5 were the main particulate pollutants over PRD. S, Ca, Fe, Al and Zn were the main trace elements found in the sampled particles, and the enrichment factors for elements were calculated to indicate that elements from anthropogenic origins are highly enriched in contrast to crustal composition. Chemical species analysis indicates that NH4+ dominated, followed by SO42-, NO3-, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, Na+ and K+. The equivalent ratio of SO42- to NH4+ is < 1.0, showing that sulfate may mainly exist in the form of (NH4)(2)SO4 and NH4HSO4. These results are valuable for studying vertical distribution characteristics of gaseous pollutants and particulate matters in the boundary layer over PRD and for providing important basic data to environmental assessment and decision-making.

AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key indicator of the Earth's surface energy and is used in a range of hydrological, meteorological, and climatological applications. As needed for most modeling and climate analysis applications, LST products that are generated from polar-orbiting meteorological satellite sensors have spatial resolutions from several hundred meters to several kilometers and have (quasi) daily temporal resolution. These sensors include the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), the Earth Observing System Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and the forthcoming Visible/Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) series, to be flown onboard the National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (VIIRS flights begin approximately 2009). Generally, split-window algorithms are used with these sensors to produce LST products. In this paper, we evaluated nine published LST algorithms (or, in some cases, their slight variants) to determine those that are most suitable for generating a consistent LST climate data record across these satellite sensors and platforms. A consistent set of moderate-resolution atmospheric transmission simulations were used in determining the appropriate coefficients for each algorithm and sensor (AVHRR, MODIS, and VIIRS) combination. Algorithm accuracy was evaluated over different view zenith angles, surface-atmosphere temperature combinations, and emissivity errors. Both simulated and actual remote sensing data were used in the evaluation. We found that the nine heritage algorithms can effectively be collapsed into three groups of highly similar performance. We also demonstrated the efficacy of an atmospheric path-length correction term that is added to the heritage algorithms. We conclude that the algorithms depending on both the mean and difference of band emissivities (Group 1 in our nomenclature) are most accurate and stable over a wide range of conditions, provided that the emissivity can be well estimated a priori. Where the emissivity cannot be well estimated, the Group 3 algorithms (which do not depend on the emissivity difference) modified with the path-length correction term perform better.

AB  - Jamaica is a small island that is losing its forest cover at a rapid rate. Due to the dependency of its largely poor population on the many services and functions its forests provide, this loss threatens to have substantial socioeconomic and ecological consequences for the country. Despite these basic facts, the problem of Jamaican deforestation has received very little attention from the scientific community. This article presents results of an island-wide, satellite-based study of forest change for Jamaica for the period 1987-1992, which was supplemented by a field trip to the island in 1999 to as-, sess the overall accuracy of the estimate. Landsat MSS images, which are available only up until 1992, have proved to be an invaluable and cost-effective resource for mapping forest change in the tropics, particularly in large areas. A supervised classification indicates that Jamaica experienced an average annual deforestation rate of 3.9% for this period, a figure higher than existing estimates based on partial ground surveys but lower than the FAO's 1990 Tropical Forest Assessment of 5.3% for 1981-1990. Deforestation estimates for Jamaica's 14 parishes are also presented, based on the integration of satellite-derived forest classification maps with a parish administrative boundaries map of the island, in a GIS. A correlation analysis between parish deforestation estimates and socioeconomic and land use/quality indicators derived from official sources suggests that deforestation is occurring most rapidly in highly populated areas possessing large numbers of small farmers who live and work under resource-poor conditions. By providing a sense of the magnitude of and main forest loss hotspots, it is hoped that these national and subnational level forest estimates will draw scientific attention to the problem of deforestation on the island. in addition, the socioeconomic analysis may provide policy-makers and planners with some sense of the relative contribution of underlying driving process in this deforestation as a first step toward the creation of effective social programs to combat the problem.

AB  - Terrestrial mosses were used simultaneously in passive (native species, Scleropodium purum and Hypnum cupressifomre) and active (S. purum transplants in moss bags) biomonitoring techniques in a study that aimed to demonstrate the compatibility of the two methods by detailed investigation of the spatial distribution of mercury in the surroundings of a chlor-alkali plant. Native mosses were sampled and transplants exposed (for periods of 30 days) at two different times of the year in order to take into account different environmental conditions (precipitation, temperature, prevailing winds, etc.). The concentrations of Hg in the native mosses ranged between 0.04 and 11.78 mu g g(-1) in February and 0.26 and 12.7 mu g g(-1) in September; in the transplants the concentrations ranged between 0.39 and 1.9 mu g g(-1) in June and 0.036 and 2.75 mu g g(-1) in November. These values are all within the ranges reported in the literature. The total concentrations were transformed into either contamination factors (CF) (by taking into account the background levels of Hg in the native mosses) or enrichment factors (EF) (by taking into account the initial concentrations in the transplants). In both cases, there was a clear relationship with the distance from the source of emission, irrespective of the time of year. Within the range of distances for which data were available for natives and transplants, the CF and EF were highly correlated. This implies that transplants sited in the area immediately surrounding the plant, where the density of native mosses was very low, can be used to determine the degree of contamination in this area. The study also illustrated that the native moss appeared to adapt to the surrounding environment because at an equal distance (> 500 m) from the source of emission the value of the CF for native mosses fell to 1, but the EF for transplanted mosses remained still high (5.2).

AB  - Molecular and stable carbon isotope compositions of 46 Ordovician crude oil samples from wells in theTuoputai region of the northern Tarim Basin were investigated using GC-MS, MRM GC-MS and IRMS to determine their genetic relationships and to identify possible source rocks.Thirty-three source rock samples from outcrops and cores were also investigated.The oil samples varied from light to heavy crudes and showed very narrow delta C-13 value ranges for the whole oil, saturated and aromatic fractions.The majority ofthe oils displayed very similar molecular compositions with relatively high concentrations of n-alkanes and isoprenoids and low concentrations ofterpenoids and steroids. Comparison ofthe compositions of these crude oils strongly suggested their genetic affinity, while maturity parameters indicated maturity variations from the peak to the late oil generation stages. The samples also showed the characteristics of mixtures of biodegraded and fresh oil charges.
   Bitumen extracts from Cambrian and Ordovician source rocks were studied in detail. The oil compositions suggested a marine marl source deposited in anoxic, hypersaline conditions with significant bacterial and algal organic matter inputs. The distributions of C-26-C-28 triaromatic steroids, tricyclic terpanes and regular steranes appear to have been greatly influenced by thermal maturation, making them unreliable for correlating the oils and the source rocks. In contrast, dinosteranes and triaromatic dinosteroids seem not to have been affected by maturation and were more useful for correlation studies.They indicated that there was no or little genetic relationship between the Cambrian - Lower Ordovician source rocks and the oils, but in general suggested a possible Middle - Upper Ordovician source for the oil accumulations in the Tuoputai field. However, the occurrence of triaromatic dinosteroids in oil from well TP28XCX may also suggest a minor contribution from Cambrian - Lower Ordovician source rocks.

AB  - Global ocean warming, wave extreme events, and accelerating sea-level rise are challenges that coastal communities must address to anticipate damages in coming decades. The objective of this study is to undertake a timeseries analysis of climate change (CC) indicators within the Bay of Biscay, including the Basque coast. We used an integrated and flexible methodology, based on Generalized Additive Mixed Models, to detect trends on 19 indicators (including marine physics, chemistry, atmosphere, hydrology, geomorphology, biodiversity, and commercial species). The results of 87 long-term time series analysed (-512,000 observations), in the last four decades, indicate four groups of climate regime shifts: 1) A gradual shift associated with CC starting in the 1980s, with a warming of the sea surface down to 100 m depth in the bay (0.10-0.25 degrees C per decade), increase in air temperature and insolation. This warming may have impacted on benthic community redistribution in the Basque coast, favouring warm-water species relative to cold-water species. Weight at age for anchovy and sardine decreased in the last two decades. 2) Deepening of the winter mixed layer depth in the south-eastern bay that probably led to increases in nutrients, surface oxygen, and chlorophyll concentration. Current increases on chlorophyll and zooplankton (i.e., copepods) biomass are contrary to those expected under CC scenarios in the region. 3) Sea-level rise (1.5-3.5 cm per decade since 1990s), associated with CC. 4) Increase of extreme wave height events of 16.8 cm per decade in the south-eastern bay, probably related to stormy conditions in the last decade, with impacts on beach erosion.

AB  - This work presents an assessment of the chemico-physical and microbial quality of water samples from hand-dug wells in the shallow aquifer of three communities neighbouring the University of Cape Coast, Ghana. Sanitary risk inspection was undertaken at each well location and the physical parameters including electrical conductivity, pH, Dissolved Oxygen (DO) and etc. were measured in situ via probes. Microbial groundwater quality was analysed using membrane filtration method. Samples of water were analysed for the pollution indicator anions including chloride and nitrate. In addition, the possible persistence of bacteria in groundwater environments in the absence of predator organisms were studied and results fitted with exponential, second-order polynomial and linear distribution models.
   Sanitary risk inspection and microbial quality results indicate that all the wells were at risk and polluted with total coliforms from on-site sanitation. Twenty-five percent (7 out of 28) of the wells recorded DO concentration within acceptable limits of drinking water standards (> 5 mg/L). Average chloride concentration, 360.5 mg/L (range: 46 mg/L to 844 mg/L) and average electrical conductivity value of 1.5 mS/cm (range: 213 mu S/cm to 2.7 mS/cm) were both higher than WHO recommended limits. Acidic conditions (pH < 6.5) were observed in water samples, indicating mineralisation of the aquifer. The high EC values and chloride content in groundwater were attributable to dry atmospheric aerosol deposition and possible mineral dissolution in the aquifer. Bacteria regrowth experiment results indicate that second-order polynomial distribution best describes bacteria inactivation rates in the absence of antagonist predators in our work. Extrapolation of time for complete inactivation of bacteria under groundwater environment ranged from 0.1 to 4 years indicating bacteria can persist in aquifers for long period of time. It was concluded that all the wells are at risk of pollution and polluted with faecal matter and atmospheric aerosols.

AB  - Degradation trend estimation (DTE) of rotating machinery plays a vital role in prognostics and health management (PHM). It enables us to foresee future conditions and avoid unexpected risks. Recently, considerable accomplishments in the field of rotating machinery PHM has achieved through regression analysis based data-driven prognostics, which assist in directly analyzing and exploring the relationships between degradation trend and characterization indicators. Internal static structures still widely exist in most of them, inevitably restricting the natural extrapolation or generalization to future moments. Thus, the autoregression theories with complete mathematical foundations are first introduced and extended the methodologies for rotating machinery DTE. Meanwhile, the characterization ability of degradation or damage information from a single indicator rather than multi-endogenous indicators considering their causality and interactions may significantly reduce in the existing regression analysis based prognostics, and it further influences the final prognostics. Therefore, the idea of exploring internal dynamic structural regression based prognostics containing establishing multi-endogenous degradation indicators with weak-stationary traits and an interpretable and lightweight vector autoregression based DTE modeling method is motivated. The above dilemmas are well addressed through the in-depth study of autoregression based prognostics, namely stationary subspaces-vector autoregressive with exogenous terms (SSVARX). To be specific, multi-channel vibration signals are first picked up, and non-stationary signals are converted into time and frequency domain based weak-stationary degradation indicators via double stationary subspace decomposition and differential operation. Then the above two domain endogenous variables are feed into our proposed DTE models after stationarity test, order determination, and impulse response analysis. Finally, promising results from two run-to-failed life tests of rolling and slewing bearings are obtained via our multi-endogenous variables based extrapolation model. Compared with existing prediction methodologies, SSVARX of this study achieves not only high-accurate prediction results but also fast-computing speed and reasonable mathematical supports.

AB  - The pivotal role of amphibians in food webs and their value as indicators of disequilibrium in ecosystem health have long been recognized by wildlife biologists. However, massive pathogen-induced declines in global amphibian populations reported during the last 30 years served to alert the scientific community that knowledge of amphibian disease ecology, including parasitic and vector-borne conditions, was and remains incipient. Herein, we report the detection of a Rickettsia bacterium infecting larvae of the argasid tick Ornithodoros faccinii, collected from the toad Rhinella ornata, in Southeastern Brazil. Fragments of the genes 16S rDNA, gltA, htrA, sca1, sca4, and ompB were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but the sequence encoding the ompA antigen was not detected. Nucleotide sequencing and multi-locus (gltA, htrA, sca1, and sca4) phylogenetic analyses characterized the bacterium, designated Rickettsia sp. strain Itingu??, as a novel member of the spotted fever group (SFG) of the Rickettsia, closely related to the Rickettsia massiliae and to a lesser extent the Rickettsia helvetica subgroups. The apparent absence of the ompA protein together with limited levels of nucleotide (90.5 %) and amino acid (82?83 %) sequence identity, relative to the ompB gene of other species in the R. massiliae subgroup, were unusual features that may reflect adaptation to selective pressures exerted by the tick and/or amphibian immune systems. The ompB sequence was exploited to develop a low-cost method for differential identification of Rickettsia sp. strain Itingu??, based on restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of amplicons (PCR-RFLP). The characterization of this novel bacterium provided an unprecedented record of infection by an SFG Rickettsia in a member of the family Argasidae infesting a cold-blooded animal and raised the number of tick-associated Rickettsia reported in Brazil to sixteen. Moreover, it highlighted the value of and the requirement for continued and extended surveillance of wildlife as potential sources of emerging tick-borne pathogens.

AB  - Qualities of the light environment, such as the spectral composition of light, have been shown to impact growth and performance of broiler chickens. UVA light is visible to broiler chickens, whereas UVB wavelengths promote endogenous vitamin D synthesis, which could support their rapid development. The aim of the current study was to investigate the impacts of supplementary UVA and UVB wavelengths on performance indicators of broiler chickens.
   Day-old Ross 308 chicks (n 5 638), reared to a target stocking density of 33 kg/m(2), were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 lighting treatments: A) White light emitting diode (LED) and supplementary UVA LED lighting (18-h photoperiod); B) White LED with supplementary UVA and UVB fluorescent lighting providing 30 mW/cm(2) UVB at bird level (lights on for 8 h of the total photoperiod to avoid overexposure of UVB); and C) White LED control group, representative of farm conditions (18-h photoperiod).
   Mortality was recorded, and broiler chickens were individually weighed at 8, 15, 22, 27, and 34 D of age. Generalized linear models and nonlinear mixed effects models (Gompertz curve) were fitted to determine the effects of UV wavelengths on broiler mortality and growth performance.
   UV did not impact breast or leg weight of broiler chickens but was associated with differences in mortality, growth, and end weight. Broiler chickens provided with UVA for the full 18-h photoperiod had slower initial growth than control broilers and a reduction in mortality. Results from male broilers reared with supplementary UVA + UVB for 8 h indicated they could reach finishing weights sooner than controls, which supports the potential for UVA + B to improve the growth performance of males.
   Results suggest that the provision of supplementary UVA + UVB wavelengths may improve the performance of male broiler chickens. The reduction in mortality in the UVA only treatment may warrant further investigation. The inclusion of UV wavelengths within poultry lighting regimes represents a promising area of further study.

AB  - The sediment dynamics and the long-term evolution of intertidal environments depend on the erosion threshold, which is often increased by microbial biofilms. Intertidal biostabilization has been well studied in temperate and subtropical environments, but little is known for subarctic conditions with strong seasonal changes in vegetation cover and sea ice presence in winter because of the difficulty in studying the sediments under ice cover. The present project investigated the role of biofilms and their seasonal as well as spatial variations for sediment biostabilization in a subarctic intertidal area near Rimouski (Quebec, Canada). Grain size distribution reflected a seaward increasing trend in sand content and mean grain size. The poor sorting of sediments results from the contribution of sediment transport by ice rafting in addition to the hydrodynamic transport processes in this subarctic intertidal area. A Cohesive Strength Meter (CSM) was used to measure the erosion threshold (tau(crit)) across the entire intertidal area. Chlorophyll a (Chl a) and extra polymeric substances (EPS) were measured in the top 3 mm. The high marsh had a far higher tau(crit) than the low marsh, but there was much less variation between low marsh, mudflat and sandflat. tau(crit )was significantly correlated with Chl a, elevation, and organic matter content. EPS was not a good indicator for tau(crit), except for the low marsh/high marsh difference. The results showed a seasonal cycle in intertidal bed emdibility. Lower intertidal areas had highest tau(crit) in autumn during the storm season, followed by lowest tau(crit) in winter under sea-ice cover, and no major difference between summer and spring. This study highlights the characteristics of cold climate intertidal areas, where low temperatures in autumn and land-fast ice cover during winter severely affect biofilms and intertidal vegetation, and ultimately their capacity to shield sediments from erosion.

AB  - Behavioral development in domestic dogs has been investigated for predicting suitability for service dog work or for matching with the "right" families as well as for identifying predispositions to behavioral problems. Findings from the scientific literature seem to confirm that conducting behavioral tests at 7 weeks of age is too early to reliably predict the temperament and personality of a dog. However, this period for domestic dogs is sensitive for early life learning and conditions during this time could have important consequences in adulthood. The aims of this study were to evaluate inter-rater reliability of a simple standardized test and to investigate which factors influence the behavioral reaction of puppies. 105 seven-week old puppies were exposed to five subtests: social attraction, following, retrieving, sudden appearance, noise. During each task, the behaviour of each pup was scored on a 3-5 point scale that reflected the suitability of the pup's reaction to the task. Scores were evaluated for a single subtest and for two aggregate indicators (i.e.response to a person: social attraction subtest and following subtest andresponse to object and noise: retrieving subtest, sudden appearance subtest and noise subtest). Three assessors independently scored the dogs' reactions for each task. Inter-rater reliability of the three assessors were analyzed with Fleiss' Kappa and Kendall's coefficient, which showed a high inter-rater reliability in 4 of 5 tasks. The ordered logistic regression was carried out to obtain a proportional odds model that was used to model the relationship between sex, litter size, stimulating environment, parity of mother, adequate maternal behavior and high scores. Litter size and maternal parity were associated with test performance inresponse to a person. The variance of effect of litter was high inresponse to object and noise. Taken together, our results suggest that using this scoring system there is sufficient inter-rater reliability in the test and litter size and mother experience influences task performances related to dog-human interaction.

AB  - Transition metal catalysis has been advocated as a critical mechanism for natural gas generation. But its presence and significance in geological settings have long been debated due to conflicting results of laboratory experiments and the lack of reliable field indicator. In this study, a low rank coal sample from the Shahezi Formation of the Songliao Basin was subjected to nonhydrous pyrolysis with and without transition metal. The chemical and isotopic compositions of gaseous products in experiments were analyzed to investigate the mechanism and potential indicator of transition metal catalysis in sedimentary basins. The chemical and carbon isotopic compositions of hydrocarbon gases generated in pyrolysis experiments revealed that transition metal could catalyze both decomposition of organic matters and methane synthesis such as Fischer-Tropsch Type reactions during maturation of source rocks under experimental conditions resembling geological settings. Catalytic methane has uniform delta D values unrelated to source rock maturity, which is helpful in identification of catalytic natural gases in sedimentary basins. Transition metal catalysis is probably not a common mechanism for natural gas generation in sedimentary basins due to the positive correlation between delta D-CH4 of natural gases and maturities of source rocks observed in most natural cases. However, transition metal catalysis could well interpret the restricted range of delta D-CH4 and carbon isotopic reversal phenomenon of natural gases in the Yingcheng Formation of the Xujiaweizi fault-depression whose origin has long been debated. So we inferred that the transition metal catalysis may have occurred in deep strata of the Xujiaweizi fault-depression and played a significant role in natural gas generation. Our study revealed that restricted range of delta D-CH4 of natural gases with different maturities may serve as an effective indicator of transition metal catalysis in sedimentary basins. It provides a new perspective to investigate the significance and universality of transition metal catalysis in different geological settings.

AB  - Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), one of the most common brominated flame retardants, has been associated with immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and reproductive toxicity. However, little attention has been focused on understanding the trans-generational effects of TBBPA. The present study used the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) animal model to evaluate the trans-generational effects of neurotoxicity induced by environmentally relevant concentrations of TBBPA (0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 mu g/L). Multiple indicators including physiological effects (body length, brood size, head thrashes, body bends, and crawling trajectory), degree of neuronal damage (dopamine, GABAergic, and glutamatergic neurons), oxidative stress-related biochemical indicators (superoxide dismutase [SOD] activity, catalase [CAT] enzyme, malondialdehyde [MDA] production, and reactive oxygen species [ROS] accumulation), and stress-related gene expressions have been evaluated in the exposed parental C. elegans generation (G(1)) and their progeny (G(2)) under TBBPA-free conditions. The results showed that TBBPA exposure induced adverse effects on physiological endpoints, among which body bends and head thrashes were the most sensitive ones, detected above 1 mu g/L in G(1) and 100 mu g/L in G(2) nematodes, respectively. After contaminant exposure, the three neurons revealed damage related to neurobehavioral endpoints, with no hereditary effects in the progeny. The oxidative stress-related biochemical endpoints demonstrated that when the exposure concentrations were above 1 mu g/L in maternal worms, impairment can be detected in both generations, but the progeny recovered at low toxicity concentration (1-100 mu g/L). The integrated target gene expression profiles were clearly altered in G(1) and G(2) worms at concentrations between 1 and 1000 mu g/L, and a more significant difference existed in two generations of nematodes at low levels (1-10 mu g/L) of TBBPA. Studing trans-generational neurotoxicity and the underlying mechanism can generate a precise evaluation of the environmental risk of TBBPA. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examines whether agroecological farming practices, when employed by highly vulnerable households in sub-Saharan Africa, can improve food security and dietary diversity. The research involved a four-year study with 425 smallholder households, selected purposively based on high levels of food insecurity and/or positive HIV status. The households carried out agroecological experiments of their own choosing over a four-year period. Baseline (n = 306) and follow-up (n = 352) surveys were conducted in 2011 and 2013 respectively to assess changes in farming practices, food security, crop diversity and dietary diversity. Longitudinal mixed effects models were used with 203 matched households to estimate determinants of change in food security and dietary diversity at the population level. Qualitative interviews and focus groups were also conducted to provide depth to the survey findings. The findings show that participatory agroecology experimentation increased intercropping, legume diversification and the addition of compost, manure and crop residue amendments to the soil. Intercropping was associated with food security and the use of organic soil amendments was associated with gains in dietary diversity in bivariate analysis. Household food security and dietary diversity increased significantly over a 2-year period. Importantly, multivariate models showed that spousal discussion about farming was strongly associated with increased household food security and dietary diversity. Households who discussed farming with their spouse were 2.4 times more likely to be food secure and have diverse diets. Addition of compost or manure to the soil significantly influenced dietary diversity. These findings indicate that poor, vulnerable farmers can use agroecological methods to effectively improve food and nutritional security in sub-Saharan Africa. The study also highlights how linking agroecology to participatory research approaches that promote farmer experimentation and gender equity also lead to greater health and well-being. The study sheds light on how agroecological approaches can rapidly improve food security and dietary diversity, even under conditions of acute social, health or ecological stress. It draws attention to issues of equity and farmer-led approaches in addressing food security and nutrition.

AB  - Over the past 30 years concerted campaigns have been undertaken to reverse nutrient-driven eutrophication in coastal waters in Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia. Typically, eutrophication abatement has proven a more recalcitrant challenge than anticipated, with ecosystem improvements only recently beginning to emerge or falling short of goals. Reduction in nutrient loads has come mainly from advanced treatment of wastewaters and has lagged targets set for diffuse agricultural sources. Synthesis of the major campaigns-varying in terms of physical settings, ecosystem characteristics, nutrient sources, socio-economic drivers, and governance-identified barriers inhibiting eutrophication abatement and potential bridges to overcome them. Actionable science can be advanced by: application of the well-established and emerging knowledge and experience around the globe, client-responsive strategic research, and timely and conclusive adjudication of scientific controversies. More accountable governance requires: enduring engagement of high-level officials of the responsible governments; effective communication of the causes, risks and benefits to the public and stakeholders; quantitative and accountable allocation of responsibility for nutrient load reductions; and binding requirements, as opposed to simply voluntary actions. Effective reduction in nutrient loads requires: reduction strategies for both nitrogen and phosphorus; inclusion of actions that reduce atmospheric emissions of nitrogen in addition to direct inputs to waterways; efficacious regulations; public subsidies based on performance; limitations on biofuel production that increases nutrient loads; and enhancing the sinks and losses for legacy nutrients retained in soils and groundwater. Outcomes must be measured and strategies appropriately adjusted through: sustained monitoring of essential indicators and processes, the use of multiple models, truly adaptive management, and cautious interventions within the coastal ecosystem. The changing climate must be taken into account by reassessing achievable future conditions and seeking alternatives for mitigating and adapting to climate change that also reduce nutrient loads.

AB  - Up to the latest versions of the German renewable energy act (EEG), there had been a constant growth of new biogas plants (BGPs). After reaching a stagnation in the last years, today the focus has shifted to improving the existing BGPs. Assuming that most plants have not reached the technical end of life, the question arises on how an operation can be realized beyond the initial EEG support period of 20 years. In addition, new legal and economic conditions require the implementation of adjustments, that is, "repowering measures." Based on a method review, a plant-specific model approach is presented to assess repowering measures for a wide range of BGPs differing in capacity, substrate mixture and agricultural structures. The techno-economic model includes different performance indicators like levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and temporal aspects like technical progress. Using a data set for BGPs in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg (Germany), results are illustrated for the different model modules and three repowering scenarios of an extended operation period of ten years. The scenarios regard different options to meet the requirements of the current EEG, namely the flexibilization and restrictions on energy crops, in comparison with a reference case. While in repowering scenarios, the number of plants decreases between 54% and 69% and the overall power capacity changes between -48% and 13% until 2035. The results further show a reduction potential in the specific area demand and GHG emission up to 12% and 24%, respectively. Technical progress, additional revenues and capacity premiums are shown to be an important factor for efficient substrate utilization, low LCOE and thereby the enabling of an extended operation period. The scenario results indicate that the agricultural areas for energy crop cultivation and the amount of manure used in BGPs will be reduced considerably, inducing new chances and challenges in the future.

AB  - Worldwide timely prevention is one of the main tasks in the fight against anemia. Therefore, the development and introduction of new iron preparations does not lose importance in order to provide the pharmaceutical market with anti-anamnetics. One of the promising approaches to the development of such drugs may be the creation of highly stable iron compounds. In this context, one of the promising groups of the compounds of the iron is the so-called clathohelasts, or macrobicyclic complexes. The article presents the parameters of acute toxicity of iron (IV) clathrochelate complexes in laboratory animals. Experimental studies were conducted under the conditions of vivarium and the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of the National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine. The indicative experiment was conducted in order to obtain primary information about the range of doses that are close to the average fatal indicator. Then 7 groups of 6 white mice-males in each were formed based on the principle of analogues. Having conducted the indicative experiment in order to obtain primary information about the range of doses that are close to the average fatal indicator, 7 groups of 6 white mice-males in each were formed based on the principle of analogues. Single intravenous solution of iron (IV) clathrochelate complexes was administered to the animals of the experimental groups and they were observed during 14 days. The features of behavior, intake of food and water were noticed, symptoms of intoxication and death of animals were recorded. As a result of the studies, it was found that the average mortality dose of the test substance for internal administration to white mise is 1258.3 +/- 144.87 mg/kg body weight. According to the classification of chemicals by the degree of danger (GOST 12.1.007-76), of iron (IV) clathrochelate complexes corresponds to the third class of hazard, and according to the classification of substances for toxicity it belong to class IV and as for its toxicity it is "low toxic substances".

AB  - Depositional models that use heterogeneity in mud-dominated successions to distinguish and diagnose environments within the offshore realm are still in their infancy, despite significant recent advances in understanding the complex and dynamic processes of mud deposition. Six cored intervals of the main body of the Mancos Shale, the lower Blue Gate Member, Uinta Basin, were examined sedimentologically, stratigraphically and geochemically in order to evaluate facies heterogeneity and depositional mechanisms. Unique sedimentological and geochemical features are used to identify three offshore environments of deposition: the prodelta, the mudbelt and the sediment-starved shelf. Prodelta deposits consist of interlaminated siltstone and sandstone and exhibit variable and stressed trace fossil assemblages, and indicators of high sedimentation rates. The prodelta was dominated by river-fed hyperpycnal flow. Mudbelt deposits consist of interlaminated siltstone and sandstone and are characterized by higher bioturbation indices and more diverse trace fossil assemblages. Ripples, scours, truncations and normally graded laminations are abundant in prodelta and mudbelt deposits indicating dynamic current conditions. Mudbelt sediment dispersal was achieved by both combined flow above storm wave base and current-enhanced and wave-enhanced sediment gravity flows below storm wave base. Sediment-starved shelf deposits are dominantly siltstone to clay-stone with the highest calcite and organic content. Bioturbation is limited to absent. Sediment-starved shelf deposits were the result of a combination of shel-fal currents and hypopycnal settling of sediment. Despite representing the smallest volume, sediment-starved shelf deposits are the most prospective for shale hydrocarbon resource development, due to elevated organic and carbonate content. Sediment-starved shelf deposits are found in either retrogradational to aggradational parasequence sets or early distal aggradational to progradational parasequence sets, bounding the maximum flooding surface. An improved framework classification of offshore mudstone depositional processes based on diagnostic sedimentary criteria advances our predictive ability in complex and dynamic mud-dominated environments and informs resource prospectivity.

TI  - Universal Linear Fit Identification: A Method Independent of Data, Outliers and Noise Distribution Model and Free of Missing or Removed Data Imputation
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - REGRESSION-ANALYSIS
KW  - IMPACT
AB  - Data processing requires a robust linear fit identification method. In this paper, we introduce a non-parametric robust linear fit identification method for time series. The method uses an indicator 2/n to identify linear fit, where n is number of terms in a series. The ratio R-max of a(max) - a(min) and S-n - a(min)*n and that of R-min of a(max) - a(min) and a(max)*n - S-n are always equal to 2/n, where a(max) is the maximum element, a(min) is the minimum element and S-n is the sum of all elements. If any series expected to follow y = c consists of data that do not agree with y = c form, R-max > 2/n and R-min > 2/n imply that the maximum and minimum elements, respectively, do not agree with linear fit. We define threshold values for outliers and noise detection as 2/n* (1 + k(1)) and 2/n * (1 + k(2)), respectively, where k(1) > k(2) and 0 <= k(1) <= n/2 - 1. Given this relation and transformation technique, which transforms data into the form y = c, we show that removing all data that do not agree with linear fit is possible. Furthermore, the method is independent of the number of data points, missing data, removed data points and nature of distribution (Gaussian or non-Gaussian) of outliers, noise and clean data. These are major advantages over the existing linear fit methods. Since having a perfect linear relation between two variables in the real world is impossible, we used artificial data sets with extreme conditions to verify the method. The method detects the correct linear fit when the percentage of data agreeing with linear fit is less than 50%, and the deviation of data that do not agree with linear fit is very small, of the order of +/-10(-4)%. The method results in incorrect detections only when numerical accuracy is insufficient in the calculation process.

AB  - The temporal evolution of simple landforms such as cinder cones by nonlinear diffusive processes is studied through the use of a new 2D numerical model using well-established and accurate numerical mathematics and high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs). Extending 1D (profile) nonlinear diffusion analyses used in cinder cone, hillslope and fault scarp evolution studies, we have implemented a 2D numerical model with a spatially and temporally varying sediment transport rate coefficient scaled nonlinearly by the ratio of local slope to critical slope. The high accuracy and efficient numerical implementation are documented in the paper and the MATLAB toolkit developed is used to solve for the developmentof an initial 2D cone form. First, we examine the nonlinear transport rule and suggest a refinement that accounts explicitly for flux at threshold slopes. We find that the maximum diffusion (necessarily introduced in the numerical model to avoid infinite rates) at the critical slope controls the final morphology, especially approaching steady state. Secondly, solving the landscape evolution problem in 2D enables a natural accounting for sediment flux convergence or divergence in the profile. Thirdly, the boundary behavior of a given landscape element controls much of what happens in that domain and so we allow for arbitrary flux magnitude or elevation boundary conditions. Fourthly, landscapes are heterogeneous in their surface cover and so we allow for spatially and temporally varying transport rate k and we permit an arbitrary vertical displacement field within the model domain. To test the new formulation for the nonlinear term, the effect of variable diffusivity k and the numerical schemes implemented, we apply the model to cinder cones built on the flanks of Mount Etna in 2001 and 2002-2003. We explore the effects of DEM resolution with data from the 2001 cone and the utility of spatially variable diffusivity to explain the variation in erosion measured by differencing repeat light detection and ranging (LIDAR) surveys gathered in 2004 and 2007 over the 2002-2003 cone complex.

AB  - Although person-to-person transmission is the most likely route for healthcare associated infections, the role of the environment should not be ignored and may also contribute to the spread of nosocomial infections. It has been proven that microorganisms are able to survive on environmental surfaces up to several weeks, therefore providing a potential for biotransfer. Assessment of environmental cleanliness is mainly conducted by surface sampling and swabbing followed by classical incubation methods based on phenotypic detection of microorganisms which take between 2 to 4 days. Novel quick methods based on DNA detection using PCR methods is a possibility for quick detection of the presence of DNA. In the present study, we investigated the presence of the following challenge microorganisms: Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans on metal and glass surface after 24 hour drying using classical incubation methods and PCR methods. We detected all challenge microorganisms at initial concentrations as low as 10(2) cfu/mL and final concentration after drying at 30 cfu/mL. PCR methods proved to be equal or more sensitive compared to classical incubation methods for all challenge microorganisms. A new PCR run was conducted where all challenge microorganisms were simultaneously detected in one run under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94 degrees C for 15 min; followed by 38 cycles of amplification (1 min denaturation at 94 degrees C; 1 min annealing at 53 degrees C; 1 min extension at 72 degrees C) and final extension at 72 degrees C for 10 min. Significance and impact: In this study we developed a unified parallel PCR method that enables simultaneous detection of all challenge microorganisms within a few hours at concentrations as low as 30 cfu/mL and can be used as a tool for quick evaluation of the cleanliness of surfaces.

AB  - Biodiesel fuel has become more attractive recently because of its environmental benefits and the fact that it is a product made from renewable resources. However the less favorable cold flow properties or the low temperature operability of biodiesel fuel compared to conventional diesel is a major drawback limiting its use. The poor flow properties of biodiesel at cold temperatures are mainly due to biodiesel fuel being composed of long-chain fatty acids with an alcohol molecule attached. If the double bond of unsaturated fatty acids in these long-chain fatty acids could be ruptured selectively, then the cold flow properties of biodiesel fuel would be enhanced by reducing its viscosity.
   In this study, the selective hydrothermal oxidation of oleic acid, as a model compound of unsaturated high molecular weight carboxylic acids, was studied experimentally. The objective was to use this as a model to investigate whether the double bond of unsaturated fatty acids can be ruptured selectively by partial hydrothermal oxidation. Demonstration of this method could then be used to show the potential to improve the cold flow properties of biodiesel. Results showed that the amount of mono-carboxylic acids, aldehyde, di-carboxylic acids, and aldehyde-acids with a carbon number of 9 was significantly higher than other oxidative products. This suggests that the oxidative cleavage may principally occur at the double bond in hydrothermal conditions. The cloud and pour points for biodiesel fuel (B100) and B100 blend with a mixture of methyl esters or acetals were measured. These are the most important indicators for the cold flow properties of biodiesel fuel. The methyl esters or acetals used were made from the esterification of carboxylic acids or aldehydes by simulating the major oxidation products. These were obtained from the hydrothermal oxidation of oleic acid at different oxygen supply rates. Results showed that the cloud and pour points of the blend were significantly enhanced compared to those of B100. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Glendonites, calcite pseudomorphs after ikaite (CaCO3 center dot 6H(2)O), feature prominently in fine-grained, glacially influenced Permian marine strata of eastern Australia, which accumulated in a series of extensional basins that occupied polar to temperate latitudes along the southeastern margin of Gondwana. Because ikaite formation in the marine environment requires near-freezing temperatures, high alkalinity, and elevated concentrations of orthophosphate, the presence of glendonites in ancient strata implies a particular array of paleoenvironmental conditions. A petrographic and geochemical study was carried out to assess the veracity of isotopic data from glendonites as proxy indicators of ancient ocean chemistry, sea-floor temperature, and diagenesis. In thin section, glendonites consist of inclusion-zoned, equant to bladed calcite crystals, interpreted as the ikaite replacement phase, enclosed in a matrix of calcite and minor chalcedony and pyrite cements. Carbon and oxygen isotope data show a negative covariance, with delta O-18 values ranging from -22.5 to +0.3%omicron and delta C-13 values from -27.7 to -4.5%omicron V-PDB. Of the calcite phases examined, the ikaite replacement phase is the most enriched in O-18 and most depleted in C-13; enclosing cements ossess lower delta O-18 and higher delta C-13 values and are interpreted to have formed during later stages of burial diagenesis. The delta O-18 values of the ikaite replacement phase do not correspond to formation with Permian seawater at near-freezing temperatures unless isotopic disequilibrium is assumed. The delta C-13 values are similar to the carbon isotope composition of bulk organic matter in the host sediment, and suggest that the alkalinity and orthophosphate necessary for ikaite stability were generated in the zone of suboxic to anoxic diagenesis. Results indicate that although delta O-18 and delta C-13 values from glendonites are useful for understanding early to late diagenetic processes, they are not ideal proxies for seawater chemistry and temperature.

AB  - Surface water impairments for pathogens are a major problem in waterways throughout the United States, especially in New Jersey. Fecal coliform (FC) counts are commonly used as an indicator of pathogens. In this study, bioretention systems, which are stormwater best management practices, were modeled with columns. Unlike traditional detention basins, bioretention systems are meant to manage water quality in addition to quantity and peak flow rates. Typical rainfall conditions for New Jersey were mimicked in the laboratory with regard to rainfall intensity and stormwater composition (bacterial colony counts) using a diluted manure slurry. The applied influent flow rate was 77. 0 mL/min, while the average leachate flow rate observed in the bottom spout was 20.8 mL/min. The hydraulic performance of the columns was adequate in that the influent completely infiltrated well before the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) performance standard of 72 h. However, ponding of more than 30.5 cm (the NJDEP performance standard for ponding) was observed in some of the simulations. The mean, median, and range of reduction coefficients for fecal coliform (FC) were 91.6%, 98.6%, and 54.5% to 99.8%, respectively, for 13 simulations. The mean, median, and range of reduction coefficients for total suspended solids (TSS) were 91.5%, 91.9%, and 81. 0% to 99.4%, respectively, for 15 simulations. The average pH of the influent water was 6.87, while the average leachate pH was 4.61. It is likely that both adsorption and filtration were responsible for the FC and TSS reductions. Die-off factors that may have influenced FC reduction in addition to adsorption and filtration are discussed. Reduction coefficients were observed to not necessarily be the ultimate indicator of system performance or effectiveness, as they are conditional upon the leachate concentration.

AB  - Pot experiments with natural soils of different base cation and aluminum saturation were established under controlled conditions in a greenhouse, in order to analyze growth and nutrition of young ash and sycamore as dependent on the chemical soil status. The trials investigated the hypotheses, that ash and sycamore on acid soils suffered from (i) Ca and Mg deficiency, (ii) Al antagonism and/or (iii) Al toxicity. All treatments received sufficient amounts of N, P, K and water.
   In all substrates containing at least 25% of a loamy soil derived from basalt with high Ca and Mg, but low Al saturation, the growth and mineral nutrition of ash and sycamore were excellent. On a sandy substrate derived from tertiary sediments and very low in Ca, Mg and Al both tree species showed reductions in shoot and root growth. Ca and Mg deficiency occurred in ash and Mg deficiency in sycamore, caused by the insufficient Mg (and Ca) supply from the soil. Al toxicity and Al antagonism could be excluded in this treatment because of the low Al concentrations in the soil solution.
   On a loamy soil derived from phyllite very low in Ca and Mg, but high in Al, the shoot and root growth of sycamore were even more inhibited than on sand, and in addition to Mg deficiency, Ca deficiency was observed with this species. Given the high Al concentrations in the soil solution, an inhibition of the Ca and Mg uptake by Al antagonism is assumed. In the same substrate, ash also suffered from Ca and Mg deficiency and exhibited dwarfish shoot and root growth. Specific morphological root damage, considerable Al accumulation within the root tissues and P deficiency occurred and about 80% of the ash died in this treatment at the end of the second growing season. All these features, including the high Al concentration in the soil solution, point towards Al toxicity with this species. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Reproductive information from Semi-giant, Chinchilla, California and New Zealand White breeds was used with a total of 51474 matings and 32 957 kindlings from 1989 to 1997 in a genetic unit to study productive indicators and the influence of environmental effects on each breed and on the population. The traits were: a) Fertility (%), b) Birth traits: total and born alive, still births (SB), c) Weaning traits (WT): mortality at weaning, percentage of the litter weaned and number of weaned per litter, d) Traits of weighed litters: weaned per weaning, litter weight (LW) and average individual weight (AM). Four variance analyses per fixed effects linear model were applied to each trait. The GLM model of SAS was used (1996). The following models were grouped, model 1: kindling month (KM), year (KY) and number (KN) (1-9 or more), model 2: consecutive period (CP) of the kindling month and KN, model 3: breed, KY, KN and regressions in KM, model 4: breed, KY, KM, KY x KM and regression in KN. Models 1 and 2 were made according to breed and 3 and 4 for the whole population of breeds with linear, quadratic and cubic regressions. The effects of KM, KY and CP were significant for all traits and breeds. KN was significant for most of the traits, except SB, in all breeds and for till other birth traits in Chinchilla and California. New Zealand was the most promising breed according to fertility and LW. The Cuban California breed showed low prolificacy. The curves showing better fit for the month effect were quadratic or cubic, except for AIW that was linear. The quadratic curves were adjusted for the parity effect in most of the weaning traits. The limited productivity of the breeds in this system was proven in weaning performance. This was caused by high mortality indices; especially in the summer, being noteworthy in the New Zealand breed. This evidence of environmental effects on all breeds is of interest to improve animal husbandry and system management and to obtain equations that predict productivity under mixed feeding conditions.

AB  - The great majority of activated sludge bacteria exist incorporated in flocs. The increase in dispersed bacteria when exposed to increasing turbulent shear rates has been successfully modelled by a model assuming that the adhesion and erosion of cells may be considered in analogy to ordinary chemical phase transitions. By this adhesion-erosion model (AE-model), an "enthalpy" of cell adhesion can be estimated, and this value in turn determines the range of shear rates in which erosion of cells predominates. Application of the model has indicated that only a mass fraction less than ca. 6-17% may be released from activated sludge. even when exposed to a severe turbulent environment. i.e. only a small fraction of the flocs is dispersible by means of erosion by turbulence. The shear sensitivity and the dispersible floc fraction were found to depend on the floc composition. A net decrease in the flee EPS content during anaerobic sludge stabilisation causes a dramatic increase in the dispersed fraction, indicating the important role of EPS for the Roc strength. It was found also that activated sludge cells do not reflocculate completely after exposure to high shear rates. This may be an indication that the cohesion energy of bacteria growing in colonies is greater than the energy of the more stochastic adhesion of dispersed cells to flee surfaces. It could also be another indicator of the importance of entanglement forces, which do not reform instantly. once broken. When the bond strength of cell attachment to sludge surfaces is altered by changes in the chemical environment, this may cause a change in the dispersible flee fraction as well as a change in the shear range of erosion. When the shear sensitivity constant k(SS) is adopted for sludge characterisation, an increased degree of dispersion under standard test conditions will result in increased shear sensitivity estimates. The shear sensitivity may be used for the estimation of an equivalent change in the Gibb's energy of cell adhesion (Delta(DeltaG(ad)/RT)).

AB  - 1. The study of functional traits offers predictive power for community ecology. Particularly in cases where individual species are difficult to study, known properties of trait spectra, such as the leaf economics spectrum (LES), and trait-environment relationships can provide crucial generalizable information that can contribute to forecasts of distributional shifts in response to the abiotic effects of climate and land use changes.
   2. Vascular epiphytes have been proposed as indicators of environmental change, but we know little about the ecology of most species. Key functional trait assumptions are based on terrestrial plants; testing these in epiphytes verifies their universality and will inform applying functional traits in predicting epiphyte responses to climate and land use change.
   3. In this study, we use functional traits from 37 vascular epiphyte species from forests and shade coffee farms at two sites in northern Nicaragua. We compare correlations among traits and intraspecific trait variances with those of terrestrial plants and among epiphyte taxonomic groups. We also test trait responses to environmental differences between sites and land use types, and within zones of the tree.
   4. We find that epiphyte leaf traits fall towards the slower end of the LES, but with about one-third lower leaf nitrogen per change in specific leaf area (SLA) relative to terrestrial herbaceous plants. Bromeliads show less relationship between these traits than other epiphyte groups and also deviate in other trait interrelationships, suggesting unique leaf construction.
   5. Trait-environment relationships varied most strongly along vertical gradients within trees, but some traits, including SLA and carbon isotope ratio, also responded to land use and site differences.
   6. We present evidence that trait relationships established for terrestrial plants appear to translate to epiphytes, but identify some possible caveats. Strong trait response to vertical gradients within trees suggests that within-canopy shifts could provide resilience to climate and land use changes for some epiphyte species.

AB  - The pollen and diatom analyses of soil samples from a 80-cm deep sedimentary core from the Barak valley of Assam provides an explicit understanding of vegetation, climatic and ecological change in the Indo-Burma region from 580 CE (1370 cal. years BP) to 1220 CE (730 cal. years BP). The impact of the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) has been well documented from palynological records. Based on changes in vegetation succession, the Mean Annual Temperature (MAT) and Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) during four pollen phases CP (1-4) were calculated using the coexistence approach. Between 580 and 760 CE (pre-MWP), the occurrence of major riparian tree pollen taxa like Barringtonia, Duabanga and Sapotaceae along with scanty diatom occurrence indicates a warm and relatively less humid climate attributable to a weak Southwest monsoon with low seasonality. This changed to a strikingly enhanced seasonality from 760 to 940 CE (beginning of MWP), indicating the establishment of the dense forest around the lake under increased warm and humid climatic conditions. During the interval from 940 to 1220 CE (MWP peak), the average values of maximum MAT and MAP were the highest recorded (similar to 31 degrees C and similar to 2250 mm, respectively). From 1220 CE onwards (post MWP), the decline in arboreal pollen coincides with an exponential rise in cereal pollen clumps and shrubby pollen like Melastoma, Clerodendrum and Justicia adhatoda along with the presence of anthropogenic indicator diatom taxa like Ulnaria ulna and Gomphonema indicating increased landscape changes due to human impact under a relatively less warm and humid climate. In many parts of the world, regional data coverage pertinent to the MCA warming has now reached a point which allows compiling palaeoclimate maps for well-defined time intervals. In this direction, future studies need to address the major climatic data gaps from the Indian sub-continent especially during the last millennia.

AB  - Since 2013, a high incidence of bilateral symmetrical alopecia has been observed in free-ranging Formosan macaques (Macaca cyclopis) in Mt. Longevity, Taiwan. We hypothesized that stress induces alopecia in this population. To verify our hypothesis, we evaluated the histopathological characteristics of skin biopsy and used a validated enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) analysis, which act as an indicator of stress experienced by the individual. Follicular densities were lower (2.1-3.0 mm(2)) in individuals with symmetrical alopecia than in those with normal hair conditions (4.7 mm(2)). Furthermore, anagen to catagen/telogen ratios were lower in individuals with alopecia (0-1.4) than in those with normal hair (4.0). The histopathological characteristics of alopecia were similar to those of telogen effluvium, which indicates that stress is one of the possible etiologies. On the basis of the analytical and biological validation of EIAs for FGM analysis, 11 beta -hydroxyetiocholanolone was considered suitable for monitoring adrenocortical activity in both sexes of Formosan macaques. The mean concentrations (standard error; sample size) of 11 beta -hydroxyetiocholanolone were 2.02 (0.17; n=10) and 1.41 (0.10; n=31) mu g/g for individuals with and without alopecia, respectively. Furthermore, the results of logistic regression analysis show that 11 beta -hydroxyetiocholanolone (p=0.012) concentration was positively associated with alopecia. Thus, stress was the most likely to trigger symmetrical alopecia in Formosan macaques in Mt. Longevity. Although stress can decrease the fitness of an individual, considering the population status of Formosan macaques in Taiwan is stable and alopecia was only observed in our study area, which is isolated from other populations, the impact on the total population of Formosan macaque in Taiwan is limited. Nonetheless, stress-induced immunosuppression and alopecia might affect the local abundance and increase zoonosis risk due to frequent human-macaque contact in Mt. Longevity. Future studies are suggested to focus on the causative factor of stress and the effects of stress and alopecia on the health and welfare in the Formosan macaques.

AB  - Structural-physiological factors affect the accurate estimation of vegetation gross primary production (GPP) under various types of environmental stress. Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), which is directly linked to photosynthesis, has been effectively used to estimate and monitor GPP. However, understanding of the physiological mechanism linking SIF to GPP under stress remains limited. In this article, the link between SIF and GPP at diurnal and seasonal timescales was explored for a maize field and its response to drought stress (as defined by the crop water stress index, CWSI) using three-years of continuous tower-based measurements was investigated. The results show that the ratio of GPP to SIF decreased with increasing drought stress levels, and the canopy stomata conductance (Gs) declined synchronously. Compared to two canopy structural factors (NDVI and NIRv), both the Pearson and partial correlation coefficients for the relationship between Gs and the ratio of GPP to the total SIF was higher (0.38, p < 0.01 and 0.32, p < 0.01 with photosynthetically active radiation as the control variable, respectively). We also found that Phi(F) tracked the changes in LUE well under drought conditions (CWSI > 0.6), which demonstrated that SIF can be a powerful parameter for estimating GPP under drought stress. However, there was a smaller drop in Phi(F) under drought stress (slope = -0.002) compared to the slope for the relationship between LUE and CWSI (-0.08). The response of light reactions to drought stress may be muted compared to the stomatal response. These findings confirm that the Gs is sensitive to drought and is important for the SIF-based GPP estimation model. It also provides reliable evidence that SIF data include a large amount of physiological information and can serve as a potential indicator for detecting drought and estimating GPP.

AB  - The Mekong River is one of the world's largest rivers and has an annual captured fish production of about 2.3 million tonnes, equivalent to around 11 billion USD. Although the Mekong provides important ecological and socioeconomic benefits to millions of people, it is facing intensive change due to anthropogenic stressors. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the changes to the spatiotemporal fish communities to inform sustainable fisheries management. Here, we aimed to characterize patterns of the fish communities and identify the ecological status of each fish community using daily catch data from 2007 to 2018 at 25 monitoring sites in the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB). The collected data were classified by a self-organizing map into four main groups. Group 4 represented the lower Vietnam Mekong Delta (VMD), while groups 1, 2, and 3 were subdivided into subgroups 1a (upper LMB), 1b (upper and middle LMB), 2a (Mekong River below the Khone Falls and Sesan River), 2b (Mekong River below the Khone Falls and Sekong, Sesan and Srepok (3S) Rivers), 3a (Floodplain-Tonle Sap and Songkhram) and 3b (upper VMD). Among the 571 species recorded, 119 were identified as indicator species. Based on the abundance and biomass comparison curves, the fish community of 2b was in a healthier condition with a positive W-statistic value while the rest had a negative W-statistic value. The highest species richness and diversity were observed in 3a and 2b, so these subgroups deserve high management and conservation priority. Likewise, 1a should also be considered as a high priority area since it harbors several endangered and long-distant migratory fishes. It was also noticed that the fish communities of groups 3 and 4, located far from the hydropower dams, remained mostly unchanged compared to those of groups 1 and 2, close to the mainstream and tributary dams in the upper LMB and 3S Rivers.

AB  - Featured Application This work examines relevant factors in reverse electrodialysis (RED) application in desalination plants to reach a more sustainable and clean water supply portfolio. Specifically, our work quantifies the energy and emissions savings stemmed from reverse electrodialysis (RED) clean energy generated out of desalination's concentrate effluents through simulation. This assessment may assist in the selection of optimal working conditions, make explicit the decisive factors on RED's performance and devise strategies to enhance energy conversion according to site-specific factors. The technical and environmental assessment may be useful in the prospective advancements towards full-scale RED technology deployment in energy-intensive processes such as desalination.
   Salinity gradient energy harvesting by reverse electrodialysis (RED) is a promising renewable source to decarbonize desalination. This work surveys the potential reduction in energy consumption and carbon emissions gained from RED integration in 20 medium-to-large-sized seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination plants spread worldwide. Using the validated RED system's model from our research group, we quantified the grid mix share of the SWRO plant's total energy demand and total emissions RED would abate (i) in its current state of development and (ii) if captured all salinity gradient exergy (SGE). Results indicate that more saline and warmer SWRO brines enhance RED's net power density, yet source availability may restrain specific energy supply. If all SGE were harnessed, RED could supply similar to 40% of total desalination plants' energy demand almost in all locations, yet energy conversion irreversibility and untapped SGE decline it to similar to 10%. RED integration in the most emission-intensive SWRO plants could relieve up to 1.95 kg CO2-eq m(-3). Findings reveal that RED energy recovery from SWRO concentrate effluents could bring desalination sector sizeable energy and emissions savings provided future advancements bring RED technology closer to its thermodynamic limit.

AB  - A well-dated sediment core from the Goheung area of the southern coast of the Korean Peninsula was used to reconstruct the history of environmental and vegetation changes in response to variability in the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and the sea-level change during the Holocene. A multi-proxy analysis (palynomorphs, mean grain size, TOC, TS, C/N ratio, and delta C-13(TOC) data) indicated that the study area underwent a change in environment from a fluvio-coastal (a fluvial to intertidal zone) to a subtidal zone due to a sea-level rise at ca. 7500 cal yr BP. Since ca. 6000 cal yr BP, it has gradually returned to a brackish-dominant environment (intertidal zone) due to coastal regression, with a decrease in relative sea-level. Palynological data show that the climate of the southern coast of the Korean Peninsula underwent a gradual cooling trend after ca. 5900 cal yr BP, due to weakening EASM intensity in response to decreasing insolation in the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, the long-term vegetation dynamics in this study area were controlled primarily by solar insolation-driven temperature changes during the Holocene. They were also associated with sea surface temperature (SST) changes in the western tropical Pacific (WTP). The vegetation dynamics (sharp reduction of broad-leaved trees and freshwater discharge indicators) in our study area indicate cold and dry climatic conditions since ca. 4500 cal BP, which may have been caused by the decreasing SST in the WTP. In addition, the strong link between the Holocene vegetation dynamics in the East Asian coastal area (especially, Quercus-Lepidobalanus and Pinus-Diploxylon) and SST variation in the WTP may suggest that the centennial-timescale recurring variations in EASM activity have been controlled by low-latitude ocean forcing induced by El Nino Southern Oscillation activity.

AB  - The Cretaceous red beds in southeastern China are regarded as terrestrial elastic sediments, whose paleoenvironmental implication is still in debate. They are conventionally regarded as lacustrine-fluvial sediments in basin. In present study, the late Cretaceous paleoenvironment documented by red beds (Liancheng and Guanzhaishan section) in the western Fujian province were investigated based on environmental magnetism, grain size, geochemistry and paleosols.The results show that : (1) The red beds in the western Fujian, mostly in form of interbedded siltstone and sandstone with gravels, are dominated by fine silt particles with less clay and sand. The dominant magnetic carrier in red beds is hematite, which attributes to low values of magnetic susceptibility in the two sections. (2) The weathering degree, reflected by chemical index of alteration (CIA), is moderate as those formed in warm and humid climate. In addition, the rare earth elements (REE) of red beds show enriched light rare earth element (LREE), depleted heavy rare earth elements (HREE) , enrichment of Ce and negative Eu anomaly, which resembled that of average upper continental crust (UCC) , thus indicating thoroughly mixing sediments. (3) Although paleosols were recognized in the red beds, in particular GZS section, these paleosols were weakly developed with no evident of B horizon (e. g. Bk and Bt) in paleosol profile. The conflict between moderate chemical weathering degree and weak pedogensis infers that the red bed sediments had experienced to an extent chemical weathering in source area before deposition. After deposition, the red sediments were hardly chemically weathered. It should be noted that the red beds solely cannot indicate paleoenvironment, which must take paleosols into account. (4) The late cretaceous paleoenvironment in western Fujian was suspected to be arid and semiarid. The hematite in red beds were mainly derived from source area, indicating well-drained dry oxidizing environment, rather than aqueous condition. This work provides an alternative prospect in studying Cretaceous red beds.

AB  - Monitoring trends in the extinction risk of species is important for tracking conservation effectiveness. The Red List index (RLI) reflects changes in aggregate extinction risk for sets of species over time (a value of zero means that all species are extinct, a value of one means that all species are categorized as Least Concern). We calculated the first national RLI for birds in Colombia for the period 2002-2016, and disaggregated indices by ecosystems, regions, and species groups. Overall, the status of birds in Colombia has moderately deteriorated during 2002-2016, declining by 0.0000714% per year (the global RLI for birds declined by 0.0297% per year). High Andean forest, paramo, and freshwater are the ecosystems in worst condition. The two regions with the greatest avian diversity contrasted: the Andes has the lowest RLI, and the Amazon the highest. Among species groups, gamebirds, parrots, large frugivores, and forest raptors are the most threatened. Habitat loss from expansion of illicit crops and population declines from hunting were the most important threats. Agricultural expansion, invasive alien animal species, illegal logging and illegal mining are significant threats for some species. Tracking species' extinction risk is important in a country with the highest bird species richness in the world, dynamic spatial patterns of habitat loss, and high levels of endemism. Recent developments provide reasons for both hope and despair. In 2016, a peace agreement ended 50 years of armed conflict. New opportunities for biodiversity conservation, local development based on bird-watching tourism, and advancement in scientific knowledge of birds now occur alongside dramatic increases in deforestation. These new conservation opportunities and challenges provide strong motivation to take advantage of the fact that the overall risk of extinction of birds in Colombia is still relatively low and stable. Effective action is urgently needed while there still is the opportunity to prevent extinctions and safeguard species, particularly those in higher risk categories.

AB  - Background: While previous studies uncovered individual vulnerabilities to health risks during catastrophic storms, few evaluated the population vulnerability which is more important for identifying areas in greatest need of intervention.
   Objectives: We assessed the association between community factors and multiple health outcomes, and developed a community vulnerability index.
   Methods: We retained emergency department visits for several health conditions from the 2005-2014 New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System. We developed distributed lag nonlinear models at each spatial cluster across eight counties in downstate New York to evaluate the health risk associated with Superstorm Sandy (10/28/2012-11/9/2012) compared to the same period in other years, then defined census tracts in clusters with an elevated risk as "risk-elevated communities", and all others as "unelevated". We used machine-learning techniques to regress the risk elevation status against community factors to determine the contribution of each factor on population vulnerability, and developed a community vulnerability index (CVI).
   Results: Overall, community factors had positive contributions to increased community vulnerabilities to Sandy-related substance abuse (91.35%), injuries (70.51%), cardiovascular diseases (8.01%), and mental disorders (2.71%) but reversely contributed to respiratory diseases (-34.73%). The contribution of low per capita income (max: 22.08%), the percentage of residents living in group quarters (max: 31.39%), the percentage of areas prone to flooding (max: 38.45%), and the percentage of green coverage (max: 29.73%) tended to be larger than other factors. The CVI based on these factors achieved an accuracy of 0.73-0.90 across outcomes.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggested that substance abuse was the most sensitive disease susceptible to less optimal community indicators, whereas respiratory diseases were higher in communities with better social environment. The percentage of residents in group quarters and areas prone to flooding were among dominant predictors for community vulnerabilities. The CVI based on these factors has an appropriate predictive performance.

AB  - Question Biodiversity surveys of epiphytic bryophytes and lichens on standing trees are mostly restricted to the lowermost 2 m, since sampling above this level is time-consuming and therefore expensive. However, sampling only the stem base is likely to result in underestimation of forest epiphyte diversity, because microclimate and physico-chemical site conditions, both of which vary with height above the ground, play important roles for poikilohydric organisms. We investigate variation in epiphyte diversity and composition along the vertical gradient in forests and discuss factors that may potentially account for height-dependent distribution patterns. Location Montane primeval beech forest Havesova in the Carpathians, eastern Slovakia. Methods Ten circular plots, each 500 m(2), were selected randomly in an area severely affected by windfall. Epiphytes were sampled along the stems of recently uprooted trees, from base to the canopy. Mean Ellenberg indicator values (EIV) for light, moisture, acidity and nitrogen availability were used as surrogate variables for environmental interpretation of compositional patterns for sampling segments of 2 m along the stem. Results By sampling only the lowest 2 m, 10% of the total bryophyte and 48% of the lichen species would have been missed. We detected systematic patterns of compositional variation for both groups along the vertical gradient. While pleurocarpous mosses and liverworts were mostly restricted to the stem base, acrocarpous mosses and crustose lichens occurred along the stem almost to the top. Foliose and fruticose lichens were concentrated at intermediate heights and in the upper canopy. Patterns of variation in EIVs suggested that increasing light availability, decreasing moisture and increasing inputs of acidic and nitrous substances are responsible for the compositional shifts along the vertical gradient. Conclusions Sampling only the stem base implies severe underestimation of the epiphyte diversity in temperate broad-leaved forests. The middle and the upper parts of tree stems have distinctive compositions of epiphytic cryptogams, because microclimate and physico-chemical site factors vary with height above the ground.

AB  - Stable carbon (C-13) and oxygen isotope (O-18) compositions of fossil brachiopod shells can be used to interpret paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic conditions. However, the initial isotopic composition of the living shells might be modified by diagenetic alteration. To assess the degree of this modification, we analyzed C-13 and O-18 and three common indicators of alteration in shells: minor element (manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), and strontium (Sr)) concentrations; cathodoluminescence (CL)/non-luminescence; and the shell microstructure of fossil Terebratalia coreanica and Laqueus rubellus (rhynchonellate brachiopod) shells from an exposure of conglomerates of the Tentokuji Formation (Pliocene, 3.85-2.75Ma) in northeastern Japan. Two indices were used to quantify the preservation state of shell microstructure: the altered fiber ratio (AFR) and the altered fiber and puncta-filling cement ratio (AF-PCR). We qualified the degree of luminescence by measuring the mean cathodoluminescence index (MCLI), defined as the mean R values in a particular area of a CL image with RGB colors. The C-13 and O-18 values were negatively correlated with AFR or AF-PCR and MCLI. The sampling spots with high Mn and Fe concentrations also exhibited relatively low C-13 and O-18. The C-13 and O-18 were more strongly correlated with Mn concentration than with Fe concentration. Therefore, of the three minor elements examined in this study, Mn concentration is the most reliable indicator of meteoric diagenesis in the studied shells. Unlike Mn and Fe concentrations, Sr concentrations in the modern and fossil brachiopod shells were similar, with overlapping ranges. This indicates that Sr concentration is not likely to be a good indicator of diagenetic alteration in the studied shells. Our study provides further evidence that multiple criteria should be applied and cross-checked when assessing diagenetic alteration of brachiopod shells.

AB  - Many bacteria enter the viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state to maximize resources and increase their tolerance to harmful conditions to cope with environmental stress, which has been described for a plethora of important human and foodborne pathogens. VBNC pathogens can potentially present a serious risk to human health as they are invisible to routine microbiological culture-based methods. Of high importance is the increased tolerance to antibiotics or disinfectant measures while in the VBNC state. The greatest remaining challenge for such investigations is the lack of an appropriate, cost-effective multi-species screening method due to experimental constraints. In this study, we investigated if de novo ATP production of cells in the VBNC state is a suitable indicator for overall cell viability that can be utilized to determine the minimum ATP inhibitory concentration (MAIC) of antibiotics and other antimicrobials. To validate this approach, heat-stress time-kill experiments were performed with both culturable and VBNC cells. We developed a comprehensive experimental setup and demonstrated the applicability of this VBNC-MIC assay for testing the tolerance of 12 strains of 4 important bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Listeria monocytogenes) in the VBNC state to eight important antimicrobials including four different antibiotics. We confirmed that bacteria in the VBNC state were resistant to all tested antibiotics (ampicillin, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin) and additionally insensitive to disinfectants (benzalkonium chloride and trioctylmethylammonium chloride) and preservatives (bronopol and sodium azide). These data emphasize the need for further research regarding the characteristics of bacterial pathogens in the VBNC state and present the advantages and high-throughput capabilities of ATP determinations to investigate tolerance of VBNC pathogens to antimicrobials. The presented method should be helpful in order to identify appropriate countermeasures, treatments, or disinfectants when confronted with bacterial pathogens in the VBNC state.

AB  - This study aims to refine the gross national happiness (GNH) development concept of Bhutan at the farm level and to show the major temporal and spatial trends in the development of rural areas with differing agroecological conditions and adoption of cattle crossbreeding. The study areas (four localities) are described as extensive, semi-intensive, intensive, and intensive peri-urban. Technical, social, economic, and environmental data from 183 households in the study areas were collected in 2000, 2004, and 2015. Participatory methods were used to select from the collected data the most relevant issues and their corresponding indicators at the farm level. The issues identified during the field workshops conducted in the study areas could be grouped as social, economic, and environmental. Next, the indicators were aggregated into economic, social, and environmental indices. In 2000 and 2004, the intensive peri-urban area showed the highest performance in the economic and social indicators. Livestock farming, despite its potential for dairying, was prohibited in one of the localities in 2010 when the territorial coverage of the capital Thimpu expanded. On the other hand, the dynamics of the indicators in the other three localities indicated that the social and economic indices were highest in the intensive area, followed by the semi-intensive area, and lastly, by the extensive area. This could be because different crossbreeding techniques were implemented in these areas. In the period 2004-2015, the reference values of the social indices declined, which could be attributed to increased rural-urban migration and intensified farm labor shortages in the study areas. The environmental indices did not change much during the monitoring periods. In summary, this study presents a methodological approach for examining the GNH in Bhutan based on participatory identification of social, economic, and environmental issues and indicators along with the reference values for the selected indicators. Likewise, this study showed that an integral assessment can complement the implementation of the GNH philosophy in the rural areas of Bhutan.

AB  - Programs targeting conversion to irrigation techniques promoted as water-efficient, such as drip irrigation, are multiplying worldwide with the claimed objective to secure food production while alleviating the pressure on water resources. However, there is a persisting and widespread questioning about the actual impact when implementing the techniques in the real-world context, particularly in smallholder farms. We propose a framework to support an integrated assessment of the impact on farm holding performance resulting from the conversion towards a new irrigation technique. It is implemented for a 4030 ha agricultural district in the Triffa plain of NE Morocco where increasing number of farms are changing surface to drip irrigation. The indicators within the framework are calculated using survey data from a sample of 25 farm holdings collected in 2012 and 2013. The survey data are enriched with institutional data and data estimated from hydrologic modeling. The results indicate that, in the study area, farmers engaging with drip irrigation are mainly motivated by social factors, while most environmental and economic indicators are signaling a neutral or undesirable effect resulting from the conversion to drip irrigation. These results question the relevance of the water use reduction objective underlying the ongoing national plan "Plan Maroc Vert" (PMV) that aims converting up to 50% of irrigated agricultural land in drip irrigation, and call for a stronger appropriation of this water-saving objective by the farm holders. However, limited data availability and quality did not allow to firmly demonstrate the robustness of the findings. This severe data constraint revealed the difficulty to assess the socio-eco and environmental impact of such irrigation plan in the study area, and highlights the need for a data collection, centralization, and sharing effort. Conditioned to a strong reduction in data uncertainty, the framework methodology proposed in this study can serve as a practical reference for other studies seeking for an integrated assessment of irrigation management changes.

AB  - Retrieving accurate volcanic sulfur dioxide (SO2) gas emission rates is important for a variety of purposes. It is an indicator of shallow subsurface magma, and thus may signal impending eruption or unrest. SO2 emission rates are significant for accurately assessing climate impact, and providing context for assessing environmental, agricultural, and human health effects during volcanic eruptions. The U.S. Geological Survey Hawaiian Volcano Observatory uses an array of ten fixed, upward-looking ultraviolet spectrometer systems to measure SO2 emission rates at 10-s sample intervals from the Kilauea summit. We present Kilauea SO2 emission rates from the volcano's summit and middle East Rift Zone during 2014-2017 and discuss the major sources of error for these measurements. Due to the wide range of SO2 emissions encountered at the summit vent, we used a variable wavelength spectral analysis range to accurately quantify both high and low SO2 column densities. We compare measured emission rates from the fixed spectrometer array to independent road and helicopter-based traverse measurements and evaluate the magnitudes and sources of uncertainties for each method. To address the challenge of obtaining accurate plume speed measurements, we examine ground-based wind-speed, plume speed tracking via spectrometer, and SO2 camera derived plume speeds. Our analysis shows that: (1) the summit array column densities calculated using a dual fit window, are within -6 to +22% of results obtained with a variety of other conventional and experimental retrieval methods; (2) emission rates calculated from the summit array located similar to 3 km downwind provide the best, practical estimate of summit SO2 release under normal trade wind conditions; (3) ground-based anemometer wind speeds are 22% less than plume speeds determined by cross-correlation of plume features; (4) our best estimate of average Kilauea SO2 release for 2014-2017 is 5100 t/d, which is comparable to the space-based OMI emissions of 5518 t/d; and (5) short-term variability of SO2 emissions reflects Kilauea lava lake dynamics.

AB  - The organochlorine pesticides aldrin (0.14g/L) and methoxychlor (0.23g/L) were both present in the Albasini Dam, Limpopo Province, South Africa, during a field survey in 2014. The use of aldrin has been banned in the USA since 1987 and restricted in South Africa since 1992. The use of methoxychlor, however, remains undefined with little information available about its registration in South Africa despite being banned in Europe (2002) and USA (2003). The aim of this study was to determine the potential effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of aldrin and methoxychlor on the reproductive system of male catfish, Clarias gariepinus. Males were exposed for 96h to the two pesticides under controlled laboratory conditions. Following exposure, each fish was weighed and measured, and a necropsy performed to determine any macroscopic abnormalities and the general health of the fish. The fish were killed and dissected and the testes removed, weighed and measured to determine the gonadosomatic index (GSI). The right testis of each fish was sectioned for histopathological assessment and to calculate the testes index (I-T). The left testis was used for computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA). The histopathological assessment of the testes showed histopathological changes such as of melano-macrophage centres (MMCs) and vacuolation of spermatogonia and spermatocytes. However, the classification of these changes indicated that the testes tissue structure was normal with slight histological changes. No statistically significant differences (p>0.05) were found in the CASA parameters between exposure groups. The results of this study showed that the environmentally relevant concentrations of aldrin and methoxychlor did not have a negative effect on the motility of the mature sperm, but adverse effects were noted in the early stages of spermatogenesis, indicating possible effects over longer exposure periods.

AB  - Background and aimsAlthough Si is recognized as a beneficial element for crops, the determination of plant-available silicon (PAS) in soils has become challenging. A correlation between pH and PAS indicators has been reported in the literature due to the higher degree of weathering of acidic soil. We tested this hypothesis in the cultivated rice fields of Karnataka State, India, which exhibit gradients of pH and climate.MethodTwo hundred surface soil samples were collected from rice fields representing nine of the ten agro-climatic zones (ACZs) defined for Karnataka. We analyzed the Si extracted by calcium chloride (Si-CC) and the Si extracted by acetate-acetic acid (Si-AA) as PAS indicators. The samples were analyzed for particle size distribution, pH, electrical conductivity and cation exchange capacity. Forty subsamples were selected for mineralogical and chemical analysis.ResultsPCA of the 200 samples showed that PAS indicators and pH were positively correlated. Si-AA was also positively correlated with electric conductivity (EC), CEC, and the silt fraction and negatively correlated with the sand fraction. A separation of the data arbitrarily made at pH7.5 showed that below 7.5, the correlation between PAS indicators and pH was better than considering the whole 200 samples. The distribution of Si-AA with pH matched the curve of adsorbed Si given in the literature. Soils characterized by low pH and high contents of sand, SiO2, Zr and Hf, showed a higher degree of weathering. They were preferentially located along the coast, where the rainfall is the most abundant. The depletion of PAS indicators was also in good agreement with the predominance of kaolinite instead of smectite, which characterizes a higher degree of desilication.ConclusionWe demonstrated that the correlation between pH and PAS indicators is explained by natural Si depletion (weathering intensity) and the effect of Si adsorption. We suggest that at pH values up to 7.5, pH can be used as a proxy for PAS in similar types of pedo-climatic conditions.

AB  - Sustainability assessment and sustainability indicators are familiar terms that have gained significant importance. Non-compliance between the sustainable development principles and transportation infrastructure projects is changing the appearance of historic cities from livable and vibrant atmosphere into the car-oriented condition and cause environmental and social problems. There exist numerous studies on measuring the sustainability of transportation at the country, state, city, and even traffic zone levels, but few have addressed the sustainability of micro-scale projects. The objective of this study is to assess the sustainability of infrastructure projects on urban transportation systems and evaluate their compliance with principles of sustainable development. According to made intensive field visits, run expert interviews, and development master plans relevant to the case study, nine scenarios are proposed to improve the traffic situation of Azadi district in Isfahan city. Obviously, a slight change in the urban streets network, would have a significant effect on traffic performance in larger area, therefore, all the proposed scenarios are modeled in Trans Cad 5.0 software environment to determine their influence area (IA) as the study area. Ten quantitative indicators in three dimensions (environmental, social, and economic) pertinent to the urban transportation are selected based on review of the related literature and available data in Isfahan. The IA and all proposed scenarios are simulated and calibrated in AIMSUN 8.0 environment and the indicators are quantified in a direct and indirect manner through AIMSUN outputs. A composite sustainability index (CSI) is applied for integrating the effects of selected indicators based on their rankings given by the experts regarding to the goals of Isfahan vision in 2025. The results indicate that public transportation development projects are the most compliant scenarios with the principles of urban sustainable development and the best options for the future development in Azadi district. This proposed framework, would assist policy-makers and traffic engineers in other cities to evaluate the sustainability of urban transportation infrastructure projects.

AB  - Pet animals live in relatively similar conditions to those of man. Therefore, they are considered to be available for monitoring the influence of various environmental factors on the organism, including trace elements. Manganese is an element essential for the metabolism and growth of organisms as a major constituent of several metalloenzymes, hormones and proteins. Tissues of mammals usually contain manganese localized in parenchymal organs, melanin-containing cells, in the bones and in skin appendages including hair, which is a stable matrix that presents numerous advantages for biomonitoring and provides information about short- and long-term exposure and the temporal exposure pattern by segmental analysis. The aim of the study was to test the use of canine coat hair as a biomarker of body manganese content in relation to factors such as breed, sex, age and body weight of animals.We measured manganese concentration in 120 hair samples collected from dogs of the following breeds: Yorkshire Terrier (VT). West Highland White Terrier (WHWT) and Schnauzer Dog (SCHD). The data were analyzed in relation to sex, age and body weight of dogs. Manganese levels were determined using flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). The hair of the studied dogs was found to be low in manganese compared to data on other carnivorous species. The highest level (5.66 mg kg(-1) dry weight) was found in the coat hair of YT dogs. In the other two breeds, the values measured were 3.4 and 2.87 mg kg(-1) dry weight in WHWT and SCHD, respectively. There was a decrease in hair manganese content in the coat of older WHWT and SCHD dogs. A reverse relationship was found in YT dogs. Sex was a factor determining hair manganese level in WHWT. The results indicate low environmental exposure of the dogs from Warsaw agglomeration to the manganese. The results of our comparisons between breeds do not confirm other authors' claims about great variation in hair manganese content.

AB  - Pharmaceuticals occurrence and environmental risk assessment were assessed in Portuguese surface waters, evaluating the impact of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and river flow rates. Twenty three pharmaceuticals from 6 therapeutic groups, including metabolites and 1 transformation product, were analysed in 72 samples collected from 20 different sites, upstream and downstream the selected WWTPs, in two different seasons. Analysis was performed by solid phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectroscopy.
   Pharmaceuticals were detected in 27.8% of the samples. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), anti-inflammatories and antibiotics presented the highest detection frequencies (27.8, 23.6 and 23.6%, respectively) and average concentrations (37.9, 36.1 and 33.5 ng L-1, respectively). When assessing the impact of WWTPs, an increase of 21.4% in the average concentrations was observed in the samples located downstream these facilities, when compared with the upstream samples.
   Increased detection frequencies and concentrations were observed at lower flow rates, both when comparing summer and winter campaigns and by evaluating the different rivers.
   Risk quotients (RQs) higher than one were found for two pharmaceuticals, concerning two trophic levels. However, since Iberian rivers are highly influenced by water scarcity, in drought periods, the flow rates in these rivers can decrease at least ten times from the lowest value observed in the sampling campaigns. In these conditions, RQs higher than 1 would be observed for 5 pharmaceuticals, additionally, all the detected pharmaceuticals (11) would present RQs higher than 0.1.
   These results emphasize that the river flow rate represents an important parameter influencing pharmaceuticals concentrations, highlighting the ecotoxicological pressure, especially due to water scarcity in drought periods. This should be a priority issue in the environmental policies for minimizing its impact in the aquatic environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Dark septate endophytic (DSE) fungi are facultative biotrophs that associate with hundreds of plant species, contributing to their growth. These fungi may therefore aid in the search for sustainable agricultural practices. However, several ecological functions of DSE fungi need further clarification. The present study investigated the effects of DSE fungi inoculation on nutrient recovery efficiency, nutrient accumulation, and growth of tomato plants fertilized with organic and inorganic N sources. Two experiments were carried out under greenhouse conditions in a randomized blocks design, with five replicates of tomato seedlings grown in pots filled with non-sterile sandy soil. Tomato seedlings (cv. Santa Clara I-5300) inoculated with DSE fungi (isolates A101, A104, and A105) and without DSE fungi (control) were transplanted to pots filled with 12 kg of soil which had previously received finely ground plant material [Canavalia ensiformis (L.)] that was shoot enriched with 0.7 atom % N-15 (organic N source experiment) or ammonium sulfate-N-15 enriched with 1 atom % N-15 (mineral N source experiment). Growth indicators, nutrient content, amount of nitrogen (N) in the plant derived from ammonium sulfate-N-15 or C. ensiformis-N-15, and recovery efficiency of N-15, P, and K by plants were quantified 50 days after transplanting. The treatment inoculated with DSE fungi and supplied with an organic N source showed significantly higher recovery efficiency of N-15, P, and K. In addition, the N-15, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, and Zn content, plant height, leaf number, leaf area (only for the A104 inoculation), and shoot dry matter increased. In contrast, the only positive effects observed in the presence of an inorganic N source were fertilizer-K recovery efficiency, content of K, and leaf area when inoculated with the fungus A104. Inoculation with A101, A104, and A105 promoted the growth of tomato using organic N source (finely ground C. ensiformis-N-15 plant material).

AB  - The production and end-of-life (EoL) processes for current and future proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) systems for road passenger vehicle applications were analysed and quantified in the form of life cycle inventories. The current PEMFC technology is characterised by highly sensitive operating conditions and a high system mass. For each core component of PEMFC there are a range of materials under development and the research aimed to identify those considered realistic for a 2020 future scenario and according to commercial goals of achieving higher performance, increased power density, greater stability and a marked reduction of costs. End-of-life scenarios were developed in consideration of the materials at the focus of recovery efforts.
   The life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) addressed the production and EoL of the fuel cell systems with inclusion of a sensitivity analysis to assess influences on the results from the key fuel cell parameters. The second part to the LCIA assessed the environmental and human health burdens from passenger transport in a fuel cell vehicle (FCV) with comparison between the 2012 and 2020 fuel cell scenarios and referenced to an internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) of Euro5 emission standard. It was seen that whilst the drivetrain (and therefore the fuel cell system) is a major contributor to the emissions in all the indicators shown, the hydrogen use (and therefore the efficiency of the fuel cell system and the method of hydrogen production) can have a far greater influence on the environmental performance. Overall, the results show inconclusive environmental benefits for using FCV instead of modern ICEV: a substantial reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions can only be achieved using hydrogen produced with non-fossil energy resources. However, even such "clean" hydrogen used in FCV will not lead to a reduction of several other environmental burdens from the life cycle perspective within the time frame considered.

AB  - In this study, we examined the species composition of neophyte communities of Robinia pseudoacacia and Acer negundo and compared the site conditions of the urban environment of two cities Riga and Kaunas. Eighty-five plots of A. negundo and R. pseudoacacia communities were selected. Within each plot, all of the vascular plant species were recorded, and their abundance was estimated in 2014. Composite soil samples of the 0-10 cm mineral topsoil were collected for the estimation of the soil chemical properties at nine systematically distributed points in each sample plot. The soil pH(KCL), exchangeable bases, total nitrogen, total organic matter, C/N ratio, and concentrations of the elements (P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Na, Pb, Cd, and Ni) were estimated. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to analyse the vegetation data. An indicator species analysis was carried out. The relationship between the soil chemical parameters was assessed by principal component analysis, and the results showed that structure and composition of the plant communities of A. negundo and R. pseudoacacia differed. The number of species was lower and the herb layer was more developed in R. pseudoacacia communities, whereas the structure of communities differed between Riga and Kaunas. The cover of the shrub layer was more developed in Riga. The number of species in A. negundo communities was similar, whereas the number of species in R. pseudoacacia communities was lower in Kaunas. Alien species were more frequent in Riga. Neophyte communities in Kaunas were more homogenous. The soil in communities in Riga had more carbon, was richer in nutrients and more acidic than in Kaunas. R. pseudoacacia grew in more fertile soils than A. negundo communities.

AB  - We used a 55-cm sediment core from shallow Chaiwopu Lake in the central Tianshan Mountains of Xinjiang, northwest China, to investigate climate and environmental changes in this arid region over the past similar to 150 years. The core was dated using Cs-137. We compared temporal changes in several sediment variables with recent meteorological and tree-ring records. Organic matter had a positive correlation with the Palmer Drought Severity Index in the central Tianshan Mountains, and the delta C-13 of organic matter had a positive correlation with regional temperature. We applied constrained incremental sum-of-squares cluster analysis to element concentrations in the core and identified three distinct zones: (1) 55-46 cm, similar to 1860-1910, (2) 46-26 cm, similar to 1910-1952, and (3) 26-0 cm, 1952-present. Between 1880 and 1910 AD, following the Little Ice Age (LIA), the sediment environment was relatively stable, climate was cold and dry, and the lake water displayed high salinity, in contrast to conditions during the LIA. During the LIA, westerlies carried more water vapor into Central Asia when the North Atlantic Oscillation was in a negative phase, and encountered the enhanced Siberia High, which probably led to increased precipitation. In the period 1910-1950 AD, the lake was shallow and the regional climate was unstable, with high temperatures and humidity. In the last similar to 15-20 years, human activities caused an increase in sediment magnetic susceptibility, and heavy metal and total phosphorus concentrations in the sediment were substantially enriched. Mean annual temperature displays a warming trend over the past 50 years, and the lowest temperature was observed in the 1950s. There has been an increase in annual total precipitation since the 1990s. The combined influences of climate and human activity on the lake environment during this period were faithfully recorded in sediments of Chaiwopu Lake. This study provides a scientific basis for environmental management and protection.

AB  - Question
   What is the relative importance of local site effects and selected important environmental variables in determining plant species composition? How do species respond to these environmental variables?
   Location
   Ten mesotrophic grassland sites of high conservation value in southern England.
   Methods
   Species cover was assessed in between 10 and 25 randomly selected 1-m(2) quadrats at each site. At each quadrat degree of waterlogging (W), soil Olsen extractable phosphorus (P) and soil pH were measured. Variation partitioning was used to separate site and soil effects, and HOF (Huisman, Olff & Fresco) modelling was used to produce response curves for the major species on soil gradients, based on coenoclines derived from partial canonical correspondence analysis (pCCA).
   Results
   Variation partitioning identified Site as the most important environmental variable (34.6%). Only 18.7% was accounted for by the three soil variables together; W (degree of waterlogging), P and pH accounted for 11.1%, 5.7% and 4.3%, respectively in raw form with 2.4% shared. However, when Site and the other soil variables were removed the variation explained reduced to 2.3% for W, 1.1% for P and 1.0% for pH. The species responses to each of these soil environmental factors could be separated into four types on each gradient. Most species were abundant at low W, low soil P and intermediate pH.
   Conclusions
   Site-based factors were more important than the three soil variables, which were assumed to be directly or indirectly associated with productivity. This implies that each site has unique properties that are more important than the soil variables. The three soil factors were, however, significant and the groups of the most common species, based on significant response curves, can be used as a first approximation of indicators of environmental conditions in British mesotrophic grasslands for conservation. However, W accounted for most variation, and the current reliance on soil available P and soil pH for assessing conservation/restoration potential should be viewed with caution.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to (a) analyze the distribution pattern of molluscs in freshwater systems from central-western Argentina, (b) investigate the key environmental factors affecting the species distribution, and (c) compare Quaternary and modern mollusc assemblages in order to evaluate the extent and limitations of freshwater molluscs as paleobioindicators. A total of 45 freshwater habitats were sampled for living molluscs. At each selected site, physical and chemical parameters were quantified, and living molluscs collected. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used for the ordination of sampling sites based on environmental variables. To explore the relationships between environmental variables and mollusc assemblages, a Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was performed. Data on fossil mollusc assemblages from three Quaternary alluvial successions outcropping in the area were combined with the modern data set by means of a Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA). Eight taxa were identified: Lymnaea viator, Heleobia hatcheri, Heleobia parchappii, Heleobia aff. parchappii, Chilina mendozana, Biomphalaria peregrina, Physa acuta, and a bivalve attributed to the family Sphaeriidae. Except for H. hatcheri and P. acuta, the species were also recorded as fossils in the area. Overall, the occurrence of molluscs in central-western Argentina appeared to be related to calm vegetated shallow water bodies. With the exception of H. parchappii that only occurred in saline waters (8-16 mS cm(-1)), the mollusc assemblages were restricted to low salinities (below 1.9 mS cm(-1)). Two main groups, indicative of different energetic environmental conditions related to the stability of the flow regime, were recognized: (1) L viator, P acuta, and B. peregrina occurred at lentic habitats (shallow lakes) or calm backwaters (pools) within lotic systems such as streams and rivers, (2) H. hatcheri, H. aff. parchappii, C mendozana, and Sphaeriidae dominated in lotic habitats where a directional water flow exists. These same groups were recognized in the fossil record allowing the reconstruction of habitats that differed in the magnitude of the water flow. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Deosai Plateau in Northern Pakistan was designated a national park to protect the largest remnant population of brown bears in Pakistan. The natural resources of this high elevation (3500-5000 m) park make a significant contribution to the livelihood of local and nomad communities. The present legislation excludes people from a park, which increases conflicts between management and local people. However, a pragmatic approach was adopted to involve people in conservation in Deosai. Community participation, achieved by recognizing rights and introducing incentives, reduced resistance against the conservation efforts, reduced grazing pressure in bear habitat and helped reduce poaching. The size of the brown bear population was set as an indicator of park success, and was monitored annually from 1993 through 2006. We observed a 5% annual growth of the brown bear population, suggesting that the conservation program has been successful due to a successful cooperation between an NGO, people, and the park management.
   The increase of the bear population is significant, because we observed an extremely low reproductive rate, due to late age of first reproduction (8.25 years), a long reproductive interval (5.7 years), and a small litter size (1.33). The reproductive rate of the Deosai population is the lowest yet documented for brown bear populations. Poor habitat quality, low quality food, high seasonality, and extreme weather conditions in the Himalaya probably explain the poor reproductive performance. Considering such low reproduction and known exchange of individuals with neighboring populations, we believe that the observed growth was a sum of reproduction and immigration. Brown bears are declining throughout South Asia and often have low-productive rates. Therefore, conservation efforts for brown bears in this region must target reducing human-caused mortalities, particularly of adult females. Involvement of people can increase efficiency in conservation, in addition to reducing cost and conflicts. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We examined the spatial and temporal distribution of the foods of ursine colobus (Colobus vellerosus) at Boabeng-Fiema, Ghana as a means to predict the monopolizablity and usurpability of their food resources. Recent evidence suggests that food may not be limiting for folivorous primates, and that male sexual coercion may be a more important influence on folivore social organization. To address the question, we collected focal data on the feeding behavior of adult females and males over 11 mo (September 2000-August 2001) on 2 groups: WW (n=31-33 individuals) and B (n=8-16 individuals). We also conducted phenological monitoring and a tree survey of the two-group home ranges to establish food availability and distribution. We used 2 behavioral or organism-defined indicators of feeding behavior to assess potential resource contestability: food site residence time and distance moved between food sites. The colobus fed on a high diversity of species, most of their food trees were not clumped in distribution, within-tree interfood distances were short, and food trees were large. The only condition associated with the potential for monopolization was low food tree density. However, low food tree density may be offset by the colobus' use of large trees. Taken together, the ecological and behavioral indicators suggest the food resources of Colobus vellerosus had a low potential for monopolization. Our results also indicate mature leaves had the longest food site residence time, which may suggest they should be the most usurpable plant part, though their presumed low quality and high abundance probably counteracted the effect. The pattern implied the potential for direct feeding competition among Colobus vellerosus at Boabeng-Fiema was low and agonistic interactions over food are not expected. Instead, a group size effect on feeding efficiency should be a more predominant influence on feeding efficiency, if food is limiting for the species.

AB  - A comparative study of the capabilities of black poplar-tree (Populus nigra L.) bark as a biomonitor of atmospheric heavy-metal pollution is reported. Performance indicators (concentrations and enrichment factors) of heavy metal bioaccumulation of bark were compared to the corresponding indicators of epiphytic lichens Xanthoria parietina (L.) Th. Fr. and Physcia adscendens (Fr.) H. Oliver, collected simultaneously with bark samples within the Kiev urban-industrial conurbation. The concentrations of 40 minor and trace elements in the samples were measured by a combination of epithermal and instrumental neutron activation analysis (NAA) using a 10 MW nuclear research reactor WWR-M as the neutron source. Statistical analysis of the data was carried out using non-parametric tests. It was shown that for the majority of the elements determined a good correlation exists between their concentrations in bark and in the lichen species. The accumulation capability of the bark was found to be as effective as, and in some cases better, for both types of lichens. Based on the background levels and variations of the elemental concentration in black poplar-tree bark, threshold values for the enrichment factors were established. For a number of elements (As, Au, Ce, Co, Cr, Cu, La, Mn, Mo, Ni, Sb, Sm, Ti, Th, U, V, W) an interspecies calibration was performed. An optimized pre-irradiation treatment of the bark sample was employed which efficiently separated the most informative external layer from the deeper layers of the bark and thus minimized variations of the element concentrations. Results of this study support black poplar-tree bark as an alternative to epiphytic lichens for heavy metal air pollution monitoring in urban and industrial regions, where severe environmental conditions may result in scarcity or even lack of the indicator species.

AB  - The relationship between ambient fine particle (PM2.5) concentration and children's personal exposure was investigated in Prince George, British Columbia. Repeated personal exposure measures (10 per subject) of 15 children and ambient concentrations at their neighbourhood schools were collected for a 6-week winter period in 2001. PM2.5 mass, sulphate (SO42-) and light absorbing carbon (ABS) were determined for all samples and the relationship between ambient concentration and personal exposure was investigated. Overall, lower particle exposures and a lower personal-ambient regression slope were found for Prince George children compared to results from other longitudinal studies of children. This suggests that in this setting indoor environments may have less influence from ambient sources and greater influence from non-ambient sources. Comparison of personal exposures and ambient concentrations for each individual indicated higher Spearman correlations for SO42- (median = 0.95) and ABS (median = 0.73) compared to total PM2.5 mass (median = 0.55). A large degree of individual variability in the personal-ambient correlation was found for PM2.5 mass, while SO42- showed very consistent results, supporting its use as an indicator of exposure to particulate matter of ambient origin. ABS was slightly more variable than SO42- due to the influence of non-ambient or very local sources in a low number of samples. The impact of local meteorology was also investigated and inversion conditions were connected to all high ambient levels (> 30 mu g m(-3)). In addition, associations were found between inversion strength and personal exposure. This finding suggests that reduction of ambient concentrations during stagnant periods would result in lower personal exposure levels. This study highlights the importance of both ambient and non-ambient sources, supports the use of both SO42- and ABS as tracers of background ambient particle exposure and demonstrates the significant effect of winter meteorology on both outdoor levels and personal exposure in a valley community.

AB  - The short-term effects of Pinus radiata forest harvesting to the stream edge followed by stream-cleaning (removal of woody debris from the stream channel), on instream light levels, stream temperature, dissolved oxygen concentrations, and aquatic invertebrates were assessed in streams draining partly (25% clear-cut) and totally (100% clearcut) harvested catchments, compared with nearby indigenous forest and mature pine plantation reference sites. There were marked increases in in-stream light levels and water temperatures following forest harvest and stream-cleaning at both sites. In-stream light levels increased from 8-13% to 60-90% and maximum monthly water temperatures increased on average by 5.6 degrees C in the partly harvested and 3.6 degrees C in the fully harvested catchment. Dissolved oxygen levels decreased at both sites shortly after harvest (94%-71% saturation in the partly harvested catchment; 72%-37% saturation in the totally harvested catchment), increasing to 75% and 81%, respectively, I year later. Although aquatic invertebrate mean density and taxa richness increased at both sites following harvest, the relative abundance of sensitive mayfly, caddisfly, and stonefly species decreased and community composition changed to one dominated by Chironomidae (midges) or Mollusca. Impacts relative to pre-harvest conditions were not as marked in the totally harvested catchment, possibly because of pre-existing elevated stream temperatures and high levels of sand and silt. Any downstream protection provided by the forested headwaters of the partly harvested catchment was soon lost after the stream entered the clear-cut area, although these forested headwaters may provide a potential source of aquatic invertebrates for re-colonisation in the future as water quality and habitat recover. Our results suggest that: (1) pre-existing constraints on habitat quality can influence the magnitude of harvesting impacts; and (2) length of stream edge harvested may be a better indicator of impact on some aspects of stream ecology, such as lighting, stream temperature, dissolved oxygen, and aquatic invertebrate community composition, than percentage of catchment harvested. This study also highlights the importance of considering the hydrological and landscape context for mitigating harvesting and wood management impacts on stream ecosystems.

TI  - The maturation rate of girls living in rich and poor rural regions of Poland before and after the transformation of 1989

AB  - The aim of this study was to find out whether the political and economic system transformation in Poland in 1989 had an influence on the rate of maturation of girls from various categories of the rural population in two regions, differing in wealth. The stratification of the villagers was based on the source of the family income (farmers, farmer-workers and non-farmers), on parents' education, and on the number of children per family. The age at menarche (AM) was used as biological indicator of living conditions.
   Rural girls aged 9.5-18.5 years were studied in 1987 in Leszno (L), a rich region (n = 2049), and in 1989 in Suwalki (S), a poor region (n = 2077). The study was repeated in 2001 in the same villages, the numbers of subjects amounting to 2440 and 2122, respectively.
   In the 1980s, AM in regions L and S amounted to 13.18 and 13.88 years, respectively, and was strongly related to social stratification. The earliest AM was found in daughters of non-farmers and the latest in the girls from farmers' families. In 2001, the acceleration in AM amounted to 0.14 years in the rich region and to 0.46 years in the poor region. The percentage of families owning a car, freezer, colour TV and automatic washing machine markedly increased and the education of parents improved. Such results are indicative of an improvement in the living standard of the groups investigated, but the villagers regard themselves as the losers as a result of the system transformation in Poland.
   Since the Polish population is considered as ethnically homogenous, the great differences in AM within the rural population, as well as the differences between the inhabitants of villages and large cities should be regarded as biological effects of social inequalities. Such differences indicate that Polish rural girls are far below the genetic potential for menarcheal age.

AB  - The daily variability of river suspended sediment concentration (Cs) and related yield ( Y) is studied at 60 global stations. The data set covers natural conditions (e.g. pre-reservoir data), ranging from the humid tropics to subarctic and and regions, located in all types of relief (yearly runoff q* from 0.1 to 55 1 s(-1) km(-2)). Basin area ranges from 64 km(2) to 3.2 million km(2). Survey lengths range from 1 to 20 years with a median of 3 years. Median values (Cs-50, q(50), Y-50) and discharge-weighted averages for Cs* and Y* range from 5 to 29 000 mgl(-1) and 10 to 5000 kg km(-2) day(-1), respectively. A set of indicators of variability are proposed for sediment concentration, water and sediment discharges including mean to median ratios (CS*/CS50, Y*/Y-50), the percentage of sediment flux discharged in 2% of time (Ms-2) the percentage of time necessary to carry half of the sediment flux (Ts-50), and quantiles of Cs, q and Y distributions corresponding to the discharge-weighted averages. Since most of the sediment flux is discharged in less than 25% of the time, "truncated rating curves" metrics are proposed between the Cs vs. q relationship for periods of high flux. Temporal variability decreases with increasing basin size, lake abundance, and is higher for basins influenced by glaciermelt and snowmelt. The least variable sediment flux regimes are noted for the Mississippi at its mouth, the Rhone Lacustre, the St. Lawrence and the Somme, a medium-sized French phreatic river. The most variable flux regimes were for small- to medium-sized basins (i.e. <1000 to 10 000 km(2)) such as steep Andean Bolivian basins, Thai basins, the Eel (CA) and Walla Walla (OR) rivers. A proposed global scale typology is based on six classes key variability indicators. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the critical soil moisture (SM) threshold (theta(crit)) of plant water stress and land surface energy partitioning is a basis to evaluate drought impacts and improve models for predicting future ecosystem condition and climate. Quantifying the theta(crit) across biomes and climates is challenging because observations of surface energy fluxes and SM remain sparse. Here, we used the latest database of eddy covariance measurements to estimate theta(crit) across Europe by evaluating evaporative fraction (EF)-SM relationships and investigating the covariance between vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and gross primary production (GPP) during SM dry-down periods. We found that the theta(crit) and soil matric potential threshold in Europe are 16.5% and -0.7 MPa, respectively. Surface energy partitioning characteristics varied among different vegetation types; EF in savannas had the highest sensitivities to SM in water-limited stage, and the lowest in forests. The sign of the covariance between daily VPD and GPP consistently changed from positive to negative during dry-down across all sites when EF shifted from relatively high to low values. This sign of the covariance changed after longer period of SM decline in forests than in grasslands and savannas. Estimated theta(crit) from the VPD-GPP covariance method match well with the EF-SM method, showing this covariance method can be used to detect the theta(crit). We further found that soil texture dominates the spatial variability of theta(crit) while shortwave radiation and VPD are the major drivers in determining the spatial pattern of EF sensitivities. Our results highlight for the first time that the sign change of the covariance between daily VPD and GPP can be used as an indicator of how ecosystems transition from energy to SM limitation. We also characterized the corresponding theta(crit) and its drivers across diverse ecosystems in Europe, an essential variable to improve the representation of water stress in land surface models.

AB  - Atmospheric reactive nitrogen (N) deposition is an important driver of carbon (C) sequestration in forest ecosystems. Previous studies have focused on N-C interactions in various ecosystems; however, relatively little is known about the impact of N deposition on ecosystem C cycling during climate extremes such as droughts. With the occurrence and severity of droughts likely to be exacerbated by climate change, N deposition-drought interactions remain one of the key uncertainties in process-based models to date. This study aims to contribute to the understanding of N deposition-drought dynamics on gross primary production (GPP) in European forest ecosystems. To do so, different soil water availability indicators (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), soil volumetric water) and GPP measurements from European FLUXNET forest sites were used to quantify the response of forest GPP to drought. The computed drought responses of the forest GPP to drought were linked to modelled N deposition estimates for varying edaphic, physiological, and climatic conditions. Our result showed a differential response of forest ecosystems to the drought indicators. Although all FLUXNET forest sites showed a coherent dependence of GPP on N deposition, no consistent or significant N deposition effect on the response of forest GPP to drought could be isolated. The mean response of forest GPP to drought could be predicted for forests with Pinus trees as dominant species (R (2) = 0.85, RMSE = 8.1). After extracting the influence of the most prominent parameters (mean annual temperature and precipitation, forest age), however, the variability remained too large to significantly substantiate hypothesized N deposition effects. These results suggest that, while N deposition clearly affects forest productivity, N deposition is not a major nor consistent driver of forest productivity responses to drought in European forest ecosystems.

AB  - High-manganese materials would provide valuable information about the history of a water-rich and oxidizing environment on early Mars. However, the detailed texture and components of these high-manganese materials are unknown. In martian breccia meteorite NWA 11220, one unique lithic clast enriched in high-manganese material (similar to 5 vol%) has been recognized. Here, we report the morphological, micro-textural, mineralogical, and geochemical features of the martian high-manganese material at the microscale for the first time. Our results show that (a) high-manganese materials are characterized by micron-sized grain (<50 mu m), complex associated-phase (i.e., apatite, enstatite, magnetite, ilmenite, and amorphous matrix), and chemical heterogeneity; (b) nano-sized (<500 nm) amorphous manganese-oxide veins or grains are the only manganese-bearing phases in the high-manganese materials. These new observations provide new evidence for revealing the geological processes related to the high-manganese materials on Mars and provide important information for future in-situ exploration and data interpretation of high-manganese materials on Mars.
   Plain language Summary On Earth, the presence of high-manganese concentrations is commonly thought to be an indicator of water-rich and highly oxidizing conditions. Similarly, high-manganese materials have also been detected on Mars at the Curiosity/Opportunity landing sites and within a martian breccia meteorite. Knowledge of the components of these high-manganese materials would provide important information about the environments in which they formed on Mars. However, the detailed texture and components of these high-manganese materials from Mars are still unclear. Based on a unique lithic clast enriched in high-manganese material (similar to 5 vol%) from martian breccia meteorite NWA 11220, the morphology, texture, mineralogy, and geochemistry of the martian high-manganese material were revealed at the microscale for the first time. These supplementary data provide a series of new insights into the high-manganese material on Mars, including (a) the new occurrence of manganese concentration in martian igneous rocks, (b) micro-textural evidence of fluid precipitation of high-manganese material, and (3) geological history recorded by high-manganese materials on Mars.

AB  - Autonomous vehicles are expected to take complete control of the driving process, enabling the former drivers to act as passengers only. This could lead to increased sickness as they can be engaged in tasks other than driving. Adopting different sickness mitigation techniques gives us unique types of motion sickness in autonomous vehicles to be studied. In this paper, we report on a study where we explored the possibilities of assessing motion sickness with electrogastrography (EGG), a non-invasive method used to measure the myoelectric activity of the stomach, and its potential usage in autonomous vehicles (AVs). The study was conducted in a high-fidelity driving simulator with a virtual reality (VR) headset. There separate EGG measurements were performed: before, during and after the driving AV simulation video in VR. During the driving, the participants encountered two driving environments: a straight and less dynamic highway road and a highly dynamic and curvy countryside road. The EGG signal was recorded with a proprietary 3-channel recording device and Ag/AgCl cutaneous electrodes. In addition, participants were asked to signalize whenever they felt uncomfortable and nauseated by pressing a special button. After the drive they completed also the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) and reported on their overall subjective perception of sickness symptoms. The EGG results showed a significant increase of the dominant frequency (DF) and the percentage of the high power spectrum density (FSD) as well as a significant decrease of the power spectrum density Crest factor (CF) during the AV simulation. The vast majority of participants reported nausea during more dynamic conditions, accompanied by an increase in the amplitude and the RMS value of EGG. Reported nausea occurred simultaneously with the increase in EGG amplitude. Based on the results, we conclude that EGG could be used for assessment of motion sickness in autonomous vehicles. DF, CF and FSD can be used as overall sickness indicators, while the relative increase in amplitude of EGG signal and duration of that increase can be used as short-term sickness indicators where the driving environment may affect the driver.

Methods In 2012-2015, we re-surveyed quasi-permanent plots that had been initially surveyed between 1971 and 1987, and re-measured soil parameters. We tested for differences in species frequency and cover, mean Ellenberg indicator values, species richness, and soil variables. Nitrogen and sulphur deposition data were analysed to evaluate possible effects of atmospheric pollutants. We used regression and redundancy analyses to identify environmental drivers responsible for changes in species composition. Results Across regions, we found significant increases in soil pH, EllenbergRandNindicator values, plant nutrient indicators, forbs, species of agricultural grasslands and of fallows. By contrast, the C:N ratio, Nardusgrassland specialists, low-nutrient indicators, and graminoids declined. Changes in species composition were related to changes in pH and management. There was a strong decrease in sulphur and a moderate increase in nitrogen deposition, whose local-scale pattern did not correlate with changes in soil parameters. However, there was an effect of local NH(y)changes on species composition. Conclusions The findings indicate significant overall eutrophication, a trend towards less acidic conditions and insufficient management, which are widely consistent across our study regions and correspond to recent reports of vegetation changes and recovery from acidification in the Atlantic biogeographic region. We assume the reduced sulphur deposition during recent decades to be a major driver of these changes, combined with increased nitrogen deposition and reduced management intensity. This suggests a large-scale validity of processes that influenced changes inNardusgrasslands of western and Central Europe.

AB  - The transport of phosphorus (P) from agricultural fields to watercourses is a worldwide concern. Development of tools to evaluate the environmental P risk is required to assist farmers and field technicians to recommend best management practices. The objective of this work was to develop and test a new approach to assess P loss vulnerability for agricultural conservationist systems in southern Brazil using easily obtainable soil attributes: cover crop residue (CCR), soil organic carbon (OC), visual evaluation of soil structure (VESS), soil test P (STP) and day content. For that, the principal component analysis was applied, and simulated rainfall was conducted in ten agricultural fields with three replicates under Oxisol, with slopes from 7% to 12%. The database was separated into main and test groups. Significant principal components were correlated with runoff coefficient (RC), final infiltration rate (FIR), total sediment (15), total P (TP), particulate P (PP), soluble P (SP) and bioavailable P (BAP). Component 1, interpreted as 'increased risk of PP transport', explained 49% of the variation with a strong dependence on CCR, OC, STP and VESS, and correlated with decreased FIR, and increased RC, TS, PP and TP. Component 2, interpreted as 'increased risk of SP transport', explained 21% of the variation with a strong dependence on OC, STP and clay content, and correlated with decreased 15, and increased SP and BAP. The Pindex scores from components 1 and 2 were divided into four classes of P loss vulnerability (low, medium, high and very high) considering the first, median and third quartile. The Euclidean distances demonstrated a high similarity of the P-index scores obtained for the main and test groups. Therefore, the developed model can estimate the risk of P loss in agricultural fields with conservative management and moderate slope in conditions similar to the database. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Biomass gasi?cation for the production of clean energy and clean technology is a practical alternative to fossil fuels. In this paper, for the first time, a biomass Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) based on olive pits as fuel is investigated by conventional and advanced exergy, exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental analyses (4E). Environmental impacts, availability, and interest in using olive pits as newly utilized renewable biomass sources have been considered in the present study. With conventional exergy analysis, the primary causes of entropy generation, exergy cost of destruction, and exergoenvironmental impacts in the plant can be indicated. Also, with advanced analysis, the real potential can be determined for improving the system as well as equipment interactions. The exerg environmental analysis has been performed based on Life Cycle Assessment and Eco indicator 99. In this regard, the LCA analysis based on Eco indicator 99 has been done by SIMA Pro software. Furthermore, computer code has been developed for thermodynamic simulation and conventional and advanced 4E analyses of the proposed system. It can predict the plant behavior for different operating conditions with relative errors of less than 2.5% with Thermoflex software. Results show the conventional and advanced 4E analyses and evaluation for considered biomass IGCC systems simultaneously. By the exergetic analysis, the location, values, and sources of entropy generation in the system are identified. By exergoeconomic analysis, the information about the cost in the components has been indicated in terms not only of capital investment but also of the cost of exergy. Through the exergoenvironmental analyses, it can be concluded that improving the efficiency and decreasing fossil fuel consumption are the key factors of promoting environmental characteristics. Splitting the exergy destruction, the capital investment cost, and the component-related environmental impact related to each component into endogenous/exogenous and avoidable/unavoidable parts promotes these analyses and enhances the quality of the conclusions achieved from them.

AB  - Purpose - to evaluate the low-dose effect of lead on the microelement state and the pre-nosological indicators of the health in preschool children living in conditions of its permanent impact.
   Materials and methods. Hygienic monitoring of lead, copper, and zinc in air, water, and foodstuffs was carried out in two industrial districts of Dnipr. city and a "conditionally clean" district of a non-industrial city. To assess the prenosological state of health in the child contingent, 46 and 57 children from pre-school institutions in the observation areas city, aged 5 to 6 years and 20 children from the control area were examined in a similar way.
   Results. The average blood lead content in 70-100 % of children in industrial areas is 1.6-5 times higher than the normative and 9.5-30 times the control. In 33-66 % of the children examined in the industrial areas and 12 % of the controls, the urine lead concentration is 6.4-12.8 times higher than the standard. Hair lead concentration in preschoolers corresponds to the permissible level, but is 2-3.5 times higher than in the children from the control region, which was found in 73-78 % of the examined. Tooth lead concentration in the children from industrial areas is 4.6 times higher than the standard level recommended by WHO, and in the nail is 3.2 times the background values. The copper content in all biosubstrates of children is determined at the physiological level, and zinc - lower by 49-80 %. The elevated lead content in biosubstrates is accompanied by 1.2 and 1.9 times increase in urinary delta-ALA activity in the children from industrial areas as compared with the recommended norm, which was observed in 51-89 % of the children examined.
   Conclusions. The biochemical abnormalities identified in the body of children indicate the beginning of microsaturnism development, which in case of microelemental status violations, is the rationale for finding effective means of reducing the "lead pressure" on the child population health.

AB  - Maintenance has a critical role in the transportation industry, as it is the guarantee for public transportation in providing continuous and safe services. The current study aims to explore the maintenance practices employed by public transport sector and investigate the environmental impact of the common maintenance practices. A comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art literature related to maintenance practices and environmental sustainability key performance indicators was conducted. Then interviews with experts and practitioners in the buses maintenance domain were conducted. After that, a cross-sectional survey to validate the literature and interview findings was performed among a sample of 132 bus maintenance practitioners working in Dubai transport sector. The results revealed that preventive maintenance, corrective maintenance, and condition based maintenance are the most commonly practiced in bus maintenance. Furthermore, it was found that waste, noise, and emission measures should be considered while selecting the maintenance practices. Eventually, the results exhibited that Preventive Maintenance is the right maintenance practice when considering waste and noise pollution as environmental selection criteria. On the other hand, Corrective Maintenance is the suitable maintenance practice when considering the emissions as environmental selection criteria. It is very important to identify the most important environmental criteria when selecting the right maintenance practice. It is obvious that the selection of the proper maintenance practice should be aligned with the environmental sustainability requirements. We consider this new practice, that is to say, the environmental sustainability based maintenance as a unique maintenance strategy that can be considered not only in automotive maintenance, but also in different contexts involved in maintenance phase of different physical assets. It is recommended that this study be extended to study other sustainability aspects of maintenance practices such as the financial aspect and service availability aspect in addition to study other transportation modes such as taxi vehicles, metro, and marine vessels.

AB  - Achieving both high yield and high nitrogen (N) use efficiency (NUE) simultaneously is a current research hotspot in crop production. To investigate approaches for achieving high yield and NUE, field experiments using N fertilizer rates of 0, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 kg N ha(-1) were conducted to study relationships between yield, N uptake and N efficiency during three wheat growing seasons from 2013 to 2016 in three experimental sites (Shangshui, Kaifeng and Wenxian) in the Huang-Huai Plain. Yield, biomass and N concentrations of plants and soil were determined. The results indicated that increased N application would affect soil N residue and increase N2O emission, suitable N application rate (N240-N268) contributed to maintaining soil fertility and reducing N2O emission for achieving high yield, high NUE and low N2O emission. High plant N accumulation (PNA) during jointing to anthesis had the best correlation coefficient with yield and NUE compared to other growth stages, which contributed to achieving high yield and NUE simultaneously. The dry matter produced by a unit of N was defined as N productivity, such as plant N net phase productivity (PNPn) and leaf N productivity (LNP). High PNPn during jointing to anthesis was significantly related to both yield and NUE. The LNP indicator (i.e. photosynthetic N use efficiency, PNUE) in the flag showed significant correlation with both yield and NUE after booting under high PNA levels. These results suggest that PNPn and PNUE could combine high yield and high NUE under high PNA conditions. Besides, to match soil N supply to plant N demand, optimum soil nitrate Naccumulation and alkali-hydrolysable N(AHN) content ranges were determined. This study provides a theoretical basis to achieve high yield, high NUE and low N2O emission for N management in wheat field production. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Endometriosis is associated with benign but adversely developed cysts in the extrauterine environment. The oxidative imbalanced environment induces DNA damage and affects cell cycle progression of endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) and endometrial epithelial cells, but how endometriotic cells maintain proliferation in the presence of oxidative stress is not clear. Growing evidence has indicated that the ectopic hypoxic microenvironment and oxidative stress can stimulate the growth of endometriotic cells, which is mainly due to the increase of HIF-1 alpha. We found that the master hypoxia-associated miRNA miR-210-3p was increased in stromal and glandular cells of ectopic lesions compared with that of eutopic and normal endometria and was consistent with the expression of HIF-1 alpha and the local oxidative stress-induced DNA damage predictor 8-OHdG. Moreover, miR-210-3p was upregulated in ESCs and Ishikawa cells under hypoxic conditions but not in normoxic culture. Knockdown of miR-210-3p induced a G2/M arrest of ESCs and Ishikawa cells under hypoxia, while no effect was found under normoxia. BARD1 was identified as a target of miR-210-3p. BARD1 expression was decreased in endometriotic tissues compared with eutopic and normal endometria and negatively correlated with the expression of miR-210-3p. Multivariate regression analysis showed that BARD1 downregulation could serve as an indicator for endometriotic severity. Our results suggest that miR-210-3p attenuates the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint by inactivating BRCA1 complex function in response to DNA damage under hypoxia via targeting the 3' untranslated region of BARD1 mRNA. Endometriotic mouse model experiments showed that intraperitoneal injection of the miR-210-3p inhibitor or vitamin C suppressed the growth of endometriotic lesions. Together, our results demonstrate that endometriotic cells inhibit BARD1/BRCA1 function by upregulating miR-210-3p, which might be the underlying mechanism for endometriotic cell maintenance of growth in oxidative stress. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-210-3p and administration of vitamin C are promising approaches for the treatment of endometriosis.

AB  - Exceptional natural phenomena, such as those that occur during a total solar eclipse, provide unique opportunities to study animal behavior outside the naturally evolved context, which can be informative in more general terms. Circumstantial descriptions of abnormal animal behavior during solar eclipses abound, although scientific studies conducted during an eclipse are relatively rare due to inherent logistical difficulties. Here, honey bee foraging and homing behavior were studied during the total solar eclipse of August 21, 2017. In the first experiment, we studied foraging behavior of honey bees during the progression of the solar eclipse and found that the foraging activity drastically decreased but did not completely cease during the totality of the eclipse, in contrast to previous reports of complete cessation. The data indicate that the level of ambient light can largely overrule the internal circadian rhythm of foraging honey bees. Furthermore, colonies with a higher need for foraging decreased their foraging activity less than satiated colonies, consistent with the hypothesis that individual foraging decisions may be influenced by colony state, which affects cost-benefit analyses. In a second experiment, the temporal dynamics of homing of released workers and drones was compared in periods before, during, and after the solar eclipse. During the totality of the eclipse, very few bees arrived back at their hive, while homing before the total eclipse was accelerated, particularly in drones. The results suggest that, while the homing abilities of honey bees are not compromised until the sun is completely eclipsed, they may still interpret the diminishing light as an indicator of deteriorating flight conditions. Our unique study provides some insight into the control of honey bee foraging behavior when external cues and internal circadian rhythms are at odds, lent support to the notion that food deprivation can lead to riskier foraging, and indicated that homing in honey bees is possible even with very small amounts of sunlight.

AB  - In the process of evaluation it's important to determine the most fertile and early matured females of trout as the process of selection according to the weight isn't always correct. In order to solve this problem we present a research on the correlation between secondary and primary sexual characteristics of the Kamloops rainbow trout females. A quantitative correlation between an exterior, interior and morphological indicators and the gonads' weight has been revealed. As a result, it has been found out that the development of a one-year-old fish differs from the development of a two-year-old one. This is manifested in the uneven growth of individual characteristics. Arguably, secondary characteristics of one-year-old females influence the development of inner organs in an important way. Thus, correlation of the gonads' weight with the length of the postorbital part is 0.703 and with the width of the forehead 0.631. This statistic clearly shows that the volume of gills, quantity of gill rakers and arches influence the development of inner organs directly; to be exact they influence the maturity of gonads. Therefore, with the indirect selection according to these characteristics females will become mature quicker and they will be more enduring to changing conditions of the environment. Considerable changes take place when one observes biometrics of two-year-old females. The correlation between previously considered characteristics and reproductive products stays the same but new characteristics are added; they are pectoral fins and ventral fins. These characteristics are indirectly related to the weight and therefore, the length of a fish which stays true both for one-year-old and two-year-old females. To grow trout in the third fishing zone it's necessary to evaluate fish as soon as it is one or two years old in order to fasten the process of getting a new type of fish of the Volga region.

AB  - The Taihu Plain of the Lower Yangtze valley, China was a centre of rice agriculture during the Neolithic period. Reasons for the rapid development of rice cultivation during this period, however, have not been fully understood for this coastal lowland, which is highly sensitive to sea-level change. To improve understanding of the geomorphological and hydrological context for evolution of prehistoric rice agriculture, two sediment cores (DTX4 and DTX10) in the East Tiaoxi River Plain, south Taihu Plain, were collected, and analysed for radiocarbon dating, diatoms, organic carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15), grain size and lithology. These multiproxy analyses revealed that prior to ca. 7500 cal. yr BP, the East Tiaoxi River Plain was a rapidly aggrading high-salinity estuary (the Palaeo-Taihu Estuary). After ca. 7500 cal. yr BP, low salinity conditions prevailed as a result of strong Yangtze freshwater discharge. Subsequently, seawater penetration occurred and saltmarsh developed between ca. 7000 and 6500 cal. yr BP due to accelerated relative sea-level rise. This transgression event influenced a large area of the Taihu Plain during the Holocene, as shown by multiple sediment records from previous studies. Persistent freshwater marsh (or subaerial land) formed due to dramatic shrinkage/closure of the Palaeo-Taihu Estuary after ca. 5600 cal. yr BP when sea level was relatively stable. We speculate that geomorphological and hydrological changes of the East Tiaoxi River Plain played an important role in agricultural development across the Taihu Plain during the Neolithic period. The closure of the Palaeo-Taihu Estuary and the formation of stable freshwater marsh (or subaerial land) after ca. 5600 cal. yr BP were critical preconditions encouraging the rapid rise of rice productivity in the Liangzhu period (5500-4500 cal. yr BP). This development changed the landscape and river systems, and thus provided adequate freshwater supply to the Taihu Plain.

AB  - The common, shallow-water foraminiferan Haynesina germanica (Ehrenberg) is one of a growing number of benthic rotalids known to acquire phototrophy through chloroplast retention (kleptoplasty). This species is broadly distributed, tolerant to a range of environmental conditions, and has been identified as a potential bioindicator of moderately polluted settings. This study was undertaken to better understand the fine structural relationships of this foraminiferan and its sequestered chloroplasts. Individuals were selected from fresh field collections and prepared for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using high pressure freezing followed by freeze substitution (HPF/FS). This method is well-known for its high-resolution of cellular structure without many of the potential artifacts introduced by standard TEM chemical fixation. Features of the sequestered chloroplasts are consistent with those of diatoms, and pennate diatoms are the most likely source. The sequestered chloroplasts observed in H. germanica are surrounded by five membranes: the four chloroplast membranes of the diatom and an encompassing, outer vacuolar membrane of the foraminifer. Most of the chloroplast-containing vacuoles include a single chloroplast, but some contain up to three. The chloroplasts examined have numerous lamellae, each consisting of three thylakoids. The pyrenoid is traversed by a single lamella that contains a single thylakoid. Storage granules are present in some chloroplasts. Food vacuoles, common in many smaller benthic foraminifera, are rare in this species, which is consistent with its utilization of acquired phototrophy as documented by others. Both uninucleate (typically a gamont) and multinucleate (typically an agamont) individuals were observed, suggesting that this species has an alternation of generations like most benthic foraminifera. Other features of the cell body (e.g., abundant mitochondria, active Golgi bodies, multivesicular bodies, peroxisomes) are consistent with its occurrences in shallow-water, aerobic settings. In addition, fibrillar vesicles are common as are small pyriform electron-dense bodies of unknown origin or function. Vesicles that appear to accumulate wastes are also common.

AB  - Several research cases using remote sensing methods to analyze changes of storage and dynamics of groundwater aquifer were reviewed in this paper. The status of groundwater storage, in an area with regional scale, could be qualitatively inferred from geological feature, surface water altimetry and topography, distribution of vegetation, and difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration. These qualitative indicators could be measured by geological lineament analysis, airborne magnetic survey, DEM analysis, LAI and NDVI calculation, and surface energy balance modeling. It is certain that GRACE and InSAR have received remarkable attentions as direct utilization from satellite data for quantification of groundwater storage and dynamics. GRACE, composed of twin satellites having acceleration sensors, could detect global or regional microgravity changes and transform them into mass changes of water on surface and inside of the Earth. Numerous studies in terms of groundwater storage using GRACE sensor data were performed with several merits such that (1) there is no requirement of sensor data, (2) auxiliary data for quantification of groundwater can be entirely obtained from another satellite sensors, and (3) algorithms for processing measured data have continuously progressed from designated data management center. The limitations of GRACE for groundwater storage measurement could be defined as follows: (1) In an area with small scale, mass change quantification of groundwater might be inaccurate due to detection limit of the acceleration sensor, and (2) the results would be overestimated in case of combination between sensor and field survey data. InSAR can quantify the dynamic characteristics of aquifer by measuring vertical micro displacement, using linear proportional relation between groundwater head and vertical surface movement. However, InSAR data might now constrain their application to arid or semi-arid area whose land cover appear to be simple, and are hard to apply to the area with the anticipation of loss of coherence with surface. Development of GRACE and InSAR sensor data preprocessing algorithms optimized to topography, geology, and natural conditions of Korea should be prioritized to regionally quantify the mass change and dynamics of the groundwater resources of Korea.

AB  - Complementary mineralogical and geochemical datasets on fluvial, beach and dune samples collected along the Atlantic margin of subequatorial southwestern Africa are used to investigate the relationships between provenance and climatic controls on sediment composition and to test the reliability of different geochemical and mineralogical weathering proxies as climatic indicators. The studied N/S-trending coastal region is characterized by strong latitudinal and inland climatic gradients, and thus represents an excellent natural laboratory in which to study the effects of climatic-induced weathering on sediment composition. Although the mineralogy and geochemistry of suspended-load muds closely reflects the different weathering intensities over both latitudinal and inland climatic gradients, the composition of mud and sand samples are strongly affected by sediment provenance. Consequently, weathering parameters such as the alpha E-Al values (estimating the degree of depletion in element E relative to the UCC standard), display complex patterns of variation especially for sand samples. By assuming a typical order of bulk-sediment mobility Na > Ca > Sr > Mg > K > Ba approximate to Rb, anomalously high or low alpha(Al) values placing a specific element off the expected mobility order are considered as an indicator of source-rock control on sediment composition. The composition of detritus recycled from Meso-Cenozoic strata reflects the cumulative effect of successive sediment cycles, with recycling processes affecting to a different extent the diverse weathering proxies. In particular, alpha Na-Al appears to be more strongly affected by recycling in muds than in sands. Among all mineralogical and chemical parameters, those that correlate best with rainfall in the drainage areas are alpha Na-Al for sands, alpha Mg-Al for muds and smectite content (only in areas of low rainfall). In the geological and geomorphological setting of SW Africa these proxies turn out to be better climate estimators than the classical weathering indices CIA or WIP. This case study reminds us to carefully consider source-rock control and mixing with recycled detritus when drawing inferences on climatic conditions based on weathering indices.

AB  - Preferential flow is an important soil hydraulic property as it controls water flow and solute transport in saturated and near-saturated conditions. Preferential flow occurs in a small range of soil water potentials and soil structure predominantly controls soil water flow; it is thus challenging to model preferential flow using soil parametric variables. The aim of this study was to identify soil properties that affect macropore-type preferential flow. Thirty undisturbed soil samples were collected from the topsoil of a paddy field and adjacent grassland, and hydraulic conductivity (K) was measured at saturation and near saturation at different tension (h) values. Soil parametric and morphological features were then recorded in the laboratory. To evaluate correlations between K(h) and different soil properties, the log-log slope of K(h) at near saturation (s) was obtained for each sample by plotting logK versus logh. The values of s were then correlated with soil parametric and morphometric properties. Values of K-s ranged from 1.2 x 10(-6) to 7.5 x 10(-4) cm h(-1) with a mean of 3.77 x 10(-4) cm h(-1) and standard deviation (SD) of 2.14 x 10(-4) cm h(-1). Application of 7 cm tension resulted in an approximately 80-fold decrease in K-s. Values for s ranged from -3.64 to -0.98 with a mean of -2.32 and SD of 0.77. These results demonstrated that the soil clay content, cation exchange capacity, specific surface area, coefficient of linear extensibility, rupture resistance, and plasticity were negatively correlated with s, while BD, structure size, structure grade, pore number and pore size were positively correlated with s. A correlation analysis further revealed that soil clay content was the key variable controlling s in the studied soils. These findings suggest that s can be used as a physical soil indicator that links environmental impact, water, and solute dynamics in near-saturated and saturated soils.

AB  - Isocyanic acid (ICA) is one of the most abundant isocyanates formed during thermal decomposition of polyurethane (PUR), and other nitrogen containing polymers. Hot-work, such as flame cutting, forging, grinding, turning and welding may give rise to thermal decomposition of said polymers potentially forming significant amounts of ICA. A newly launched dry denuder sampler for airborne isocyanates using di-n-butylamine (DBA) demonstrated build-up of background ICA-DBA over time. Build-up of background ICA-DBA was not observed when stored at inert conditions (Ar atmosphere) for 84 days. Thus, freshly prepared denuders were used. The sampling efficiency of ICA using freshly prepared denuder samplers (0.2 L min(-1)), impinger + filter samplers (0.5 L min(-1)) using DBA and 1-(2-methoxyphenyl) piperazine (2MP)-impregnated filter cassette samplers (1 L min(-1)) was investigated. PTR-MS measurements of ICA were used as a quantitative reference. Dynamically generated standard ICA atmospheres covered the range 5.6 to 640 ppb at absolute humidities (AH) 4.0 and 16 g m(-3). Recovered ICA was found to be 73-115% (denuder), 89-115% (impinger + filter) and 62-100% (2MP filter cassette). The method limit of detection (LOD) was equal to an amount of ICA of 24 ng (denuder), 8.9 ng (impinger + filter) and 9.4 ng (2MP filter cassette). The PTR-MS LOD for ICA was 1.8 and 2.8 ppb in atmospheres with an AH of 4 and 16 g m(-3). Denuder samplers were used for personal (n = 176) and stationary (n = 31) air sampling during hot-work at six industrial sites (n = 23 workers). ICA was detected above method LOD in 66% and 58% of the personal and stationary samples, respectively. ICA workroom air concentrations were determined to be 1.8-320 ppb (median 12 ppb) (personal samples), and 1.5-44 ppb (median 6.6 ppb) (stationary samples).

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to measure the comparative efficiency of 18 Korean commercial banks under the presence of negative observations and examine performance differences among them by grouping them according to their market conditions.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors employ two data envelopment analysis (DEA) models such as a Banker, Charnes, and Cooper (BCC) model and a modified slacks-based measure of efficiency (MSBM) model, which can handle negative data. The BCC model is proven to be translation invariant for inputs or outputs depending on output or input orientation. Meanwhile, the MSBM model is unit invariant in addition to translation invariant. The authors compare results from both models and choose one for interpreting results.
   Findings - Most Korean banks recovered from the worst performance in 2011 and showed similar performance in recent years. Among three groups such as national banks, regional banks, and special banks, the most special banks demonstrated superb performance across models and years. Especially, the performance difference between the special banks and the regional banks was statistically significant. The authors concluded that the high performance of the special banks was due to their nationwide market access and ownership type.
   Practical implications - This study demonstrates how to analyze and measure the efficiency of entities when variables contain negative observations using a data set for Korean banks. The authors have tried two major DEA models that are able to handle negative data and proposed a practical direction for future studies.
   Originality/value - Although there are research papers for measuring the performance of banks in Korea, all of the papers in the topic have studied efficiency or productivity using positive data sets. However, variables such as net incomes and growth rates frequently include negative observations in bank data sets. This is the first paper to investigate the efficiency of bank operations in the presence of negative data in Korea.

AB  - Pharmaceuticals constitute an important environmental issue for receiving waters. A holistic approach, taking into consideration the sources of these compounds (hospitals, domestic use), discharges (wastewater effluent, combined sewer overflows) and related risks to the environment, is therefore needed to develop the best protection strategy.
   The substance flow analysis (SFA) approach, applied, for example, to the city of Lausanne, Switzerland, is an ideal tool to tackle these issues. Four substances were considered: one antibiotic (ciprofloxacin), an analgesic (diclofenac), and two anti-epileptics (carbamazepine and gabapentin). Consumption data for the main hospital of the city (916 beds) and for the population were available. Micropollutant concentrations were measured at different points of the system: wastewater inlet and outlet (WWTP), combined sewer overflows (CSO) and in the receiving waters (Vidy Bay, Lake Geneva). Measured and predicted concentrations were in agreement, except for diclofenac, for which analytical uncertainties were expected. Seven different scenarios were considered (supplementary treatment at the WWTP, at the hospital or at both places, etc.). Based on the results obtained, the supplementary treatment at the WWTP decreases the load of pharmaceuticals reaching surface water by a factor between 2 and 27, depending on the compound and on the technique. The treatment at the hospitals only influences the amount of ciprofloxacin reaching the environment and decreases the release by one third. The contribution of CSO to surface water pollution is low compared to that of the WWTP for the selected compounds. Regarding the risk for the receiving waters, ciprofloxacin was found to be the most problematic compound, with a risk quotient far above 1. In this particular case, a treatment at the WWTP is not sufficient to reduce the risk, and additional measures at the CSO or at the hospital should be considered. SFA is an ideal tool for developing the best strategy for pharmaceutical elimination, but its application depends on data availability and local conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Watershed exports of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, major solutes, and suspended sediments were examined during five water years in the Penobscot River basin, which forms part of the Gulf of Maine watershed. Mean annual exports of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the Penobscot River were 58 kg C ha(-1) year(-1), whereas cumulative yearly watershed flux of DOC during the study period ranged from 8.6 to 16.1 x 10(10) g C year(-1) and averaged 11.7 x 10(10) g C year(-1). Watershed exports of total soluble N (TN) and total soluble P in the Penobscot River averaged 1.9 and 0.02 kg ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. Companion studies in two other major Maine rivers indicated that mean annual exports of DOC and TN in the Androscoggin River were 40 kg C ha(-1) year(-1) and 2.0 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), whereas exports in the Kennebec River were 43 kg C ha(-1) year(-1) and 2.2 kg N ha(-1) year(-1). Extrapolation of results from this investigation and a previous complementary study indicates that estuaries and coastal waters in the Gulf of Maine receive at least 1.0 x 10(10) g N year(-1) and 2.5 x 10(11) g C year(-1) in combined runoff from the four largest Maine river basins. Soluble exports of Ca + Mg + Na minus wet deposition inputs of cations in the Penobscot system were approximately 1,840 mol(c) ha(-1) year(-1), which represents a minimum estimate of cation denudation from the watershed. Based on its low N and P export rates, the Penobscot River watershed represents an example of reference conditions for use as a benchmark in ecological assessments of river water quality restoration or impairment. In addition, the biogeochemical metrics from this study provide an historical baseline for analysis of future trends in nutrient exports from the Penobscot watershed as a function of changing climatic and land use patterns.

AB  - Domestic sewage is a potential source of contamination deteriorating water quality in rivers and coastal environments. The present study determined the concentrations of eight steroids in both filtrate and suspended particulate matter (SPM) samples collected monthly at the eight major riverine runoff outlets of the Pearl River Delta (PRD), South China, from March 2005 to February 2006. The concentration of the eight steroids (sum of which is defined as Sigma(8)steroid) in the filtrate and SPM samples ranged 16.7-1340 ng L-1 and 0.44 - 240 mu g g(-1), respectively. The filtrate samples contained the highest levels of cholesterol (CHOE) and stigmasterol (STIG) on average, whereas the SPM samples had the largest relative abundances of CHOE and coprostanol (COP). In general, larger proportions of the steroids were associated with SPM than with the filtrate phase. The combined (filtrate plus SPM) concentrations of COP in riverine runoff of the PRD were at the midpoint of the global range in surface water. The concentrations of Sigma(8)steroid and COP in SPM were not significantly correlated with particulate organic carbon (POC), riverine runoff, or SPM concentrations, which indicates the dominance of nonpoint input sources for the occurrence of steroids in the PRD. The annual riverine inputs of Sigma(8)steroid and COP were estimated at 360 and 31.6 tons yr(-1), respectively, and the monthly inputs of both Sigma(8)steroid and COP were positively correlated with monthly runoff discharge. Furthermore, the concentrations of Sigma(8)steroid, COP, and CHOE showed significant temporal and spatial variability. These results can be explained by a combination of climatic characteristics, socioeconomic conditions, and steroid sources. Analyses of the diagnostic indices of COP and background information suggested that riverine runoff from the PRD may have been affected by domestic wastewater, which appeared to be a major COP source to the Pearl River Estuary and South China Sea.

AB  - The effects of potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH2PO4) and bovine manure compost (BMC) on the degradation and metabolism of chlorothalonil were examined in a sandy loam soil under laboratory conditions. In non-sterilized, non-amended soil, chlorothalonil degradation half-life was 8.8 days. However, it was up to 19.0 days in sterilized non-amended soil, suggesting that the degradation rate was about 2-fold slower than that in non-sterilized non-amended soil. Biological mechanisms accounted for 54.7% of chlorothalonil degradation in non-sterilized soil, indicating that the indigenous microorganisms in soil play an important role in the degradation process. In non-sterilized soil, the more acutely toxic metabolite, 4-OH-chlorothalonil (HTI), of chlorothalonil started forming after the second day of incubation. The concentration of HTI reached its maximum level (2.9 g g- 1) at 10 days after treatment, and no further degradation of HTI was observed in the following span of 20 days (10-30 days of incubation). However, the degradation rate of chlorothalonil was decreased substantially by the addition of KH2PO4 with a half-life of 17.5 days. No formation of HTI was observed before 10 days of incubation and no significant difference of the metabolite concentration at the end of experiment was observed between KH2PO4-amended and non-amended treatments, which denoted that the addition of KH2PO4 did not reduce the formation of HTI in the longer incubation course. In BMC-amended soil, the degradation rate was about 1.8 times faster than in non-amended soil. At 30 days of incubation, both chlorothalonil and HTI were degraded to a lower level in BMC-amended soil than in non-amended soil. The application of farm litter is a common fertilizing practice in vegetable fields in China, and thus this practice could not only improve soil fertility but also promote the removal of chlorothalonil and its metabolite HTI to further increase safety in crop rotations.

AB  - The USDA Forest Service Forest Health Monitoring (FHM) program indicators, including forest mensuration, crown condition classification, and damage and mortality indicators were used in the Cadillac Brook and Hadlock Brook watershed forests at Acadia National Park (ANP) along coastal Maine. Cadillac Brook watershed burned in a wildfire in 1947. Hadlock Brook watershed, undisturbed for several centuries, serves as the reference site. These two small watersheds have been gauged and monitored at ANP since 1998 as part of the Park Research and Intensive Monitoring of Ecosystems Network (PRIMENet). Forest vegetation at Hadlock Brook was dominated by late successional species such as Acer saccharum, Fagus grandifolia, Betula alleghaniensis, Acer rubrum and Picea rubens. Forest vegetation at Cadillac Brook, on the other hand, was younger and more diverse and included those species found in Hadlock as well as early successional species such as Betula papyrifera and Populus grandidentata. Differences in forest species composition and stand structure were attributed to the severe wildfire that affected the Cadillac Brook watershed. Overall, the forests at these ANP watersheds were healthy with a low percentage (<= 22%) of trees showing symptoms of damage.
   Foliar nitrogen (N) concentrations were higher in A. rubrum and P. rubens trees growing in Hadlock Brook watershed, but differences were significant only for P. rubens. Foliar aluminum (Al) concentrations were also higher in both species growing in Hadlock Brook watershed but differences were significant only for A. rubrum. Foliar calcium (Ca) and manganese (Mn) concentrations, on the other hand, were significantly lower in Hadlock Brook watershed for both species. Foliar potassium (K) was significantly higher for P. rubens growing in Hadlock Brook. No differences in foliar concentrations of magnesium (Mg), phosphorus (P), boron (B), copper (Cu) and lead (Pb) were found between watersheds. The higher foliar N concentrations as well as higher foliar concentrations of Ca and Al might indicate early stages of N saturation and acidification in Hadlock Brook watershed as also suggested by Hadlock Brook stream N flux data in published PRIMENet studies at ANP.

AB  - The species composition of fragmented semi-natural grasslands may change over time due to stochastic local extinction and colonization events, successional change and/or as a response to changing management or abiotic conditions. The resistance of vegetation to change may be mediated through the effects of topography (slope and aspect) on soils and microclimate.
   To assess long-term vegetation change in British chalk grasslands, 92 plots first surveyed by F. H. Perring in 1952-53, and distributed across four climatic regions, were re-surveyed during 2001-03. Changes in vegetation since the original survey were assessed by comparing local colonization and extinction rates at the plot scale, and changes in species frequency at the subplot scale. Vegetation change was quantified using indirect ordination (Detrended Correspondence Analysis; DCA) and Ellenberg indicator values.
   Across all four regions, there was a significant decrease in species number and a marked decline in stress-tolerant species typical of species-rich calcareous grasslands, both in terms of decreased plot occupancy and decreased frequency within occupied plots. More competitive species typical of mesotrophic grasslands had colonized plots they had not previously occupied, but had not increased significantly in frequency within occupied plots.
   A significant increase in Ellenberg fertility values, which was highly correlated with the first DCA axis, was found across all regions. The magnitude of change of fertility and moisture values was found to decrease with angle of slope and with a topographic solar radiation index derived from slope and aspect.
   The observed shift from calcareous grassland towards more mesotrophic grassland communities is consistent with the predicted effects of both habitat fragmentation and nutrient enrichment. It is hypothesized that chalk grassland swards on steeply sloping ground are more resistant to invasion by competitive grass species than those on flatter sites due to phosphorus limitation in shallow minerogenic rendzina soils, and that those with a southerly aspect are more resistant due to increased magnitude and frequency of drought events.

AB  - A literature survey of the interactive effects of CO2 enrichment and temperature on plant development and growth, indicated that the responses cannot be interpreted within a simple framework. For example, although plant development is generally accelerated by increased temperature, CO2 enrichment can accelerate it even further in some instances, or CO2 enrichment may have neutral or even retarding effects in other cases. Where the temperature and CO2 effects are additive, it is argued that CO2 is operating in the same way as radiation to reduce a carbon limitation. If this were true, CO2 enrichment would be most likely to accelerate development in tropical regions during the low-radiation monsoon season.
   Similarly, while it would be expected that CO2-enrichment would have increasingly enhancing effects with increasing temperature on phytomass growth, this is not invariably the case. In extreme examples which followed the expected trend, plants grown in twice-normal CO2-enriched atmospheres performed progressively better than those grown at current levels of CO2 by 8.7% for every 1-degrees-C rise in temperature. However, the difference between the two CO2 treatments more commonly increased by only around 2% for every 1-degrees-C rise in temperature. Of examples examined, both sunflower and nodulated cowpea showed the reverse response to temperature, while non-nodulated cowpea, supplied with luxuriant levels of nutrition, showed no interaction with temperature but a strong interaction between CO2 and radiation. Other aspects of the environment such as nutrition and radiation strongly modify the responses to temperature. It is also clear that plant factors such as stage of development can alter the response to CO2. Long-term studies with several species are required which will take into account many environmental variables within a realistic envelope. One methodology for doing this is presented.
   There was no evidence among species that responses to CO2 arise through any consistent change in morphology such as via increased branching or increased leaf number. Plant plasticity is such that responses can be expressed in a variety of ways determined by other environmental variables.

AB  - Agricultural production plays an essential role in food security and economic development, but given its direct links within the environment, it is also an important driver of environmental degradation. It has become essential to not only produce more crops but doing it while maintaining or reducing the respective environmental impacts. A promising method for evaluating production efficiency is the nonparametric eco-efficiency analysis, which compares the economic value added against a composite environmental pressure indicator. This article proposes a novel method of evaluating the eco-efficiency scores, which does not depend on field survey data, but rather on multi-agent simulations. We present the first estimates of eco-efficiency for crop farms in the Amazon and Cerrado biomes in Brazil, identify regions and farm profiles that could be the focus of targeted interventions, and evaluate whether eco-efficiency scores could be improved using an alternative scenario. We combine a biophysical model with bioeconomic agentbased simulations to mimic land-use decisions of real-world farms. We then estimate the efficiency scores with an enhanced order-m estimator that conditions the efficiency estimates on explanatory variables, thus producing robust efficiency measures. Our simulations reveal that there are indeed differences in eco-efficiency estimates between macro-regions in the federal state of Mato Grosso. According to our simulations, the Southeast exhibited the greatest occurrences of inefficiencies, followed by the West macro-region. In our life-cycle inventory, sunflower cultivation had the lowest levels of environmental pressures. However, when evaluating it in a prospective scenario of infrastructure development, we could not observe a positive impact on efficiency. By using efficient computational methods, we replicate our simulations many times to create robust estimates that are more representative than a single field survey. In addition, our novel method combines simulated farm data with eco-efficiency analyses, allowing ex-ante impact evaluations where policy interventions can be tested before their implementation.

AB  - Vegetation Fractional Cover (VFC) is an important indicator of the condition of the terrestrial surface of the Earth. The dynamics of bare soil (BS), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) and photosynthetic vegetation (PV) fractions reveal patterns of growth, senescence, dormancy and regeneration. The dynamics also reveal trends in land cover and land use management across the globe. Analysis of satellite data has indicated increasing greenness of the land surface however the dynamics of the NPV and BS fractions are equally important indicators of many elements of ecosystem function and sustainability. In this study, we provide a comprehensive assessment of trends in VFC for the global terrestrial land surface based on a trend analysis over the period 2001-2018 using the Global Vegetation Fractional Cover Product. Trends were analysed by Mann-Kendell regressions over 18 years for each month of the year. Monthly maps of significant trend areas were aggregated to provide seasonal assessments. Areas and percentage areas of positive and negative trends were compiled for United Nations Subregions, Countries and Ecoregions. Significant negative trends in BS occurred across 20 M km2 of the terrestrial land surface. Although the areas of negative trends in BS were largest in China and India, the top 24 countries by area were widely distributed across the world. However, BS increased significantly across more than 11 M km2. Eleven of the top 24 ranked countries for area of increasing BS were in Africa. Substantial areas exhibited negative trends in NPV split between China and India where PV was increasing, and drylands in Asia and Africa where BS was increasing. Analysis of covariate factors at country scale inferred an association between significant increase in BS and long-term drought and increases in livestock populations. The positive trends in BS and negative trends in NPV are indicators of current and future risk for soil erosion, habitat change, and reduction in ecosystem health across heavily populated regions of the developing world.

AB  - Understanding phenotypic responses is crucial for predicting and managing the effects of environmental change on native species. Color and display size are typically used to evaluate the utilization value of ornamental plants, which are also important ornamental characters of Lonicera nervosa Maxim. (L. nervosa). However, there is limited documentation of its floral environmental adaptation. The environmental conditions for the development of an organism changes with altitudinal variation. The aim of this research was to find flower trait variability maintenance and the tradeoff among the organs in five different populations of L. nervosa growing at distinct altitudes. We investigated the distribution patterns of floral color, floral display, and biomass tradeoff along a 700-m altitude gradient from 2,950 to 3,650 m. One-way ANOVA analysis was performed to assess the variability of flower traits and floral color across different altitudes. Moreover, correlations and tradeoffs between flowers and vegetative organs were also observed at different altitude ranges. The results indicated that L. nervosa flowers had a strong adaptability along the elevation and divergent altitude range-specific patterns, which was divided by an altitude breakpoint at around 3,300 m. Below 3,300 m, petal lightness (petal L) decreased, but total floral display area (TFDA), individual floral dry mass (IFDM), and total floral dry mass (TFDM) increased with an increase in altitude. Whereas, above 3,300 m no significant difference was observed in petal L, TFDA, IFDM, and TFDM decreased slightly with an increase in altitude. The responsibility for the selection on floral color at a lower altitude was stronger than that at a higher altitude, while the selection agents on floral biomass had significant effects within the entire altitude range. However, the effects on floral biomass were opposite on both sides of 3,300 m. Thus, floral trait and floral color can be useful indicators for the domestication of horticultural plants and help to evaluate and initiate management and conservation actions.

AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) natural convection (NC) processes in heterogeneous porous media and associated energy losses and mixing processes are still poorly understood. Studies are limited to two-dimensional domains because of computational burden, worsened by heterogeneity, which may demand grid refinement at high permeability zones for accurate evaluation of buoyancy forces. We develop a meshless Fourier series (FS) solution of the natural convection problem in a porous enclosure driven by thermal or compositional variations. We derive the vector potential formulation of the governing equations for vertical and horizontal heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity and implement an efficient method to solve the spectral system with an optimized number of Fourier modes. 3D effects are induced either by heterogeneity or variable boundary conditions. The developed FS solution is verified against a finite element solution obtained using COMSOL Multiphysics. We evaluate entropy generation (viscous dissipation and mixing) indicators using FS expansions and assess how they are affected by heterogeneity. We define a large-scale Rayleigh number to account for heterogeneity by adopting an arithmetic average effective permeability. The FS solution is used to investigate the effect of the large-scale Rayleigh number and level of heterogeneity on NC processes and energy losses. Results show that increasing the Rayleigh number intensifies fluid flow, thus enhancing convective transfer, which causes a dramatic increase in total entropy generation. Both viscous dissipation and mixing (and thus chemical reactions in the solute transport case) increase. The third dimension effect, which also enhances flow and entropy indicators, is more pronounced at high Rayleigh numbers. Surprisingly, entropy variation indicators remain virtually unchanged in response to changes in heterogeneity, for fixed Rayleigh number, which we attribute to the arithmetic average permeability being indeed appropriate for NC in 3D. This study not only explores the effect of Rayleigh number and heterogeneity on natural convection processes and the associated entropy generation and mixing processes, but also provides a highly accurate solution that can be used for codes benchmarking.

AB  - Whey protein hydrolysate (WPH) is a potential functional ingredient in salmonid feeds, as a source of protein with a mixture of peptides of varying chain lengths and free amino acids, which possess antioxidative properties. A 12-week feeding trial was conducted to examine the effects of including low levels of WPH in Arctic charr diets and its effect on growth performance, feed intake and oxidative indicators. Six salmonid diets were formulated to contain WPH at inclusion levels of: 0.0, 1.0, 5.1, 10.1, 25.5 or 51.0 g/kg. Fish meal was included in the diets at a level of 81.6 g/kg and fish oil at 51.0 g/kg. Diets were fed to Arctic charr (average weight: 34.1 g; 30 fish / 130 l tank; 3 tanks / treatment). There were no significant differences in the overall body weight, weight gain, feed consumption, feed conversion ratio, protein efficiency ratio, specific growth rate, fork length, viscerosomatic index or hepatosomatic index of fish fed the experimental diets, nor were there any significant linear or quadratic effects related to WPH inclusion level. There were also no significant differences among treatments for the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) or ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) in liver samples. Although there were no significant differences in the growth performance and antioxidative capacity as a result of WPH inclusion, biological results-particularly at 5.1 g/kg WPH-warrant further study to fully evaluate the potential of WPH when oxidative stress is induced. Benefits of the dietary inclusion level of 5.1 g/kg WPH under normal conditions include 9% higher weight gain and feed consumption, lower TBARS values, and induction of oxidative stress mechanisms. Based on growth performance results alone, however, it appears WPH is an effective protein source at dietary inclusion levels up to 51.0 g/kg for juvenile Arctic charr.

AB  - Vulnerability to drought-induced embolism is a key trait that shapes drought resistance and that could be increasingly used to design climate-smart forest management guidelines and to anticipate the outcome of climate change on populations dynamics and ecosystems functioning. A panel of methods is currently available to measure embolism resistance. This makes crucial a proper identification of which methods are the most accurate for determining this trait. However, the measurement of embolism resistance is sensitive to numerous artifacts that may lead to large errors for a given species. In addition, not all methods are easily accessible because of the cost of some large equipment and/or certain lab facilities. The emergence of the easy and low cost Pneumatic method allows to perform vulnerability curves at high throughput. However, only few studies have evaluated the reliability of this method compared to others. In this study, we proposed a comparison of five methods that allowed to assess embolism resistance in eleven tree species with contrasting xylem anatomy and vessels length (six short vessel angiosperms, two tracheid bearing conifers and three long-vessel angiosperms), covering a large part of the range of embolism resistance observed in trees. Consistent results were obtained among all the methods for short-vessel angiosperm species. In tracheid-bearing conifers, the Pneumatic method overestimated vulnerability to embolism. In long-vessel species, the Pneumatic method led to inconsistent results with accurate vulnerability to cavitation curves (VCs) for one species but led to r-shaped VCs with a underestimation of incipient embolism for the two other ones. The comparison of VC parameters with turgor loss point is proposed as an indicator of the validity of the VCs. The conditions of validity, the advantages and pitfalls of the five methods are discussed. Our results warned against the widespread usages of some methods before rigorous validation tests have been performed.

AB  - Soil salinity has become a serious environmental abiotic stress limiting crop productivity and quality. The root system is the first organ sensing the changes in salinity. Root development under elevated salinity is therefore an important indicator for saline tolerance in plants. Previous studies focused on varietal differences in morphological traits of quinoa under saline stresses; however, variation in root development responses to salinity remains largely unknown. To understand the genetic variation in root development responses to salt stress of quinoa, we conducted a preliminary screening for salinity response at two salinity levels of a diverse set of 52 quinoa genotypes and microsatellite markers were used to link molecular variation to that in root development responses to salt stresses of represented genotypes. The frequency distribution of saline tolerance index showed continuous variation in the quinoa collection. Cluster analysis of salinity responses divided the 52 quinoa genotypes into six major groups. Based on these results, six genotypes representative of groups I to VI including Black quinoa, 2-Want, Atlas, Riobamba, NL-6 and Sayana, respectively, were selected to evaluate root development under four saline stress levels: 0, 100, 200 and 300 mM NaCl. Contrasts in root development responses to saline stress levels were observed in the six genotypes. At 100 mM NaCl, significant differences were not observed in root length development (RLD) and root surface development (RSAD) of most genotypes except Black quinoa; a significant reduction was observed in this genotype as compared to controls. At 200 mM NaCl, significant reduction was detected in RLD and RSAD in all genotypes showing this as the best concentration to discriminate among genotypes. The strongest inhibition of root development was found for all genotypes at 300 mM NaCl as compared to lower saline levels. Among genotypes, Atlas of group III shows as a saline-tolerant genotype confirming previous reports. Variation in root responses to salinity stresses is also discussed in relation to climate conditions of origins of the genotypes and reveal interesting guidelines for further studies exploring the mechanisms behind this aspect of saline adaptation.

AB  - The prevalence of skin lesions at the legs of dairy cows often serves as an indicator for animal welfare and is used as a measurement of adequacy of the present housing conditions. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of skin lesions at the carpus, tarsus, and stifle in Swiss dairy cows kept in tie stalls and to describe potential risk factors associated with the different types and severities thereof. Skin lesions and potential risk factors were assessed in 627 cows of 27 tie stall farms in a cross-sectional study. The associations of each outcome and the potential risk factors were assessed by means of logistic regression models using farm as the random factor. One odds ratio was obtained for each biologically relevant risk factor category and the final models were compared between the lesion types and locations. Tarsal lesions were recorded most frequently, with a prevalence of 62.2, 34.4, and 24.0% for moderate to severe hair loss, any severity of ulceration, and moderate to severe swelling, respectively. The prevalence of carpal lesions ranged from 54.4% for hair loss, over 7.7% for ulceration, to 6.1% for swelling, while stifle lesions were recorded less frequently with a prevalence of 18.6, 8.9, 3.4% for hair loss, ulceration, and swelling, respectively. The risk for various skin lesion types and locations significantly increased, when the concrete stall base was covered with a rubber mat and the bedding depth was low. Cows were at the lowest risk to develop skin lesions when they had more than 13 days of outdoor exercise per month. The prevalence of skin lesions in tied Swiss dairy cows is remarkably high and could possibly be reduced by providing the herd more frequent outdoor exercise and a well-cushioned, friction-absorbing and non-abrasive lying surface.

AB  - Purpose Bioremediation using microorganisms is a promising strategy to remediate soil with petroleum hydrocarbons. Streptomyces sp. Hlh1, an endophytic strain, has previously demonstrated the ability to degrade crude petroleum in liquid culture. To apply this strain at field scale, it is necessary to test its ability to colonize the soil, compete with native microbiota, and remove the petroleum hydrocarbons under unfavorable conditions. Herein, a study was conducted to evaluate the performance of Streptomyces sp. Hlh1 to remove crude petroleum from contaminated sterilized and non-sterilized soils.
   Materials and methods Soils samples, contaminated with 2%, 5%, and 10% of petroleum, were inoculated with Streptomyces sp. Hlh1, and incubated at 30 degrees C for 4weeks. At the end of bioremediation assays, the pollutant concentrations were determined by Gas chromatography flame ionization detector and the degradation rates were also calculated. The survival of the strain in the soil was estimated and the toxicity of metabolites was evaluated on Lactuca sativa.
   Results and discussion Streptomyces sp. Hlh1 was able to grow and remove total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), n-alkanes, and aromatic hydrocarbons found in soil samples. In sterilized soil samples, Streptomyces sp. Hlh1 removed up to 40% of TPH at an initial concentration of 10%. Whereas, the maximum TPH removal reached was 55% in non-sterilized soil at an initial concentration of 2%. In addition, it was observed that the degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons was more active than n-alkanes. The strain grew well and produced high biomass in contaminated soil. Lettuce seedling was found to be the adequate bioindicator to assess the toxicity of petroleum end products. Streptomyces sp. Hlh1 performed a successful bioremediation, which was confirmed through the phytotoxicity test.
   Conclusions The study shows the first insight of the contribution of free endophytic actinobacterial strain in the bioremediation of petroleum-contaminated soil; therefore, it suggests that Streptomyces sp. Hl1 can be usefully exploited at field scale.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the co-occurrence of some frequent fecal indicator bacteria and cyanobacteria species at San Roque reservoir (SRr), highlighting the relationship between their variability and environmental factors. This study was carried out at SRr (31 degrees 22 ' S, 64 degrees 27 ' O) located west of the city of Cordoba, Argentina. Physico-chemical measurements and sampling for microbiological and nutrient determinations were done at three recreational sites, during seasons of major touristic activity (spring-summer), with the aim of identifying temporal patterns of microorganism variability. In addition, we carried out laboratory experiments with local isolated bacteria (Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp.) and axenic Microcystis aeruginosa cultures to assess an association among these microorganisms and evaluate whether it was positive or negative. Our results showed an inverse relationship between cyanobacteria and thermotolerant coliform bacteria (TtC) at SRr, which was only observed when high cyanobacteria concentration occurred (>= 3.4 x 10(4) to 1.2 x 10(6) cell.mL(-1)). Experimental results also showed this type of relationship: E. coli and Enterococcus spp. decreased their growth in the presence of M. aeruginosa. In addition, it was observed that the variability of main phytoplanktonic species and TtC at SRr was mainly explained by temporal patterns, that is, the seasonal changes and the hydrological year. In summary, our data indicated that cyanobacteria high abundance during bloom periods could be an inhibiting factor for bacteria growth at SRr. Moreover, we demonstrated that nutrients such us P and N are not the main factors determining the variability of studied microorganisms in this eutrophic reservoir, but other factors, such as climatic conditions (temperature and precipitations), have a major influence. This study would provide a more comprehensive view on the dynamics of microorganism populations with sanitary relevance in eutrophic reservoirs.

AB  - Despite a wide number of toxicological studies that describe benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) effects, the metabolic mechanisms that underlie these effects in fish are largely unknown. Of great concern is the presence of BaP in aquatic systems, especially those in close proximity to human activity leading to consumption of potentially contaminated foods. BaP is a known carcinogen and it has been reported to have adverse effects on the survival, development and reproduction of fish. The purpose of this study was to investigate if a low dose of BaP can alter genes and key metabolic pathways in the liver and testis in male adult tilapia, and whether these could be associated with biological endpoints disruption. We used both high-throughput RNA-Sequencing to assess whole genome gene expression following repeated intraperitoneal injections of 3 mg/kg of BaP (every 6 days for 26 days) and morphometric endpoints as indicators of general health. Condition factor (K) along with hepatosomatic and gonadosomatic indices (morphometric parameters) were significantly lower in BaP-treated fish than in controls. BaP exposure induced important changes in the gene expression pattern in liver and testis as revealed by both Pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses. Alterations that were shared by both tissues included arachidonic acid metabolism, androgen receptor to prostate-specific antigen signaling, and insulin-associated effects on lipogenesis. The most salient liver-specific effects included: biological processes involved in detoxification, IL6-associated insulin resistance, mTOR hyperactivation, mitotic cytokinesis, spindle pole and microtubule binding. BaP effects that were confined to the testis included: immune system functions, inflammatory response, estrogen and androgen metabolic pathways. Taken together, gene expression and morphometric end point data indicate that the reproductive success of adult male tilapia could be compromised as a result of BaP exposure. These results constitute new insights on the mechanism of action of low dose BaP in a non-model organism (tilapia).

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effects of plant absence or presence on microbial properties and enzyme activities at different levels of salinity in a sandy clay soil. The treatments involved five salinity levels-0.5 (control), 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 dS m(-1) which were prepared using a mixture of chloride salts-and three soil environments (unplanted soil, and soils planted with either wheat or clover) under greenhouse conditions. Each treatment was replicated three times. At the end of the experiment, soil microbial respiration, substrate-induced respiration (SIR), microbial biomass C (MBC), and enzyme activities were determined after plant harvest. Increasing salinity decreased soil microbial properties and enzyme activities, but increased the metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) in both unplanted and planted soils. Most microbial properties of planted soils were greater than those of unplanted soils at low to moderate salinity levels, depending upon plant species. There was a small or no difference in soil properties between the unplanted and planted treatments at the highest salinity level, indicating that the indirect effects of plant presence might be less important due to significant reduction of plant growth. The lowered microbial activity and biomass, and enzyme activities were due to the reduction of root activity and biomass in salinized soils. The lower values of qCO(2) in planted than unplanted soils support the positive influence of plant root and its exudates on soil microbial activity and biomass in saline soils. Nonetheless, the role of plants in alleviating salinity influence on soil microbial activities decreases at high salinity levels and depends on plant type. In conclusion, cultivation and growing plant in abandoned saline environments with moderate salinity would improve soil microbial properties and functions by reducing salinity effect, in particular planting moderately tolerant crops. This helps to maintain or increase the fertility and quality of abandoned saline soils in arid regions.

AB  - Introduction. The analysis of fire statistics is one of the most important tasks in making managerial decisions by the State Fire Service. Ensuring fire safety in the state is a vital factor in adequate prediction of the number of fires. Therefore, the problem of qualitative mathematical modelling of fire statistics arises.
   The purpose of this article is the construction of adequate econometric models to forecast the number of fires in the different countries of the world.
   Results. Based on the latest statistics provided by the Centre for Fire Statistics of the International Association of Fire and Rescue Services (CTIF) for 2003-2015, the authors of the article conducted a multivariate analysis of variance analysis and examined the key factors affecting the number of fires worldwide, such as population size, the country's territory and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. The use of cluster analysis has made it possible to distinguish five groups of countries that have similar risk factors for fire. With regard to the examined factors, the authors propose time series models with a distributed lag for two countries, Ukraine and France, and forecasted future values for the number of fires.
   Conclusions. The factors affecting the number of fires in the country can be divided into two groups: objective (territory, natural and climatic conditions) and socio-economic (to reveal their impact, it is necessary to analyse such indicators as density of fires, population density and GDP per capita).
   Analysing the worked out models which include socio-economic and objective factors, we can conclude that for Ukraine and France the influence of social and economic factors differs. For Ukraine, the low population density factor is positive, i.e. it contributes to lowering the density of fires. For France, the situation is the opposite. The density of GDP per capita, by contrast, greatly contributes to reducing the density of fire cases in France, however in Ukraine its effect is manifested in a negative way.

AB  - The role of inland water in CO2 exchange with the atmosphere was evaluated on the basis of calculated partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) from sampling of 207 lakes and 84 reservoirs across China in late summer. The results suggested that almost 60% of these water bodies were supersaturated with CO2 with respect to atmosphere, and the collected reservoirs samples exhibited higher mean pCO(2) than lakes. The mean pCO(2) in fresh water lakes was about 3.5 times of the value in saline lakes. The lakes and reservoirs were divided into five groups (Inner Mongolia -Xinjiang plateau region, Tibetan Plateau region, Northeastern plain and mountainous region, Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau region, and Eastern plain region). The Yunnan- Guizhou Plateau region showed the highest pCO(2) compared with other regions, most likely due to the typical karst landforms, karst processes may promote aqueous CO2 concentration, and karstification has a significant effect on the capture of atmospheric CO2. Inner Mongolia -Xinjiang plateau and Tibetan Plateau region reserviors showed negative CO2 flux to atmosphere, other waters in this study all supersaturated with CO2 with respect to the atmosphere. A which We analyzed the relationship between pCO(2) and environmental variables, and results showed that some indicators had correlations with pCO(2) in individual region such as total phosphorus, dissolved organic matter, and total suspended solids, but the relationship could not be observed with all surveyed waters. This indicated that it might be much more effective in a smaller regional scale than the broadened scale when the environmental factors were used as the predictor of pCO(2) in lakes. Therefore, the common algorithm that extrapolates CO2 concentration or emission flux from the study region to a wider scale might not be accurate because of the changes in the environmental and water quality conditions.

AB  - Bioretention cells, which are generally effective in controlling surface runoff and recharging groundwater, have been widely adopted as low impact development practices. However, shallow groundwater has limited their implementation in some locations due to the potential problems of a reduction in surface runoff control, groundwater pollution, and continuous groundwater drainage through the underdrain. Many guidelines have established minimum requirements for the groundwater depth below bioretention cells, but they may not be optimized for certain environmental conditions and bioretention cell designs. This study made use of a variably saturated flow model to examine the hydrologic performance of a single bioretention cell in shallow groundwater with event-based simulations, considering a wide range of initial groundwater depths, media and in situ soil types, surface runoff loads, and underdrain sizes. Performance indicators (e.g., runoff reduction, time for infiltrated water to reach the bioretention cell bottom and the groundwater table, and height and dissipation time of groundwater mound) were evaluated to examine the processes of runoff generation, the formation and dissipation of groundwater mounds, and the bioretention cell's performance in a shallow groundwater environment. The most influential factors were the initial groundwater depth, the hydraulic conductivity of the media soil, and the rainfall runoff load. With a deeper initial groundwater table, infiltrated water took longer to reach the bioretention cell bottom and groundwater table. Groundwater mounds, however, took longer to dissipate even though they were smaller. The groundwater quality can be better protected if relatively less-permeable soil types (e.g., sandy loam) are used as the media, although it may compromise the performance in runoff quantity control. However, only very high surface runoff loads would cause concerns regarding a reduction in runoff quantity control and possible groundwater contamination due to the shallow groundwater. A distance of 1.5-3m between the bioretention cell bottom and the groundwater table is generally sufficient. The results of this study could help to guide the planning and design of bioretention cells in areas of shallow groundwater.

AB  - Solar-powered GPS transmitters linked to the GSM cellular transmission system are a powerful new tool for avian research. Data collection can be researcher programmed or use dynamic fix (DF) rates that are automatically adjusted in accordance with battery charge. Lack of prior knowledge of fix (location) collection rates represents an obstacle to designing studies with transmitters that use DF rates. We assessed the quantity and quality of data collected by a commercially available DF transmitter. To assess fix collection rates, factors influencing fix collection rates, GPS accuracy, and the ability of transmitters to differentiate movement from nonmovement, we used a combination of controlled static tests at known locations, deployments on free-ranging Black Vultures (Coragyps atratus) and Turkey Vultures (Cathartes aura), and motion tests. During static testing, transmitters often collected upwards of 500 fixes per day in open habitats with little cloud cover. Hourly fix rates varied, commonly reaching 1 fix min(-1) at midday but dropping to 1 fix hr(-1) at night. The numbers of daylight fixes collected during vulture deployments were greater on days with little cloud cover, positively correlated with increasing daily movement rates, and positively correlated with available daylight hours, likely due in part to increased solar radiation near the summer solstice. Mean horizontal GPS error was 7.8 m (+/- 12.2 m SD). Mean vertical error was 4.5 m (+/- 142 m) above true elevation. Speed records >0 km hr(-1) were reliable indicators of movement provided a 3D fix was obtained. Overall, the transmitters that we evaluated provided large volumes of data, but the inability to control data collection schedules may prove problematic for some applications.

AB  - Introduction - European animal welfare legislation (2008/119/EC) poses limitations on the current management practices of Valle d'Aosta breeders.
   Aim - The haematological profiles, salivary cortisol concentrations, and behavioural responses of Valdostana calves housed in either tie-stalls (TS) or multiple pens (MP) were evaluated in relation to the age at enclosure: very young calves (VYC 7-39 days) or young calves (YC 40-80 days).
   Materials and methods - Twenty-nine calves were divided into two age groups: VYC (12 females and two males) and YC (13 females and two males). Blood and saliva samples were collected at baseline, at 20 (T1) and at 40 days (T2) after enclosure in one of the two housing systems. Behaviour was analyzed by direct closed-circuit TV recording.
   Results - Salivary cortisol levels measured at 40 days were significantly higher in the VYC housed in TS than those housed in MP (P<0.01). Differences in haematological profiles were observed only in the animals that had entered indoor housing (TS or MP) at age >40 days. The VYC housed in TS spent more time in vigilant resting, tended to spend less time sleeping, and exhibited significantly more ruminant activity.
   Discussion - The type of enclosure for housing calves can affect haematological profiles, cortisol concentrations, and behaviours. A multidisciplinary approach is more effective for evaluating animal welfare than assessment investigating a single parameter.
   Conclusion - In this study, the hypothesis that MP housing could create stressful conditions in a breed selected for fighting behaviour was not confirmed by our data. The socioeconomic implications of different housing systems need to be studied in geographical areas with natural constraints, such as mountainous regions where local breeds are frequently reared. Animal welfare data on minor local breeds can be useful for informing practices and policies for maintaining biodiversity and breeding of local breeds.

AB  - The level of sustainability of animal production depends on the use of modern housing systems which ensure high productivity and quality of milk and meat, with the possibility of robotization of work, by simultaneously minimizing the negative impact on the environment, including energy inputs by using renewable energy sources and ensuring livestock animals' welfare. Livestock production, especially milk production, is a source of significant amounts of harmful gases such as carbon dioxide and ammonia. The main aim of the research was a multicriterial investigation of free-stall cattle barns for dairy cows taking into account sustainability of production. Twelve free-stall cattle barns were tested with boxed litter and non-litter systems, and with deep litter, four barns in each system. Original methodology was elaborated which allowed for the technological, economic and environmental assessment of cattle barns and their elements of infrastructure. The methodology scheme consisted of the following stages: stage 1 choice of objects for research, stage 2 characteristics of objects tested, stage 3 identification of key elements characteristic of the objects tested which are helpful for technical, technological, quality and economic assessment, stage 4 determination of these parameters, stage 5 model of final assessment and choice of the best, most convenient technological-functional solutions, stage 6 designing exemplary models.
   The parameters obtained from tests allowed the selection of the best solutions, to be applied in new designs which comply with the requirements of standards, including welfare, environmental protection and minimization of energy inputs. Based on research results, three model proposals of functional technological solutions for cattle barns were elaborated. The first proposed example was a free-stall boxed cattle barn with litter. The second best solution was a non-littered boxed cattle barn. The third model proposed was a cattle barn with deep litter. All three barns are considered to have very good micro climate parameters, by dint of the proper construction of the adjustable ventilation system. Also, investment costs and energy inputs could be at a level acceptable by investors thanks to high automation and robotization.

AB  - Remote sensing is a promising tool for plant phenotyping and precision farming, as it allows for non-invasive, fast and automated measurements of relevant plant traits with spatial and temporal resolution. The simplest and most used remote sensing application in the field is to use reflectance vegetation indices, based on the optical properties of chlorophyll, as indicators of variables of interest. However, the applicability is limited by their sensitivity to environmental conditions and canopy structure. Another remotely sensed signal related to chlorophyll is chlorophyll fluorescence. Compared to reflectance it is plant specific and directly linked to plant physiological processes; but it is also weak, which complicates its use for in-field applications. This study evaluates the performance of an active proximal remote sensing system utilizing the chlorophyll fluorescence ratio method, measuring the ratio of red fluorescence to far-red fluorescence (termed SFR), for the assessment of growth and biomass as an alternative or complement to reflectance vegetation indices.
   Basil plants were subject to chlorophyll fluorescence and weight measurements periodically throughout commercial growth cycles, both in a laboratory and commercial greenhouse environment. In the laboratory, SFR showed a strong linear relationship with dry weight on logarithmic scales. Further characterization of the method indicated that it is independent of background light and the same growth dynamics is obtained irrespective of point in time during chlorophyll fluorescence induction. The same trend that was observed in the laboratory was also observed in the greenhouse, but varying background light from the sun and from supplemental lighting added complexity that needs to be addressed in further studies. To our knowledge, the strong link between SFR and biomass, both in a closed environment and greenhouse setting, has not so clearly been demonstrated on canopy level before. Owing to the simplicity of the method, being relatively cheap and fast, it has potential for commercial applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study is to detect proxies from speleothems that are suitable for geochemical and paleoenvironmental research in Croatian karst (Dinaric karst and isolated karst of the Pannonian basin). The main subject is elemental composition and mineralogy of speleothems from various sites in Croatian karst and whether the different climatic, geological and hydrological characteristics of those karst regions affect elemental and mineralogical characteristics of speleothems in order to design and plan future research. Total of 37 speleothem samples from 32 caves in different geological, geomorphological and climatic zones of Croatian karst were collected. In all samples concentration of 30 elements was determined by ICP-MS and mineral composition was analyzed by XRD. In 82% of studied samples calcite is the only mineral identified. Minor minerals detected are: quartz, dolomite, muscovite/illite, chlorite and plagioclase. Besides the most abundant calcium, the elements with the highest concentrations (>500 mg/kg) are: Al, Fe, Si and Mg. Elements with the lowest concentrations recorded (<1 mg/kg) are: Be, Cd, Tl, W, Bi, U, As and Co. Besides Cd, other heavy metals used as anthropogenic contamination indicators have very low concentrations (<10 mg/kg). Statistical relationships between elements were established. A boxplot statistical method showed that largest numbers of anomalies are present in all three samples from Lukina jama located on Northern Velebit Mountain, where a whole series of elements, including many heavy metals, show extreme values (Pb, Cu, Zn, Mn, Ni, Cr, Co, Ba, K, Mg, Li, Be, Al, U, Si, Ti, W, Fe, As). Factor analysis showed that anomalies of element concentrations in most cases can be explained by local mineralogical conditions. This study will significantly contribute the knowledge about elemental and mineralogical composition of speleothems in Croatia, which are mostly determined by geogene influence.

AB  - To achieve fast and accurate analysis of carbamazepine in surface water, we developed a novel porous membrane-protected micro-solid-phase extraction (mu-SPE) method, followed by liquid chromatography-isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-IDMS/MS) analysis. The mu-SPE device (similar to 0.8 x 1 cm) was fabricated by heat-sealing edges of a polypropylene membrane sheet to devise a bag enclosing the sorbent. The analytes (both carbamazepine and isotope-labelled carbamazepine) were first extracted by mu-SPE device in the sample (10 mL) via agitation, then desorbed in an organic solvent (1 mL) via ultrasonication. Several parameters such as organic solvent for pre-conditioning of mu-SPE device, amount of sorbent, adsorption time, and desorption solvent and time were investigated to optimize the mu-SPE efficiency. The optimized method has limits of detection and quantitation estimated to be 0.5 ng L-1 and 1.6 ng L-1, respectively. Surface water samples spiked with different amounts of carbamazepine (close to 20, 500, and 1600 ng L-1, respectively) were analysed for the validation of method precision and accuracy. Good precision was obtained as demonstrated by relative standard deviations of 0.7% for the samples with concentrations of 500 and 1600 ng kg(-1), and 5.8% for the sample with concentration of 20 ng kg(-1). Good accuracy was also demonstrated by the relative recoveries in the range of 96.7%-103.5% for all samples with uncertainties of 1.1%-5.4%. Owing to the same chemical properties of carbamazepine and isotope-labelled carbamazepine, the isotope ratio in the mu-SPE procedure was accurately controlled. The use of mu-SPE coupled with IDMS analysis significantly facilitated the fast and accurate measurement of carbamazepine in surface water. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on stream restoration projects to benefit salmonids and other aquatic species across the Pacific Northwest, though only a small percentage of these projects are monitored to evaluate effectiveness and far fewer are tracked for more than 1 or 2 years. The Washington State Salmon Recovery Board and the Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board have spent more than US$500 million on salmonid habitat restoration projects since 1999. We used a multiple before-after-control-impact design to programmatically evaluate the reach-scale physical and biological effectiveness of a subset of restoration actions. A total of 65 projects in six project categories (fish passage, instream habitat, riparian planting, livestock exclusion, floodplain enhancement, and habitat protection) were monitored over an 8-year period. We conducted habitat, fish, and macroinvertebrate surveys to calculate the following indicators: longitudinal pool cross section and depth, riparian shade and cover, large woody debris volumes, fish density, macroinvertebrate indices, and upland vegetation condition class. Results indicate that four categories (instream habitat, livestock exclusions, floodplain enhancements, and riparian plantings) have shown significant improvements in physical habitat after 5 years. Abundance of juvenile Coho Salmon Oncorhynchus kisutch increased significantly at fish passage projects and floodplain enhancement projects, but significant results were not detected for other fish species. Moreover, the biological response indicators of juvenile salmonid abundance and macroinvertebrate indices showed declines at instream habitat and habitat protection projects, respectively. Our results indicate that a subset of projects can be effectively evaluated programmatically, but power and sample size estimates indicate that two or more years of preproject data are necessary to adequately determine the effectiveness of many project types, particularly for fish. Programmatic evaluations of project effectiveness should include adequate preproject sampling and multiseason monitoring for fish species to address issues of variability that are likely to be encountered in large-scale monitoring programs.

AB  - Background: Iron overload cardiomyopathy that prevails in some forms of hemosiderosis is caused by excessive deposition of iron into the heart tissue and ensuing damage caused by a raise in labile cell iron. The underlying mechanisms of iron uptake into cardiomyocytes in iron overload condition are still under investigation. Both L-type calcium channels (LTCC) and T-type calcium channels (TTCC) have been proposed to be the main portals of non-transferrinic iron into heart cells, but controversies remain. Here, we investigated the roles of LTCC and TTCC as mediators of cardiac iron overload and cellular damage by using specific Calcium channel blockers as potential suppressors of labile Fe(II) and Fe(III) ingress in cultured cardiomyocytes and ensuing apoptosis.
   Methods: Fe(II) and Fe(III) uptake was assessed by exposing HL-1 cardiomyocytes to iron sources and quantitative real-time fluorescence imaging of cytosolic labile iron with the fluorescent iron sensor calcein while iron-induced apoptosis was quantitatively measured by flow cytometry analysis with Annexin V. The role of calcium channels as routes of iron uptake was assessed by cell pretreatment with specific blockers of LTCC and TTCC.
   Results: Iron entered HL-1 cardiomyocytes in a time-and dose-dependent manner and induced cardiac apoptosis via mitochondria-mediated caspase-3 dependent pathways. Blockade of LTCC but not of TTCC demonstrably inhibited the uptake of ferric but not of ferrous iron. However, neither channel blocker conferred cardiomyocytes with protection from iron-induced apoptosis.
   Conclusion: Our study implicates LTCC as major mediators of Fe(III) uptake into cardiomyocytes exposed to ferric salts but not necessarily as contributors to ensuing apoptosis. Thus, to the extent that apoptosis can be considered a biological indicator of damage, the etiopathology of cardiosiderotic damage that accompanies some forms of hemosiderosis would seem to be unrelated to LTCC or TTCC, but rather to other routes of iron ingress present in heart cells.

AB  - The Hindu Kush-Himalayan (HKH) region is characterized by a variety of climatic conditions from tropical to alpine. It has been documented that the rates of warming in the HKH region are significantly higher than the global average and that the warming is occurring at much higher rates in the high-altitude regions than in the low-altitude regions. Mountainous environments are considered sensitive indicators of climate change. Hence this study examined the potential impact of global warming on the HKH region by applying Hadley Centre's high-resolution regional climate model PRECIS (Providing Regional Climates for Impact Studies) to 3 subregions: the western, central, and eastern Himalaya. The physical mechanisms that drive warming are different for the 3 regions, and the western Himalaya has 2 major rainy seasons, whereas the central and eastern Himalaya have only one. This study therefore focused on the common rainy season (June-September), during which all 3 regions receive the highest proportion of their annual rainfall. The 3 PRECIS simulations that correspond to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's A1B emissions scenario were carried out for a continuous period from 1961 to 2098. They were validated with high-resolution (0.25 degrees latitude x 0.25 degrees longitude) data provided by the Asian Precipitation-Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of the Water Resources (APHRODITE) project and by the US National Centers for Environmental Prediction and National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis data. The model was reasonably effective in simulating the monsoon climate over the HKH region. The climate projections were examined over the short (2011-2040), medium (2041-2070), and long term (2071-2098). The model projections indicate that significant warming will occur throughout the HKH region toward the end of the 21st century. Summer monsoon precipitation is expected to be 20-40% higher in 2071-2098 than it was in the baseline period (1961-1990). The 3 Quantifying Uncertainty in Model Predictions simulations show large differences in projections in the western Himalaya.

AB  - The Pre-Andean area of Chile exhibits saline soils of volcanic origin naturally contaminated with arsenic (As), and we hypothesise that revegetation with resistant species may be a valid alternative for soil management in this area. Thus, the xerophytic and halophytic shrubs Atriplex halimus and Atriplex atacamensis were cultivated in containers for 90 days in Pre-Andean soil, As-soil, (111 +/- 19 mg As kg(-1), pH 8.4 +/- 0.1) or control soil (12.7 +/- 1.1 mg As kg(-1), pH 7.8 +/- 0.1) to evaluate As accumulation and resistance using stress bioindicators (chlorophylls, malondialdehyde (MDA) and total thiols). Sequential extraction of As-soil indicated that 52.3% of As was found in the most available fraction. The As distribution was significantly different between the species: A. halimus translocated the As to leaves, whilst A. atacamensis retained the As in roots. At 30 and 90 days, A. halimus showed similar As concentrations in the leaves (approximately 5.5 mg As kg(-1)), and As increased in stems and roots (up to 4.73 and 163 mg As kg(-1), respectively). In A. atacamensis, As concentration was lower (2.6 in leaves; 3.2 in stems and 6.9 in roots in mg As kg(-1)). Both species exhibited a high concentration of B in leaves (362-389 mg kg(-1)). If the plants are used for animal feed, it should be considered that A. halimus accumulates higher concentration of As and B in the leaves than A. atacamensis. Neither plant growth nor stress bioindicators were negatively affected by the high levels of available As, with the exception of MDA in the leaves of A. halimus. The results indicate that these plants resist contamination by arsenic, accumulating mainly the metalloid in the roots and can be recommended to generate plant cover in As-contaminated soils in the Pre-Andean region, under saline conditions controlled, preventing the dispersion of this metalloid via wind and leaching.

AB  - Fossil pollen records have been widely used as indicators of past changes in vegetation and variations in climate. The driving mechanisms behind these vegetation changes have, however, remained unclear. In order to evaluate vegetation changes that have occurred in the northern part of the Tibetan Plateau and the possible drivers behind these changes, we have applied a moving-window Redundancy Analysis (RDA) to high resolution (10-15 years) pollen and sedimentary data from Lake Kusai covering the last 3770 years. Our analyses reveal frequent fluctuations in the relative abundances of alpine steppe and alpine desert components. The sedimentary proxies (including total organic carbon content, total inorganic carbon content, and "end-member" indices from grain-size analyses) that explain statistically some of the changes in the pollen assemblage vary significantly with time, most probably reflecting multiple underlying driving processes. Climate appears to have had an important influence on vegetation changes when conditions were relatively wet and stable. However, a gradual decrease in vegetation cover was identified after 1500 cal a BP, after which the vegetation appears to have been affected more by extreme events such as dust-storms or fluvial erosion than by general climatic trends. Furthermore, pollen spectra over the last 600 years are shown by Procrustes analysis to be statistically different from those recovered from older samples, which we attribute to increased human impact that resulted in unprecedented changes to the vegetation composition. Overall, changes in vegetation and climate on the northern part of the Tibetan Plateau appear to have roughly followed the evolution of the Asian Summer Monsoon. After taking into account the highly significant millennial (1512 years) periodicity revealed by time-series analysis, the regional vegetation and climate changes also show variations that appear to match variations in the mid-latitude westerlies.

AB  - Natural water has been disinfected using TiO2 as the fixed catalyst incorporated in a homemade photoreactor, in which the dimensions and the design parameters are representative of devices that are currently employed at larger scale. The catalyst was immobilized on the external surface of a cylinder of frosted glass situated in the longitudinal axis of a tubular glass reactor. Two alternative methods of immobilizing the catalyst on glass were studied: in the first, a commercial titanium oxide powder (Aeroxide (R) TiO2 P25) was mounted on a polymeric support; and in the second, it was applied by sol-gel deposition. Illumination was effected by installing the glass reactor in the irradiation chamber of a solar simulator. Under laboratory conditions, groundwater contaminated with cultured and wild bacteria was treated photocatalytically, and the influence of the photolysis, the pumping, and the catalysts was studied. The results obtained have demonstrated that the catalyst immobilized in the interior of the photoreactor presents similar results, in the disinfection of E. coli, as 0.5 g/l of TiO2 P25; and that, in 1.5 h approximately of simulated solar illumination (167 kW(UVA) s/m(2)) on the sol-gel deposit of TiO2, it is possible to eliminate 100% of the bacteria covered by international regulations in respect of water for human consumption. With regard to the aging assay of the system, it was observed at 250 h of operation a reduction in the effectiveness of the disinfection process. At 0 and 250 h of operation, the percentages of elimination of E. coli after 50 min of illumination were 100% and 99.5%, respectively. This reduction in the effectiveness of the process was due to the formation of a film of calcium carbonate adhering to the internal glass wall of the photoreactor, which is in contact with the liquid being treated, and to the presence of calcium carbonate precipitates on catalyst surface.

AB  - Seasonal changes in macroinvertebrate taxon abundances that are related to life history introduce temporal variation into macroinvertebrate community structure that can potentially confound bioassessments. In this study, macroinvertebrates from three rural and three urban streams were sampled monthly to assess temporal variability in community structure, determine how taxon life-cycle seasonality affects this variability, and determine if this temporal variability confounds biotic index interpretations. Temporal variation in taxon abundances was higher in the rural streams than in the urban streams, and 17 of 23 indicator taxa from rural streams exhibited, or are known to exhibit, either fast- or slow-seasonal life cycles. Conversely, five taxa were identified as indicators for urban streams, but only two of these taxa exhibited seasonal life cycles. Further, the life-cycle seasonality of many rural stream indicator taxa appeared to be linked to the seasonality of environmental conditions such as hydrologic permanence and benthic leaf detritus availability.
   Macroinvertebrate bioassessment index (MBI) scores were higher in the rural streams than in the urban streams during all months except June, July, and October when no difference was detected. We attribute the reduced discriminatory power of the MBI in the summer and early autumn to the life-cycle of a single taxon (Stenelmis sp.), and its effects on % Clingers - a component metric of the MBI. Stenelmis sp. exhibited a non-seasonal life cycle with a larval development time of approximately 12 months with considerable overlapping of cohorts present during the summer and early autumn when an extended first instar recruitment period was evident. During this overlap period, urban stream MBI values increased resulting in no statistical difference in the MBI between urban and rural streams in June, July, and October. Analyses of temporal variability in taxon abundances and life-history characteristics, as completed in this study, can greatly contribute to the creation and/or validation of bioassessment protocols.

AB  - The paper addresses the sensitivity of a novel method for quantifying the environmental risks associated with the current-driven transport of adverse impacts released from offshore sources (e.g. ship traffic) with respect to the spatial resolution of the underlying hydrodynamic model. The risk is evaluated as the probability of particles released in different sea areas hitting the coast and in terms of the time after which the hit occurs (particle age) on the basis of a statistical analysis of large sets of 10-day long Lagrangian trajectories calculated for 1987-1991 for the Gulf of Finland, the Baltic Sea. The relevant 21) maps are calculated using the OAAS model with spatial resolutions of 2, 1 and 0.5 nautical miles (nm) and with identical initial, boundary and forcing conditions from the Rossby Centre 3D hydrodynamic model (RCO, Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute). The spatially averaged values of the probability and particle age display hardly any dependence on the resolution. They both reach almost identical stationary levels (0.67-0.69 and ca 5.3 days respectively) after a few years of simulations. Also, the spatial distributions of the relevant fields are qualitatively similar for all resolutions. In contrast, the optimum locations for fairways depend substantially on the resolution, whereas the results for the 2 nm model differ considerably from those obtained using finer-resolution models. It is concluded that eddy-permitting models with a grid step exceeding half the local baroclinic Rossby radius are suitable for a quick check of whether or not any potential gain from this method is feasible, whereas higher-resolution simulations with eddy-resolving models are necessary for detailed planning. The asymptotic values of the average probability and particle age are suggested as an indicator of the potential gain from the method in question and also as a new measure of the vulnerability of the nearshore of water bodies to offshore traffic accidents.

AB  - Carbonates of the 1640 million years (Ma) old Barney Creek Formation (BCF), McArthur Basin, Australia, contain more than 22 different C-40 carotenoid derivatives including lycopane, gamma-carotane, (3-carotane, chlorobactane, isorenieratane, beta-isorenieratane, renieratane, (beta-renierapurpurane, renierapurpurane and the monoaromatic carotenoid okenane. These biomarkers extend the geological record of carotenoid derivatives by more than 1000 million years. Okenane is potentially derived from the red-colored aromatic carotenoid okenone. Based on a detailed review of the ecology and physiology of all extant species that are known to contain okenone, we interpret fossil okenane as a biomarker for planktonic purple sulfur bacteria of the family Chromatiaceae. Okenane is strictly a biomarker for anoxic and sulfidic conditions in the presence of light (photic zone euxinia) and indicates an anoxic/oxic transition (temporarily) located at less than 25 m depth and, with a high probability, less than 12 m depth. For the BCF, we also interpret renierapurpurane, renieratane and beta-renierapurpurane as biomarkers for Chromatiaceae with a possible contribution of cyanobacterial synechoxanthin to the renierapurpurane pool. Although isorenieratane may, in principle, be derived from actinobacteria, in the BCF these biomarkers almost certainly derive from sulfide-oxidizing phototrophic green sulfur bacteria (Chlorobiaceae). Biological precursors of gamma-carotane, beta-carotane and lycopane are found among numerous autotrophic and almost all phototrophic organisms in the three domains of life. In the BCF, a paucity of diagnostic eukaryotic steroids suggests that algae were rare and, therefore, that cyanobacterial carotenoids such as beta-carotene, echinenone, canthaxanthin and zeaxanthin are the most likely source of observed beta-carotane. gamma-Carotane may be derived from cyanobacteria, Chlorobiaceae and green non-sulfur bacteria (Chloroflexi), while the most likely biological sources for lycopane in the BCF are carotenoids of the lycopene, rhodopin and spirilloxanthin series abundant in purple sulfur bacteria.

AB  - The second meta-analysis of the Italian studies on short-term health effects of air pollution, known as MISA-2, was based on daily time series of indicators of both pollution and of health outcomes. It covered 15 cities during 1996-2002 for a total population of approximately nine millions. Health outcomes included mortality for natural causes. for respiratory diseases and for cardiovascular conditions, as well as hospital admissions for respiratory, cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases. Pollutants considered in univariate analyses were sulphur dioxide (SO2) nitrogen oxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), suspended particulate matter (SPM) measuring less than 10 mu m diameter (PM10) and ozone (O-3, limited to the summer period). Results, including risk estimates, have been largely confirmatory of findings obtained in previous large meta-analytic studies carried out in North America and in Europe. A full report in Italian is available. The present contribution summarises the results of MISA-2 and addresses three major issues regarding their interpretation: robustness of the causal inferential process, the role of specific air pollutants and the reliability of risk estimates. The former issue is stressed according to Bradford Hill's criteria and the conclusion is reached that at least for the association of air pollution with an increase in mortality the evidence for causality is strong. Assessing the role of each air pollutant is problematic: there is some evidence that the effects of PM10 are partly confounded by other pollutants, but PM10 may not be the best indicator of the role of air SPM (routine measures of PM2.5 have not been introduced in Italy). As for risk estimates, the per cent increase in risk of mortality for unit increase in PM10 concentration, measured in MISA-2, is remarkably similar to estimates in other studies and there is indication for linearity of the dose-response relationship.

AB  - We examined patterns of variation in richness, diversity, and composition of understory vascular plant communities in mixedwood boreal forests of varying composition (broadleaf, mixedwood, conifer) in Alberta, Canada, before and for 2 years following variable-retention harvesting (clearcut, 20 and 75% dispersed green tree retention, control). Broadleaf-dominated forests differed from mixedwood or conifer-dominated forests in that they had greater canopy cover, litter depth, soil nitrogen, warmer soils, as well as greater shrub cover, herb and shrub richness and diversity (plot scale). In contrast, conifer, and to a lesser extent mixedwood, forest had greater beta diversity than broadleaf forest. Overall, mixedwood and conifer forests were similar to one another, both differed from broadleaf forest. Several species were found to be significant indicators of broadleaf forest but most of these also occurred in the other forest types. Understory composition was related to canopy composition and edaphic conditions. Variable-retention harvesting had little effect on understory cover, richness, or diversity but resulted in reduced richness and beta diversity at a larger scale. The clearcut and 20% treatments affected composition in all forest types. Early successional species and those common in disturbed sites were indicators of harvesting while evergreen, shade-tolerant understory herbs were indicators of the control forest and 75% retention harvest. We conclude that it is important to maintain a range of variation in canopy composition of mixedwood forests in order to conserve the associated understory communities. The presence of conifers in these forests has a particularly important influence on understory communities. The threshold for a lifeboat effect of variable-retention harvesting is between 20 and 75% retention. Examination of richness and beta diversity at a variety of scales can provide interesting information on effects of harvesting on spatial reorganization and homogenization of understory plant communities.

AB  - Social approach is crucial for establishing relationships among individuals. In rodents, social approach has been studied primarily within the context of behavioral phenomena related to sexual reproduction, such as mating, territory defense and parental care. However, many forms of social interaction occur before the onset of reproductive maturity, which suggests that some processes underlying social approach among juvenile animals are probably distinct from those in adults. We conducted a longitudinal study of social investigation (SI) in mice from two inbred strains to assess the extent to which genetic factors influence the motivation for young mice to approach one another. Early-adolescent C57BL/6J (B6) mice, tested 4-6 days after weaning, investigated former cage mates to a greater degree than BALB/cJ (BALB) mice, irrespective of the sex composition within an interacting pair. This strain difference was not due to variation in maternal care, the phenotypic characteristics of stimulus mice or sensitivity to the length of isolation prior to testing, nor was it attributable to a general difference in appetitive motivation. Ultrasonic vocalization (USV) production was positively correlated with the SI responses of mice from both strains. Interestingly, several USV characteristics segregated with the genetic background of young mice, including a higher average frequency and shorter duration for the USVs emitted by B6 mice. An assessment of conditioned place preference responses indicated that there was a strain-dependent difference in the rewarding nature of social contact. As adolescent mice aged, SI responses gradually became less sensitive to genetic background and more responsive to the particular sex of individuals within an interacting pair. We have thus identified a specific, genetic influence on the motivation of early-adolescent mice to approach one another. Consistent with classical theories of motivation, which propose a functional relationship between behavioral approach and reward, our findings indicate that reward is a proximal mechanism through which genetic factors affect social motivation during early adolescence.

AB  - Covert bacteria-harboring long-term micropropagated culture of grape that was sanitized of associated microbes as assessed through the indexing of tissue and medium for several passages (Thomas and Prakash (2004) In Vitro - Plant 40:603-607) showed reemergence of bacteria in a section of cultures (3/40) during the subsequent screening. Similarly, long-term propagated triploid watermelon cultures showed bacterial reentry in some sub-stocks (2/14) during their extended monitoring post-antibiotic treatment (Thomas et al. (2006) Plant Cell Tiss Org Cult, 85:317-329). Each of the three grape sub-stocks showed single bacterium, identified as Bacillus pumilus (x2) or Brevibacillus sp. (x1) based on 16S rDNA sequence analysis with 100% similarity to 'ARBG2' and 'ARBG1' isolates respectively, retrieved originally from grape stocks as long-term alcohol-surviving spore-forming covert contaminants. The two isolates from watermelon included Brevibacillus sp. (ARBG1) and B. pumilus (AuRB-WM1), the latter distinct from the 'ARBG2' isolate. The chance of bacterial re-entry through endophytic survival or during culture handling appeared remote on account of the tissue indexing employed and the care taken. Monitoring the autoclaves for proper functioning using chemical, physical and biological indicators, sealing the vessels to protect from microscopic vectors and scrutinizing the autoclaved medium for microbial growth all pointed the contaminant source to occasional vessel-adhering residual spores from the previous covertly contaminated cycle(s) that were not recognized as contaminated. Such spores withstood the standard autoclaving either due to their high heat resistance or some conditions typical to tissue culture vessels, and the proportion of vessels showing carry-over inoculum increased with the number of passages of culturing with the organism. The problem due to these hardy spore-forming bacteria was circumvented through double autoclaving of culture vessels with the first one a day prior to the medium preparation

AB  - The objective was to establish a minimum soil quality dataset for a long-term tillage, residue management and rotation trial for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) production systems. Based on this soil quality evaluation, sustainable management practices could be selected for transferring technologies to farmers in the region. A long-term experiment was conducted with 16 different crop management practices varying in: (1) rotation (continuous maize or wheat and both phases of the rotation of maize and wheat), (2) tillage (conventional and zero) and (3) crop residue management (full retention or removal for fodder). Superior soil quality was considered to represent the maintenance of high productivity without significant soil or environmental degradation. The pertinent, minimum soil quality data set included the following physical indicators: time-to-pond, aggregate stability, permanent wilting point, and topsoil penetration resistance. Chemical indicators were: soil C, N, K and Zn concentrations, measured in the 0-5 cm topsoil and C, N concentration in 5-20 cm. Multivariate analysis grouped the treatments into clusters: (1) zero tillage with retention of residue, (2) zero tillage with residue removal and (3) conventional tillage. Zero tillage combined with crop residue retention improved chemical and physical conditions of the soil. In contrast, zero tillage with removal of residues, led to high accumulation of Mn in the topsoil, low aggregate stability, high penetration resistance, surface slaking resulting in low time-to-pond values and high runoff. Finally, soil quality under conventional tillage was intermediate (irrespective of residue management), especially reflected in the physical status of the soil. The results provide a strong justification to promote zero tillage technology combined with appropriate residue management to farmers in the volcanic highlands of Central Mexico and other similar regions. The minimum data set and associated tools for careful monitoring and observation, will be essential for evaluating soil quality in farmer's fields. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper describes the design, synthesis, and the characterization of the two new chromogenic crown ethers 2,2'-[1,4,10,13-tetraoxa-7,16-diazacyclooctadecane-7,16-diylbis(methylene)]bis[4- [(1-methyl-4-(1H)-pyridinylidene)ethylidene]-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-one (KBC-001) and the lipophilic derivative 2,2'-[1,4,10,13-tetraoxa-7,16-diazacyclooctadecane-7,16-diylbis(methylene)]bis[4-[(1-dodecyl-4-(1H)-pyridinylidene)ethylidene]-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-one (KBC-002). A merocyanine dye that forms a betainic structure upon intramolecular charge transfer and shows solvent polarity dependent spectral sensitivity was selected as the chromophore system to develop the new chromoionophores. This approach allows the design of overall electrically neutral ligands bearing charged groups without the need of external counter ions. A proton ionizable group in the dye moiety acts as a charged ion-binding site and is an integral part of a lariat crown ether ionophore. A chromoionophore for calcium ion sensing has been developed, which combines the size-selective binding character of a crown ether with strong electrostatic attraction between the positively charged calcium ion and two negatively charged lariat side arms in the overall neutral compound. This water-soluble dye selectively responds to the presence of calcium ions in water at pH 8.5 with a dynamic response range between 10 muM and 10 mM. The binding event can be monitored both by absorption spectrometry and by fluorescence spectrometry. No cross-sensitivity was found for the physiologically important cations Mg2+, Li+, Na+, and K+ up to concentrations of 0.1 M under the same experimental conditions. In contrast to the water-soluble reagent KBC-001, the lipophilized derivative KBC-002 having two long alkyl chains was successfully applied to ion-exchange type optode membranes made from plasticized poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC). The dynamic response range of the optode at pH 9.0 was between 10 muM and 10 mM while retaining the high calcium selectivity. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Assessment of injury to fish and wildlife resources in the Grand Calumet River and Indiana Harbor Area of Concern, USA
T2  - ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - This article is the second in a series of three that describes the results of a Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) conducted in the Grind Calumet River and Indiana Harbor Area of Concern (IHAOC). The assessment area is located in northwest Indiana and was divided into nine reaches to facilitate the assessment. This component of the NRDA was undertaken to determine if fish and wildlife resources have been injured due to exposure to contaminants that are associated with discharges of oil or releases of other hazardous substances. To support this assessment, information was compiled on the chemical composition of sediment and tissues; on the toxicity of whole sediments, pore water, and elutriates to fish; on the status of fish communities:, and on fish health. The data on each of these indicators were compared to regionally relevant benchmarks to assess the presence and extent of injury to fish and wildlife resources, The results of this assessment indicate that injury to fish and wildlife resources has occurred throughout the assessment area, with LIP to five distinct lines of evidence demonstrating injury within the various reaches. Based on the frequency of exceedance of the benchmarks for assessing sediment and tissue chemistry data, total polychlorinated biphenyls is the primary bioaccumulative contaminant of concern in the assessment area. It is important to note, however, that this assessment was restricted by the availability of published bioaccumulation-based sediment quality guidelines, tissue residue guidelines, and other benchmarks of sediment quality conditions. The availability of chemistry data for tissues also restricted this assessment in certain reaches of the assessment area. Furthermore, insufficient information was located to facilitate identification of the substances that are causing or substantially contributing to effects on fish (i.e., sediment toxicity, impaired fish health, or impaired fish community structure). Therefore, substances not included on the list of COCs cannot necessarily be considered to be of low priority with respect to sediment injury (e.g., metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, alkanes, alkenes, organochlorine pesticides, phthalates, dioxins, and furans, etc.).

AB  - Soil quality appears to be an ideal indicator of sustainable land management. Soil is the foundation for nearly all land uses. Soil quality, by definition, reflects the capacity to sustain plant and animal productivity, maintain or enhance water and air quality, and promote plant and animal health. By reflecting the basic capacity of the soil to function, it integrates across many potential uses. Nonetheless, few land managers have adopted soil quality as an indicator of sustainable land management. There are a number of constraints to adoption. Most could be overcome through a concerted effort by the research community. Specifically, we need to address the following issues: (1) demonstrate causal relationships between soil quality and ecosystem functions, including biodiversity conservation, biomass production and conservation of soil and water resources. True calibration of soil quality requires more than merely comparing values across management systems; (2) increase the power of soil quality indicators to predict response to disturbance. Although then are many indicators that reflect the current capacity of a soil to function, there are few that can predict the capacity of the soil to continue to function under a range of disturbance regimes. Both resistance and resilience need to be considered; (3) Increase accessibility of monitoring systems to land managers. Many existing systems are too complex, too expensive, or both; (4) Integrate soil quality with other biophysical and socio-economic indicators. Effective early-warning monitoring systems will require not just the inclusion of both biophysical and socio-economic indicators, but also the development of models that incorporate feedbacks between soil quality and socio-economic conditions and trends and (5) Place soil quality in a landscape context. Most ecosystem functions depend on connections through time across different parts of the landscape. In conclusion, soil quality is a necessary but not sufficient indicator of sustainable land management. Its value will continue to increase as limitations are diminished through collaboration between scientists, land managers and policymakers. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The occurrence of trace fossil assemblages dominated by arthropod trackways and surface grazing trails within Carboniferous tidal rhythmites has puzzled sedimentologists and ichnologists, who interpreted them either as marine or nonmarine. The Virgilian (Stephanian) Tonganoxie Sandstone Member (Stranger Formation) at Buildex Quarry (eastern Kansas) consists, for the most part, of planar-laminated coarse-grained siltstones deposited on an upper tidal flat, close to or at the fluvial-estuarine transition of a macrotidal estuarine paleovalley. Recurrent thickness fluctuations demonstrate the strong influence of tidal processes and provide evidence that these deposits are tidal rhythmites, with thicker strata representing spring tides and thinner ones recording neap tides. The Buildex sequence hosts a moderately diverse ichnofauna composed of arthropod trackways (Dendroidichnites irregulare, Diplichnites gouldi, Diplopodichnus bifurcus, Kouphichnium isp., Mirandaichnium famatinense, Stiallia pilosa, Stiaria intermedia), grazing traces (Gordia indianaensis, Helminthoidichnites tenuis, Helminthopsis hieroglyphica), subsurface feeding traces (Treptichnus bifurcus, T. pollardi, irregular networks), apterygote insect resting and feeding traces (Tonganoxichnus buildexensis, T. ottawensis), fish traces (Undichna britannica, U. simplicitas), and tetrapod trackways. In contrast to trace fossil assemblages from brackish-water estuarine settings, the Buildex ichnofauna is characterized by moderate to relatively high ichnodiversity, ichnotaxa commonly present in terrestrial/freshwater environments, dominance of surface trails and absence of burrows, dominance of temporary structures produced by a mobile deposit-feeder fauna, a mixture of traces belonging to the Scoyenia and Mermia ichnofacies, moderate density of individual ichnotaxa, and absence of monospecific suites. This ichnofauna is thought to record the activity of a typical freshwater/terrestrial benthos. The presence of this mixed freshwater/terrestrial ichnofauna in tidal rhythmites is regarded as indicative of tidal flats that were developed in the most proximal zone of the inner estuary under freshwater conditions, more precisely in a zone between the maximum limit of landward tidal currents and the salinity limit further towards the sea. Although lithofacies distribution in estuarine valleys is mainly salinity-independent, the distribution of benthos is not. Accordingly ichnologic studies have the potential to provide a high-resolution delineation of fluvio-estuarine transitions.

AB  - This paper emphasizes some aspects of soil protozoology related to agriculture, viz. farming systems, biocides, and biodiversity. Ecofarming slightly increases abundances and biomasses of soil protozoa and stimulates soil life in general. Agroecosystems are more sensitive to conventional farming practices than grasslands, especially under severe climatic conditions, e.g, water stress, The increased soil life under ecofarming is not associated with an increased crop yield. In contrast, yield decreases more or less distinctly. However, the yield loss is usually partially or completely compensated by the reduced operating expenses (energy input) per crop unit. Thus, ecofarming appears to be a useful practice, especially for sustaining biodiversity.
   The effects of biocides on soil protozoa can be summarized as follows: (1) The general pattern of reaction of soil protozoa to biocide stress is the same as that of other organisms; (2) Many protozoan species seem to be just as sensitive to pesticides as other more commonly used test organisms; (3) Insecticides are usually more toxic than herbicides and disturb soil protozoa critically, i.e, populations often do not fully recover within 60 days; (4) Fungicides have rather varied effects but most of them very likely do not influence soil protozoa critically. There is still a great need for comprehensive, well-designed field studies on the effects of biocides on soil protozoa, especially testate amoebae.
   Literature on protozoan species diversity in agroecosystems is sparse, highly scattered, and burdened with misidentifications. Our own data indicate that species richness of ciliates is usually only slightly decreased, and is sometimes even higher, in agroecosystems as compared with neighbouring natural biotopes. This contrasts with species richness of testate amoebae, which is invariably and distinctly (greater than or equal to 50%) reduced by agriculture, leaving an impoverished version of the original, much more diverse community. Testate amoebae are thus highly sensitive bioindicators in agroecosystems. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Thermal denaturation of the B form of double-stranded DNA has been probed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Raman spectroscopy of 160 base pair (bp) fragments of calf thymus DNA. The BSC results indicate a median melting temperature T-m = 75.5 degrees C with calorimetric enthalpy change (Delta H-cal = 6.7 kcal/mol (bp), van't Hoff enthalpy change Delta H-vH = 50.4 kcal/mol (cooperative unit), and calorimetric entropy change Delta S-cal = 19.3 cal/deg . mol (bp), at the experimental conditions of 55 mg DNA/ml in 5 mM sodium cacodylate at pH 6.4. The average cooperative melting unit [n(melt)] comprises 7.5 bp. The Raman signature of 160 bp DNA is highly sensitive to temperature. Analyses of several conformation-sensitive Raman bands indicate the following ranges for thermodynamic parameters of melting: 43 < Delta H-vH < 61 kcal/mol (cooperative unit), 75 < T-m < 80 degrees C and 6 < [n(melt)] < 9 bp, consistent with the DSC results. The changes observed in specific Raman band frequencies and intensities as a function of temperature reveal that thermal denaturation is accompanied by disruption of Watson-Crick base pairs, unstacking of the bases and disordering of the B form backbone. These three types of structural change are highly correlated throughout the investigated temperature range of 20 to 93 degrees C. Raman bands diagnostic of purine and pyrimidine unstacking, conformational rearrangements in the deoxyribose-phosphate moieties, and changes in environment of phosphate groups have been identified. Among these, bands at 834 cm(-1) (due to a localized vibration of the phosphodiester group), 1240 cm(-1) (thymine ring) and 1668 cm(-1) (carbonyl groups of dT, dG and dC), are shown by comparison with DSC results to be the most reliable quantitative indicators of DNA melting. Conversely, the intensities of Raman marker bands at 786 cm(-1) (cytosine ring), 1014 cm(-1) (deoxyribose ring) and 1092 cm(-1) (phosphate group) are largely invariant to melting and are proposed as appropriate standards for intensity normalizations.

AB  - The progressive improvement of hygienic conditions in the workplace has increased the importance of obtaining detailed information on extra-occupational factors that might influence the levels of the biological indicators. This information is indispensable both when subjects belonging to the general population are selected for establishing 'reference values' and when subjects occupationally exposed to specific chemical substances are studied. In nonoccupationally exposed subjects the biological indicator levels may be influenced by circumstances which enhance absorption of the substance in question. Examples of interference factors considered for biological indicators of main metals are: gender, age, smoking habits, alcohol consumption and dietary habits. In occupationally exposed subjects the levels of the biological indicators can be influenced by factors that interfere with the metabolism of the substances absorbed in the workplace. In particular, factors such as alcohol, drugs and tobacco appear to play an important role in modifying the biological indicator levels in the occupationally exposed. Ethanol can inhibit as well as induce the metabolism of solvents. Inhibition occurs after excessive ingestion of ethanol, whereas induction occurs in subjects who regularly consume alcohol. There are several examples of inhibition of the metabolism of solvents by alcohol in man, occurring at levels of exposure frequently encountered in the workplace, also within the 'occupational exposure limits', (GEL). Conversely, there are very few studies on the effects of induction, which presumably occur only when the exposure levels greatly exceed GEL. Among drugs, analgesics seem to play a particular role in interfering with the metabolism of solvents. Since cigarette smoking is frequently associated with alcohol ingestion at present it is difficult to extrapolate the isolated effect of smoking on the metabolism of solvents. In order to facilitate interpretation of the results of biological monitoring, we propose to prepare informative sheets for the main substances which will contain information on factors that can influence the levels of the indicators.

AB  - BackgroundNon-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as sanitary measures and travel restrictions, aimed at controlling the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), may affect the transmission dynamics of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). We aimed to quantify the contribution of the sales of hand hygiene products and the number of international and domestic airline passenger arrivals on HRSV epidemic in Japan.MethodsThe monthly number of HRSV cases per sentinel site (HRSV activity) in 2020 was compared with the average of the corresponding period in the previous 6years (from January 2014 to December 2020) using a monthly paired t-test. A generalized linear gamma regression model was used to regress the time-series of the monthly HRSV activity against NPI indicators, including sale of hand hygiene products and the number of domestic and international airline passengers, while controlling for meteorological conditions (monthly average temperature and relative humidity) and seasonal variations between years (2014-2020).ResultsThe average number of monthly HRSV case notifications in 2020 decreased by approximately 85% (p<0.001) compared to those in the preceding 6years (2014-2019). For every average yen1 billion (approximately 680,000/$9,000,000) spent on hand hygiene products during the current month and 1month before there was a 0.29% (p=0.003) decrease in HRSV infections. An increase of average 1000 domestic and international airline passenger arrivals during the previous 1-2months was associated with a 3.8x10(-4)% (p<0.001) and 1.2x10(-3)% (p<0.001) increase in the monthly number of HRSV infections, respectively.Conclusions This study suggests that there is an association between the decrease in the monthly number of HRSV cases and improved hygiene and sanitary measures and travel restrictions for COVID-19 in Japan, indicating that these public health interventions can contribute to the suppression of HRSV activity. These findings may help in public health policy and decision making.

AB  - The zero-waste project in Turkey, which was started in 2017, is planned to be implemented until 2023, starting from public institutions and organizations. However, in refectories where high amounts of organic waste are generated, these organic wastes are generally transported to the landfill site by the municipalities and, consequently, they go beyond the scope of the zero-waste project. In this study, the anaerobic treatment of refectory wastes based on the scope of the zero-waste approach in Turkey has been developed as an innovative and holistic approach. As a result of the informing studies in the refectories, the waste of bread could be zero, while the waste of meals could not be zero, but a significant decrease in meal waste was found. In addition, this holistic approach has also strengthened recycling. Anaerobic digestion was selected to complete the zero-waste target for food wastes that are still generated. In the study using the UASB reactor operated in mesophilic conditions (36.5-37 degrees C), feeding has been done with approximately 21.9 kg VSadded m(-3) OLR in 10-day HRT. As a result, it was observed that the production of biogas and organic fertilizers from food waste using anaerobic technologies is an important solution on behalf of realizing the zero-waste application. The results showed that 1 kg of food waste with 62 +/- 3.2% solid content could produce 640 L of biogas with approximately 62.2 +/- 0.6% methane content. In addition, a 26.2-L bio-fertilizer with an average COD concentration of 3354 +/- 106 mg L-1 was produced. This research paper with a successful method at the Adiyaman University in Turkey focuses on the goal of zero waste. This study illustrated how it is possible to implement an effective initiative to reduce food waste with a holistic approach.

AB  - Take-off is a critical phase of flight, and many birds jump to take to the air. Although the actuation of the hindlimb in terrestrial birds is not limited to the sagittal plane, and considerable non-sagittal plane motion has been observed during take-off jumps, how the spatial arrangement of hindlimb muscles in flying birds facilitates such jumps has received little attention. This study aims to ascertain the 3D hip muscle function in the magpie (Pica pica), a bird known to jump to take-off. A musculoskeletal model of the magpie hindlimb was developed using mu CT scans (isotropic resolution of 18.2 mu m) to derive bone surfaces, while the 3D muscle path definition was further informed by the literature. Function was robustly characterized by determining the 3D moment-generating capacity of 14 hip muscles over the functional joint range of motion during a take-off leap considering variations across the attachment areas and uncertainty in dynamic muscle geometry. Ratios of peak flexion-extension (FE) to internal-external rotation (IER) and abduction-adduction (ABD) moment-generating capacity were indicators of muscle function. Analyses of 972 variations of the 3D muscle paths showed that 11 of 14 muscles can act as either flexor or extensor, while all 14 muscles demonstrated the capacity to act as internal or external rotators of the hip with the mean ratios of peak FE to IER and ABD moment-generating capacity were 0.89 and 0.31, respectively. Moment-generating capacity in IER approaching levels in the FE moment-generating capacity determined here underline that the avian hip muscle function is not limited to the sagittal plane. Together with previous findings on the 3D nature of hindlimb kinematics, our results suggest that musculoskeletal models to develop a more detailed understanding of how birds orchestrate the use of muscles during a take-off jump cannot be restricted to the sagittal plane.

AB  - Objectives
   The primary objective of this review was to conduct a systematic critical appraisal of published literature, in order to assess the evidence regarding the impact of cat group size on cat wellbeing in the domestic home. The secondary objectives were to: (i) identify additional social and environmental mediators of cat wellbeing in these contexts; and (ii) identify general limitations within the current evidence and provide recommendations for future studies.
   Methods
   A systematic search of electronic databases (Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar) was conducted using targeted Boolean phrasing. Papers were retained for appraisal of full text where they included a comparison of both single (n = 1) and multi-cat (n > 2) domestic housing conditions and/or comparison of different multi-cat group sizes, within a single study; or where they compared outcome measures that were either behavioural and/or physiological and deemed as relevant indicators of cat wellbeing.
   Results
   A total of 1334 unique papers were returned, 15 of which were retained. Of these papers, only four stated their primary aim to be an investigation of links between cat group size and cat wellbeing. Overall, the reviewed papers did not indicate consistent directions of effects regarding cat group size and outcome measures relevant to wellbeing. This was similar for the other social and environmental mediators identified.
   Conclusions and relevance
   Inconsistency in results is likely due to the substantial methodological variation, limitations in measures used as indicators of wellbeing and limitations in general study designs and reporting. Results also highlight the complex, multifactorial relationships between cat wellbeing and various social and environmental factors. These may be as, if not more, important than absolute numbers of cats residing within a household. Due to the various limitations and general paucity of research, further studies are recommended to provide a suitable evidence base regarding impacts of multi-cat living on cat wellbeing in domestic environments.

AB  - This study presents Mg and Fe isotopic data for a suite of volcanic rocks including basalt, trachyte and comendite from Changbaishan, northeast China. Our results show that the Millennium Eruption (ME) trachytes and comendites have delta Mg-26 ranging from 0.37 to 0.14%. Combined with literature data, the positive correlation between delta Mg-26 and 87Sr/86Sr ratios and the almost constant value for Nd isotopes suggest that the heavy Mg isotopic composition most likely derived from involvement of weathered products of basalt instead of the old supracrustal/basement rocks. Iron isotopic composition is significantly varied throughout our suite of samples, with delta Fe-56 values of 0.17 +/- 0.04% and 0.16 +/- 0.03% for basalts, 0.09 to 0.23% for cone-construction trachytes, and 0.23 to 0.37% for the ME samples. The slightly higher delta Fe-56 than MORB observed in basalts reflect the role of subducted materials that could elevate source Fe3+/SFe ratios via redox reaction. The trachytes from the cone construction, thought to be significantly affected by chemical weathered product, have a restricted Fe isotopic variation, while those ME samples with less weathered product input have overall higher delta Fe-56 values. This contrasting Fe isotopic signature suggests that the paleo-weathering event likely occurred under oxidized environment, leaving the residue with little Fe isotope fractionation. By contrast, the good correlations between Fe isotopes and indicators of magmatic differentiation (e.g., tFe(2)O(3), SiO2, Mg#) in all rocks reflect that fractional crystallization under an open system most likely accounts for the Fe isotopic variation, which was enhanced by the compositional effect as suggested by the broadly positive relationship between delta Fe-56 and (Na + K)/ (Ca + Mg). This study therefore highlights the potential applications of Mg-Fe isotopes as great tracers of redox condition and ancient climate.

AB  - Root exudates are part of the rhizodeposition process, which is the major source of soil organic carbon (C) released by plant roots. This flux of C is believed to have profound effects on C and nutrient cycling in ecosystems. The quantity of root exudates depends on the plant species, the period throughout the year, and external biotic and abiotic factors. Since root exudates of mature trees are difficult to collect in field conditions, very little is known about their flux, especially in water-limited ecosystems, such as the seasonally hot and dry Mediterranean maquis. Here, we collected exudates from DNA-identified roots in the forest from the gymnosperm Cupressus sempervirens L. and the evergreen angiosperm Pistacia lentiscus L. by 48-h incubations on a monthly temporal resolution throughout the year. We examined relationships of the root exudate C flux to abiotic parameters of the soil (water content, water potential, temperature) and atmosphere (vapor pressure deficit, temperature). We also studied relationships to C fluxes through the leaves as indicators of tree C balance. Root exudation rates varied significantly along the year, increasing from 6 mu g C cm(-2) root day(-1) in both species in the wet season to 4- and 11-fold rates in Pistacia and Cupressus, respectively, in the dry season. A stepwise linear mixed-effects model showed that the three soil parameters were the most influential on exudation rates. Among biotic factors, there was a significant negative correlation of exudation rate with leaf assimilation in Cupressus and a significant negative correlation with leaf respiration in Pistacia. Our observation of enhanced exudation flux during the dry season indicates that exudation dynamics in the field are less sensitive to the low tree C availability in the dry season. The two key Mediterranean forest species seem to respond to seasonal changes in the rhizosphere such as drying and warming, and therefore invest C in the rhizosphere under seasonal drought.

AB  - Since most toxicological risk assessments are based on individual single-species tests, there is uncertainty in extrapolating these results to ecosystem assessments. Herein, we successfully developed a mediated microbial electrochemical biosensor with mixed microorganisms for toxicity detection by microelectrode array (MEA). In order to fully mobilize all the mixed microorganisms to participate in electron transfer to amplify the current signal, 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ) was used as the lipophilic mediator to mediate the intracellular metabolic activities. Hydrophilic K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] was employed as an extracellular electron acceptor to transport electrons from hydroquinone (HQ) to the working electrode. Under the optimal conditions of 50 mM phosphate buffer solution (PBS), 0.4 mM BQ, 10 mM K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] and OD600= 0.5 bacteria concentration, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values measured with the composite-mediated respiration (CM-RES) of BQ-K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] for Cu2+, Cd(2+)and Zn(2+)were 5.95, 7.12 and 8.86 mg L-1, respectively. IC(50)values obtained with the single mediator K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] were 2.34, 5.88 and 2.42 mg L(-1)for the same samples. The results indicate that the biosensor with the single mediator K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] had higher sensitivity to heavy metal ions than the biosensor with composite mediators. After verification, we found that the addition of BQ cannot amplify the current. The IC(50)value of 0.89 mg L(-1)for BQ was obtained using K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] as the single mediator. This suggests that BQ is highly toxic, which explained why the sensitivity of the biosensor with the combined mediator BQ-K-3[Fe(CN)(6)] was lower than that of the biosensor with the single mediator K-3[Fe(CN)(6)]. At the same time, this also implies that toxicity itself cannot be ignored when it is used as an electronic mediator in a mediated microbial electrochemical biosensor.

AB  - Introduction To achieve universal health coverage, the Government of India has introducedAyushman Bharat - Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB - PMJAY),a large tax-funded national health insurance scheme for the provision of secondary and tertiary care services in public and private hospitals. AB - PMJAY reimburses care for 1573 health benefit packages (HBPs). HBPs are designed to cover the treatment of diseases/conditions with high incidence/prevalence or which contribute to high out-of-pocket expenditure. However, there is a dearth of reference cost data against which provider payment rates can be assessed. Methods and analysis The CHSI (Cost of Health Services in India) study will collect cost data from 13 Indian states covering 52 public and 40 private hospitals, using a mixed economic costing methodology (top-down and bottom-up), to generate unit costs for the HBPs. States will be sampled to capture economic status, development indicators and health service utilisation heterogeneity. The public sector hospitals will be chosen at secondary and tertiary care level. One tertiary facility will be selected from each state. At secondary level, three districts per state will be selected randomly from the district composite development score ranking. The private sector hospital sample will be stratified by nature of ownership (for-profit and not-for-profit), type of city (tier 1, 2 or 3) and size of the hospital (number of beds). Average costs for each HBP will be calculated across the different facility types. Multiple scenarios will be used to suggest rates which could be negotiated with the providers. Overall, the study will provide economic cost data for price setting, strategic purchasing, health technology assessment and a national cost database of India. Ethics and dissemination The approval has been obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee and Institutional Collaborative Committee of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India. The results shall be disseminated in conferences and peer-reviewed articles.

AB  - The internal layers of ice sheets from ice-penetrating radar (IPR) investigation preserve critical information about the ice-flow field and englacial conditions. This paper presents a new detailed analysis of spatial distribution characteristics of internal layers and subglacial topography of the East Antarctic ice sheet (EAIS) from Zhongshan Station to Dome A. The radar data of 1244 km along a traverse between Zhongshan Station and Dome A of EAIS were collected during the 29th Chinese National Antarctic Research Expedition (CHINARE 29, 2012/2013). In this study, the Internal Layering Continuity Index (ILCI) and basal roughness were taken as indicators to provide an opportunity to evaluate the past internal environment and dynamics of the ice sheet. Except for the upstream of Lambert Glacier, the fold patterns of internal layers are basically similar to that of the bed topography. The relatively flat basal topography and the decrease of ILCI with increasing depth provide evidence for identifying previous rapid ice flow areas that are unavailable to satellites, especially in the upstream of Lambert Glacier. Continuous internal layers of Dome A, recording the spatial change of past ice accumulation and ice-flow history over 160 ka, almost extend to the bed, with high ILCI and high basal roughness of the corresponding bed topography. There are three kinds of basal roughness patterns along the traverse, that is, "low xi (t) low eta", "low xi (t) high eta", and "high xi (t) high eta", where xi (t) represents the amplitude of the undulations, and quantifies the vertical variation of the bedrock, and eta measures the frequency variation of fluctuations and the horizontal irregularity of the profile. The characteristics of internal layers and basal topography of the traverse between Zhongshan Station and Dome A provide new information for understanding the ancient ice-flow activity and the historical evolution of EAIS.

AB  - Levels of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) provide a surrogate measure of the microbial quality of water used for a wide range of applications. Despite the common use of these measures, a significant limitation is a delay in results due to the time required for cultivation and enumeration of FIB. Testing requires at least 18-24 h, and therefore, FIB cannot be used to identify current or real-time microbial water quality. An approach of nowcasting or empirical modelling approaches that incorporate water quality, environmental, and weather variables to predict FIB levels in real-time has been developed with some success. However, FIB levels are dependent on a complex interaction of numerous variables, which can be challenging to model with ordinary linear regression or classification methods most commonly applied. In this study, novel use of Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) that allow for a probabilistic representation of complex variable interactions is investigated for real-time modelling of FIB levels surface waters. In particular, the integration of both water quality measures and current/historical weather for prediction of fecal coliforms and Escherichia coli levels is achieved using BBNs. For 4-bin classification of fecal coliform levels, BBNs increased prediction accuracy by 25%-54% compared to other previously used techniques including logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and random forests. Binary prediction of E. coli levels exceeding a threshold of 20 CFU/100 mL was also significantly improved using BBNs with prediction accuracies >90% for all monitoring sites. Advantages of the BBN approach are also demonstrated identifying the ability to make predictions from incomplete monitoring data as well as probabilistic inference of variable importance in FIB levels. In particular, the results indicate that water quality surrogates such as conductivity are essential to real-time prediction of FIB. The results and models described in this work can be readily utilized to provide accurate and real-time assessments of FIB levels in surface waters utilizing commonly monitored parameters.

AB  - Mixed-flow fans (MFF) are widely used to reduce the heat stress in dairy cows in summer. Our research team developed MFFs with a newly shaped diffuser with the length of 250 mm and the circumferential angle of 150 degrees, which have better performance in terms of maximum flow flux and energy efficiency. However, how the elevation angle of the diffuser influences the performance of MFFs and how the optimal fan perform in the field experiment has not been studied yet. In this paper, the diffuser was optimized by CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulation of the fan and a laboratory prototype test. An orthogonal test showed no interaction among length, circumferential angle, and elevation angle. The diffuser with an elevation angle of 10 degrees performed better than that with an elevation angle of 0 degrees, showing increased jet lengths, flow flux, and energy efficiency by 0.5 m, 0.69%, and 1.39%, respectively, and attaining greater axial wind speeds and better non-uniformity coefficients at the dairy cattle height. Then, through on-site controlled trials, we found that the 10 degrees/150 degrees/250 mm diffusers increased the overall average wind speeds by 9.4% with respect to the MFFs without a diffuser. MFFs with the newly shaped diffuser were used for field tests, and their effectiveness in alleviating heat stress in dairy cows was evaluated by testing environmental parameters and dairy cows' physiological indicators. Although the temperature-humidity indexes (THIs) in the experimental barn with the optimized fan at different times were lower than those in the controlled barn, the environmental conditions corresponded to moderate heat stress. However, this was not consistent with cow's respiratory rate and rectal temperature. Finally, on the basis of the CFD simulation of a dairy cow barn, the equivalent temperature of cattle (ETIC), which takes into account the effect of air velocity, showed that the environment caused moderate heat stress only at 13:00, but not at other times of the day. This shows that ETIC is more accurate to evaluate heat stress.

AB  - The genus Collarina Jullien, 1886 (Cribrilinidae Hincks, 1879) has until now been known from the Atlantic-Mediterranean region as just two species, C. balzaci (Audouin, 1826), synonym of Collarina cribrosa Jullien, 1886, type species of the genus, considered to be widely distributed from the northern British Isles to the SE Mediterranean, and C. fayalensis Harmelin, 1978 from the Macaronesian Isles. Abundant material collected in the Mediterranean and the NE Atlantic, coupled with examination of museum specimens, allowed better definition of the species-specific morphological features in this genus and some generic traits (ooecium formation, avicularia with nested cystids). Besides the redescription of C. balzaci and C. fayalensis, this study led to the description of four new species: C. denticulata Harmelin, n. sp., recorded only in the Mediterranean, C. gautieri Harmelin, n. sp., present in both the NE Atlantic and the Mediterranean, C. macaronensis Harmelin, n. sp., from Madeira, Azores and Galicia, and C. speluncola Harmelin, n. sp., from the Mediterranean and the Gulf of Cadiz. A seventh morphotype (Collarina sp., from the Mediterranean, seemingly close to C. speluncola Harmelin, n. sp., has been left unnamed pending the availability of more abundant material. It was proven that C. balzaci: 1) has often been confused with C. gautieri Harmelin, n. sp.; 2) is exclusively epiphytic (mainly on Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile, 1813 and brown seaweeds), with life-cycle adapted to ephemeral hosts; 3) is widely distributed in the Mediterranean, but also present in the Canaries on seaweeds, and has probably been overlooked in similar habitats in other warm-temperate NE Atlantic localities; and 4) is able to proliferate dramatically on Posidonia leaves in association with diatoms under unusual environmental conditions (Gulf of Gabes, chemical disturbance). All Collarina species live in coastal areas, mostly at shallow depth, in shaded microhabitats: plants (C. balzaci), dark cave walls (C. speluncola Harmelin, n. sp.) and small hard substrates, e.g. shells, pebbles, and anthropogenic debris (all other species).

AB  - Pesticides are commonly applied in conventional agricultural systems, but they can lead to serious environmental contamination. The calculation of on-field pesticide emissions in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies is challenging, because of the difficulty in the calculation of the fate of pesticides and, therefore, several literature approaches based on different dispersion models have been developed. PestLCI 2.0 model can provide simultaneous assessment of the emission fractions of a pesticide to air, surface water and groundwater based on many parameters. The goal of this study is to exploit the extent of PestLCI 2.0 sensitivity to soil variations, with the ultimate goal of increasing the robustness of the modelling of pesticide emissions in LCA studies. The model was applied to maize cultivation in an experimental farm in Northern Italy, considering three tests, which evaluated the distribution of pesticides among environmental compartments obtained considering different soil types.
   Results show that small variations in soil characteristics lead to great variation of PestLCI 2.0, with a significance that depends on the type of environmental compartment. The compartment most affected by soil variations was groundwater, whereas surface waters were dominated by meteorological conditions, pesticides' physical and chemical properties and wind drift, which are independent from soil characteristics.
   Therefore, the use of specific soil data in PestLCI 2.0 results in the availability of a comprehensive set of emission data in the different compartments, which represents a relevant input for the inventory phase of LCA studies and can increase their robustness. Nevertheless, PestLCI 2.0 requires a great effort for the data collection and a specific expertise in soil science for interpreting the results. Moreover, characterization factors for pesticide groundwater emissions should be developed, in order to exploit these detailed results in the impact assessment phase, Finally, the study provides further insights into future improvement of PestLCI 2.0.

AB  - Soil erosion by water remains a major problem in many regions of the world and in many cases the dominant source of sediment is from gully erosion. Filling-in ephemeral gullies by mechanical operations serves to maintain high erosion rates and degrades the soil from areas used for filling, however, the impact of gully filling on soil quality is uncertain. The objective was to quantify the impact of filling of an ephemeral gully on crop yield and soil quality adjacent to the gully. An ephemeral gully was sampled for in situ physical (topsoil depth, soil color, shear strength, soil penetration resistance) properties and hydraulic (bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity, water retention) properties from undisturbed cores in a field in the sixth consecutive year of No Till. The field was selectively resampled the following year immediately following tillage. Soil properties were measured and sampled every 7.6 m out to 37 m from each side of the gully center along five transects perpendicular to the gully and a similar transect removed from the gully to represent baseline conditions. Filling of the gully by scraping soil from upper convex slope positions significantly reduced corn yield. The best indicators of soil physical quality were depth of topsoil, shear strength at the surface, and soil penetration resistance at the 5 cm depth and the best hydraulic properties were saturated hydraulic conductivity and several water retention characteristics. However, the slope of the retention curve at its inflection point was not found to be an indicator of soil physical quality. Every 1 cm loss of topsoil resulted in a 3.3 to 6.5% loss in yield. The soil physical quality indicators were dramatically changed by tillage such that the index developed was no longer appropriate. Future efforts need to address the dynamic changes in the soil quality index following tillage due to reconsolidation of the soil and whether inclusion of chemical and biological indicators would be less impacted by tillage.

AB  - Biological fixation of atmospheric nitrogen (N-2) by bryophyte-associated cyanobacteria is an important source of plant-available N in the boreal biome. Information on the factors that drive biological N-2 fixation (BNF) rates is needed in order to understand the N dynamics of forests under a changing climate. We assessed the potential of several cryptogam species (the feather mosses Hylocomium splendens and Pleurozium schreberi, a group of Dicranum bryophytes, two liverworts, and Cladina lichens) to serve as associates of cyanobacteria or other N-2-fixing bacteria (diazotrophs) using acetylene reduction assay (ARA). We tested the hypotheses that the legacy of chronic atmospheric N deposition reduces BNF in the three bryophyte species, sampled from 12 coniferous forests located at latitudes 60-68 degrees N in Finland. In addition, we tested the effect of moisture and temperature on BNF. All species studied showed a BNF signal in the north, with the highest rates in feather mosses. In moss samples taken along the north-south gradient with an increasing N bulk deposition from 0.8 to 4.4 kg ha(-1) year(-1), we found a clear decrease in BNF in both feather mosses and Dicranum group. BNF turned off at N deposition of 3-4 kg ha(-1) year(-1). Inorganic N (NH4-N + NO3-N) best predicted the BNF rate among regression models with different forms of N deposition as explanatory variables. However, in southern spruce stands, tree canopies modified the N in throughfall so that dissolved organic N (DON) leached from canopies compensated for inorganic N retained therein. Here, both DON and inorganic N negatively affected BNF in H. splendens. In laboratory experiments, BNF increased with increasing temperature and moisture. Our results suggest that even relatively low N deposition suppresses BNF in bryophyte-associated diazotrophs. Further, BNF could increase in northern low-deposition areas, especially if climate warming leads to moister conditions, as predicted. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aims: The study aims at putting together and comparing different types of rock vegetation classified to different syntaxa and usually studied separately. The particular objectives of the study were: 1) to identify and classify the vegetation units of rock communities; 2) to explain floristic differences between phytosociological units with different habitat conditions. Study area: The study area lies at the northern border of the Italian Peninsula, between 43 degrees 40' and 44 degrees 40' N and between 9 degrees and 11 degrees E. It is characterized by a great variety of rocky habitats and represents a centre of endemism and a zone of phytogeographic transition between the Alps and the Apennines. Methods: The study was based on a dataset including 693 phytosociological releves that were classified according to the recent updatings of the Braun-Blanquet method. During the classification, releves were assigned to phytosociological classes based on the cover-abundance prevalence of diagnostic species, taking into account the current literature. The definitive classification into associations was carried out through cluster analysis. The analysis of floristic variation within the rock vegetation was performed through Principal Component Analysis, adopting Ellenberg indicator values as indirect environmental factors. Results: We identified 36 basic vegetation units (35 of them evaluated as associations) belonging to four phytosociological classes (Crithmo-Staticetea, Adiantetea, Asplenietea trichomanis and Polypodietea). All these vegetation units were characterized by their floristic composition, structure, syntaxonomy, habitat and distribution. Conclusions: More than half of the identified associations and a new suballiance Primulenion apenninae (within the alliance Androsacion vandellii) were newly described. Two alliances (Moehringion muscosae and Hymenopbyllion tunbrigensis) were first documented as part of the Italian vegetation. Indirect gradient analysis indicated that, within the four classes, the floristic composition varied along different environmental gradients and that temperature can be identified as the factor most strongly correlated with the variation of rock-face vegetation.

AB  - Uneven-aged silviculture may better maintain species assemblages associated with old-growth forests than clear felling in part due to habitat heterogeneity created by maintaining standing retention strips adjacent to harvest trails. Retention strips and harvest trails created at the time of tree removal will likely have different microclimate and may harbor different assemblages. In some cases, the resultant stand heterogeneity associated with uneven-aged silviculture may be similar to natural small-scale disturbances. For beetles, increased light and temperature as well as potential access to young vegetation and deadwood substrates present in harvset trails may harbor beetle assemblages similar to those found in natural gaps. We sampled saproxylic beetles using flight intercept traps placed in harvest corridors and retention strips in 9 replicated uneven-aged spruce stands in central Sweden. We compared abundance, species richness and composition between harvest corridors and retention strips using generalized linear models, rarefaction, permutational multivariate analysis of variance and indicator species analysis. Canopy openness doubled, mean temperature and variability in daily temperature increased and humidity decreased on harvest trails. Beetle richness and abundance were greater in harvests trails than in retention strips and the beetle species composition differed significantly between habitats. Twenty-five species were associated with harvest trails, including three old-growth specialists such as Agathidium discoideum (Erichson), currently red-listed. We observed only one species, Xylechinus pilosus (Ratzeburg) that strongly favored retention strips. Harvest trails foster both open habitat species and old-growth species while retention strips harbored forest interior specialists. The combination of closed canopy, stratified forest in the retention strips and gap-like conditions on the harvest trails thus increases overall species richness and maintains more diverse assemblages at the stand level than would otherwise be seen in less heterogeneous stand types. This suggests that uneven-aged silviculture may provide added conservation benefits for both open habitat and old-growth specialists than silvicultural approaches that reduce stand heterogeneity.

AB  - Heavy metal contamination commonly appears in mining areas and volcanic watersheds due to the acidic drainage water. Under the hydrochemical condition, the solar photocycle would result in changes of the water temperature, in photosynthesis and in iron photoreduction, which leads to substantial hydrochemical fluctuations, especially for heavy metals. It is important to consider the daily variations in water quality when developing a hydrochemical monitoring plan for an area with highly developed agriculture, such as the Tatun Volcano Group watershed area in this study. The results show that the water chemistry is highly complicated by both solar photocycles and hydrochemical fluctuations in the upstream area. Using principal component analysis, the contributions from the two factors can be successfully separated. During the daytime, the photocycle results in the formation of aluminum hydroxide, which can remove heavy metals from water. Consequently, the content of heavy metals, including As, Cu, Ni, Co and Ba, increases after sunset and can reach a maximum before sunrise, while Fe behaves inversely due to the photoreduction. The variation of As during a diel cycle can reach 97%. However, the content of most of the heavy metals during diel cycle is incomparable with those in the earlier studies due to the formation of aluminum hydroxide instead of iron hydroxide. The other significant factor, hydrochemical fluctuation, can explain the variation of major components in water including Cl, SO4. Rare earth elements (REEs) were also analyzed and can be an excellent natural tracer in this study. The distribution of REEs shows a depletion of light REEs and an even normalized concentration of middle and heavy REEs. It is theorized that the REEs in the water in this study derive mainly from the reservoir rock of geothermal water. In a hydrochemical monitoring plan, REEs can be an indicator for identifying an anthropogenic source.

AB  - Background: Health is influenced by numerous factors that affect the health service system and health status of the people in every country. This article aims to compare the determinants of the health service system and the health status of the people in Thailand, the Lao PDR, Vietnam, and Cambodia; and to recommend policies that impact the population's health and the country's development. Methods: A comprehensive search of the literature from a variety of online search and academic databases, and synthesis of previous study was used in this paper. Data on country indicators were taken from published online databases of the Ministry of Public Health of Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, and Vietnam; the World Health Organization, and the World Bank.
   Results: In Thailand, the determinants of the health service system and health status of the people are medical information and technology because of the government initiatives to improve the quality of healthcare services through the use of modern technology. In Vietnam, the society and culture, and the strengths and weaknesses of the hospital significantly affect the health status and health service system there because of the religious beliefs of the people. However, in Cambodia, the strengths and weaknesses of the hospital are the primary determinant of the health service system and health status of the people due to the condition of the hospitals, the availability of new medical devices, and the number of healthcare professionals. In the Lao PDR, trade and investment, and medical information and technology, significantly influence the health service system and health status of the people because of the government efforts to outsource capital expenditures and medical technology.
   Conclusion: The strengths and weaknesses of the hospital are the key determinants of the health service system and health status of the people in all GMS countries. Understanding the determinants of health is essential in order to develop policies and programs that impact the population's health and the country's development.

AB  - Shortly after the deposition of black shales in the Rhaetian Sea (Central European Basin, CEB), the Triassic/Jurassic (TO) boundary witnessed one of the Big Five mass extinction events in Earth's history. Aiming at a better understanding of paleoenvironmental changes in the (geochemically) less well-known middle to late Rhaetian (German subdivision), we studied samples from a cored borehole from the central Rhaetian Sea in NW Germany (Hebelermeer 2). Biomarkers, palynomorphs and bulk geochemistry all support a marine/brackish setting with inputs from terrestrial plants. Dinosteranes were found throughout the core, most likely suggesting the spread of dinoflagellates. It is widely accepted that volcanic exhalations during the development of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) had a major impact on marine and terrestrial environments in the earliest Jurassic e.g., the development of photic zone euxinia and H2S poisoning of benthic life. There is evidence from the studied core, however, that comparable conditions already thrived in the central Rhaetian Sea during the middle Rhaetian. A first indication of euxinia/anoxia is evident from low to very low total organic carbon versus total sulfur (TOC/TS) ratios (similar to<1) with a minimum preceding the Tr/J boundary (0.03). The latter very low value hints at a decoupling of S and C cycles and eventually abiogenic pyrite formation. Water-column anoxia during the middle Rhaetian is indicated by the occurrence of the biomarker gammacerane, which records ciliates living at the O-2-H2S chemocline. The strongest support for a stratified water column even with photic zone euxinia comes from high abundances of isorenieratane. This biomarker is a pigment of anoxygenic phototrophic green sulfur bacteria, which use H2S for photosynthesis. Our data point to perturbations in the biogeochemical cycles of sulfur and carbon already in the middle Rhaetian, which are possibly linked to early volcanic activities and SO2, H2S, and CO2 eruptions.

AB  - Aim: Production of wood charcoal is an ancient form of anthropogenic forest use that existed for millennia in Mediterranean countries and only vanished in the last century. As a result, thousands of abandoned charcoal kiln platforms still occur in present-day woodlands. Because of peculiar light and soil properties, the understorey vegetation at these platforms may differ from the surrounding stands. Our study investigated, for the first time, the effects of abandoned kiln platforms on understorey vegetation diversity, composition and biomass production in forests of a Mediterranean area.
   Location: Tuscany, central Italy.
   Methods: One 3 9 3 m kiln plot on charcoal kiln area and one 3 9 3 m control plot in the surrounding stands were established in 59 representative sites located in three major forest types dominated by evergreen sclerophylls, deciduous oaks and beech. In each plot, diversity and composition of the understorey community were analysed, together with soil factors (content of C, N, C: N ratio, pH) and light conditions (PAR). A 50 9 50 cm frame was randomly placed in each plot to measure biomass production.
   Results: The charcoal kiln habitat positively affected understorey diversity and above-ground biomass, as well as the content of C, C: N ratio, pH and light availability. Significant compositional differences between the two plot types occurred, although to a variable extent for the three forest types. Graminoids were more abundant on kiln plots, and 12 indicator species were found for this habitat in deciduous oak forests. Higher values of cover and biomass showed the lack of detrimental effects of wood charcoal accumulation on understorey productivity.
   Conclusions: Long-term wood charcoal production in Mediterranean woodlands has caused long-lasting effects on the understorey via persistent changes in abiotic factors. Hence, former kiln platforms represent anthropogenic microhabitats that increase biodiversity and fine-scale heterogeneity of forest ecosystems. Conservation measures are advocated to preserve them against various external threats.

AB  - Faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and harmful algal blooms (HABs) threaten the health and the economy of coastal communities worldwide. Emerging automated sampling technologies combined with molecular analytical techniques could enable rapid detection of micro-organisms in-situ, thereby improving resource management and public health decision-making. We evaluated this concept using a robotic device, the Environmental Sample Processor (ESP). The ESP automates in-situ sample collection, nucleic acid extraction and molecular analyses. Here, the ESP measured and reported concentrations of FIB (Enterococcus spp.), a microbial source-tracking marker (human-specific Bacteriodales) and a HAB species (Psuedo-nitzschia spp.) over a 45-day deployment on the Santa Cruz Municipal Wharf (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Both FIB and HABs were enumerated from single in-situ collected water samples. The in-situ qPCR efficiencies ranged from 86% to 105%, while the limit of quantifications during the deployment was 10 copies reaction(-1). No differences were observed in the concentrations of enterococci, the human-specific marker in Bacteroidales spp., and P.australis between in-situ collected sample and traditional hand sampling methods (P>005). Analytical results were Internet-accessible within hours of sample collection, demonstrating the feasibility of same-day public notification of current water quality conditions.
   Significance and Impact of the StudyThis study presents the first report of in-situ qPCR enumeration of both faecal indicators and harmful algal species in coastal marine waters. We utilize a robotic device for in-situ quantification of enterococci, the human-specific marker in Bacteriodales and Pseudo-nitzschia spp. from the same water samples collected and processed in-situ. The results demonstrate that rapid, in-situ monitoring can be utilized to identify and quantify multiple health-relevant micro-organisms important in water quality monitoring and that this monitoring can be used to inform same-day notifications.

AB  - Species colonization in a new habitat patch is an efficiency indicator of biodiversity conservation. Colonization is a two-step process of dispersal and establishment, characterized by the compatibility of plant traits with landscape structure and habitat conditions. Therefore, ecological trait profiling of specialist species is initially required to estimate the relative importance of colonization filters. Old planted parks best satisfy the criteria of a newly created and structurally matured habitat for forest-dwelling plant species. We sampled species in 230 ancient deciduous forests (source habitat), 74 closed-canopy manor parks (target habitats), 151 linear wooded habitats (landscape corridors), and 97 open habitats (isolating matrix) in Estonia. We defined two species groups of interest: forest (107 species) and corridor specialists (53 species). An extra group of open habitat specialists was extracted for trait scaling. Differing from expectations, forest specialists have high plasticity in reproduction mechanisms: smaller seeds, larger dispersules, complementary selfing ability, and diversity of dispersal vectors. Forest specialists are shorter, less nutrient-demanding and mycorrhizal-dependent, stress-tolerant disturbance-sensitive competitors, while corridor specialists are large-seeded disturbance-tolerant competitors. About 40% of species from local species pools have immigrated into parks. The historic forest area, establishment-related traits, and stand quality enhance the colonization of forest specialists. The openness of landscape and mowing in the park facilitate corridor specialists. Species traits in parks vary between a forest and corridor specialist, except for earlier flowering and larger propagules. Forest species are not dispersal limited, but they continue to be limited by habitat properties even in the long term. Therefore, the shady parts of historic parks should be appreciated as important forest biodiversity-enhancing landscape structures. The habitat quality of secondary stands can be improved by nurturing a heterogeneous shrub and tree layer, and modest herb layer management.

AB  - Crop phenology is essential for evaluating crop production in the food insecure regions of West Africa. The aim of the paper is to study whether satellite observation of plant phenology are consistent with ground knowledge of crop cycles as expressed in agro-simulations. We used phenological variables from a MODIS Land Cover Dynamics (MCD12Q2) product and examined whether they reproduced the spatio-temporal variability of crop phenological stages in Southern Mali. Furthermore, a validated cereal crop growth model for this region, SARRA-H (System for Regional Analysis of Agro-Climatic Risks), provided precise agronomic information. Remotely-sensed green-up, maturity, senescence and dormancy MODIS dates were extracted for areas previously identified as crops and were compared with simulated leaf area indices (LAI) temporal profiles generated using the SARRA-H crop model, which considered the main cropping practices. We studied both spatial (eight sites throughout South Mali during 2007) and temporal (two sites from 2002 to 2008) differences between simulated crop cycles and determined how the differences were indicated in satellite-derived phenometrics. The spatial comparison of the phenological indicator observations and simulations showed mainly that (i) the satellite-derived start-of-season (SOS) was detected approximately 30 days before the model-derived SOS; and (ii) the satellite-derived end-of-season (EOS) was typically detected 40 days after the model-derived EOS. Studying the inter-annual difference, we verified that the mean bias was globally consistent for different climatic conditions. Therefore, the land cover dynamics derived from the MODIS time series can reproduce the spatial and temporal variability of different start-of-season and end-of-season crop species. In particular, we recommend simultaneously using start-of-season phenometrics with crop models for yield forecasting to complement commonly used climate data and provide a better estimate of vegetation phenological changes that integrate rainfall variability, land cover diversity, and the main farmer practices.

AB  - Frechet (sensitivity) kernels are an important tool in glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) investigations to understand lithospheric thickness, mantle viscosity and ice-load model variations. These parameters influence the interpretation of geologic, geophysical and geodetic data, which contribute to our understanding of global change.
   We discuss global sensitivities of relative sea-level (RSL) data of the last 18 000 years. This also includes indicative RSL-like data (e.g., lake levels) on the continents far off the coasts. We present detailed sensitivity maps for four parameters important in GIA investigations (ice-load history, lithospheric thickness, background viscosity, lateral viscosity variations) for up to nine dedicated times. Assuming an accuracy of 2m of RSL data of all ages (based on analysis of currently available data), we highlight areas around the world where, if the environmental conditions allowed its deposition and survival until today, RSL data of at least this accuracy may help to quantify the GIA modeling parameters above.
   The sensitivity to ice-load history variations is the dominating pattern covering almost the whole world before about 13 ka (calendar years before 1950). The other three parameters show distinct patterns, but are almost everywhere overlapped by the ice-load history pattern. The more recent the data are, the smaller the area of possible RSL locations that could provide enough information to a parameter. Such an area is mainly limited to the area of former glaciation, but we also note that when the accuracy of RSL data can be improved, e.g., from 2m to 1 m, these areas become larger, al-lowing better inference of background viscosity and lateral heterogeneity. Although the patterns depend on the chosen models and error limit, our results are indicative enough to outline areas where one should look for helpful RSL data of a certain time period. Our results also indicate that as long as the ice-load history is not sufficiently known, the inference of lateral heterogeneities in mantle viscosity or lithospheric thickness will be interfered by the uncertainty of the ice model.

AB  - Ellenberg's indicator values have been suggested as useful method of estimating site conditions using plants. We examined whether Ellenberg's R values are suitable for indicating soil reaction and if calibration to physical pH measurements can improve bioindication in oligotrophic and mesotrophic submontane broad-leaved forests in Slovakia. Vegetation relev,s and pH-H2O and pH-CaCl2 soil reaction were recorded for this purpose. Ellenberg's R values (R (e)) were compared to Jurko's indicator values (R (j)) and a set of species R values and tolerances (T), which were calibrated with physical pH data using the weighted averaging (R (w), T (w)) and Huisman-Olff-Fresco modelling (R (h), T (h)). Original R (e) values were then recalibrated with measured pH data to establish new, adjusted set of scores (R (c), T (c)) at Ellenberg's scale. The Re values are significantly correlated with the other R values, and they demonstrate similar frequency distribution to R (j) and R (w) values for the studied species pool. The frequency distribution becomes similar across all the R values when indifferent species were excluded. The performance of all the indicator values in terms of bioindication was tested. Relev, means of the R values were regressed on the field pH measurements. The performance of bioindication varied from 36% to 49% of the explained variance for pH-CaCl2, with the R (e) and R (c) values yielding 46% and 49% respectively. The bioindication slightly improved for all calibrated methods (R (w), R (h) and R (c)) when species were weighted inversely with their tolerances - the performance varied from 42% to 51%, and the R (c) values performed most effectively. We concluded that Ellenberg's R values represent a powerful system for bioindicating soil acidity when compared to the other alternatives, with pH-CaCl2 showing better results than pH-H2O. Recalibration of Ellenberg's values to the measured data improved the indicator system.

AB  - Maternal stress effects on offspring development have been studied largely in rodents and primates, and to a lesser extent in farm animals. Potential lack of knowledge concerning prenatal stress on farm animals is regrettable because they are frequently subjected to a variety of husbandry stressors. Above all, effects of maternal stress on poultry offspring have been neglected. Prenatal effects in birds are known to involve maternal steroids present in eggs. In this study, we investigated the effects of daily unpredictable stressors applied to laying Japanese quail on their offspring's morphological and behavioural development. We also investigated the effects of our procedure on female reproductive output and on egg characteristics (weight, composition, yolk sex steroid levels). Our procedure induced only a mild stress: laying and egg fertilization rates of stressed females were not impaired; they remained similar to those of control females. Nonetheless, our stress procedure had an impact on some egg characteristics: stressed females' eggs were heavier, contained more albumen and tended to have higher yolk testosterone levels than control females' eggs. Stressed females' offspring hatched earlier, were heavier at hatching and had a different growth pattern than did control females' offspring. They also appeared to have a higher emotional reactivity than control chicks when encountering a novel environment and they reacted more strongly following social separation. Our study revealed that mild stressors applied to laying Japanese quail can increase the emotional reactivity of their chicks and suggested that maternal stress effects on offspring are mediated by changes in egg composition and yolk testosterone levels. We stress the particular relevance to the poultry industry of our findings highlighting the importance of taking into account the environment of laying females, as this environment can influence their progeny's behaviour and therefore their subsequent adaptation to husbandry conditions and ultimately their welfare.

AB  - The indirubins long have been used in Chinese medicine for treatment of myelocytic leukemia. Among the many more recently described biological activities of the indirubins, attention has been directed toward the ability of these compounds to inhibit GSK-3 and CDKs, kinases implicated in neurodegenerative conditions. Little information is available on effects of indirubins on chemically-induced neurodegeneration. Here we examined the influence of three indirubins on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)- and kainic acid (KA)-induced neurotoxicity in the mouse. The three indirubins examined were 6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (6BIO), 5-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (5BIO) and 5-amino-6-bromoindirubin (5A6BI). The first two derivatives were previously described indirubins with low nanomolar inhibitory activity against GSK-3 and CDKs. The third compound was synthesized by the dimerization of 5-amino-6-bromoisatin with 3-acetoxyindol. The synthesis of the key compound 5-amino-6-bromoisatin was based on the bromination of the ketal of 5-amino-isatin. All indirubins examined decreased various measures associated with dopaminergic neurotransmission in striatum. These effects occurred alone or over and above the decrements seen following administration of the dopaminergic neurotoxicant, MPTP. Striatal serotonin and serotonin turnover were decreased by the indirubins in MPTP-treated mice. None of these striatal effects of the indirubins alone were associated with evidence of astrogliosis, an indicator of underlying neuropathology, nor did they potentiate the astrogliosis accompanying administration of MPTP. In general, the indirubins reduced KA-associated mortality and striatal but not hippocampal astrogliosis due to this toxicant. The data suggest that indirubins affect striatal biogenic amine levels and turnover in intact mice. The data do not indicate a neuroprotective action of indirubins in mice treated with MPTP but that they do suggest that they may be neuroprotective against KA-induced injury of the neostriatum.

AB  - We compared the understory communities (herbs, shrubs, and tree seedlings and saplings) of old-growth and second-growth eastern hemlock forests (Tsuga canadensis) in western Massachusetts, USA. Second-growth hemlock forests originated following clear-cut logging in the late 1800s and were 108-136 years old at the time of sampling. Old-growth hemlock forests contained total ground cover of herbaceous and shrub species that was approximately 4 times greater than in second-growth forests (4.02 +/- 0.41%/m(2) versus 1.06 +/- 0.47%/m(2)) and supported greater overall species richness and diversity. In addition, seedling and sapling densities were greater in old-growth stands compared to second-growth stands and the composition of these layers was positively correlated with overstory species composition (Mantel tests, r > 0.26, P < 0.05) highlighting the strong positive neighborhood effects in these systems. Ordination of study site understory, species composition identified a strong gradient in community composition from second-growth to old-growth stands. Vector overlays of environmental and forest structural variables indicated that these gradients were related to differences in overstory tree density, nitrogen availability, and coarse woody debris characteristics among hemlock stands. These relationships suggest that differences in resource availability (e.g., light, moisture, and nutrients) and microhabitat heterogeneity between old-growth and second-growth stands were likely driving these compositional patterns. Interestingly, several common forest understory plants, including Aralia nudicaulis, Dryopteris intermedia, and Viburnum alnifolium, were significant indicator species for old-growth hemlock stands, highlighting the lasting legacy of past land use on the reestablishment and growth of these common species within second-growth areas. The return of old-growth understory conditions to these second-growth areas will largely be dependent on disturbance and self-thinning mediated changes in overstory structure, resource availability, and microhabitat heterogeneity.

AB  - This article describes the development of a Nile Biotic Pollution Index (NBPI) for the River Nile in Egypt. Chemical data were collected from 30 locations along the Nile from Aswan to Cairo and 21 sites within the river delta, incorporating a range of conditions from unpolluted to grossly polluted. Seven chemical variables were used to calculate a Nile Chemical Pollution Index (NCPI) for each site. Biological data were collected primarily using Artificial Substrate Samplers (ASS). The UK developed, Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) biotic index and the BMWP-ASPT were applied to the data. A Nile Biotic Pollution Index (NBPI) and the NBPI-ASPT were obtained by incorporating more of the Nile taxa. There were highly significant regressions (P < 0.001) for both the UK and the Nile Pollution Index scores with the NCPI for the whole river. The modification of the UK indices improved the Nile Indices increasing the number of taxa recorded from 29 to 43 and the total number of recorded taxon occurrences from 377 to 490. The Nile Indices provided better discrimination at both ends of the pollution spectrum. The NBPI-ASPT was best for the river as a whole, and particularly for the river from Aswan to Cairo. The NBPI was much better in the delta than from Aswan to Cairo. These differences in performance were attributed to the fact that the NBPI-ASPT excludes information on taxon diversity. In clean waters there was a wide range of NBPI score suggesting that the biodiversity of taxa is dependent on other aspects of habitat quality. Conversely in the polluted delta the high score of an individual taxon is critical for the NBPI-ASPT as it may have a distorting effect. As the NBPI-ASPT was the most consistent biotic index it is recommended as the regular biological assessment and regulatory tool for Egypt to meet the requirements of the Convention for Biodiversity.

AB  - High altitude rivers in European mountains show a large diversity of benthic diatom assemblages. Diatoms were studied from rivers of the Alps, the Pyrenees, the Massif-Central and the Iberic system. The study area spread across four countries, Italy, France, Switzerland and Spain. Since 2000, the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) has required the assessment of stream quality using bioindicators and any deviation from reference conditions measured. References for each river type and for each bioindicator, such as diatoms, are in the process of being defined.
   System A is a typological system proposed by the WFD, in which ecoregions spread over several countries were defined. The first aim of this study was to assess the importance of these ecoregions for diatoms compared to other environmental factors. To reduce the heterogeneity of the diatom assemblages due to the river continuum and also pollution, only the rivers higher than 800 meters were selected. These rivers include a majority of sites that are only slightly polluted, or not at all. In total 261 sampling sites were considered from four ecoregions: the Iberic region, the Pyrenees, the Alps, and the Western Highlands. The sampling sites were characterized by differences in geology, distance from the source and altitudes. Statistical analysis showed that geographic ecoregions of system A and geology were the most important environmental descriptors for diatoms. Distance from the source and altitude were less important and pollution was the least important parameter.
   The second aim was to describe and to typify the main diatom assemblages of these European mountains. Eight clusters gathered into four main groups were identified. Group I was mainly recorded in the Alps and the Pyrenees; group II had in common its close proximity to the source; group III was often found in the Western Highlands on crystalline geology, and group IV was present in all ecoregions and included weakly polluted streams. Some suggestions for the improvement of the ecoregions based on benthic diatoms were given in the conclusion.

AB  - Sedimentological and micropaleontological characteristics of core sediments from the outer shelf of the Korea Strait, which connects the northern East China Sea and the East Sea (Sea of Japan), were investigated to elucidate the paleoceanographic environment, especially the timing of the Kuroshio inflow, since the last glacial maximum. The core sediments, containing continuous records of the last 15,000 years, are characterized by a relatively high mud content (more than 50%, on average) and well-developed tide-influenced sedimentary structures. Their mineralogy suggests that the material originated from the paleo-Nakdong River system, which extended across the shelf of the Korea Strait during low sea-level periods. Planktonic foraminifers reveal a series of well-defined changes in paleoceanographic conditions during the late Pleistocene-Holocene. Down-core variations in the abundance of four foraminiferal assemblages, i.e., cold, coastal, tropical-subtropical, and Kuroshio water groups comprising characteristic planktonic species, suggest the occurrence of a distinct paleoenvironmental change in the surface water at 7,000 years B.P., i.e., from 15,000 to 7,000 years B.P., the area was influenced by coastal waters whereas since ca. 7,000 years B.P., it has been under the influence of open-sea water related to the Kuroshio Current flow, associated with both higher temperature and higher salinity. In particular, Pulleniatina obliquiloculata increased markedly in abundance at this time, documenting the inflow of the Kuroshio into the study area. These data indicate that the coastal water stage terminated at ca. 7,000 years B.P. when the warm Kuroshio and its major branch, the Tsushima Current, began to flow into the East Sea, as is the case today. The intrusion of the Tsushima Current through the Korea Strait after ca. 7,000 years B.P. resulted in abrupt changes in sedimentation rates and a dramatic increase in abundance of the Kuroshio indicator species, P. obliquiloculata.

AB  - A reappraisal of the zoogeography and systematics of Asian colobines demonstrates marked discontinuities in their distribution. The Bornean proboscis monkey is separated by Sumatra from its sole congener on the Mentawai Islands. Pygathrix species have a discontinuous distribution at the range limit of the Asian Colobinae. The existence in the Himalayas of some disjunct relatives of the south Indian fauna, has obscured a wider disjunction in which for example, the hooded black leaf monkey, Semnopithecus johnii, has one subspecies in southern India and another in north Vietnam. A closely related Vietnamese leaf monkey is a subspecies of the otherwise Indonesian S. auratus. Presbytis comata is disjunct between west Java, northern Sumatra and northern Borneo. The Mentawai Islands P. potenziani is closely related. Biogeographic parallels imply a common cause and previous continuity across the intervening areas. The only wholly compatible explanation is that the disjunct areas alone retained adequate moisture and temperature to support their endemic biota during a cool drought. That not only genera, but species are disjunct, indicates such conditions prevailed recently, and are probably attributable to the Pleistocene glaciations. The supposition that its maritime climate shielded Asian rainforest from the glacial drought known to have partially deforested Africa and South America, is inapplicable to the Indian subcontinent, and ignores the climatic effects of the emergence of the Sunda and the Sahul shelves. Such known influences, the distribution of drought indicator plants, fossil plants and fossil mammals, grassland birds and freshwater fish, and the anatomical specializations of Nasalis confirm the instability of the Asian environment. The absence of endemic representatives of certain primates in north Sumatra implies the occurrence of two cold droughts. Available evidence appears to correlate the deforestations with the abrupt curtailment of glacial Stages 7 and 5, at about 190 000 years BP and about 80 000 years BP. The greater significance of climatic than topographical barriers in delineating the Oriental zoogeographic region, and a rapid speciation rate, is implied. Morphological change is evidently generated by geographic dispersal, rather than geographic isolation. (C) 1996 The Linnean Society of London

AB  - The relationship between dough properties, loaf parameters and data from three approaches [HPLC, immunoassay and high M(r) glutenin subunit quality score (determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis)] were compared in order to assess both their relative values in quality screening, and to determine the relationships between the parameters. Total high M(r) and low M(r) glutenin subunits were quantified by reversed-phase HPLC in two sets of flour samples: (1) 27 wheal cultivars grown at each of three Australian sites in 1989; and (2) 14-15 cultivars grown at one site in 1986 under three levels of nitrogen fertilisation. The sets of samples were also analysed using two antibody assays, the results of which had earlier been shown to provide correlations with dough strength. With each set of samples, antibody binding, the amounts of high M(r) glutenin subunits and high M(r) glutenin subunit quality scores were each correlated to a similar extent with maximum resistance. In contrast, Farinograph dough development time was much more closely related to high M(r) glutenin subunit content and antibody binding than high M(r) glutenin subunit composition. This is probably due to the former two measures taking into account environmental effects as well as genotype. Extensibility tended to be related to the total amount of glutenin subunits and its major components, the low M(r) glutenin subunits. When grouped across sites and nitrogen fertiliser treatments, these trends were less apparent because of the dominant effect of variation in protein content. Statistical incorporation of the effect of variation in flour protein content improved prediction of maximum resistance but not loaf volume. Total gliadin content only maintained correlations with dough development time, which was also consistently correlated with flour protein content. The studies confirm earlier immunoblotting and ELISA data suggesting that the antibody assays selectively quantify high M(r) glutenin subunits. They also indicate differential relationships between particular gluten protein fractions and theological parameters, such as strength and extensibility.

AB  - As the COVID-19 pandemic has largely increased the utilization of telehealth, mobile mental health technologies - such as smartphone apps, vir-tual reality, chatbots, and social media - have also gained attention. These digital health technologies offer the potential of accessible and scalable interventions that can augment traditional care. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive update on the overall field of digital psychiatry, covering three areas. First, we outline the relevance of recent technological advances to mental health research and care, by detailing how smartphones, social media, artificial intelligence and virtual reality present new opportunities for "digital phenotyping" and remote intervention. Second, we review the current evidence for the use of these new technological approaches across different mental health contexts, covering their emerging efficacy in self-management of psychological well-being and early intervention, along with more nascent research supporting their use in clinical management of long-term psychiatric conditions - including major depression; anxiety, bipolar and psychotic disorders; and eating and substance use disorders - as well as in child and adolescent mental health care. Third, we discuss the most pressing challenges and opportunities towards real-world implementation, using the Integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework to explain how the innovations themselves, the recipients of these innovations, and the context surrounding innovations all must be considered to facilitate their adoption and use in mental health care systems. We conclude that the new technological capabilities of smartphones, artificial intelligence, social media and virtual reality are already changing mental health care in unforeseen and exciting ways, each accompanied by an early but promising evidence base. We point out that further efforts towards strengthening implementation are needed, and detail the key issues at the patient, provider and policy levels which must now be addressed for digital health technologies to truly improve mental health research and treatment in the future.

AB  - Permeability prediction of submarine shallow sediments is significantly important for finding hydrate-bearing sands with commercial potential. Permeability could be more sensitive to hydrate occurrence than traditional velocity parameters, because the rapid decrease of permeability is probably caused by hydrates. The elastic characteristics of the hydrate-bearing sediments differ from the consolidated oil-gas reservoir. In this paper, two elastic limitations that the shallow sediments would be somewhere in between are assumed: 1) sediments are extremely soft; 2) sediments are consolidated. Derivations show that the difference between the bulk modulus in these two assumptions depends on the pore compressibility, and the difference was defined as the pore compressibility indicator (PCI). It has been theoretically proven that PCI is closely related to permeability. Logging data analysis indicates that sediments with high permeability own small PCI and overall large porosity. At the same time, the occurrence of hydrate significantly increases PCI, and even low-saturation hydrate can cause a significant decrease in permeability, so a successful permeability prediction enhances detection and identification of hydrates. Then, the relationship between the seismic reflections and PCI is studied, and a twostate seismic inversion is proposed to obtain PCI. Finally, to predict permeability, a neural network is constructed and well trained using PCI and porosity as inputs and permeability as the output. Error analysis and sensitivity analysis are then carried out. Field applications show that the predicted permeability is consistent with the logging data, and channels for fluid migration such as coarse-grained sands own high permeability, while providing favorable conditions for hydrate formation. In this study, we propose a new seismic approach for permeability prediction in unconsolidated sediments, which is a scientific and effective attempt to predict permeability with seismic data. It can improve the accuracy of hydrate identification and provide basic data for the evaluation of production potential.

AB  - The Holocene variability of Poaceae (grasses) and their response to climate changes has not yet been investigated, despite their prevalence and biodiversity in the Lower Yangtze Valley. In this study, we analysed phytolith assemblages in a high-resolution sediment core from the Lower Yangtze Valley to reconstruct the past vegetation and climate of the early to mid-Holocene (ca. 9000-7200 cal a BP). The sediment core chronology was based on 11 radiocarbon dates of terrestrial plant macro-remains or char, which sufficiently captured regional centennialscale vegetation and climatic variability of the early to mid-Holocene. We identified and classified phytoliths into 30 morphotypes covering seven taxonomic groups: Panicoideae, Pooideae, Bambusoideae, Chloridoideae, Oryzoideae, Arecaceae (palms), and broad-leaved trees. The downcore phytolith assemblage indicated a significant increase in palms, bamboo forests, and other evergreen broad-leaved trees after 8200 cal a BP. Both Panicoideae and Pooideae, which are indicative of dry or cold climates, decreased from 9000 to 7200 cal a BP, indicating a transition to a warmer and wetter climate during that period. Due to the coastal environment of the Lower Yangtze, both the strengthening East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and rising sea-level likely influenced the early to mid-Holocene climate transition. The general climatic warming was interrupted by several centennialscale intervals at 8800, 8200, 7700, and 7300 cal a BP, coinciding with weaker precipitation or lower temperature inferred from other high-resolution records; these changes were likely forced by meltwater input from the Laurentide ice sheet and solar activity. Our study provides a reliable reconstruction of climatic changes in the Lower Yangtze Valley. Moreover, the phytolith record provided a more detailed reconstruction of Holocene plant communities compared with a pollen-based record from the same core. We therefore recommend the use of phytoliths for plant reconstructions (mainly grasses) in evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved mixed forests.

AB  - The aim of the research was to study the yield indicators of 36 early-ripening potato varieties in the northern region (Arkhangelsk) and the highlands of the North Caucasus (altitude 2500m above sea level). Experimental work was carried out in 2015-2020. Features of the northern zone - a light period of up to 21 hours in June - July, contributing to an increase in the duration of interphase periods of plant development. In the highlands, a short daylight hours of 14 hours, a sharp drop in daytime temperatures 15,1 - 25,8 degrees C and night temperatures 7,8 - 15,2 degrees C and intense solar insolation. Peat-podzolicgley soils of the northern region are characterized by low humus (3,7%) and high - potassium (240 ... 267 mg/kg) in comparison with mountain meadow subalpine soils of high mountains (6,7% and 102 ... 120 mg/kg). Potatoes were planted in the first decade of June, harvesting - in early September. Was planted 25 tubers of each variety according to the scheme 0,7 x 0,3 m, the area of the accounting plot was 5.25 m(2). Using cluster, discriminant analyzes, the varieties were grouped according to a set of indicators: the multiplication factor, the yield of one plant and the average mass of tubers. In the northern region, the best were the varieties that formed from 8,1 to 11,4 tubers with an average weight of 37,0 ... 67,9 g and a yield of 400 ... 633 g. In the highlands, the varieties that formed 11,8 ... 19,8 pcs., 56,5 ... 70,6 g and 830... 1140, respectively, were the most productive. According to the results of the assessment of plasticity of 36 early-ripening potato varieties, they were resistant to extreme environmental conditions in northern and high mountains. zones were characterized by only five varieties: Daryonka, Red Lady, Breeze, Leader, Gulliver.

AB  - The expansion and complication of the modern sphere of social services and social responsibility, aimed at improving the lives of the population, raises questions regarding the influence of the status and prestige of social workers on the result of their activities. The purpose of the article is to develop a model for the formation of public inter-corporate professional prestige of social workers, taking into account the specifics of the social environment and regional peculiarities. Methods. The diagnostics of the level of social and inter-corporate prestige of social workers at the regional level was conducted by assessing the following three groups of indicators of professional activity, public and corporate prestige, which are the structural components of the proposed model. The study uses the results of sociological surveys conducted in the Khabarovsk Territory in 2016-2018, as well as the methods of structural and functional analysis. Results. The studies, conducted in the Khabarovsk Territory, showed that the growth of the prestige of social work and social workers is hampered by relatively high numbers of people in need and people with low incomes, high indicators of mortality and longevity, a high cost of living and high rates of migration. The low level of prestige of social workers demonstrates the need for eliminating the existing stereotypes by the administrative, methodical and educational methods. The article presents an algorithm for assessing the image of social workers using the model as a tool to improve the quality of social work and the professionalism of social workers in the regional conditions.
   Conclusions and application. The proposed model demonstrates the importance of increasing prestige as a factor in the improvement of social work, describes the method of constructing a model and the organizational and methodological actions for its implementation in practice. The conclusions and results may be of interest to various social structures and educational institutions to optimize the processes of social work, to present the means to increase the prestige of workers, as well as to improve their professional training.

AB  - The direct root-zone irrigation system is a new technique to deliver water directly to the root zone of grapevines at specific irrigation rates and delivery depths. The response of Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon to direct root-zone deficit irrigation was investigated in a commercial vineyard with loamy sand soil in the semi-arid lower Columbia Basin of southcentral Washington State, USA. Three irrigation rates and three delivery depths were compared for effects on grape yield and crop water use efficiency during three consecutive growing seasons. Furthermore, we investigated the influence of irrigation rate on grape quality, and used an in situ root imaging system for root phenotyping under different delivery depths for two years. Results showed that delivery depth had no significant effect on grape yield and crop water use efficiency; however, increases in delivery depth from 30 cm to 90 cm resulted in 60-70% decreased root number and 46-59% decreased root length in the upper soil profile (0-60 cm). Moderate irrigation rates (35% less water use on average) improved crop water use efficiency by 14-23% and only reducing grape yield 15-18% per individual grapevine, without sacrificing grape quality or inducing early defoliation for the first two years. Surprisingly, no significant reduction of grape yield was found in the third year, which can be attributed to cooler and wetter weather and potentially vine acclimation to the direct root-zone irrigation strategy. We conclude that direct root-zone deficit irrigation could be a convenient and efficient subsurface irrigation method to improve crop water use efficiency without reducing grape quality under seasonal drought. Future studies should compare the economic and environmental returns of direct root-zone deficit irrigation with other traditional irrigation strategies under different environmental conditions to optimize the direct root-zone deficit irrigation method.

AB  - We proved that plants A. cylindrica, T. spelta, T. turgidum, T. sphaerococcum, T. vavilovii, T. persicum, T. araraticum, T. aestivum var. barbarossa, and T. aestivum var. ferrugineum, owning high drought resistance, have a stable high productive potential and quality indicators of grain (protein, gluten, dietary fiber content), that allows use them in the production of products functional purpose (bakery, confectionery, sour-dairy products, including yoghurts, and dessert cheese). Implementation mechanisms are disclosed adaptive potential plants of cultural and wild cereals by biochemical (protein content, gluten, starch in seeds, the presence of gliadin proteins (Gli-1.1, Gli-6D2, Gli-6D3, Gli-6.2), molecular-genetic markers (allele genes of drought resistance - Dreb A1, Dreb B1, Dreb D1; glutenins Glu-D1) and morphological-ontogenetic criteria. For the first time for successful address introduction cultural and wild cereal plants suggested by the criteria of mechanisms drought resistance to rank plants by potential ecological valence regarding the unfavorable hydrothermal regime. Differentiation of genotypes based on elements of plant strategies: features of their ontogeny, morphological characteristics, physiological and biochemical parameters, biochemical and molecular-genetic markers. In this connection, genotypes of cultural and wild cereal plants in conditions in s.tu by sensitivity on the effect of hydrothermal stress are divided into xerophytic, mesophytic and intermediate - xerophytic-mesophytic types of development. That's it ranking underlying on the principles of autecological approach, manifestation of a multi-level system of answers plant organisms at different levels of integration, as adaptive reactions. In particular, mechanisms such as: functional stability (stipulated structural and functional features of plants), morphological tolerance (the ability of plants to resist damage without reducing performance), ontogenetic evasion (stability due to features ontogenetic development), ecological plasticity of the organism and plant populations as a whole. The obtained results of the biochemical and molecular genetic markers of adaptability and quality indicators of genotypes cultural (wheat, triticale, rye) and wild cereals (A. cylindrica, T. spelta, T. turgidum and others) are important in breeding and successive targeted use in the food industry are given.

AB  - Urbanisation is regarded as one of the most threatening global issues for wildlife, however, measuring its impact is not always straight forward. Oxidative stress physiology has been suggested to be a useful biomarker of health and therefore, a potentially important indicator of the impact that urban environmental stressors, especially air pollution, can have on wildlife. For example, nitrogen oxides (NOx), released during incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, are highly potent pro-oxidants, thus predicted to affect either the protective antioxidants and/or cause oxidative damage to bio-molecules. To date, epidemiological modelling of the predicted association between oxidative stress and NOx exposure has not been performed in wild animals. Here, we address this short-coming, by investigating multiple oxidative stress markers in four common passerine bird species, the blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus), great tit (Parus major), house sparrow (Passer domesticus) and tree sparrow (Passer montanus), living along a gradient of NOx and urbanisation levels in southern Sweden. First of all, the results revealed that long-and medium-term (one month and one week, respectively) NOx levels were highly correlated with the level of urbanisation. This confirms that the commonly used urbanisation index is a reliable proxy for urban air pollution. Furthermore, in accordance to our prediction, individuals exposed to higher long-and medium-term NOx levels/urbanisation had higher plasma antioxidant capacity. However, only tree sparrows showed higher oxidative damage (protein carbonyls) in relation to NOx levels and this association was absent with urbanisation. Lipid peroxidation, glutathione and superoxide dismutase levels did not co-vary with NOx/urbanisation. Given that most oxidative stress biomarkers showed strong species-specificity, independent of variation in NOx/urbanisation, the present study highlights the need to study variation in oxidative stress across contexts, seasons and life-stages in order to understand how the ecology and phylogeny of species interact to affect species resilience to urban environmental stress.

AB  - Opportunistic citizen data documenting species observations i.e. observations collected by citizens in a non-standardized way is becoming increasingly available. In the absence of scientific observations, this data may be a viable alternative for a number of research questions. Here we test the ability of opportunistic species records to provide predictions of the realized distribution of species and if species attributes can act as indicators of the reliability and completeness of these data. We use data for 39 reptile and amphibian species across mainland Portugal as a case study. We collected distribution data from two independent sources: a national citizen-science project and a scientific. We measure and compare the climatic niche width of the species as represented by each of the two data sources. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) were used to relate a set of response variables describing the species morphology, life-history, communication, type of locomotion, habitat and geographic distribution, to observed differences in niche widths. We also performed species distribution models (SDMs) for each of the two types of data using generalized additive models. We found that 12 species had more than 50% of their climate niche covered by citizen science data. Results from GLMMs suggested that the number of grid cells in which a species occurs and its use of forest habitat were positively related to the comprehensiveness of the sampling of climatic niches by citizen science data. Variation in the p of SDMs for both types of data (as measured by the true skill statistic; TSS) was highly similar but SDMs from citizen science data had an overall lower performance. Nevertheless a few species achieved good predictions (TSS > 0.6) using these data. We conclude that species observations in citizen science projects can provide accurate predictions of species realized distributions, however, efforts should be made to identify the conditions under which these data are more likely to provide reliable representations of the species niches.

AB  - The increasing health burdens pose great challenge for planners and policy makers to create a more livable city. Recent literature has linked land use to a wide range of illness and death causes in developed nations. It therefore requires evidence-driven and replicable frameworks to inform land use decisions that integrate with health promotion. This paper proposes a theoretical framework for the mechanistic links between neighborhood land use and public health; and then quantifies their associations at district level, using the case of Shenzhen in developing China. Data for 15 health indicators in 2010 are collected at district level; and a set of standardized land use variables (individual land use type, general land use mix, and physical street conditions) are proposed to comprehensively reflect the neighborhood land use characteristics. Spatial regression is employed to analyze the relationships between health outcomes and land use variables. Results show that the land use exploratory variables vary with health indicators, but several key land use determinants are identified: green land abundance, green land morphology, institutional land proximity, industrial land proximity, blue land abundance, street walkability and street connectivity. Structural equation modeling is further applied to examine the possible mediators and it demonstrates that the casual pathways between land use and public health are quite complex. The developed set of standardized land use variables can serve as practical tools to facilitate land use decisions with health considerations. In practice, several complexities at governance levels challenge the efforts to reconnect land use policies and public health promotion. We put forward three useful solutions to enhancing health connection with land use policy across different international settings. This study captures the nuanced health disparities varied with districts and indicators, and therefore produces some more generalized knowledge that ultimately helps develop land use policies aimed at promoting public health at home and abroad.

AB  - The microbial communities in recreational freshwaters play important roles in both environmental and public health perspectives. In this study, the bacterial community structure and its associations with freshwater environments were investigated by analyzing the summertime microbiomes of three beach waters in Ohio (East Fork, Delaware, and Madison lakes) together with environmental and microbial water quality parameters. From the swimming season of 2009, 21 water samples were collected from the three freshwater beaches. From the samples, 110,000 quality-checked bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained and analyzed, resulting in an observation of 4500 bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The most abundant bacteria were Mycobacterium and Arthrobacter of the Actinobacteria (33.2%), Exiguobacterium and Paenisporosarcina of the Firmicutes (23.4%), Planktothrix and Synechococcus of the Cyanobacteria (20.8%), and Methylocystis and Polynucleobacter of the Proteobacteria (16.3%). Considerable spatial and temporal variations were observed in the bacterial community of Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and Firmicutes, where the bacterial community structure was greatly influenced by hydrological and weather conditions. The most influential factors were (1) water inflow for Bacteroidia and Clostridia, (2) turbidity for Gammaproteobacteria, (3) precipitation for Bacilli, and (4) temperature and pH for Cyanobacteria. One noticeable microbial interaction in the bacterial community was a significant negative relationship between Cyanobacteria and Bacilli (P < 0.05). Concerning beach water quality, the level of the genetic markers for cyanobacterial toxin (mcyA) was linked to the abundance of Cyanobacteria. In addition, unique distributions of the genera Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Bacteroides, Clostridium, Finegoldia, Burkholderia, and Klebsiella, together with a high density of fecal indicator Escherichia coli, were markedly observed in the sample from Madison Lake on July 13, suggesting a distinctly different source of bacterial loading into the lake, possibly fecal contamination. In conclusion, deep sequencing-based microbial community analysis can provide detailed profiles of bacterial communities and information on potential public health risks at freshwater beaches.

AB  - Recent peatland restoration studies have highlighted the need to modify the conventional approach of monitoring the recovery of biogeochemical functions through above-ground processes by integrating below-ground components, which are potentially sensitive indicators of reclamation trajectory in long-term monitoring programs. In this study, the recovery of nutrient cycling processes were assessed from both above and below-ground perspectives in a fen constructed on a post-mining landscape in the Athabasca oil sands region, Canada. The goal of this study was to understand if and how different revegetation strategies (seedlings (SDL); moss layer transfers (MLT); seedlings with moss transfer (SMLT) and a control treatment (CTRL)) influence the evolution of biogeochemical functions in the constructed fen relative to a natural reference (REF). The treatments were replicated 6 times and monitored over 2 growing seasons. Our results showed that revegetation facilitated both above-ground productivity and the cycling of below-ground nutrients, especially in the species-rich SMLT plots. Supply of labile substrates in the re-vegetated plots increased microbial potential activity. This was reflected in higher rates of respiration (c.7.8 g CO2 m(-2) day(-2)), nutrient acquisition (net immobilization) and productivity (c. -16.3 g CO2 m(-2) day(-2)) among revegetated plots relative to the CTRL. Nutrient dynamics within the constructed fen suggest that phosphorus limitation (N:P ratio > 20) could hamper the establishment of a diverse plant community, whereas the build-up of microbial biomass appears to be NO3 limited. Our results also emphasize the need to track the evolution of nutrients cycling processes through long-term monitoring programs, and identify the potential use of ammonification, nitrogen mineralization and phosphorus availability as functional indicators of a fen's recovery trajectory towards conditions present in natural fens.

AB  - Objective Wasting and stunting may occur together at the individual child level; however, their shared geographic distribution and correlates remain unexplored. Understanding shared and separate correlates may inform interventions. We aimed to assess the spatial codistribution of wasting, stunting and underweight and investigate their shared correlates among children aged 6-59months in Somalia.
   Setting Cross-sectional nutritional assessments surveys were conducted using structured interviews among communities in Somalia biannually from 2007 to 2010. A two-stage cluster sampling methodology was used to select children aged 6-59months from households across three livelihood zones (pastoral, agropastoral and riverine). Using these data and environmental covariates, we implemented a multivariate spatial technique to estimate the codistribution and divergence of the risks and correlates of wasting and stunting at the 1x1km spatial resolution.
   Participants 73778 children aged 6-59months from 1066 survey clusters in Somalia.
   Results Observed pairwise child level empirical correlations were 0.30, 0.70 and 0.73 between weight-for-height and height-for-age; height-for-age and weight-for-age, and weight-for-height and weight-for-age, respectively. Access to foods with high protein content and vegetation cover, a proxy of rainfall or drought, were associated with lower risk of wasting and stunting. Age, gender, illness, access to carbohydrates and temperature were correlates of all three indicators. The spatial codistribution was highest between stunting and underweight with relative risk values ranging between 0.15 and 6.20, followed by wasting and underweight (range: 0.18-5.18) and lowest between wasting and stunting (range: 0.26-4.32).
   Conclusions The determinants of wasting and stunting are largely shared, but their correlation is relatively variable in space. Significant hotspots of different forms of malnutrition occurred in the South Central regions of the country. Although nutrition response in Somalia has traditionally focused on wasting rather than stunting, integrated programming and interventions can effectively target both conditions to alleviate common risk factors.

AB  - Perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) have recently received scientific and regulatory attention due to their broad environmental distribution, persistence, bioaccumulative potential, and toxicity. Studies suggest that fish consumption may be a source of human exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) or long-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids. Most PFC fish tissue literature focuses on marine fish and waters outside of the United States (U.S.). To broaden assessments in U.S. fish, a characterization of PFCs in freshwater fish was initiated on a national scale using an unequal probability design during the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) 2008-2009 National Rivers and Streams Assessment (NRSA) and the Great Lakes Human Health Fish Tissue Study component of the 2010 EPA National Coastal Condition Assessment (NCCA/GL). Fish were collected from randomly selected locations-164 urban river sites and 157 nearshore Great Lake sites. The probability design allowed extrapolation to the sampled population of 17,059 km in urban rivers and a nearshore area of 11,091 km(2) in the Great Lakes. Fillets were analyzed for 13 PFCs using high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Results showed that PFOS dominated in frequency of occurrence, followed by three other longer-chain PFCs (perfluorodecanoic acid, perfluoroundecanoic acid, and perfluorododecanoic acid). Maximum PFOS concentrations were 127 and 80 ng/g in urban river samples and Great Lakes samples, respectively. The range of NRSA PFOS detections was similar to literature accounts from targeted riverine fish sampling. NCCA/GL PFOS levels were lower than those reported by other Great Lakes researchers, but generally higher than values in targeted inland lake studies. The probability design allowed development of cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) to quantify PFOS concentrations versus the sampled population, and the application of fish consumption advisory guidance to the CDFs resulted in an estimation of the proportion of urban rivers and the Great Lakes that exceed human health protection thresholds.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a proxy for climate- and human-related historical fire activity which has rarely been used beyond 1800 AD. We explored the concentration and composition patterns of PAHs together with other proxies (charcoal, C, N, S, delta C-13, delta N-15, and delta S-34) in a sediment core of Holzmaar as indicators of variations in climate and anthropogenic activity over the past 2600 years. The concentrations of pyrogenic PAHs remained low (<500 ng g(-1)) from the pre-Roman Iron Age (600 BC) until the first significant increases to ca. 1000-1800 ng g-1 between 1700 and 1750 AD related to regional iron production. The highest increases in pyrogenic PAH concentrations occurred with industrialization peaking in the 1960s. PAH concentrations in most recent sediments decreased to pre-industrial levels because of emission control measures and the switch from coal to oil and gas as major fuel sources. Fluxes of PAHs (mg km(-2) yr(-1)) increased in the order Migration Period and Early Middle Ages < pre-Roman Iron Ages < Roman era < High Middle Ages and Renaissance < pre-industrial modern period < industrial modern period. The changes of PAHs fluxes in pre-industrial times parallel known changes in local, regional and continental anthropogenic activity and climatic variations or their interactions across these historical periods. Perylene, a mainly biologically produced compound, was the dominant PAH in pre-industrial times. The Migration Period and the Early Middle Ages witnessed the most profound and simultaneous changes to the sedimentary organic matter properties in the past 2600 years including the lowest PAH fluxes because of reduced human activity and more negative delta C-13 and delta N-15 values probably in response to colder and wetter conditions.

AB  - Relative roles of climate change and human activities in desertification are the hotspot of research on desertification dynamic and its driving mechanism. To overcome the shortcomings of existing studies, this paper selected net primary productivity (NPP) as an indicator to analyze desertification dynamic and its impact factors. In addition, the change trends of actual NPP, potential NPP and HNPP (human appropriation of NPP, the difference between potential NPP and actual NPP) were used to analyze the desertification dynamic and calculate the relative roles of climate change, human activities and a combination of the two factors in desertification. In this study, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and meteorological data were utilized to drive the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model to calculate the actual NPP from 2001 to 2010 in the Heihe River Basin. Potential NPP was estimated using the Thornthwaite Memorial model. Results showed that 61% of the whole basin area underwent land degradation, of which 90.5% was caused by human activities, 8.6% by climate change, and 0.9% by a combination of the two factors. On the contrary, 1.5% of desertification reversion area was caused by human activities and 90.7% by climate change, the rest 7.8% by a combination of the two factors. Moreover, it was demonstrated that 95.9% of the total actual NPP decrease was induced by human activities, while 69.3% of the total actual NPP increase was caused by climate change. The results revealed that climate change dominated desertification reversion, while human activities dominated desertification expansion. Moreover, the relative roles of both climate change and human activities in desertification possessed great spatial heterogeneity. Additionally, ecological protection policies should be enhanced in the Heihe River Basin to prevent desertification expansion under the condition of climate change.

AB  - Frequent severe droughts can financially cripple dryland farm businesses and farmers need effective business strategies to survive. This study analysed the economic performance of 123 farms in a rainfed agricultural region of Australia from 2004 to 2009, a period that included severe droughts in 2006 and 2007. The business indicators examined were business equity, operating profit/ha, return on capital, and the debt to income ratio and the droughts altered these indicators for many of the farms surveyed. Over the study period the equity position of just over 60% of farms declined, although 55% of these had more than 80% equity in the business initially and were able to absorb a short term decline in equity caused by the drought. In addition, 9% of farms had levels of equity below 80% at the start of the investigation, but actually improved their equity position by the end of the study. Strong links were found between wheat yield and the business indicators. Mostly this was due to the crop dominant nature of the farm businesses where wheat was by far the main crop. However, farms that were able to capitalise on favourable conditions in other years were better placed to enhance or recover their financial position. Farms that cropped a higher proportion of their farm area were at an advantage. Structural indicators, including the percentage of area cropped, had a small but significant effect on the debt to income ratio, the return on capital and operating profit. Farm diversity also favourably lessened the debt to income ratio. Other factors, including farm size did not influence the outcome of any business indicator. Farms that remained resilient, despite the serious droughts were those that cropped more than 50% of their farm area, were prudent in their expenditure, maintained some enterprise diversity and often generated wheat yields in each year that were near the yield potential for that year.

AB  - The composition of the nematode fauna at two different agrosystems (banana monocultures and mixed banana-palmito plantations) was investigated at six study sites on the coastal plain of southern Brazil. Nematode abundance was higher and the number of families was lower (25 compared to 33) in the soil of banana monocultures. The assemblages in the soil of the banana monocultures were dominated by bacterial feeders and plant parasites, whereas in the soil of the mixed plantations the proportion of the other trophic groups was higher. In the monocultures, the percentage of families categorised as colonisers (c-p 1 families) was higher and the persisters lower. The difference in the assemblage of c-p groups was significant between sites of the two different systems. Principal component analysis (PCA) ordination of the samples by nematode family composition showed site-specific assemblages, similarity between two sites of each system and significant dissimilarities between the two systems. The MI 1-5 and the MI 2-5 were lower in the banana monocultures. Additionally, the MI 2-5 of banana site B2 was significantly higher than that of the two other banana sites. The ratio F/B was higher and the ratio (F + B)/plant feeders was lower in the banana-palmito plantations. The differences between the systems in nearly all measured parameters indicate a higher degree of disturbance and nutrient enrichment of the soil under monocultures. However, a low number of plant parasites and dominance of c-p 3 taxa at both agroecosystems show that the soil of both agroecosystems seems to be of an advanced successional stage. This may be a result of a less intensive 'organic' cultivation without the use of plant protection products and fertilisers and with additional non-host plants. Despite many non-controlled variables in the smallholder systems, according to the results the nematodes can be regarded as suitable indicators of soil disturbance in banana and banana-palmito agro-ecosystems.

AB  - The performance of two different types of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) instruments for resolving spectral overlaps on S e isotopes was compared by means of selenium isotopic ratio measurements. Examined were a quadrupole-based, hexapole collisions cell CC-ICP-MS and a double-focusing sector field SF-ICP-MS. Due to the importance of precise and accurate isotope ratio determination in environmental, clinical and nutritional studies, a thorough investigation of the critical instrumental parameters of each technique was performed. A hydride generation system was coupled with SF-ICP-MS to maintain high signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) at high mass resolution. However, Se-80(+) was not completely separated from the argon dimer Ar-40(2)+ at m/z = 80, even in high-resolution mode. The same hydride generation system was coupled to a collision cell instrument and it was found that argon dimers are significantly reduced using a mixture of H-2 and He gas with the cell. A lower mass bias of 2.5% per amu was determined for measured Se isotopes using the SF-ICP-MS instrument compared 3.6% observed for the CC-ICP-MS instrument. Under optimized conditions, the precision for Se isotope ratio measurements of both instruments was evaluated and compared measuring NIST-3149 Se standard solution. On average, the uncertainty determined by repeated measurements over the span of three individual measuring sessions in a period of 3 weeks ranged from 0.06% to 0.15% and 0.09% to 0.30% R.S.D. for the various isotope ratios using the CC-ICP-MS and SF-ICP-MS instrument, respectively. The detection limits (3l) for total Se were determined by measuring 82 Se and found to be 1.7 and 4.0 ng L-1 for the CC-ICP-MS and SF-ICP-MS, respectively. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Replacement of peat as a growing medium by a renewable material, such as an organic waste, is an issue of concern since harvesting of peat has a considerable environmental impact and, actually, it is a non-renewable resource. Cattle manure is a readily available organic waste, which means that once it goes through the composting process, it can be used as an alternative to peat, specifically, the solid fraction obtained from mechanical liquid-solid separation of cattle slurry (SF). Studies have shown it to be suitable for such uses.
   The purpose of this study was to detect possible changes in the physicochemical and chemical properties of SF when it is composted using different aeration strategies, with an emphasis on the changes that would make it feasible for use as a substrate.
   With this aim in mind, an experiment was designed with three aeration strategies that would be used during composting. The first consisted of applying air through a static method (forced ventilation). The second involved improving aeration by adding a bulking agent and a dynamic turning method. In the third strategy, aeration was carried out by turning (control).
   The results show that the different aeration strategies had a clear effect on the evolution of pH, electrical conductivity (EC), nitrate-N, ammonia-N and bicarbonate content. Nitrification was favored under good aeration conditions using the static composting method, probably due to the greater availability of ammonia-N that was transformed into nitrate-N. In general, the low buffering capacity allowed for a reduction of the pH during the curing stage of composting (in conjunction with low temperatures during this period), a characteristic that favors the use of this compost as a growing medium. We also conclude that measuring bicarbonate levels during composting could be used as an indicator of the possible acidification of the material and as a way of evaluating the level of material aeration.

AB  - To guarantee high production standards which respect the environment, decision-makers in the European Community must promote best management practices (BMPs). Given the strong interactions between pedo-climatic conditions and management, decision support systems are useful tools for selecting the more effective BMPs. An integrated non-point source (NPS) model-GIS system was designed to evaluate the production and environmental effects of alternative criteria of BMPs in the Mincio River Basin (NE-Italy). It is based on an integration of the CropSyst model (version 3.02.21) with a high informational level GIS developed in the Arc/Info environment. Three alternative criteria were evaluated: (1) obtaining maximum irrigation efficiency; (2) obtaining maximum nitrogen (N) fertilisation efficiency; (3) obtaining combined maximum irrigation and N fertilisation efficiency. The hypothetical criteria were compared applying multicriteria analysis of concordance/discordance to a set of agro-environmental indicators. The latter were obtained from field-scale CropSyst applications in the study area in the period 1994-2000. Application of the system required a preliminary 2-year validation phase of CropSyst on 12 experimental sites in the Basin that are heterogeneous in terms of climate, soil and management. The multi-criteria analysis considered the actors currently involved in the management of the Basin area: the farmer, environmentalist and politician. This application demonstrated that water flow control, through irrigation rationalisation, is the critical point for reducing pollution in the area. This allowed crop yield to be improved with a contemporary reduction in irrigation depths (50%) and nitrogen leaching (more than 50%). Irrigation rationalisation represents the best compromise between the farmers' production and livestock waste disposal requirements and the environmentalists' desire for water saving and protection. The GIS-CropSyst integration considers the different pedo-climatic and crop combinations and represents a valid support for territorial management and planning. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Toxkits are a relatively new generation of microbiotests developed by the research teams of Professor Guide Persoone at the University of Ghent, Belgium. They are an effective and cost-efficient way to perform, for example, regulatory acute aquatic toxicity screening tests of effluents, aimed at maintaining water quality and protecting biota of receiving waters. To date there are seven Toxkits on the market with different test species of different phylogenetic groups. The protocols for several of these kits (e.g., Daphtoxkit(TM) and the Algaltoxkit(TM)) adhere to national or international guidelines for toxicity testing. Supported by the Sustainable Management Fund (SMF) of the Ministry for the Environment (New Zealand), research into the development of ecotoxicity test protocols using native indicator species has been underway since 1995 at the National Institute for Water and Atmospheric Research Ltd. NZ (NIWA). The Resource Management Act of 1991 requires local authorities and industry to apply for consent to discharge effluent to water or land. Ecotoxicity testing is now being included in these consent requirements. Also supported by a grant from the SMF, Wellington Polytechnic has begun comparative sensitivity tests, using split effluent samples, with Toxkit organisms and native species. NIWA is contracted to carry out the toxicity testing with native species. Six Toxkit protocols and the IQ Toxicity Test(TM) (rapid microbiotest using fluorescing enzyme split substrate) marketed by Aqua Survey USA are being used in the comparison. In addition a round-robin intercalibration exercise will be carried out using selected Toxkits, in regional diagnostic laboratories. Information from the comparative sensitivity tests and the intercalibration exercise will be used to determine overall effectiveness and cost-efficiency of the Toxkits, under New Zealand conditions, and to make recommendations to regional authorities about their potential role as Tier I ecotoxicity screening tests in consents to discharge effluent. The research design is explained, preliminary results are presented, and an update of recent advances in Toxkit technology and their increased application in European countries is given, (C) 1998 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - 1 The performance of seedlings of Acer saccharum, Fraxinus americana, Gleditsia triacanthos and Prunus serotina was examined in eight old-field vegetation patch types and in control plots with no competition. Measurements of seedling gas exchange, water potential, foliar N, and specific leaf area were related to microenvironmental conditions and to seedling growth and survival.
   2 Among vegetated patch types, predawn leaf water potentials and midday photosynthetic rates of the tree seedlings were highest in the short-statured and shallow-rooted patches of Poa pratensis, and lowest under established trees and shrubs where both soil moisture and subcanopy irradiance are reduced.
   3 For seedlings of all tree species, photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area averaged 21-28% of that measured in control seedlings free of competition. Irradiance and photosynethesis both varied significantly among patch types, and photosynthesis was more strongly correlated with irradiance than with other variables.
   4 In all species, photosynthesis under full light was strongly correlated with photosynthesis measured under ambient light. Ambient photosynethesis most closely approached photosynethetic capacity in late-successional species (Acer > Fraxinus > Prunus > Gleditsia). Shade-tolerance thereby enhances the potential for late-successional species to invade established plant communities.
   5 The ratio of net photosynthesis to stomatal conductance in tree seedlings was decreased in competitive environments dominated by Solidago and other fast-growing herbs. Reduced water use efficiency appears to be caused by competitively induced nitrogen limitations. Some competitive environments thus reduce both soil moisture and photosynthetic water use efficiency of tree seedlings.
   6 Measurements of photosynthesis and foliar nitrogen are good indicators of long-term seedling growth, but not of survival. The complex interaction of light, moisture and nitrogen availability varies distinctively among old-field vegetation patches, and invading tree species differ in their ability to cope with these compound stresses. Such differences can explain differential tree seedling growth rates in old-field vegetation, but the densities of trees found germinating and surviving from year to year depend on other factors.

AB  - Climate change is a severe global threat. Research on climate change and vulnerability to natural hazards has made significant progress over the last decades. Most of the research has been devoted to improving the quality of climate information and hazard data, including exposure to specific phenomena, such as flooding or sea-level rise. Less attention has been given to the assessment of vulnerability and embedded social, economic and histor-ical conditions that foster vulnerability of societies. A number of global vulnerability assessments based on indicators have been developed over the past years. Yet an essential question remains how to validate those assessments at the global scale. This paper examines different options to validate global vulnerability assessments in terms of their internal and external validity, focusing on two global vulnerability indicator systems used in the WorldRiskIndex and the INFORM index. The paper reviews these global index systems as best practices and at the same time presents new analysis and global results that show linkages between the level of vulnerability and disaster outcomes. Both the review and new analysis support each other and help to communicate the validity and the uncertainty of vulnerability assessments. Next to statistical validation methods, we discuss the importance of the appropriate link between indicators, data and the indicandum. We found that mortality per hazard event from floods, drought and storms is 15 times higher for countries ranked as highly vulnerable compared to those classified as low vulnerable. These findings highlight the different starting points of countries in their move towards climate resilient development. Priority should be given not just to those regions that are likely to face more severe climate hazards in the future but also to those confronted with high vulnerability already.

AB  - The spatial and temporal locations of autoignition for direct-injection compression-ignition engines depend on fuel chemistry, temperature, pressure, and mixing trajectories in the fuel jets. Dual-fuel systems can provide insight into both fuel-chemistry and physical effects by varying fuel reactivities and engine operating conditions. In this context, the spatial and temporal progression of two-stage autoignition of a diesel-fuel surrogate, n-heptane, in a lean-premixed charge of synthetic natural-gas (NG) and air is imaged in an optically accessible heavy-duty diesel engine. The lean-premixed charge of NG is prepared by fumigation upstream of the engine intake manifold. Optical diagnostics include high-speed (15kfps) cool-flame chemiluminescenceimaging as an indicator of low-temperature heat-release (LTHR) and OH * chemiluminescence-imaging as an indicator high-temperature heat-release (HTHR). NG prolongs the ignition delay of the pilot fuel and increases the combustion duration. Zero-dimensional chemical-kinetics simulations provide further understanding by replicating a Lagrangian perspective for mixtures evolving along streamlines originating either at the fuel nozzle or in the ambient gas, for which the pilot-fuel concentration is either decreasing or increasing, respectively. The zero-dimensional simulations predict that LTHR initiates most likely on the air streamlines before transitioning to HTHR, either on fuel-streamlines or on air-streamlines in regions of near-constant phi. Due to the relatively short pilot-fuel injection-durations, the transient increase in entrainment near the end of injection (entrainment wave) is important for quickly creating auto-ignitable mixtures. To achieve desired combustion characteristics, e.g., multiple ignition-kernels and favorable combustion phasing and location (e.g., for reducing wall heat-transfer or optimizing charge stratification), adjusting injection parameters could tailor mixing trajectories to offset changes in fuel ignition chemistry.

AB  - Lichens contribute significantly to the biodiversity and functioning of many ecosystems. Although lichens are useful air pollution bioindicators and may respond in significant ways to global change, they are studied infrequently under field conditions in chamberless exposure systems. We surveyed corticolous lichens on paper birch (Befula papyrifera) and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) after 10 years exposure (1998-2007) to elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) and O-3 (eO(3)) in the Aspen-FACE experiment in Rhinelander, WI, USA. This experiment utilized chamberless exposure rings, 30 m in diameter, with both host trees planted together in one quadrant. Four treatments were allocated among 12 rings: ambient, eCO(2), eO(3), and the combination of eCO(2), eO(3), each replicated once in each of three blocks. Over the course of the experiment, ambient CO2 increased from 343 to 386 ppm while eCO(2) averaged similar to 530 ppm CO2. Ambient ozone concentrations averaged similar to 37 ppb and similar to 49 ppb for e0 3 although exposures decreased with time. Tree growth and leaf area index were negatively affected by eO(3) and stimulated by eCO(2), resulting in higher photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in eO(3) and lower in eCO(2). We assessed lichen richness and cover on five host trees per ring on the north-facing side of the trunks, which were higher on birch than on aspen. Neither of the lichen measures on birch responded to the exposure treatments, while on aspen lichen cover was highest in eO(3) and lowest in eCO(2). On aspen, lichen cover was positively related to PAR and dominated by Caloplaca. No relationship was found for birch, although Lecanora exhibited a negative relationship with PAR. These lichens were insensitive to direct effects of eCO(2) and eO(3) at the levels applied. Instead, they responded to indirect effects, such as host tree species, and changes in understory PAR, resulting from direct effects of eO(3) and eCO(2) on the host trees. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Landfilling is still the most common technology used in developing countries for the final disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW), albeit the negative impacts on the environment such as those caused by the release of greenhouse gases (GHG) that contribute to global warming (GW). The Colombian government set a target of 20% reduction in GHG emissions by year 2030, for which the solid waste management sector has an important role to play. Also, the achievement of the targets of sustainable development goals (SDG) is playing a key role for the government agenda and will do so for the next years. In this context, there is an important room for improvement of the management alternatives in currently operative landfills in the country, especially in terms of measures to reduce fugitive air emissions and leachates. This paper evaluates, using life cycle assessment (LCA) methods, the environmental impacts associated with a landfill in Colombia under four different scenarios: open dumps (zero) and conventional landfill under three landfill gas (LFG) management alternatives: venting (a), flaring (b), and energy recovery (c). The impact categories as well as the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods used were determined through the review of LCA studies for MSW management systems in developing countries. Main results show that global warming potential (GWP) was the main environmental impact caused by the landfill operation under the conditions considered; however, GWP was significantly reduced with the shifting from management scenarios with no LFG treatment (o and a: common to most landfills in developing countries) to scenarios where LFG is either flare (b) or utilized for energy production (c). These results suggest that adoption of technologies for LFG capture, burn, and energy recovery must be considered if important reductions of GHGs are expected from the waste management sector, as well as to provide economic incentives to improve the operational sustainability of landfills in developing countries.

AB  - Soil research in temperate to cool and humid regions has typically focused on acidic soils; there has been relatively little investigation of the effects of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) on unamended soil properties or function in these environments. The object of this study was to characterise the effects of small amounts of CaCO3 on pedogenic trajectories and soil biogeochemistry in a humid subalpine valley of Switzerland. To isolate the influence of CaCO3, six profiles were selected that had developed under almost identical conditions for soil formation, i.e. climate, topography, vegetation structure, time since deglaciation, silicate mineralogy and texture. The main difference between the profiles was that three contained a small quantity of CaCO3 (< 6.2%; thereafter, CaCO3 -bearing') while the remaining three contained no detectable CaCO3 (thereafter, 'CaCO3-free'). The presence of CaCO3 was associated with cascading changes in soil biogeochemistry. These changes included higher pH, an order of magnitude higher extractable Ca and twice as much soil organic carbon (SOC). CaCO3 bearing profiles also displayed a higher proportion of poorly crystalline Fe forms. The higher pH at the CaCO3 bearing site was attributable to the weak buffering provided by CaCO3 dissolution, which in turn maintained the relatively higher extractable Ca. Exchangeable Ca (Ca-Exch) and other reactive Ca forms could help stabilise SOC, contributing to its accumulation through processes such as flocculation and subsequent occlusion within aggregates and/or sorption to mineral surfaces. The increased SOC, Ca-Exch and pH at the CaCO3-bearing site could in turn be inhibiting the crystallisation of disordered Fe forms, but further research is required to confirm this effect and isolate the exact mechanisms. Overall, this study shows that the presence of small amounts of CaCO3 in humid environments has a far-reaching influence on soil biogeochemistry and further supports the idea that indicators of Ca prevalence have the potential to improve regional SOC estimates.

AB  - Snakeskin gourami (Trichopodus pectoralis) has been considered as a valuable and suitable species for breeding in fresh and brackish water regions in Vietnam. It has a high meat yield and favouritely consumed as dry-salted fish. However the dry-salted snakeskin gourami quality has gone down very fast owing to rancidity and proteolytic activity because it has high fat content and protease in its abdomen. It's necessary to have an appropriate processing and preserving approach to accelerate its commercial value in local and international markets. Edible coating supports a natural cover on the product surface to control weight loss, oil rancidity and solute movements. Biodegradability, edibility and barrier attributes are some benefits of edible coating superior to plastic bag. Storage temperature and packaging procedure affected the rancidity and proteolytic activity in the dry-salted snakeskin gourami (Trichopodus pectoralis). Purpose of this research demonstrated the efficacy of carrageenan coating on storage of dry-salted snakeskin gourami (Trichopodus pectoralis). The dried snakeskin gouramis were coated by various concentrations of carrageenan (0.5%, 0.75%, 1.0%, 1.25%, 1.5%). The efficacy of carrageenan coating was defined via quality indicators of dry-salted snakeskin gouramis such as fat rancidity: Peroxide value (mEqO2/kg), Thiobarbituric acid (mg maloaldehyde/ kg); proteolytic changes: total volatile base (TVB-N, mg N/100 g) nitrogen content and trimethylamine (TMA, mg N/100 g). In 3 month-interval, all coated samples were periodically analyzed during 12 months of preservation at ambient condition. Results showed that the carrageenan coating of 1.25% w/w, packed in vacuum bag and stored at 4oC could avoid microbial decomposition and fat oxidation of the dry-salted snakeskin gouramis. From this investigation, the dry-salted snakeskin gouramis had shelf-life at ambient storage for 12 months without deterioration. The research implied that the edible coating would be ideal to extend the stability of this valuable oil fish by inhibition of proteolytic reaction, reduction of fat rancidity and enhancement of overall acceptance.

AB  - To investigate the mechanism of the organic-matter enrichment in the Lower Longmaxi Formation shale, the geochemistry and total organic carbon (TOC) of the Longmaxi Formation black shales in the Jiaoshiba, Zhaotong, and Weiyuan areas of the Sichuan Basin were analyzed. Paleoproductivity proxy parameters (Ba-bio, Si-ex, and Ni/Al), clastic influx proxies (TiO2 and Ti/Al), redox indices (V/Cr, Ni/Co, V/(V+Ni), and U/Th), and hydrothermal indicators (Fe, Mn, and Y concentrations; Fe/Ti ratio and a Ni-Zn-Co diagram) were employed to decipher the paleoenvironment of the Lower Longmaxi Formation shales. TiO2 and Ti/Al indicated low terrigenous detrital influx in all three areas. However, Ba-bio, Si-ex, and Ni/Al indicated high productivity in the Jiaoshiba area. V/Cr, Ni/Co, and U/Th indicated higher oxygen content with larger fluctuations in the Zhaotong and Weiyuan areas. Fe, Mn, and Y concentrations and the Fe/Ti ratio implied greater active hydrothermal activity in the Weiyuan area. These heterogeneities were considered to be closely related to the paleoenvironment and paleogeography, and the large basement faults that developed during the Chuanzhong paleo-uplift could have provided vents for deep-hydrothermal-fluid upwelling. The redox indices (V/Cr, Ni/Co, and U/Th) and a paleoproductivity proxy (Ni/Al) displayed a significant correlation with the TOC, suggesting that both excellent preservation conditions and high paleoproductivity were the controlling factors for the enrichment of organic matter in the Longmaxi Formation shale. There was no obvious correlation between the clastic influx proxy (Ti/Al) and the TOC due to the extremely low supply of terrigenous debris. The hydrothermal indicator (Fe/Ti) was negatively correlated with the TOC in the Weiyuan area, indicating that hydrothermal activity may have played a negative role in the accumulation of organic matter. This study suggests that the enrichment of organic matter in the Longmaxi Formation marine shale varied according to the paleogeography and sedimentary environment.

AB  - Pelagic microcrinoids assigned to the genus Roveacrinus identified in thin-sections of carbonates of the Turonian lower Aruma Formation of Saudi Arabia provide the first documented occurrence of these microfossils in the Arabian Peninsula. The species include Roveacrinus cf. alatus Douglas 1908, Roveacrinus sp., Roveacrinus geinitzi Schneider 1989, Roveacrinus cf. geinitzi, Roveacrinus aff. rugosus Douglas 1908, Roveacrinus sp. A., Roveacrinus aff. geinitzi Schneider 1989 and Roveacrinus cf. derdereensis. The Turonian range is based on the presence of planktonic foraminifera Heterohelix moremanni, H. globulosa and Marginotruncana sigali in the absence of Rotalipora spp., although possible Cenomanian forms are present within one deep marine microfacies assemblage. The biofacies containing the often abundant Roveacrinus fragments consists typically of abundant calcareous dinoflagellate cysts Calcisphaerula innominata with less common Pithonella ovalis, and rare Bonitocardiella conica, rare to common planktonic foraminifera and rare benthonic foraminifera including Marssonella turris and Gavelinella spp. This assemblage, within very fine-grained packstones, suggests a deep marine depositional environment with low energy, normal salinity conditions. Deep marine sediments, that include Heterohelix moremanni and forms that may be transitional to H. globulosa, include roveacrinids that compare with the Cenomanian species R. derdereensis and these may prove to be supplementary useful age indicators in such environments. Although their association with pelagic microfossils would suggest a planktonic lifestyle, a definite paleoenvironmental interpretation seems elusive by most authors although there is a direct association between the roveacrinoid abundance and flooding surfaces and high-productivity events.
   Roveacrinid fragments have been recovered from calcareous mudstones of the Ruwaydha and Tuwayil members of the Aruma Formation that overlie upper Cenomanian grainstones of the Mishrif Member of the Wasia Formation. A regionally significant unconformity separates the Mishrif Formation from the Aruma Formation, of which the basal Aruma represents a significant deep marine transgression. The episodic microcrinoid distribution potentially provides regionally correlative bioevents in addition to their possible relationship with the oceanic anoxic event OAE 2.

AB  - Production of biomass feedstock for methanation in Europe has focused on silages of maize and cereals. As ecological awareness has increased in the last several years, more attention is being focused on perennial energy crops (PECs). Studies of specific PECs have shown that their cultivation may enhance agrobiodiversity and increase soil organic carbon stocks while simultaneously providing valuable feedstock for methanation. This study was designed to compare soil quality indicators under annual energy crops (AECs), PECs and permanent grassland (PGL) on the landscape level in south-western Germany. At a total 25 study sites, covering a wide range of parent materials, the cropping systems were found adjacent to each other. Stands were commercially managed, and PECs included different species such as the Cup Plant, Tall Wheatgrass, Giant Knotweed, Miscanthus, Virginia Mallow and Reed Canary Grass. Soil sampling was carried out for the upper 20cm of soil. Several soil quality indicators, including soil organic carbon (C-org), soil microbial biomass (C-mic), and aggregate stability, showed that PECs were intermediate between AEC and PGL systems. At landscape level, mean C-org content for (on average) 6.1-year-old stands of PEC was 22.37 (+/- 7.53) gkg(-1), compared to 19.23 (+/- 8.08) and 32.08 (+/- 10.11) for AEC and PGL. C-mic contents were higher in PECs (356 +/- 241g C g(-1)) compared to AECs (291 +/- 145) but significantly lower than under PGL (753 +/- 417). The aggregate stability increased by almost 65% in PECs compared to AEC but was still 57% lower than in PGL. Indicator differences among cropping systems were more pronounced when inherent differences in the parent material were accounted for in the comparisons. Overall, these results suggest that the cultivation of PECs has positive effects on soil quality indicators. Thus, PECs may offer potential to make the production of biomass feedstock more sustainable.

AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the diurnal patterns of physiological responses and the thermal regulation of adult Nellore bulls. Six 30-mo-old Nellore bulls (669 +/- 65 kg BW) were randomly assigned to four 6-h periods in a Latin Square design such that measurements of each animal cover a 24-h cycle. Meteorological variables (air temperature, relative humidity, local solar irradiance, ultraviolet radiation, wind speed and black globe temperature) were recorded at regular one-minute intervals with an automated weather station. Respiratory rate, ventilation rate, oxygen, carbon dioxide, methane, saturation pressure, air temperature of the exhaled air, saturation pressure in the air leaving the ventilated capsule placed over the animal surface, hair coat, skin surface and rectal temperature were assessed. The thermal equilibrium was determined according to the principles of the first law of thermodynamics using biophysical equations. Animals were evaluated in an area which was protected from solar radiation, rain, and had a range of ambient air temperature between 20.57 +/- 0.07 and 30.86 +/- 0.07 degrees C. Percentage of O-2 and CO2 in the exhaled air changed moderately (P < 0.0001) throughout the 24 h, which resulted in an average metabolic heat production of 151.45 +/- 13.60 W m(-2). At the largest thermal gradient (T-S - T-A; from 24:00-07:00 h), heat transferred by long wave radiation and surface convection corresponded to near 60% of the metabolism. At 11:00 h the ambient temperature approached 29 degrees C and latent heat became the main way to cool the body. From this time until 17:00 h, cutaneous evaporation represented approximately 53% of total heat loss. In conclusion, results of the present study seem to be a good indicator of lower energy expenditure for body thermal regulation, high heat tolerance and adaptation of Nellore cattle to the tropical environment.

AB  - The immediate effects of asymmetric warming (i.e., day-and night-time warming) on terrestrial ecosystems have been well documented, but the time-lag effects remain poorly understood. In this paper, we investigated the global inter-annual hysteretic responses of vegetation to asymmetric warming over the period of 1982-2013. The net primary production (NPP) was employed as the indicator of vegetation growth, and accumulated monthly average daily maximum temperature and minimum temperature (ATmax and ATmin) were used to reflect the asymmetric warming condition. Additionally, partial correlation analyses were conducted to examine the correlations between NPP and ATmax/ATmin on a monthly scale. Furthermore, the best time lags that ATmax/ATmin had on NPP and the optimal correlations between ATmax/ATmin and NPP were analyzed by time-lag analyses. The results showed that (i) vegetation responded to the asymmetric warming with near 12 month delays at a global scale, and vegetation exhibited larger lags in responding to recent warming over temperature-limited areas or semiarid and subhumid regions compared to other places; (ii) compared with ATmin, ATmax had longer time-lag effects on biomes over mid-high latitudes (45 degrees N-90 degrees N, 23 degrees S-60 degrees S) and high altitudes (i.e., the Tibetan Plateau and the Brazil Plateau) and smaller delay impacts on biomes in other regions; (iii) with hysteretic impacts considered, ATmax correlated positively with vegetation in temperature-limited areas and negatively in heat-sufficient and water-deficit places, and the reverse was mostly true for ATmin. These phenomena may be associated with the intrinsic differences in the mechanisms that day-and night-time temperatures have on vegetation growth. Our paper gives new insights into the non-uniform responses of the terrestrial ecosystem to asymmetric warming. Looking ahead, terrestrial ecosystem models are highly recommended to incorporate such non-uniform time-lag impacts and distinguished correlations so as to improve their performances in future work.

AB  - Heat transfer fluids are important component in transferring heat through heat exchangers in variety of industrial applications including solar energy. Measurement of convective heat transfer coefficients in experimental setup simulating as much actual operating conditions as possible is one reliable method. Experimenting with fully synthetic heat transfer oil meant for use in concentrated solar power plants, the paper presents experimental data for the oil run in a closed-loop indoor test setup up to high temperatures of 200 A degrees C and at two flow rates of 900 and 1200 kg h(-1). Convective heat transfer coefficients were calculated based on actual steady-state heat transfer taking place between the hot oil and cold water flowing in a counterflow shell and tube heat exchanger. It was observed that the convective heat transfer coefficient is higher at lower oil flow rate and there is more variation in the experimental values at lower flow rates of oil. On the contrary, the coefficients of convective heat transfer on the basis of empirical correlations at same two oil flow rates were calculated to be higher at higher oil flow rate with the variation uniformly patterned. With respect to calculations based on empirical correlations and experimentally observed values, a comparison of convective heat transfer coefficient "hi" for oil at the two flow rates, the empirically calculated heat transfer coefficients show an increasing trend with a definite gradient, while the experimental values show variable trend which is increasing initially with temperature, then drops slightly and then again starts to increase. In view of the fact that the empirical correlations do not take into account the nature and chemistry of the oil, it has been concluded that the experimental determination of heat transfer coefficient is reliable and feasible, though it may not necessarily correlate with the theoretically derived values.

AB  - This paper presents a new approach when dealing with availability and reliability of wireless optics by employing several prediction methods for RSSI parameter in hard FSO/RF switching methodology. Despite the fact that FSO link signal and its overall communication is strongly affected by weather conditions (fog, heavy rains, snow, etc.), the strength of RSSI will finally result in link availability or a signal fade. Eventually, there is almost unlimited number of weather states which have either positive or negative impact on RSSI and FSO link, respectively. However, the way that nature and surrounding world are organized is behavioral patterns which can be found everywhere. Finding appropriate pattern is mostly matter of scale of observed group of parameters. Machine learning, data mining or big data are interchangeable terms used in pattern finding processes. We have decided to leverage the power of machine learning algorithms to predict RSSI parameter base on measured weather parameters in this paper. First chapter is dedicated to a deep analysis of negative effects encountered when light propagates through an atmospheric channel and deteriorate optical signal. In following, we paid attention to practical design and assembly of a monitoring device. The further discussion evaluates the methodologies of so called soft and hard switching between FSO and RF (Radio Frequency) link. The primary attention was paid to the hard switching technique and to relations between the received signal strength indicator with the parameters influencing atmospheric channel. Selected machine learning methods and their modifications (AdaBoostClassifier with DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier) were applied in this analysis in order to estimate received optical power parameter based on series of weather parameters. Such a process involves classification and regression methods. This paper presents finding out an optimal scheme for input matrix as an essential for machine learning training process. Considered time and calculation requirements are compensated by employing automation tools in overall process. Finally, we conclude and evaluate the outcomes of machine learning models in FSO/RF hard switching process.

AB  - Heat stress has a significant impact on all livestock and poultry species causing economic losses and animal well-being concerns. Providing shade is one heat-abatement strategy that has been studied for years. Material selected to provide shade for animals greatly influences the overall stress reduction provided by shade. A study was conducted to quantify both the environment and animal response, when cattle had no shade access during summertime exposure or were given access to shade provided by three different materials. A total of 32 Black Angus heifers were assigned to one of the four treatment pens according to weight (eight animals per pen). Each pen was assigned a shade treatment: No Shade, Snow Fence, 60% Aluminet Shade Cloth and 100% Shade Cloth. In the shaded treatment pens, the shade structure covered similar to 40% of the pen (7.5 m(2)/animal). Animals were moved to a different treatment every 2 weeks in a 4x4 Latin square design to ensure each treatment was applied to each group of animals. Both environmental parameters and physiological responses were measured during the experiment. Environmental parameters included dry-bulb temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, black globe temperature (BGT), solar radiation (SR) and feedlot surface temperature. Animal response measurements included manual respiration rate (RRm), electronic respiration rate (RRe), vaginal temperature (body temperature (BT)), complete blood count (CBC) and plasma cortisol. The environmental data demonstrated changes proportional to the quality of shade offered. However, the animal responses did not follow this same trend. Some of the data suggest that any amount of shade was beneficial to the animals. However, Snow Fence may not offer adequate protection to reduce BT. For some of the parameters (BT, CBC and cortisol), 60% Aluminet and 100% Shade Cloth offers similar protection. The 60% Aluminet lowered RRe the most during extreme conditions. When considering all parameters, environmental and physiological, 60% Aluminet Shade Cloth offered reductions of BGT, SR, feedlot surface temperature and the best (or equal to the best) overall protection for the animals (RRe, RRm, BT, blood parameters).

AB  - Long-distance migratory birds are declining globally and migration has been identified as the primary source of mortality in this group. Despite this, our lack of knowledge of habitat use and quality at stopovers, i.e., sites where the energy for migration is accumulated, remains a barrier to designing appropriate conservation measures, especially in tropical regions. There is therefore an urgent need to assess stopover habitat quality and concurrently identify efficient and cost-effective methods for doing so. Given that fuel deposition rates directly influence stopover duration, departure fuel load, and subsequent speed of migration, they are expected to provide a direct measure of habitat quality and have the advantage of being measurable through body-mass changes. Here, we examined seven potential indicators of quality, including body-mass change, for two ecologically distinct Neotropical migratory landbirds on stopover in shade-coffee plantations and tropical humid premontane forest during spring migration in Colombia: (1) rate of body-mass change; (2) foraging rate; (3) recapture rate; (4) density; (5) flock size; (6) age and sex ratios; and (7) body-mass distribution. We found higher rates of mass change in premontane forest than in shade-coffee in Tennessee Warbler Oreothlypis peregrina, a difference that was mirrored in higher densities and body masses in forest. In Gray-cheeked Thrush Catharus minimus, a lack of recaptures in shade-coffee and higher densities in forest, also suggested that forest provided superior fueling conditions. For a reliable assessment of habitat quality, we therefore recommend using a suite of indicators, taking into account each species' ecology and methodological considerations. Our results also imply that birds stopping over in lower quality habitats may spend a longer time migrating and require more stopovers, potentially leading to important carryover effects on reproductive fitness. Evaluating habitat quality is therefore imperative prior to defining the conservation value of newly identified stopover regions.

AB  - We studied enchytraeid communities in several habitats polluted by heavy metals from Zn-Pb mining and smelting activities. We sampled 41 sites that differed in the type of substratum(carbonate rock, metal-rich carbonate mining waste, siliceous sand) and land management (planting Scots pine, topsoiling, leaving to natural succession), and the distance from the smelter. Our main aims were to determine which pollution variables and natural factors most influenced enchytraeid species composition, richness and density, and examine what was the effect of planting Scots pine (reclamation) on enchytraeid communities. The soils harboured on average 1 to 5 enchytraeid species and 700 to 18,300 individuals per square metre, depending on the habitat. These figures were generally lower than those reported from unpolluted regions. Redundancy and multiple regression analyses confirmed the negative impact of heavy metal pollution on both enchytraeid community structure and abundance. Among pollution variables, the distance from the smelter best explained the variation in enchytraeid communities. The concentrations of heavy metals in the soil had less (e.g. total Pb and exchangeable Zn) or negligible (water-soluble forms) explanatory power. Natural soil properties were nearly irrelevant for enchytraeids, except for soil pH, which determined the species composition. Plant species richness was an important explanatory variable, as it positively affected most parameters of enchytraeid community. The results of two-by-two factorial comparisons (planting Scots pine vs. natural succession; carbonate mining waste vs. siliceous sand) suggest that reclamation can improve soil quality for biota, since it increased the diversity and abundance of enchytraeids; this effect was not dependent on the type of substratum. In conclusion, enchytraeids responded negatively to heavy metal pollution and their response was consistent and clear. These animals can be used as indicators of metal toxicity even in the presence of high natural variability, but it is recommended to study their species composition. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Currently, there is no meaningful methodology for the estimation of environmental impacts from long-term heavy metal emissions in a life cycle assessment (LCA) context, when an assessment of landfill and mining technologies is performed. In this paper, the aims are to investigate the main issues hindering the standardisation of a methodology to account for potential impacts from long-term metal emissions, and to describe the characteristics of a robust framework for an operational impact assessment methodology.
   In order to demonstrate the issues around potential impacts from long-term emissions in LCA and derive a scientific basis for developing an adequate LCA methodology to address these impacts, a two-part review on long-term metal emissions is performed that (a) identifies a suitable time-dependent life cycle inventory (LCI) while underlining the problems in existing emission prediction attempts and (b) describes the existing LCA approaches for accounting of toxic potential impacts from these emissions while explaining the reason that the identified proposals have not been adopted from the LCA community. These approaches are then compared upon the basis of a common LCI and their differences are highlighted.
   A suitable dynamic LCI is identified for landfill emissions, which calculates Ni, Zn, Cd and Pb emissions as a function of time, based on assumed developments of the leachate pH. The results of the application of the different impact assessment methods on that LCI differ by up to 8 orders of magnitude. Therefore, the decision-making process supported by an LCA becomes very confusing. None of the approaches consider future changes in the receiving environment and are accompanied with any uncertainty considerations.
   In order to move towards a robust environmental assessment of long-term emissions, it is necessary to (i) represent future potential impacts more accurately by estimating time-dependent characterisation factors (CFs) corresponding to changing environmental conditions, (ii) develop more robust estimations by addressing uncertainty and (iii) refer to actual potential impacts, by taking into account the current and future background concentrations.

AB  - Municipal parks in the city of Sao Paulo, which are used for leisure purposes, contain remnants of the flora of the Atlantic Forest, as well as lakes and springs, and are home to mammals, birds and arthropods, some of which can be vectors of disease. The eastern side of the city has the largest population in Sao Paulo and twenty-four municipal parks. The aim of this study was to investigate Culicidae fauna in two parks on this side of the city and to determine which of the Culicidae species identified have the potential to act as bioindicators and vectors of human pathogens. Culicidae were collected monthly between March 2011 and February 2012 in Carmo Park and Chico Mendes Park with battery-powered aspirators, Shannon traps and CDC traps for adult mosquitoes, and larval dippers and suction samplers for immature mosquitoes. To confirm sample sufficiency, the EstimateS program was used to plot sample-based species accumulation curves and estimate total richness by the Jackknife 1 method. In all, 1,092 culicids from nine genera (Aedes, Anopheles, Coquillettidia, Culex, Limatus, Mansonia, Trichoprosopon, Toxorhynchites and Uranotaenia) and nineteen taxonomic units were collected in Carmo Park. Coquillettidia venezuelensis (Theobald 1912), Aedes scapularis (Rondani 1848) and Culex (Culex) spp. Linnaeus 1758 were the most abundant adults, and Culex (Melanoconion) spp. Theobald 1903 and Anopheles strodei Root 1926 the most abundant immature mosquitoes. In Chico Mendes Park 4,487 mosquitoes in six genera and eighteen taxonomic units were collected. Culex (Cux.) spp. and Ae. scapularis were the most abundant adults, and Ae. albopictus (Skuse 1984) the most abundant immature mosquitoes. The species accumulation curves in both parks were close to the asymptote, and the total richness estimate was close to the observed richness. Some culicid taxons are bioindicators of environmental conditions in the areas they inhabit. It is important to monitor native fauna in municipal parks in Sao Paulo as various species in this study were found to have vector competence and capacity to transmit pathogens, such as arboviruses.

AB  - We isolated diurnal timescale contributions to a 6-year hourly radon record and incorporated them in ME-2 as a proxy for changes in atmospheric mixing depth in an attempt to improve the source apportionment of fine atmospheric particulate matter (PM2.5). Results from this radon-based implementation of ME-2 are directly compared with the more traditional ME-2 implementation where wind speed is used, as a proxy for changes in mixing depth. The radon-based version more accurately reproduced daily PM2.5 source contributions, as evidenced by better correlations with the results from the corresponding bi-linear model. The versions of ME-2 employed in this study were modified to account for calm wind conditions separately, and a recently updated solution approach was adopted.
   Source apportionment for the radon-based ME-2 implementation was most successful for the finer, primary emissions (Smoke, Autos, Industry) that are more easily suspended and whose concentrations are more directly tied to changes in atmospheric mixing depth. Incorporation of the diurnal radon signal in ME-2 improved the estimated source strength distributions of the Smoke, Autos and Industry sources with respect to the township of Muswellbrook. It also resulted in a more consistent anti-correlation between these 3 source types and atmospheric mixing depth than for the wind speed case. These results confirm that near surface radon concentration is more closely tied to atmospheric mixing depth (and therefore pollutant concentrations) than wind speed.
   The measurement site for this study is a small township in a rural setting, with nearby power stations and open-cut coal mines. Consequently, the distribution and characteristics of anthropogenic aerosol sources are very different than for a typical urban or industrial setting. This is reflected in lower correlation between the multi-linear models and the corresponding bi-linear models, indicating that the performance of multi-linear models is affected by the nature of the distribution of sources.

AB  - Objective: The relationship between milk yield and both fertility and general animal health in dairy herds is discussed from opposing viewpoints. The hypothesis (1) that raising the herd milk yield would decrease fertility results, the number of milk cells as an indicator for udder health and the replacement rate as a global indicator for animal health as well as increasing the occurrence of specific diseases as a herd problem was compared to the opposing hypotheses that there is no relationship (2) or that there is a differentiated and changing relationship (3). Material and methods: A total of 743 herd examinations, considered independent, were performed in 489 herds between 1995 and 2010. The milk yield, fertility rate, milk cell count, replacement rate, categorized herd problems and management information were recorded. The relationship between the milk yield and both the fertility data and animal health was evaluated using simple and multiple regression analyses. Results: The period between calving and the first service displayed no significant relationship to the herd milk yield. Simple regression analysis showed that the period between calving and gestation, the calving interval and the insemination number were significantly positively associated with the herd milk yield. This positive correlation was lost in multiple regression analysis. The milk cell count and replacement rate using both the simple and multiple regression analyses displayed a significant negative relationship to the milk yield. Conclusion and clinical relevance: The alternative hypothesis (3) was confirmed. A higher milk yield has no negative influence on the milk cell count and the replacement rate in terms of the udder and general health. When parameterizing the fertility, the herd milk yield should be considered. Extending the resting time may increase the milk yield while preventing a decline in the insemination index.

AB  - The sustainable use of productive resources by agricultural producers in the central valley of Chile should be compatible with economic results so that producers can select an appropriate rotation or succession of annual crops and pasture. The objective of this work was to evaluate the economic behavior of four food crop and supplementary forage rotations using indicators of profitability and profit variability. Productive data were used from a long-term experiment (16 yr) in the central valley of Chile under conditions of irrigation. With productive data and information on historic input/output prices, the real net margin per rotation (RNMR) and its coefficient of variation (CV) were determined. The results indicated that the highest economic benefits and greatest economic stability were obtained with rotations that only included crops, namely sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L. subsp. vulgaris)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)-barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) (CR2) and corn (Zea mays L.)-wheat-bean-barley (CR4). These rotations included crops with low CV of the net margin, such as wheat, barley and beans, with values between 0.31 and 0.34. The rotations with crops and pasture, sugar beet-wheat-red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) (2) (CR1) and corn-wheat-red clover (2) (CR3) had lower net margins and more variability of this indicator. Red clover had the highest CV value (1.00). The selection of crops for rotations and their sequence were determining factors in the economic behavior of rotations, affecting the level of RNMR and the degree of inter-annual variability of this indicator. Thus, differences among rotations of 47% in net margin were determined (CR2 vs. CR1), which only differed in the replacement of pasture with red clover (2) by bean-barley. The economic analysis based on the net margin and its variability allow for discriminating among rotations, providing valuable information for producers in deciding which crops to use in rotations.

AB  - The hydrogen isotopic ratios (H-2/H-1) of land plant leaf water and the carbon-bound hydrogen of leaf wax lipids are valuable indicators for climatic, physiological, metabolic and geochemical studies. Temperature will exert a profound effect on the stable isotopic composition of leaf water and leaf lipids as it directly influences the isotopic equilibrium (IE) during leaf water evaporation and cellular water dissociation. It is also expected to affect the kinetics of enzymes involved in lipid biosynthesis, and therefore the balance of hydrogen inputs along different biochemical routes. We conducted a controlled growth experiment to examine the effect of temperature on the stable hydrogen isotopic composition of leaf water and the biological and biochemical isotopic fractionations during lipid biosynthesis. We find, that leaf water H-2 enrichment at 20 degrees C is lower than that at 30 degrees C. This is contrary to the expectation that at lower temperatures leaf water should be more enriched in H-2 due to a larger equilibrium isotope effect associated with evapotranspiration from the leaf if all other variables are held constant. A hypothesis is presented to explain the apparent discrepancy whereby lower temperature-induced down-regulation of available aquaporin water channels and/or partial closure of transmembrane water channel forces water flow to "detour" to a more convoluted apoplastic pathway, effectively increasing the length over which diffusion acts against advection as described by the Peclet effect (Farquhar and Lloyd, 1993) and decreasing the average leaf water enrichment. The impact of temperature on leaf water enrichment is not reflected in the biological isotopic fractionation or the biochemical isotopic fractionation during lipid biosynthesis. Neither the biological nor biochemical fractionations at 20 degrees C are significantly different from that at 30 degrees C, implying that temperature has a negligible effect on the isotopic fractionation during lipid biosynthesis.

AB  - The influence of physical and chemical parameters on the abundance and diversity of chironomids was studied in six rivers with moderate to highly polluted water in the Juru River Basin. The rivers: Ceruk Tok Kun (CTKR) as reference site, and polluted rivers of Pasir (PR), Juru (JR), Permatang Rawa (PRR), Ara (AR) and Kilang Ubi (KUR) were sampled over a period of five months (November 2007 March 2008). Nine chirnomid species: Chironimus kiiensis, C. javanus, Polypedilum trigonus, Microchironomus sp., Dicrotendipes sp., Tanytarsus formosanus, Clinotanypus sp., Tanypus punctipennis and Fittkauimyia sp. were identified. Assessment of their relationships with several environmental parameters was performed using the canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Tanytarsus formosanus was the most dominant in the relatively clean CTKR and moderately polluted JR with mean densities of 19.66 and 25.32 m(-2), respectively while C. kiiensis was abundant in more polluted rivers. Tanytarsus formosanus, Dicrotendipes sp. and Microchironomus sp. were grouped under moderate to high water temperature, total organic matter (TOM), total suspended solids (TSS), velocity, pH, phosphates and sulphates. However, Tanypus punctipennis, Fittkauimyia sp., and Clinotanypus sp. were associated with high contents of river sediment such as TOM, Zn and Mn and water ammonium-N and nitrate-N and they were associated with higher dissolved oxygen (DO) content in the water. Chironomus kiiensis, C. javanus and P trigonus showed positive relationships with TOM, ammonium-N and nitrate-N as well as trace metals of Zn, Cu and Mn. These three species could be considered as tolerant species since they have the ability to survive in extreme environmental conditions with low DO and high concentrations of pollutants. Based on the water parameter scores in all rivers, the highest diversity of chironomid larvae was reported in CTKR. With higher concentrations of organic and/or inorganic pollutants as reported in PPR, KUR and AR, the chironomid larval diversity decreased, and the abundance of tolerant species, mainly Chironomus spp., increased.

AB  - Several temperature-humidity indexes (THI) have been used to estimate the degree of thermal stress experienced by dairy cows. The present objectives were to develop equations using meteorological variables that predicted rectal temperature of lactating cows in a subtropical environment and compare the goodness of fit of these equations to those using 8 different THI. Rectal temperature was measured between 1500 and 1700 h in 1,280 lactating Holstein cows in north central Florida between August and December. Meteorological data recorded in the barn where cows were located included dry bulb temperature (Tdb), relative humidity (RH), dew point temperature, and wind speed. Wet bulb temperature was calculated. In the first series of analyses, regression analysis was used to model rectal temperature using the meteorological variables as well as THI. The r(2) using Tdb (0.41) was slightly less than for models using all but one THI (r(2) between 0.42 and 0.43). The r(2) for equations using Tdb could be improved by adding RH (r(2) = 0.43) or RH and RH2 (r(2) = 0.44) to the model. In the second analysis, regression analysis was performed using forward selection, backward elimination, and stepwise selection procedures with the meteorological variables. All models gave a similar goodness of fit (r(2) = 0.44). An analysis of variance with rectal temperature as a class variable was performed to determine the least squares means of meteorological measurements associated with hyperthermia. A Tdb of 29.7 degrees C was associated with rectal temperature of 39 degrees C, and a Tdb of 31.4 degrees C was associated with rectal temperature of 39.5 degrees C. In conclusion, Tdb is nearly as good a predictor of rectal temperatures of lactating Holsteins in a subtropical environment as THI. Estimates of values of meteorological variables associated with specific rectal temperatures should prove valuable in relating environmental conditions to the magnitude of hyperthermia experienced by heat-stressed cows.

AB  - Aims: Subcolonies of penguins differ markedly in physical characteristics and inbreeding success. Subcolony size is the best studied subcolony characteristic and has been suggested to be an important factor explaining the variation in reproductive success. Small subcolonies generally have lower breeding success, probably because they suffer from worse environmental conditions. It is likely that lower quality individuals also occupy smaller subcolonies, which in turn affects breeding success. However, results are not always consistent, and other subcolony characteristics may mediate breeding success. In the present study, the relationship is investigated between physical subcolony characteristics (slope, isolation and size) and several variables indicative of individual quality and breeding success in the chinstrap penguin Pygoscelis antarctica.
   Location: The study was performed in the Vapour Col chinstrap penguin colony on Deception Island (South Shetlands Archipelago, 63 infinity 00'S, 60 infinity 40'W) during the austral 2002-03 breeding season.
   Methods: The slope, the degree of isolation and the size (number of nests) of 22 randomly selected subcolonies were measured. Variables indicating individual quality were considered in 10 nests of each subcolony: parental body size (bill length, bill depth, flipper length), nest size and egg size, and variables indicating breeding success: hatching date and hatching success.
   Results: Both isolated and sloped subcolonies were smaller in size, and were occupied by male parents with shorter bills and less bill depth respectively. Isolated subcolonies also showed a delayed hatching date and lower hatching success and females of more sloped subcolonies laid smaller eggs. Nest size was larger in isolated subcolonies and smaller in sloped subcolonies.
   Conclusions: This study indicates that physical characteristics of subcolonies, such as the degree of isolation and slope, rather than just size, affect breeding success of chinstrap penguins. It is also suggested that nest size could be an indicator of individual quality only if it is compared within the same subcolony or if the effect of subcolony is taking into account.

AB  - The genus Paenibacillus is a new group of bacilli separated from the genus Bacillus, and most of species have been isolated from soil. In the present study, we collected 450 spore-forming bacilli from the roots of winter crops, such as barley, wheat, onion, green onion, and Chinese cabbage, which were cultivated in the southern part of Korea. Among these 450 isolates, 104 Paenibacillus-like isolates were selected, based on their colony shape, odor, color, and endospore morphology, and 41 isolates were then finally identified as Paenibacillus spp. by 16S rDNA sequencing. Among the 41 Paenibacillus isolates, 23 were classified as P. polymyxa, a type species of the genus Paenibacillus, based on comparison of the 16S rDNA sequences with those of 32 type strains of the genus Paenibacillus from the GenBank database. Thirty-five isolates among the 41 Paenibacillus isolates exhibited antagonistic activity towards plant fungal and bacterial pathogens, whereas 24 isolates had a significant growth-enhancing effect on cucumber seedlings, when applied to the seeds. An assessment of the root-colonization capacity under gnotobiotic conditions revealed that all 41 isolates were able to colonize cucumber roots without any significant difference. Twenty-one of the Paenibacillus isolates were shown to contain the nifH gene, which is an indicator of N-2 fixation. However, the other 20 isolates, including the reference strain E681, did not incorporate the nifH gene. To investigate the diversity of the isolates, a BOX-PCR was performed, and the resulting electrophoresis patterns allowed the 41 Paenibacillus isolates to be divided into three groups (Groups A, 13, and C). One group included Paenibacillus strains isolated mainly from barley or wheat, whereas the other two groups contained strains isolated from diverse plant samples. Accordingly, the present results showed that the Paenibacillus isolates collected from the rhizosphere of winter crops were diverse in their biological and genetic characteristics, and they are good candidates for further application studies.

AB  - The focus of this paper is to consider the applicability of the hsp70 stress protein response as a biomarker in field studies. Stress proteins (or heat shock proteins, hsp) of the hsp70 family are induced by sublethal concentrations of a variety of environmental pollutants. However, few studies have applied these proteins as biomarkers of environmental stress under field conditions. Our laboratory is investigating hsp70 proteins and other responses of Asian clam (Potamocorbula amurensis) as potential biomarkers in laboratory and field studies. Our efforts include two studies presently being conducted in northern San Francisco Bay: (1) monthly collection of clams from four sites along a cadmium contamination gradient; (2) 7 day in situ exposure of clams at two selected sites at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. Here we present results on hsp70 proteins in P. amurensis in held-collected and outplanted clams. Both held projects are ongoing, therefore the results presented here do not represent completed studies; rather, they illustrate a portion of our experience. For this workshop, we illustrate weaknesses and strengths of these proteins as biomarkers, and we underscore where additional work is needed. In field-collected clams (study no. 1), site-specific differences in levels of two hsp70 proteins, hsp70 and hsp76, were measured in May and June 1997. Although an inverse correlation exists between cadmium tissue concentrations and hsp70 protein levels, differences detected may be reflective of a salinity gradient. Results from recent laboratory exposures to cadmium and a range of salinities are discussed. After in situ exposure for 7 days (study no. 2), both hsp70 and hsp76 levels were significantly reduced in clams from site R. However, given a brief heat-shock in the laboratory, hsp70 protein levels were significantly higher in clams from this site than in controls. Results indicate that downregulation as well as upregulation of hsp70 proteins may be indicators of stress in P. amurensis.

AB  - Iodine deficiency is a major public health problem in. developing countries. The main areas where goitre is prevalent have been identified but the different degrees of severity and the populations affected have not. Most countries are now attempting to obtain reliable and more extensive data.
   A pilot study was carried out in the Ivory Coast in order to improve epidemiological knowledge of iodine deficiency and collect the information required to set up an elimination programme. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of goitre and cretinism and to measure the main biochemical indicators of thyroid function (T3, T4 and TSH). The study involved 1433 people identified from a census. The prevalence of goitre was 50.3%. There was a significant difference between the examined ethnic groups: 52.7% of the Yacouba and 28.6% of the non-Yacouba had goitre. The most affected age group was 15 - 45 year The predominance of women demonstrated the susceptibility of women at child-bearing age to develop the condition. The prevalence of cretinism was approximately 1.5%. Through the assessment carried out using a grid of clinical indicators, it was possible to identify 10 cases of laboratory proven myxedematous cretinism due to hypothyroidism.
   The concentration of iodine in foodstuffs was below the limit of detection (< 7.5 mu g/kg) and iodine could not be detected in the water (< 1 mu g.l) The biological profile of the population was affected to a very limited extent with a mean value (+/- standard deviation) for TSH of 1.93 (+/- 1.56) mIU/l (0.1 - 4.0) and a free T4 value of 10 (+/- 3.46) pmol/l (8.2 - 20).
   These initial results confirm the high prevalence of endemic goitre and the low iodine content of the soil, water and food in the investigated region. The study will be complemented by a nutritional investigation to improve the understanding of iodine balance, after which an appropriate action plan will be proposed.

AB  - Using catch data collected by fishery observers from the otter trawl fleet, we describe changes in the winter distribution of cod on the Newfoundland-Labrador Shelf between 1980 and 1999. We determined the relative abundance of cod in three areas of winter aggregation: south-east of Hamilton Bank, south-east of Belie Isle Bank and south-east of Funk Island Bank. The principal finding was that the cod, during their reproductive period, exhibited significant changes in distribution and behaviour, well before the stock showed signs of collapse. There were three indicators of these changes. First, there was a progressive disappearance of fish from the north with time. Most of the biomass was located in the Hamilton Bank area before 1984. By 1989, most of the fish were found at the Belie Isle Bank and south-east of Funk Island Bank locations and by 1991, only to the south (Funk Island Bank). Second, movements of the prespawning/spawning schools became more limited. Compared with the extensive along-shelf migrations, often covering distances of about 100 km, observed in earlier years, the fish schools after 1989 exhibited less movement to the north. Density of fish in the schools was highest in 1990. By 1991, the schools remained nearly stationary around 49 degrees 30'N, near the southern end of their distribution. Third, the schools spread over an increasingly greater range of depths. The greatest density of fish as reflected by high catch rates was generally observed no deeper than 600 m between 1980 and 1988. By 1989-1990, substantial catch rates were observed as deep as 1100 m, particularly to the north although catches continued to be considerable at the shallower depths. These changes in distribution and behaviour were generally coincident with the occurrence of anomalously cold ocean temperatures and heavy ice conditions, but no direct link between these changes and the environment was evident.

AB  - The purpose of the study is to form an information model of material, technical and financial resources in construction, based on identifying and taking into account the existing initial conditions and developing proposals for their improvement at the level of accounting and management by improving the documentation process. The article examines the relationship between material, technical and financial resources in housing construction. It is proposed to consider the information resource as the main resource, because it has an impact on the formation of all other resources, and therefore, in fact, manages them. The economic indicators for the calculations were obtained by the authors from the website of the State Statistics Service of Ukraine for 2009-2020 in 24 regions of the country, JSC "Information and Analytical Center Liga", "Wikipedia" (Ukraine), forms of annual financial statements of 3 construction organizations. The potential possibility of the working population of Ukraine to purchase housing by making two hypotheses is calculated. At the junction of these hypotheses, appropriate conclusions are formed regarding the improvement of sources of financing for housing construction. Due to the study of problematic aspects of housing construction, a model of material, technical and financial resources in the context of digitalization has been formed. It is proposed to improve financial and management accounting for the formation of new synthetic and analytical accounts, internal and intermediate management documents and the methodology of financial accounting. In the course of the current research, the method of putting forward and proving (rejecting) hypotheses is used to calculate indicators of the potential of the working-age population to purchase housing for the corresponding period of time. On this basis, a comparison of a number of indicators for the regions of Ukraine was made and the lowest and highest potential opportunity for the purchase of housing was calculated. This will contribute to the renewal of natural resources, the search for alternative resources, saving time, optimizing material costs, attracting new types of monetary units (virtual funds) to the construction industry, the speed of settlements with partners, etc.

AB  - Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in rivers is mainly affected by natural conditions and human activities and can reflect the watershed pollution status to a certain extent. The Yellow River is one of the largest contributors to the global riverine sediment flux from the land to ocean, and there is a paucity of information on how the optical properties of CDOM have the potential to serve as an indicator of water quality for the sedimentladen Yellow River. In this study, a three-dimensional fluorescence parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis method was applied to investigate the seasonal and spatial variations in CDOM fluorescence components and spectral characteristics from the source region to the estuary in the mainstream of Yellow River. The relationships of CDOM with water quality indicators and trophic state were also analyzed. Six PARAFAC components (C1-C6) were identified and grouped into two categories: humic-like components (C1-C4), which accounted for 85.8 %, and protein-like components (C5 and C6), which accounted for only 14.2 %. The CDOM components, spectral parameters, and their clear correlations with the main ions (Na+ and Cl-) all indicated that the humic-like components may be primarily derived from nonpoint source erosion, and the protein-like components were mainly derived from point source discharges in the watershed. The combination of the CDOM absorption coefficient at 254 nm (a(254)), spectral slope ratio (SR), specific UV absorbance SUVA254, and fluorescence index (FI) had a good predictive ability for the key water quality indicators (total nitrogen (TN), dissolved total nitrogen (DTN), total phosphorus (TP), dissolved total phosphorus (DTP), and chlorophyll a (Chl a)) and trophic state index (TSI). Therefore, some fluorophores and UV spectral parameters of CDOM in the Yellow River can be used for rapid water quality monitoring and pollution source indication, especially pollutants related to nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients in the basin.

TI  - Detection of SARs-CoV-2 in wastewater using the existing environmental surveillance network: A potential supplementary system for monitoring COVID-19 transmission

KW  - CORONAVIRUS MERS-COV
KW  - SARS
AB  - The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is caused by SARs-CoV-2. The virus is transmitted from person to person through droplet infections i.e. when infected person is in close contact with another person. In January 2020, first report of detection of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces, has made it clear that human wastewater might contain this virus. This may illustrate the probability of environmentally facilitated transmission, mainly the sewage, however, environmental conditions that could facilitate faecal oral transmission is not yet clear. We used existing Pakistan polio environment surveillance network to investigate presence of SARs-CoV-2 using three commercially available kits and E-Gene detection published assay for surety and confirmatory of positivity. A Two-phase separation method is used for sample clarification and concentration. An additional high-speed centrifugation (14000Xg for 30 min) step was introduced, prior RNA extraction, to increase viral RNA yield resulting a decrease in Cq value. A total of 78 wastewater samples collected from 38 districts across Pakistan, 74 wastewater samples from existing polio environment surveillance sites, 3 from drains of COVID-19 infected areas and 1 from COVID 19 quarantine center drainage, were tested for presence of SARs-CoV-2. 21 wastewater samples (27%) from 13 districts turned to be positive on RT-qPCR. SARs-COV-2 RNA positive samples from areas with COVID 19 patients and quarantine center strengthen the findings and use of wastewater surveillance in future. Furthermore, sequence data of partial ORF 1a generated from COVID 19 patient quarantine center drainage sample also reinforce our findings that SARs-CoV-2 can be detected in wastewater. This study finding indicates that SARs-CoV-2 detection through wastewater surveillance has an epidemiologic potential that can be used as supplementary system to monitor viral tracking and circulation in cities with lower COVID-19 testing capacity or heavily populated areas where door-to-door tracing may not be possible. However, attention is needed on virus concentration and detection assay to increase the sensitivity. Development of highly sensitive assay will be an indicator for virus monitoring and to provide early warning signs.

AB  - Based on fifteen-year observations, we explored the interannual variations of five water use efficiency (WUE) indicators (i.e., standard ecosystem WUE (EWUE), plant-canopy WUE (PWUE), inherent WUE (IWUE), underlying WUE (uWUE) and stomatal slope (G(1))) over a typical winter wheat-summer maize rotation cropland in the North China Plain. The results showed that none of WUE indicators had a significant interannual trend. PWUE showed the lowest interannual variability and could be regarded as stationary for these two crops. G(1) was stationary for wheat which was under an essentially constant soil water condition, whereas exhibited a strong fluctuation for maize experiencing more variable soil water content (SWC) than wheat. IWUE and uWUE were non-stationary for both crops. SWC and leaf area index (LAI) dominated EWUE for maize and wheat, respectively. PWUE was dominated by the shortwave solar radiation (R-g) in maize seasons and not significantly affected by any meteorological or biophysical factors in wheat seasons. For IWUE and uWUE, air temperature (T-a) and LAI were the most important drivers in maize and wheat seasons, respectively. Atmospheric CO2 concentration (C-a) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) were not revealed as important controllers. These findings reflected that the meteorological and biophysical regulatory mechanisms of WUE indicators at the ecosystem level were quite different from that at the leaf level. But G(1) was an exception due to that for both maize and wheat, G(1) was only significantly affected by SWC. Moreover, we found that none of the remote sensing (RS)-based global products performed satisfactorily on capturing interannual variations of EWUE for both crops. These results cautioned that using these global RS-based products to explore the interannual variations of EWUE for the cropland ecosystem may lead to substantial bias.

AB  - The objective of this research is to provide a case study in the field of ambitious agricultural and rural development programmes of four neighbouring EU member states, namely Czechia, Italy, Hungary, Austria. The efficient agricultural production and compensation for employees strengthen the income conditions of the rural population in the selected countries, which can give insights into the impact of rural population support for a sustainable and competitive agricultural sector for other countries. The traditional developing trends of their agricultural sectors and food production with similar agricultural economic features make the comparison of these countries possible. This analysis focuses on the main economic indicators of agricultural income by emphasizing correlations among GDP growth, agricultural gross value added, compensation payments, wages and salaries, annual working units, food production per capita, agricultural emissions, rural population, nitrogen use, GDP in purchasing power parity per capita and arable land use based on principal component analysis with varimax rotation and principal component scores for describing the reasons of economic differences among the analysed countries represented on a two-dimensional map based on their Principal Component Scores at the economic development level by multisided overviews of regional economics, agricultural development and environmental conservation. The main conclusion is that rural population was able to increase income (compensation payments, wages and salaries) in the four Member States during the period from 2010 to 2018. Czechia with the highest average land use concentration got the best indicator of the gross factor income per annual working unit. In 2010, the gross factor income in Czechia was three times higher than that of Austria and higher than that of Italy. By the end of 2018 Czechia achieved a considerable production growth of 35.5% but the increase of its gross factor income was even more spectacular, twice as high compared to Italy and 2.5 times higher compared to Austria. Compensation for employees and salaries and wages played the most important role in keeping the rural population in its original places accompanied by sustainable development.

AB  - Nighttime light (NTL) remote sensing data have been widely used to derive socioeconomic indicators at the national and regional scales to study regional economic development. However, most previous studies only chose a single measurement indicator (such as GDP) and adopted simple regression methods to investigate the economic development of a certain area based on DMSP-OLS or NPP-VIIRS stable NTL data. The status quo shows the problems of using a single evaluation index-it has a low evaluation precision. The LJ1-01 satellite is the first dedicated NTL remote sensing satellite in the world, launched in July 2018. The data provided by LJ1-01 have a higher spatial resolution and fewer blooming phenomena. In this paper, we compared the accuracy of the LJ1-01 data and NPP-VIIRS data in detecting county-level multidimensional economic development. In three provinces in China, namely, Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi, 20 socioeconomic parameters were selected from the following five perspectives: economic conditions, people's livelihood, social development, public resources and natural vulnerability. Then, a County-level Economic Index (CEI) was constructed to evaluate the level of multidimensional economic development, with the spatial pattern of the multidimensional economic development also identified across the study area. The present study adopted the random forest (RF) and linear regression (LR) algorithms to establish the regression model individually, and the results were evaluated by cross-validation. The results show that the RF algorithm greatly improves the accuracy of the model compared with the LR algorithm, and thus is suitable for the study of NTL data. In addition, a better determinate coefficient (R-2) based on the LJ1-01 data (0.8168) was obtained than that from the NPP-VIIRS data (0.7245) in the RF model, which reflects that the LJ1-01 data offer better potential in the evaluation of socioeconomic parameters and can be used to identify, both accurately and efficiently, multidimensional economic development at the county level.

AB  - Seasonal suspended sediment transfer in glaciated catchments is responsive to meteorological, geomorphological, and glacio-fluvial conditions, and thus is a useful indicator of environmental system dynamics. Knowledge of multifaceted fluvial sediment-transfer processes is limited in the Alaskan Arctic - a region sensitive to contemporary environmental change. For two glaciated sub-catchments at Lake Peters, northeast Brooks Range, Alaska, we conducted a two-year endeavour to monitor the hydrology and meteorology, and used the data to derive multiple-regression models of suspended sediment load. Statistical selection of the best models shows that incorporating meteorological or temporal explanatory variables improves performances of turbidity- and discharge-based sediment models. The resulting modelled specific suspended sediment yields to Lake Peters are: 33 (20-60) t km(-2)yr(-1)in 2015, and 79 (50-140) t km(-2)yr(-1)in 2016 (95% confidence band estimates). In contrast to previous studies in Arctic Alaska, fluvial suspended sediment transfer to Lake Peters was primarily influenced by rainfall, and secondarily influenced by temperature-driven melt processes associated with clockwise diurnal hysteresis. Despite different sub-catchment glacier coverage, specific yields were the same order of magnitude from the two primary inflows to Lake Peters, which are Carnivore Creek (128 km(2); 10% glacier coverage) and Chamberlin Creek (8 km(2); 23% glacier coverage). Seasonal to longer-term sediment exhaustion and/or contrasting glacier dynamics may explain the lower than expected relative specific sediment yield from the more heavily glacierized Chamberlin Creek catchment. Absolute suspended sediment yield (t yr(-1)) from Carnivore Creek to Lake Peters was 27 times greater than from Chamberlin Creek, which we attribute to catchment size and sediment supply differences. Our results provide a foundational understanding of the current sediment transfer regime and are useful for predicting changes in fluvial sediment transport in glaciated Alaskan Arctic catchments.

AB  - Tropical forests are posited to hold up to one-third of the solution to slow climate change. It is estimated that over two-hundred million "forest peoples"-including indigenous peoples and local communities-live within and depend upon tropical forests. To successfully mitigate climate change, we must find new forms of collaboration that meet the goals of forest-dependent communities for secure land rights, equitable participation in decision-making, and dignified livelihoods in conjunction with meeting commitments to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2018, 34 subnational governments and 18 indigenous and local community organizations announced their endorsement of the "Guiding Principles for Collaboration between Subnational Governments, Indigenous Peoples, and Local Communities." The Guiding Principles of Collaboration (GPC) are a set of 13 universal tenets which lay out a blueprint for collaboration between subnational state actors, indigenous peoples and local communities to recognize rights, support livelihoods, strengthen participation of forest-dependent communities in decision-making, and protect indigenous and community environmental defenders within the context of joint action for climate change mitigation. Their implementation would advance the integration of climate justice in subnational efforts for forest conservation. Taking the GPC as a point of departure, we explore how jurisdictional approaches to sustainability can protect and enhance the rights and livelihoods of indigenous peoples (IP) and local communities (LC). We develop and apply a suite of indicators to assess existing conditions across 11 tropical forest jurisdictions toward meeting the commitments described in the GPC. Our findings suggest that while the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities are recognized within national legal frameworks, implementation and security of those rights is uneven across subnational jurisdictions. Participation of IP and LC is not yet formalized as part of jurisdictional climate change mitigation initiatives in most cases, limiting their potential to inform policy outcomes and benefit-sharing mechanisms. Monitoring the implementation of the GPC may foster greater accountability for commitments, as well as collective action and learning to support regional transformations to sustainability.

AB  - Urban stormwater and snowmelt pollution contributes significantly to the deterioration of surface waters quality in many locations. Consequently, the sources of such pollution have been studied for the past 50 years, with the vehicular transportation sector and the atmospheric deposition identified early as the major pollution sources. In search for mitigation of this pollution, source controls, besides other measures, were recognised as effective pollution mitigation tools, whose successful implementation requires a good knowledge of pollution sources. Even though great research efforts have been exerted to document specific sources of urban runoff pollution, or specific groups of pollutants present in urban runoff, a comprehensive overview of all known contributing sources is still missing. This review contributes to closing this gap by compiling findings of previous research and critically synthesizing the current knowledge of various stormwater pollution sources. As the emphasis is placed on the sources, the related issues of implications for urban surface water quality and possible source controls for individual sources are touched upon just briefly, where required. The review showed that the atmospheric deposition, vehicular transportation-related activities and metallic building envelopes continue to be among the major pollution sources, which have been studied in a far greater detail than other sources. Furthermore, it was noted that because of the rapid advances in clean manufacturing and pollution control technologies, a large part of the body of data on stormwater quality available in the literature should be considered as historical data, which may no longer describe well the current conditions. Progressing historical data obsolescence, combined with continuing releases of new materials and chemicals, and, in some cases of new substances of potential concern, into the environment, suggests that the identification of important stormwater runoff/snowmelt pollution sources, and the associated pollutants, has been and will remain to be a work in progress.

AB  - Water markets in developing countries are difficult to implement due to social, environmental, and technical restrictions. However, the primary concern in irrigation districts with a lack of a functioning market mechanism is the economically efficient allocation of water. In this light, the objective of this study is the development of an Economic-Operational framework that could be used for the most economically efficient allocation of water. This framework is expected to provide an infrastructure for delivering volumetric mutually-related main economic components: Positive Mathematical Programing (PMP) and the Model Predictive Control (MPC) which is added as an operational model component. The economic model (PMP) simulates the existing conditions surrounding the agricultural activities and calculates the agricultural sector's income, as well as the economic value of water, considering current cropping patterns and the economic value of water. Consequently, the operational model (MPC) distributes and delivers water to the agricultural units based on the weighted average of water's economic value. Operational performance of the entire canal system is then assessed based on the customized operational assessment indicators for developing the framework. Finally, the last part of the framework includes performance evaluation of the approach introduced in the present study with respect to sustainable development goals, using the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method. For this purpose, the effect of any changes in the calculated volume of water, through employing the framework, on the economic, social, and environmental indicators can be observed.
   This framework is expected to provide a guideline for the water authorities in ranking the inter-sectoral impacts of economic, social, and environmental effects of the operational scenarios. The developed framework provides a mechanism in which managers and planners of irrigation districts can test and assess their policies in different schemes before implementation. Also, the framework will produce the economic results of possible actions of farmers involving different managerial, climatic, and agricultural scenarios. The developed framework is then tested on the Roodasht Irrigation District, located in the semi-arid region in Iran. The simulation results are then examined.

AB  - Tree defoliation and mortality have considerably increased world-wide during the last decades due to global change drivers such as increasing drought or invasive pests and pathogens. However, the effects of this tree decline on soil food webs are poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated the impacts of Quercus suber decline on soil food webs of Mediterranean mixed forests invaded by the exotic oomycete pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi, using soil nematodes as bioindicator taxa. We used a spatially explicit neighbourhood approach to predict the characteristics of the nematode community (diversity, trophic structure, and several indices indicative of soil food web conditions) as a function of the characteristics of the tree and shrub community (species composition, size, and health status). Our results indicate that the process of defoliation and mortality of Q. suber caused significant alterations in the nematode trophic structure increasing the abundance of lower trophic levels (bacterivores, fungivores, and herbivores) and decreasing the abundance of higher levels (predators and omnivores). Furthermore, Q. suber decline altered the functional composition of soil communities, producing a setback of the ecological succession in the soil food web to an earlier stage (decrease in the maturity index and increase in the plant parasitic index), simplified soil food webs (decrease in the structure index), and shifts in the predominant decomposition channel (increase in the fungivores/bacterivores ratio). We also detected contrasting characteristics of the nematode community in neighbourhoods dominated by coexisting woody species, which suggests potential for long-term indirect effects on soil food webs due to the substitution of Q. suber by non-declining species. Synthesis. Our study provides novel results that show the major impacts that ongoing health deterioration of dominant tree species can have on the structure and composition of soil food webs in forest systems invaded by exotic pathogens, with cascading consequences for soil biogeochemical processes in both the short- and long term.

AB  - Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a spinal cord condition that results in progressive non-traumatic compression of the cervical spinal cord. Spine surgeons must consider a large quantity of information relating to disease presentation, imaging features, and patient characteristics to determine if a patient will benefit from surgery for DCM. We applied a supervised machine learning approach to develop a classification model to predict individual patient outcome after surgery for DCM. Patients undergoing surgery for DCM as a part of the AOSpine CSM-NA or CSM-I prospective, multi-centre studies were included in the analysis. Out of 757 patients 605, 583, and 539 patients had complete follow-up information at 6, 12, and 24 months respectively and were included in the analysis. The primary outcome was improvement in the SF-6D quality of life indicator score by the minimum clinically important difference (MCID). The secondary outcome was improvement in the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) score by the MCID. Predictor variables reflected information about pre-operative disease severity, disease presentation, patient demographics, and comorbidities. A machine learning approach of feature engineering, data pre-processing, and model optimization was used to create the most accurate predictive model of outcome after surgery for DCM. Following data pre-processing 48, 108, and 101 features were chosen for model training at 6, 12, and 24 months respectively. The best performing predictive model used a random forest structure and had an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.70, classification accuracy of 77%, and sensitivity of 78% when evaluated on a testing cohort that was not used for model training. Worse pre-operative disease severity, longer duration of DCM symptoms, older age, higher body weight, and current smoking status were associated with worse surgical outcomes. We developed a model that predicted positive surgical outcome for DCM with good accuracy at the individual patient level on an independent testing cohort. Our analysis demonstrates the applicability of machine-learning to predictive modeling in spine surgery.

AB  - Spatial information on soils and their abilities to fulfil their functions is key to sustainable soil resource use. Maps indicating how soils fulfil their functions, e.g., regulating nutrient and water flows, providing appropriate habitats, and supporting biomass production, have allowed soil information to be embedded in spatial planning programmes. We adapted 10 static soil function assessment (SEA) methods and applied them to agricultural soils in a study area on the Swiss Plateau. Soil function maps were created by applying the SFA methods to maps of eight basic soil properties generated previously using digital soil mapping techniques. The soil function maps were compared with results obtained by applying the SFA methods to data for >7000 soil profiles to determine how reasonable the maps were. Soil in the study area had distinctive spatial patterns for most of the regulation, habitat, and production functions, clearly indicating the multiple roles played by soil in supporting ecosystem services. The fulfilment of individual soil functions is linked to the inherent soil properties, the terrain, and climatic conditions. The soil function maps agreed well with the SFA results for the profiles in terms of land use, soil type, and drainage class. Four aggregation rules were tested to give total assessment values (soil indices). Aggregating the 10 soil functions into an overall soil functionality value gave quite diverse spatial patterns, indicating that merging might average out the spatial characteristics of certain soil functions. We conclude that a quite comprehensive set of soil functions can be assessed using spatial information for eight basic soil properties to a soil depth of at least 1 m and approved pedotransfer functions for secondary soil properties. SFA methods for the production function are well established, but methods for assessing habitat and regulation functions need to be developed further. This is also true for forest soils, for which SFA methods are yet to be established. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Nanling and adjacent regions of South China host a series of tin deposits related to Mesozoic granites with diverse petrological characteristics. The rocks are amphibole-bearing biotite granites, or (topaz-) albite-lepidolite (zinnwaldite) granites, and geochemically correspond to mealuminous and peraluminous types, respectively. Mineralogical studies demonstrate highly distinctive and critical patterns for each type of granites. In mealuminous tin granites amphibole, biotite and perthite are the typical rock-forming mineral association; titanite and magnetite are typical accessory minerals, indicating high fO(2) magmatic conditions; cassiterite, biotite and titanite are the principal Sn-bearing minerals; and pure cassiterite has low trace-element contents. However, in peraluminous tin granites zinnwaldite-lepidolite, K-feldspar and albite are typical rock-forming minerals; topaz is a common accessory phase, indicative of high peraluminity of this type of granites; cassiterite is present as a uniquely important tin mineral, typically rich in Nb and Ta. Mineralogical distinction between the two types of tin granites is largely controlled by redox state, volatile content and differentiation of magmatic melts. In oxidized metaluminous granitic melts, Sn4+ is readily concentrated in Ti-bearing rock-forming and accessory minerals. Such Sn-bearing minerals are typical of oxidized tin granites, and are enriched in granites at the late fractionation stage. In relatively reduced peraluminous granitic melts, Sn2+ is not readily incorporated into rock-forming and accessory minerals, except for cassiterite at fractionation stage of granite magma, which serves as an indicator of tin mineralization associated with this type of granites. The nature of magma and the geochemical behavior of tin in the two types of granites thus result in the formation of different types of tin deposits. Metaluminous granites host disseminated tin mineralization, and are locally related to deposits of the chlorite quartz-vein, greisen, and skarn types. Greisen, skarn, and quartz-vein tin deposits can occur related to peraluminous granites, but disseminated mineralization of cassiterite is more typical.

AB  - Modeling insecurity under future climate change and socio-economic development is indispensable for adaptive planning and sustainable management of water resources. This case study strives to assess the water quality and quantity status for both the present and the near future in the Ciliwung River basin inside the Jakarta Province under different scenarios using population growth with planned additional wastewater management infrastructure by 2030 as mentioned in the local master plan, and comparing the above conditions with the addition of the effects of climate change. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nitrate (NO3), the three important indicators of aquatic ecosystem health, were simulated to assess river pollution. Simulation results suggest that water quality in year 2030 will further deteriorate compared to the base year 2000 due to population growth and climate change, even considering the planned wastewater management infrastructure. The magnitude of impact from population growth is far greater than that from climate change. Simulated values of NO3, BOD and COD ranged from 6.07 to 13.34 mg/L, 7.65 to 11.41 mg/L, and 20.16 to 51.01 mg/L, respectively. Almost all of the water quality parameters exceeded the safe limit suitable for a healthy aquatic system, especially for the year 2030. The situation of water quality is worse for the downstream sampling location because of the cumulative effect of transport of untreated pollutants coming from upstream, as well as local dumping. This result will be useful for local policy makers and stakeholders involved in the water sector to formulate strategic and adaptive policies and plan for the future. One of the potential policy interventions is to implement a national integrated sewerage and septage management program on a priority basis, considering various factors like population density and growth, and global changes for both short- and long-term measures.

AB  - In the last decades drought has become one of the natural disasters with most relevant impacts in Europe and this not only, in water scarce areas such as the Mediterranean that are inclined to such events. As a complex natural phenomenon, drought is characterized by many hydro-meteorological aspects, a large variety of possible impacts and definitions. This study focuses on meteorological drought, investigated by using indicators that include precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET), i.e. the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). These indicators account for the lack of precipitation and the drying effects of hot temperatures and in this study have been computed for short-accumulation periods (3-month) to capture the seasonality of droughts. The input variables, monthly precipitation and temperature for 1950-2015, stem from daily gridded E-OBS data and indicators were computed on regular grids spanning over the whole of Europe. PET was calculated from minimum and maximum temperatures using the Hargreaves-Samani formulation. Monthly precipitation and PET have then been used to compute the SPI-3 and the SPEI-3 time series. From these series drought events were defined at seasonal scale and trends of frequency and severity of droughts and extreme droughts were analyzed for the periods 1950-2015 and 1981-2015. According to the SPI (driven by precipitation), results show a statistically significant tendency towards less frequent and severe drought events over North-Eastern Europe, especially in winter and spring, and a moderate opposite tendency over Southern Europe, especially in spring and summer. According to the SPEI (driven by precipitation and temperature), Northern Europe shows similar wetting patterns, while Southern and Eastern Europe show a more remarkable drying tendency, especially in summer and autumn. Both for frequency and severity, the evolution towards drier conditions is more relevant in the last three decades over Central Europe in spring, the Mediterranean area in summer, and Eastern Europe in autumn.

AB  - Mid-to-high latitude forests play an important role in the terrestrial carbon cycle, but the representation of photosynthesis in boreal forests by current modelling and observational methods is still challenging. In particular, the applicability of existing satellite-based proxies of greenness to indicate photosynthetic activity is hindered by small annual changes in green biomass of the often evergreen tree population and by the confounding effects of background materials such as snow. As an alternative, satellite measurements of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) can be used as a direct proxy of photosynthetic activity. In this study, the start and end of the photosynthetically active season of the main boreal forests are analysed using spaceborne SIF measurements retrieved from the GOME-2 instrument and compared to that of green biomass, proxied by vegetation indices including the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived from MODIS data. We find that photosynthesis and greenness show a similar seasonality in deciduous forests. In high-latitude evergreen needleleaf forests, however, the length of the photosynthetically active period indicated by SIF is up to 6weeks longer than the green biomass changing period proxied by EVI, with SIF showing a start-of-season of approximately 1month earlier than EVI. On average, the photosynthetic spring recovery as signalled by SIF occurs as soon as air temperatures exceed the freezing point (2-3 degrees C) and when the snow on the ground has not yet completely melted. These findings are supported by model data of gross primary production and a number of other studies which evaluated insitu observations of CO2 fluxes, meteorology and the physiological state of the needles. Our results demonstrate the sensitivity of space-based SIF measurements to light-use efficiency of boreal forests and their potential for an unbiased detection of photosynthetic activity even under the challenging conditions interposed by evergreen boreal ecosystems.

AB  - Cocoa-based small-scale agriculture is the most important source of income for most farming families in the region of Alto Beni in the sub-humid foothills of the Andes. Cocoa is grown in cultivation systems of varying ecological complexity. The plantations are highly susceptible to climate change impacts. Local cocoa producers mention heat waves, droughts, floods and plant diseases as the main impacts affecting plants and working conditions, and they associate these impacts with global climate change. From a sustainable regional development point of view, cocoa farms need to become more resilient in order to cope with the climate change related effects that are putting cocoa-based livelihoods at risk. This study assesses agroecosystem resilience under three different cocoa cultivation systems (successional agroforestry, simple agroforestry and common practice monocultures). In a first step, farmers' perceptions of climate change impacts were assessed and eight indicators of agroecological resilience were derived in a transdisciplinary process (focus groups and workshop) based on farmers' and scientists' knowledge. These indicators (soil organic matter, depth of Ah horizon, soil bulk density, tree species diversity, crop varieties diversity, ant species diversity, cocoa yields and infestation of cocoa trees with Moniliophthora perniciosa) were then surveyed on 15 cocoa farms and compared for the three different cultivation systems. Parts of the socio-economic aspects of resilience were covered by evaluating the role of cocoa cooperatives and organic certification in transitioning to more resilient cocoa farms (interviews with 15 cocoa farmers combined with five expert interviews). Agroecosystem resilience was higher under the two agroforestry systems than under common practice monoculture, especially under successional agroforestry. Both agroforestry systems achieved higher cocoa yields than common practice monoculture due to agroforestry farmers' enhanced knowledge regarding cocoa cultivation. Knowledge sharing was promoted by local organizations facilitating organic certification. These organizations were thus found to enhance the social process of farmers' integration into cooperatives and their reorientation toward organic principles and diversified agroforestry.

AB  - For adequate conservation planning, ecologists need to understand the driving factors of the species richness and composition patterns of arthropod assemblages. The present study scrutinizes how the vegetation, the surrounding matrix and the process of fragmentation affects the diversity and the composition of arthropod assemblages in dune slack meadow remnants of an agricultural landscape in southern Hungary. Spiders, orthopterans and true bugs were sampled with sweep netting in a total of 25 sand steppe, mesotrophic wet meadow and alkaline meadow patches. Our general findings showed that the structure and species composition of arthropod assemblages depended primarily on the vegetation type. From among the size and shape of the patches, their extent of isolation and the types of the surrounding landscapes only the latter one could be shown to have a significant effect, though this was also restricted to the group of spiders. Therefore, the structure and composition of spider assemblages may be used as indicators for the adjacent agricultural activities. Unlike its effect on species composition, the effect of vegetation type was not consistent on the species richness of the arthropod assemblages and functional groups. The influence of vegetation type was greater on the species richness of herbivores (specialist and generalist true bugs and grasshoppers) than on that of the carnivores (spiders, bush crickets and carnivorous true bugs). Based on the fact that neither patch size nor the extent of isolation, i.e. the measures of fragmentation, influenced the species richness of the majority of the arthropod groups significantly, we conclude that fragmentation was not the main threat for the studied arthropod fauna. Furthermore, the present study calls attention to the limited efficiency of Island Biogeography Theory in the case of relatively large, traditionally managed grasslands embedded in extensive agricultural landscapes, like the general landscape pattern of the Great Hungarian Plain.

AB  - Temporal and interspecific dietary variability were investigated in three canid taxa, Canis lupus, Canis mosbachensis and Canis etruscus, across a range of British and mainland European wolf assemblages from the Early Pleistocene to Recent periods. Using established cranio-dental indicators to reveal dietary specialisations towards bone eating, flesh slicing, and non-flesh food crushing, inferences were made concerning the proportions of flesh to non-flesh foods in the diet, and hence the level of camivory adopted by each taxon. Significant temporal differences were found in the diet and frequency of tooth wear of C lupus from MIS 3, 5a and 7 in Britain. Relative body size comparisons based on lower carnassial length also revealed variation in body size for the Pleistocene age groups, correlating with differences in diet. Stepwise Discriminant Function Analyses revealed large-bodied MIS 5a C lupus to be hypercarnivorous and specialised in fast flesh slicing and to some extent bone consumption, whereas relatively smaller-bodied MIS 3 and 7 C. lupus were both less carnivorous and more specialised in crushing nonmeat foods. Modern wolves from central Sweden are smaller than those of MIS 5a and hypercarnivorous, although with greater specialisation towards crushing of non-meat foods. Temporal variations in diet were related to changes in prey diversity, competition from other carnivores, openness of the environment, and ultimately climate, and reflect the cranio-dental plasticity of C lupus. In contrast, no temporal differences in diet were found in age groups of C. mosbachensis and C etruscus, which may relate to more stable overall conditions in comparison to the later Pleistocene. The cranio-dental characteristics of the smaller-bodied mesocarnivore C etruscus indicate adaptations to non-meat food crushing, whereas in the similarly small C mosbachensis, enhanced flesh slicing capabilities and reduced crushing abilities indicate that it was more carnivorous than C etruscus. C. etruscus and C mosbachensis were both more specialised than C lupus. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - N-Phenyl-N'-(2-chloroethyl)ureas (CEUs) are antimicrotubule agents interacting covalently with beta-tubulin near the colchicine-binding site (C-BS). Glutamyl 198 residue in beta-tubulin (Glu198), which is adjacent to the C-BS behind the two potent nucleophilic residues, Cys239 and Cys354, has been shown to covalently react with 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-(4-iodophenyl)urea (ICEU). By use of mass spectrometry, we have now identified residues in beta-tubulin that have become modified irreversibly by 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-[3-(5-hydroxypentyl)phenyl]urea (HPCEU), 1-[4-(3-hydroxy-4-methoxystyryl) phenyl]-3-(2-chloroethyl)urea (4ZCombCEU), and N,N'-ethylenebis(iodoacetamide) (EBI). The binding of HPCEU and 4ZCombCEU to beta-tubulin resulted in the acylation of Glu198, a protein modification of uncommon occurrence in living cells. Prototypical CEUs then were used as molecular probes to assess, in mouse B16F0 and human MDA-MB-231 cells, the role of Glu198 in microtubule stability. For that purpose, we studied the effect of Glu198 modification by ICEU, HPCEU, and 4ZCombCEU on the acetylation of Lys40 on alpha-tubulin, a key indicator of microtubule stability. We show that modification of Glu198 by prototypical CEUs correlates with a decrease in Lys40 acetylation, as observed also with other microtubule depolymerizing agents. Therefore, CEU affects the stability and the dynamics of microtubule, likewise a E198G mutation, which is unusual for xenobiotics. We demonstrate for the first time that EBI forms an intramolecular cross-link between Cys239 and Cys354 of beta-tubulin in living cells. This work establishes a novel basis for the development of future chemotherapeutic agents and provides a framework for the design of molecules useful for studying the role of Asp and Glu residues in the structure/function and the biological activity of several cellular proteins under physiological conditions.

AB  - This study investigates whether tree decline in Eucalyptus gomphocephala (tuart) is associated with the functional diversity of soil bacterial communities. We selected 12 sites with different stages of decline and assessed crown health [Crown density (CD), Foliage transparency (FT), Uncompacted live crown ratio (ULCR), Crown dieback ratio (CDR) and Epicormic index (EI)] and soil bacterial functional diversity based on Biolog EcoPlates (TM) incubation [Average well colour development (AWCD), Shannon diversity (H'), richness (S) and Shannon evenness (EI)]. Crown health indices differed between sites with El being the most robust indicator of decline in crown health followed by CDR and CD (P < 0.05). Soil bacterial indices collected at 0-10 and 20-30 cm soil depth between December (summer, dry season) and May (autumn, start of wet season) differed between sites (P < 0.05), and significant relationships between crown health indices, except ULCR, and all soil bacterial indices were observed. Principle component analysis (PCA) showed that a decrease in the utilization of carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, amino acids and amines by the soil bacterial communities correlated to sites with poor crown health, indicating some changes in physiological responses of bacterial groups with declining tree health. Using stepwise regression analyses, in the 0-10 cm soil layer in December, itaconic acid had a 46% contribution to the El. Carboxylic acids, including itaconic acid, have a strong ability to solubilize soil minerals in calcareous soil, and these possibly increased the availability of soil mineral nutrients in the healthier sites compared to the declining sites, particularly in the dry season. In addition, lack of soil water in the declining sites limited soil bacterial diversity and was positively correlated with El in the 0-10 cm soil layer in December. In conclusion, soil bacterial functional diversity has a strong relationship with tuart decline and the importance of soil microbes in tuart ecosystem health must be considered in the future.

AB  - On the Loess Plateau, China, several planted tree species such as Populus hopeinsis and Robinia pseudoacacia suffer occasional diebacks in the top shoots, reducing growth rates after maturation. However, this does not usually occur in other species, e.g., Ulmus pumila and Zizyphus jujuba. We compared stable carbon isotope ratios (delta C-13) as indicators of leaf water-use efficiency (WUE), leaf mass per unit area (LMA), and leaf area- and mass-based nitrogen content (N-area and N-mass) by tree height (1, 5, and 10 m) in P. hopeinsis, R. pseudoacacia, U. pumila, and Z jujuba. In P. hopeinsis and R. pseudoacacia, leaf delta C-13 and N-area were significantly lower in 10-m trees than in 1-m saplings, indicating that leaf WUE and photosynthetic rates of both species decreased with tree height. In contrast, delta C-13 in Z. jujuba varied little with tree height. The delta C-13 of 10-m-tall U. pumila trees was significantly higher than that of 1-m plants, demonstrating an increase in WUE with tree height. Decreasing WUE, leaf N-area and N-mass with height increases in P. hopeinsis and R. pseudoacacia may be related to water and nutrient limitations for these species in semiarid regions. in contrast, stable or increasing delta C-13 with tree height in U. pumila and Z jujuba may account (to some extent) for successful production of these species under identical environmental conditions. Diameter growth rate also decreased with maturity in P. hopeinsis and R. pseudoacacia, but increased or was stable for U. pumila and Z. jujuba. The differences in leaf WUE and LMA among species with tree maturity may be related to species' growth patterns and susceptibility to drought stress, and are likely to be important new criteria for plantation species selection on the Loess Plateau.

AB  - The present research study proposes a new set of appropriately defined indices for the characterization of persistence of chemicals in a multimedia environment that prominently figures as a key exposure-based indicator within contemporary frameworks of chemical hazard and risk assessment, as well as recent international regulatory initiatives. Effectively overcoming some of the limitations associated with traditional approaches that could lead to a potential misclassification of chemical substances, the proposed set of persistence indices retain also a conceptually insightful and computational appeal. Conceptually inspired by certain measures/indices for the characteristic time found in classic dynamic systems theory, and technically relying on notions and methods from the theory of matrices, the new performance indices can be easily calculated on the basis of a dynamic multimedia environmental model and the aid of a software package such as MATLAB. In particular an extension of the notion of equivalence width as a quantitative proxy of overall persistence is introduced, that captures the dynamic history of the chemical's environmental behavior, while remaining independent of the particular release pattern and discharge conditions (thus overcoming the standardization difficulties encountered when a large number of chemicals need to be first screened and classified in a tiered hazard assessment methodology). Furthermore, a second persistence index is introduced whose value can be analytically calculated through the solution of a simple Lyapunov matrix equation bearing some resemblance to certain measures of system resilience used in theoretical biology and ecology, yet inspired by system-theoretic notions associated with the Lyapunov framework of analysis in systems science. Furthermore, for both persistence measures a comparison is made with the slowest time-constant associated with the specific chemical dynamics in a multimedia environment, and upper and lower bounds are established. Finally, the proposed persistence indices are calculated on the basis of a standard dynamic multimedia environmental model for various representative cases involving chemicals of particular interest.

AB  - This article describes a conductometric bi-layer based bienzyme biosensor for the detection of proteins as a marker of organic matter in rivers. Proteins were chosen to be used as indicators of urban pollution. The working mechanism of the bienzyme biosensor is based on the enzymatic hydrolysis of proteins into several fractions (peptides and amino acids), which results in a local conductivity change depending of the concentration of proteins. In this work, we began with the optimization of biosensor response using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard protein. For this objective seven enzymatic biosensors were prepared: four enzymatic sensors with only one layer of enzyme (proteinase K, trypsin, pronase or protease X) and three other enzymatic sensors with two layers (first layer: membrane containing proteinase K; second layer: one of the three other enzymes: trypsin, pronase or protease X). The biosensors were obtained through the deposition of enzymatic layers and the cross-linking process between enzymes and BSA in saturated glutaraldehyde vapour. The response of the various biosensors, described previously, were compared with the values of total organic carbon (TOC), and those of organic nitrogen (N-org), as determined by the laboratory accredits (CEMAGREF of Lyon) using the traditional method of analysis (NF EN 1484, infrared spectroscopy) and (NF EN 25663, mineralization/colorimetry assay) respectively for each water sample obtained from different sites in Lyon (France). The linear correlations obtained with the response of the seven biosensors showed the most important indices of correlations for the biosensor with two enzymatic layers: proteinase K + pronase (pkp). The optimum conditions for the preparation of the pkp biosensor increased the sensitivity and gave a limit of quantification of 0.583 mu g/L for TOC and 0.218 mu g/L for N-org in water samples. This sensor shows good reproducibility (2.28%), a capacity to be used at temperatures range 10-30 degrees C (depending on the season) and moreover a long lifetime (5 weeks).

AB  - Erosion is a major soil degradation problem in South Africa, confronting both land and water resource management throughout the country. Given the increasing threat of soil erosion, a need to improve technics of estimating the soil-erosion risk at a national scale was identified by the National Department of Agriculture and florins the basic premise or this study. Principles and components of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation are applied here since the model combines sufficient simplicity for application oil a national scale with a comprehensive incorporation of the main soil-erosion factors. Indicators of erosion susceptibility of the physical environment, including climate erosivity, soil erodibility and topography were improved over earlier assessments by feeding current available data into advanced algorithms. Two maps are presented: all actual erosion-risk distribution, and a potential erosion-risk map that excludes the vegetation cover factor. Actual soil-erosion risk, which relates to the Current risk of erosion under contemporary vegetation and land-use conditions, was accounted for by regression equations between vegetation cover and MODIS-derived spectral index. The area of land with a moderate to severe potential risk is found to total approximately 61 in. ha (50%). Although more than 91 m (75%) are classified as having only a very low, to low actual risk, approximately 26 in. ha (20%) of land is eroded at a rate greater than a soil-loss tolerance of 10 t/ha.yr. showing the potential to target erosion control to problem areas. The Eastern Cape, Limpopo and KwaZulu-Natal Provinces have the highest erosion potential. Comparison of potential and actual erosion risk indicates that over 26 m. ha (>30% of national land) could be subject to high erosion risk without Maintenance or careful management of the Current vegetation cover and land use. Although the distribution of the actual erosion risk broadly follows that outlined previously, this study provides an advance oil previous assessments of erosion, results are validated more comprehensively than before. and show an overall accuracy of 77%. The paper also describes many of the limitations inherent in regional erosion studies.

AB  - The microbial water quality at two beaches, Hobie Beach and Crandon Beach, in Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA was measured using multiple microbial indicators for the purpose of evaluating correlations between microbes and for identifying possible sources of contamination. The indicator microbes chosen for this study (enterococci, Escherichia coli, fecal coliform, total coliform and C. perfringens) were evaluated through three different sampling efforts. These efforts included daily measurements at four locations during a wet season month and a dry season month, spatially intensive water sampling during low- and high-tide periods, and a sand sampling effort. Results indicated that concentrations did not vary in a consistent fashion between one indicator microbe and another. Daily water quality frequently exceeded guideline levels at Hobie Beach for all indicator microbes except for fecal coliform, which never exceeded the guideline. Except for total coliform, the concentrations of microbes did not change significantly between seasons in spite of the fact that the physical-chemical parameters (rainfall, temperature, pH, and salinity) changed significantly between the two monitoring periods. Spatially intense water sampling showed that the concentrations of microbes were significantly different with distance from the shoreline. The highest concentrations were observed at shoreline points and decreased at offshore points. Furthermore, the highest concentrations of indicator microbe concentrations were observed at high tide, when the wash zone area of the beach was submerged. Beach sands within the wash zone tested positive for all indicator microbes, thereby suggesting that this zone may serve as the source of indicator microbes. Ultimate sources of indicator microbes to this zone may include humans, animals, and possibly the survival and regrowth of indicator microbes due to the unique environmental conditions found within this zone. Overall, the results of this study indicated that the concentrations of indicator microbes do not necessarily correlate with one another. Exceedence of water quality guidelines, and thus the frequency of beach advisories, depends upon which indicator microbe is chosen. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The ecosystem response of Lake Redo (Central Pyrenees) to fluctuations in seasonal air temperature during the last two centuries was investigated by comparison of reconstructed air temperatures with the sediment record. Fine slicing allowed a resolution of 3-6 years according to the Pb-210 dating, although it was still difficult to easily investigate the response to air temperature forcing, since extreme fluctuations in temperature occur on interannual time-scales. However, the resolution was sufficient to show responses on decadal and century scales. An overall tendency to warming in mean annual temperature in the Central Pyrenees has been caused by summer and in particular by autumn increases. Many of the measured sediment variables apparently responded to these long term trends, but the significance of the relationships was highly conditioned by the structure of the data. The variables responding most on the finer time scales were the microfossils. For diatoms, chironomids and chrysophytes the main variability correlated to summer and to autumn temperatures. For two planktonic species, Fragilaria nanana and Cyclotella pseudostelligera, we found a link of their variability with temperature fluctuations in their growing months ( September and October, respectively). This relationship appeared at a certain point during a general warming trend, indicating a threshold in the response. On the other hand, no significant changes in the dominant species could be linked to temperature, nor in any significant subgroup of the 180 diatom species present in the core. In contrast, for most chironomids ( particularly Paratanytarsus austriacus, Heterotrissocladius marcidus and Micropsectra radialis) a negative relationship with summer temperature extended throughout the studied period. This response of the whole group gives chironomids a more robust role as indicators for recording temperature changes on long time-scales( e. g., through the Holocene) and for lake signal inter-comparison. Finally, our results indicated that, in all cases, there was a significant resilience to high frequency changes and hysteresis despite extreme fluctuations. Although we were dealing with organisms with one or many generations per year, their populations seemed to follow the decadal trends in air temperature.

AB  - As a result of increasing anthropogenic nitrogen deposition, N availability in many forest ecosystems, which are normally N-limited, has been enhanced. We discuss the impacts of this increased N availability on the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis which is generally regarded as an adaptation to nutrient limited conditions. Nitrogen deposition can influence fruit-body formation by ECM fungi, the production and distribution of the extraradical mycelium in the soil and the formation of ectomycorrhizas.
   Available data from long-term N deposition studies indicate that the most prominent effects might be discernible above-ground (i.e. on the formation of fruit bodies). 'Generalist' species, forming a symbiosis with a wide range of tree species, seem to be less affected by increased N availability than 'specialist' species, especially those living in symbiosis with conifers. However, the importance of below-ground investigations to determine the impacts of N deposition on the ECM symbiosis must not be underestimated. Culture experiments show an optimum N concentration for the formation of extraradical mycelium and mycorrhizas. Often, negative effects only become visible at comparatively high N concentrations, but the use of a few easily cultivated species of ECM fungi, which are adapted to higher N concentrations, undermines our ability to generalize.
   So far, N deposition experiments in the field have only shown minor changes in the below-ground mycorrhizal population, as estimated from the investigation of mycorrhizal root tips. However, effects on the ECM mycelium, which is the main fungal component in terms of nutrient uptake, cannot be excluded and need further consideration.
   Because the photoassimilate supply from the plant to the fungal partner is crucial for the maintenance of the ECM symbiosis, we discuss the possible physiological implications of increasing N inputs on the allocation of C to the fungus. Together with ultrastructural changes, physiological effects might precede obvious visible changes and might therefore be useful early indicators of negative impacts of increasing N inputs on the ECM symbiosis.

AB  - The relationships between leaf and kernel carbon isotope discriminations (Delta) and several leaf structural parameters that are indicators of photosynthetic capacity were studied in durum wheat grown in the field under three water regimens, A set of 144 genotypes were cultivated in two rain-fed trials, and 125 of these were grown under supplementary irrigation before heading. Total chlorophyll and nitrogen (N) contents, the dry mass per unit leaf area (LDM, the reciprocal of specific leaf area) and carbon isotope discrimination (Delta) were measured in penultimate leaves and Delta of mature kernels was also analysed, Both LDM and N per unit area showed significant (P less than or equal to 0.001) negative correlation (r = -0.60 and r = -0.36, respectively) with leaf Delta in the wettest trial, Little or no correlation was found for any structural parameter and leaf Delta in the rain-fed trials, In contrast, in the two rain-fed trials LDM was the parameter with the strongest positive correlation (P less than or equal to 0.001) with kernel Delta (r = 0.47 and 0.30) and grain yield (r = 0.43 and 0.29), whereas no correlation was found in the irrigation trial, These correlations, rather than representing a causal link between the amount of photosynthetic tissue and Delta, were probably indirect associations caused by a parallel effect or water status and phenology on leaf structure, grain Delta and yield, Correlations across trials (i.e. environments) between leaf structure and either Delta and yield were very high, although also spurious, Our results suggest that LDM should be used to cull segregating population differences in leaf ii based on the internal photosynthetic capacity only ire the absence of drought, Selecting for kernel Delta and grain yield on the basis of LDM is worthwhile for rain-fed trials.

AB  - The aim of the research was to determine the efficiency and reliability of the removal of pollutants from wastewater by the mechanical-biological treatment plant A2/O. The system disposed of on average 4,000-5,000 m3/d of wastewater, of which about 320 m3/d was industrial wastewater. The evaluation was based on data from 5 y (2015-2019) of the work of this facility. The following pollution indicators were analyzed: biochemical demand for oxygen (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP). The efficiency of wastewater treatment during the period under study was good. The pollutant reduction coefficients averaged over the years 2015-2019 were: for TSS - 95%, for BOD5 - 98%, COD - 93% for TN - 82%, and TP - 88%. The results of the Weibull-based reliability analysis in the case of TSS and COD indicated that the treatment plant analyzed during the whole test period worked with high efficiency. The study showed that in the case of BOD5 there were 25 d in the year in which the limit may be exceeded. Studies have shown that 44% of collected samples of treated wastewater exceeded total nitrogen concentrations of 15 mg/L. Thus, effluent discharged to the receiver from the treatment plant analyzed, on approximately 160 d during a year total nitrogen concentrations are above limit values. On this basis, it can be concluded that the treatment plant under examination does not comply with the requirements of the Regulation for almost half of the year. The cause of this condition is the instability of nitrification and denitrification processes which are responsible for the removal of nitrogen compounds in a biological reactor. In the case of the treatment plant under consideration, the reliability of the removal of general phosphorus on 55 d/y is reduced, thus the values obtained during these days are at a level that does not meet the reliability requirements.

AB  - Groundwater is a ubiquitous natural resource and one of the most reliable sources of freshwater worldwide. The rapid population growth, water demand in various sectors as well as maximizing agricultural production have led to over-exploitation of groundwater in different parts of the world, including India. Therefore, the information on crop water demands and availability of reliable groundwater resources is necessary for establishing strategies for optimal irrigation water supply. This study aims to map 'potential groundwater resources' (PGWR), 'fraction of vegetation' (FV) as an alternative crop coefficient using remote sensing data and 'crop water demands' and to develop a new indicator named 'Agricultural Groundwater Resources Indicator' (AGRI) for 'Normal', 'Dry' and 'Wet' years in the Damodar Canal Command (DCC). The mean, median, SD and CV of the groundwater fluctuation are evaluated at 4.56 m, 4.6 m, 0.85 m and 0.19 m/m, respectively. The maximum and minimum potential groundwater resources were computed at 1247 mm and 245 mm, respectively. The maximum annual crop evapotranspiration (ETc) for the 'Normal', 'Dry' and 'Wet' years of the study command was computed at 1166 mm year(-1), 1290 mm year(-1) and 999 mm year(-1), respectively. During the 'Normal' year, crop water demands in about 60% of the study area could be fulfilled from the PGWR supply. In this study, an indicator named AGRI was used for the first time in identifying possible spatial irrigation adequacy from the potential groundwater resources. The map of AGRI could be the reference map for managing the uniform distribution of irrigation water supply in the DCC. The developed AGRI map will provide valuable information to the water planners, water managers, decision-makers, engineers, agriculturists and farmers in particular for sustainable water management. Being adaptive in nature, the proposed model can be applied worldwide irrespective of diverse agro-climatic conditions.

AB  - Reservoir sediments harbor abundant bacterial communities that are sensitive to substances transferred from the water column and might record historic water quality in environmental DNA (eDNA). The unique bacterial community along the sediment profile were retrieved based on eDNA in a reservoir to investigate potential links between water quality and the microbial population on a long-time scale. Bacterial communities in sediment samples gathered into three clusters along the depth (depths of 18-38, 8-18, and 1-7 cm). These three sections accumulated during three periods in which water quality was recorded in history (the pristine stage, degraded stage and remediated stage). Sediment samples from the degraded stage had lower microbial community evenness and diversity and higher microgAMBI indices than the other two sections, suggesting that poor water quality during that period was recorded in sedimental eDNA. After decades of biogeochemical cycles, statistical analysis revealed that the main factors affecting the microbial community were bromine, chlorine, and high molecular-weight PAHs in sediments from the degraded stage. The relevant functional groups Dehalococcoidia, Gemmatimonadales, Sva0485, Burkholderiales and Xanthomonadales might be indicators of the historical loading of these pollutants. Amending the microgAMBI index with our functional group of pollution can better illustrate the significant long-term environmental changes caused by historic anthropogenic activities. In sediments from the pristine stage with less pollution input, DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon) from the karst landform was the dominant factor controlling microbial communities. Whereas, the surface sediments, which accumulated during the remediated stage, had more correlation with chemistry, such as sulfate and heavy metals, in the overlying water. Our research revealed that historical changes in the water condition, that can be affected by anthropogenic activities, can be depicted by changes in the bacterial communities stored in the sediment using sedimental eDNA. Assessments of the bacterial communities in the sediments, either by describing their biodiversity or using particular species as indicators, would be potential proxies to describe historical environmental development of microbial communities.

AB  - The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) hydrological model has been used extensively by the scientific community to simulate varying hydro-climatic conditions and geo-physical environment. This study used SWAT to characterize the rainfall-runoff behaviour of a complex mountainous basin, the Budhigandaki River Basin (BRB), in central Nepal. The specific objectives of this research were to: (i) assess the applicability of SWAT model in data scarce and complex mountainous river basin using well-established performance indicators; and (ii) generate spatially distributed flows and evaluate the water balance at the sub-basin level. The BRB was discretised into 16 sub-basins and 344 hydrological response units (HRUs) and calibration and validation was carried out at Arughat using daily flow data of 20 years and 10 years, respectively. Moreover, this study carried out additional validation at three supplementary points at which the study team collected primary river flow data. Four statistical indicators: Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), percent bias (PBIAS), ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data (RSR) and Kling Gupta efficiency (KGE) have been used for the model evaluation. Calibration and validation results rank the model performance as "very good". This study estimated the mean annual flow at BRB outlet to be 240 m(3)/s and annual precipitation 1528 mm with distinct seasonal variability. Snowmelt contributes 20% of the total flow at the basin outlet during the pre-monsoon and 8% in the post monsoon period. The 90%, 40% and 10% exceedance flows were calculated to be 39, 126 and 453 m(3)/s respectively. This study provides additional evidence to the SWAT diaspora of its applicability to simulate the rainfall-runoff characteristics of such a complex mountainous catchment. The findings will be useful for hydrologists and planners in general to utilize the available water rationally in the times to come and particularly, to harness the hydroelectric potential of the basin.

AB  - Aim Correlative species distribution models (SDMs) are among the most frequently used tools for conservation planning under climate and land use changes. Conservation-focused climate change studies are often conducted on a national or local level and can use different sources of occurrence records (e.g., local databases, national biodiversity monitoring) collated at different geographic extents. However, little is known about how these restrictions in geographic space (i.e., Wallacean shortfall) can lead to restrictions in environmental space (i.e., Hutchinsonian shortfall) and accordingly affect conclusions about a species' vulnerability to climate change.
   Location Americas with a focus on Mexico.
   Methods We present an example study constructing SDMs for three Mexican tree species (Alnus acuminata, Liquidambar styraciflua and Quercus xalapensis) using datasets collated at a global (Americas), national (Mexico) and local (cloud forests of eastern Mexico) level to demonstrate the potential effects of a Wallacean shortfall on the estimation of the environmental niche-and thus on a Hutchinsonian shortfall-its projection in space and time and, consequently, on species' potential vulnerability to climate change.
   Results The consequence of using the three datasets was species-specific and strongly depended on the extent to which the Wallacean shortfall affected estimations of environmental niches (i.e., Hutchinsonian shortfall). Where restrictions in geographic space lead to an underestimation of the environmental niche, vulnerability to climate change was estimated to be substantially higher. Additionally, the restrictions in geographic space may increase the likelihood of issues with non-analogue climates, increasing model uncertainty.
   Main conclusion We recommend assessing the extent to which a species' entire realized environmental niche is captured within the target conservation area, and increasing the geographic extent, if needed, to account for environments and occurrences reflecting potential future conditions. This way, the risk of underestimating the climatic potential of the species (i.e., Hutchinsonian shortfall), as well as the errors induced by extrapolation into "locally novel" climates, can be minimized.

AB  - Soil solid-solution distribution coefficients (K-d) are used in predictive environmental models to assess public health risks. This study was undertaken to determine K-d for potentially toxic elements (PTE) Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn in topsoil samples (0-20 cm) from 30 soils in the State of Sao Paulo, southeastern Brazil. Batch sorption experiments were carried out, and PTE concentrations in the equilibrium solution were determined by High Resolution Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (HR-ICPMS). Sorption data was fitted to the Freundlich model. The K-d values were either obtained directly from the slope coefficients of C-type isotherms or derived from the slope of the straight line tangent to the non-linear L-type and H-type isotherms. Stepwise multiple regression models were used to estimate the K-d values through the combined effect of a number of soil attributes [pH(H2O), effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) and contents of clay, organic carbon, and Fe (oxy) hydroxides]. The smallest variation in K-d values was recorded for Cu (105-4598 L kg(-1)), Pb (121-7020 L kg(-1)), Ni (6-998 L kg-1), as variation across four orders of magnitude was observed for Cd (7-14,339 L kg(-1)), Co (2-34,473 L kg(-1)), and Cr (1-21,267 L kg(-1)). The K-d values for Zn were between 5 and 123,849 L kg(-1). According to median values of Kd, PTE were sorbed in the following preferential order: Pb > Cu > Cd > Ni > Zn > Cr > Co. The K-d values were best predicted using metal-specific and highly significant (p < 0.001) linear regressions that included pH(H2O), ECEC, and clay contents. The K-d values reported in this study are a novel result that can help minimize erroneous estimates and improve both environmental and public health risk assessments under humid tropical edaphoclimatic conditions.

AB  - Multi-access edge computing (MEC) is a new leading technology for meeting the demands of key performance indicators (KPIs) in 5G networks. However, in a rapidly changing dynamic environment, it is hard to find the optimal target server for processing offloaded tasks because we do not know the end users' demands in advance. Therefore, quality of service (QoS) deteriorates because of increasing task failures and long execution latency from congestion. To reduce latency and avoid task failures from resource-constrained edge servers, vertical offloading between mobile devices with local-edge collaboration or with local edge-remote cloud collaboration have been proposed in previous studies. However, they ignored the nearby edge server in the same tier that has excess computing resources. Therefore, this paper introduces a fuzzy decision-based cloud-MEC collaborative task offloading management system called FTOM, which takes advantage of powerful remote cloud-computing capabilities and utilizes neighboring edge servers. The main objective of the FTOM scheme is to select the optimal target node for task offloading based on server capacity, latency sensitivity, and the network's condition. Our proposed scheme can make dynamic decisions where local or nearby MEC servers are preferred for offloading delay-sensitive tasks, and delay-tolerant high resource-demand tasks are offloaded to a remote cloud server. Simulation results affirm that our proposed FTOM scheme significantly improves the rate of successfully executing offloaded tasks by approximately 68.5%, and reduces task completion time by 66.6%, when compared with a local edge offloading (LEO) scheme. The improved and reduced rates are 32.4% and 61.5%, respectively, when compared with a two-tier edge orchestration-based offloading (TTEO) scheme. They are 8.9% and 47.9%, respectively, when compared with a fuzzy orchestration-based load balancing (FOLB) scheme, approximately 3.2% and 49.8%, respectively, when compared with a fuzzy workload orchestration-based task offloading (WOTO) scheme, and approximately 38.6%% and 55%, respectively, when compared with a fuzzy edge-orchestration based collaborative task offloading (FCTO) scheme.

AB  - Micropollutants have been linked to freshwater and human toxicity. Their occurrence in water bodies arises from different causes, including the discharge of effluents from conventional urban wastewater treatment plants, which are not designed for their removal. The addition of an advanced treatment process for this purpose will allow a toxicity reduction; however, such will also imply further resources and energy use resulting in other environmental impacts. Energy use is a particularly relevant hotspot of the environmental impacts associated with advanced treatments; therefore, solar-based treatments have great potential in this field. The present study assessed the environmental impacts via life cycle assessment (LCA) of five solar-based treatments - solar photolysis (with and without H2O2), photocatalysis using TiO2 (with and without H2O2) and circumneutral photo-Fenton - using a pilot-scale compound parabolic collector photoreactor to select the most suitable option for the removal of micropollutants (carbamazepine, diclofenac and sulfamethoxazole; 5 mu g/L) from a secondary-treated wastewater. The ranking of solar treatments per highest generated impacts is, overall, as follows: circumneutral photo-Fenton > TiO2-P25/H2O2 > TiO2-P25 > solar/H2O2 > solar. While solar photolysis uses fewer resources and energy, thus generating lower environmental impacts, the common incomplete mineralization of the parent micropollutants implies that toxicity reduction cannot be guaranteed in this case. Aiming for a balance between ecotoxicity reduction and the impacts caused by the application of each technology, the solar TiO2-P25 treatment, which was here investigated by LCA for the first time to remove organic micropollutants from secondary-treated urban wastewater, appears to be the most suitable option at the studied conditions (and when TiO2 is reused at least 5 times). One of the environmental downfalls of the assessed treatments is the energy required to produce the chemicals, and so the importance of minimizing external energy use during the application of advanced treatment processes is reinforced.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of the paper is to identify the links of the current level of competitiveness of selected companies based on an analysis of key factors of the Balanced Scorecard.
   Methodology/Approach: In this case, we take a closer look at strategies. as paths to expected goals. However, it is possible that emerging (unexpected) situations may occur during the planned strategy, which will turn the strategy into an emerging strategy. Strategies affect business management, which is a system for creating the Balance Scorecard method. It is with this method that individual perspectives can be observed that evaluate an enterprise such as a customer perspective, a process perspective, a financial perspective and a learning perspective. In addition, we used a multivariate analysis in the research to describe the variability of model relationships containing financial and non-financial indicators with an emphasis on their importance in the process of managing the competitiveness of the companies surveyed.
   Findings: Since in 2019 Coca Cola's shares are falling and Pepsi's shares are growing, we focused on the competition between the two world companies. Based on the analysis performed, the most important factories are those included in the financial perspective and which uses the analysis of ratios, which helps the company to respond in time to its solvency or insolvency, and thus ensure a suitable market position against competitors.
   Research Limitation/Implication: The case study solutions represent concrete results for selected research subjects. The analysis performed in the paper can be expanded to include further perspectives with the conditioning factors of the companies surveyed to better understand the relationships between competing companies, which are affected by many new external and internal market determinants in the current turbulent environment.
   Originality/Value of paper: The originality of the contribution is to determine the significance of the factors affecting the competitiveness of the world companies surveyed and to explain the current problem concerning stock volatility in connection with the environmental problem as the main environmental polluter in the world.

AB  - Across the Mojave Desert of southeastern California, outcrops of the Cambrian middle member of the Wood Canyon Formation preserve the deposits of pre-vegetation braided-fluvial and braid-delta environments. One 78-meter-thick section in the southern Marble Mountains, documented here through detailed stratigraphic logging, facies analysis, architectural panels based on "Structure-from-Motion" models, and a suite of paleocurrent and accretion-surface measurements, provides insight into the development of a river-dominated, wave- and tide-influenced braid delta at the distal end of a continent-scale braidplain. In contrast to other pre-Devonian braid-delta strata, in which mudrock is largely absent, the greater part of the middle member system contains over 5% mudstone. Four fades associations, FA4-7, constitute the middle member section and represent (in order of stratigraphic height) a braidplain-to-delta transition (FA4), proximal braid delta (FAS), distal braid delta (FAO, and upper braid-delta front (FA7). The 20 meters of braidplain-to-delta transition strata are largely similar to those of fluvial middle member sections, containing approximately 2% mudstone, unimodal north-northwest paleoflow, and vertical, downstream, and downstream-lateral accretion elements representing compound barforms and channel fills. Above, each braid-delta facies association (FA5-7) preserves high-sinuosity paleocurrent indicators, 6-12% mudstone, and symmetrical, wave-formed sand waves. Decimeter-thick fluid-mud deposits found chiefly in FA6 and less commonly in FA7 indicate the presence of a turbidity-maximum zone that records brackish-water conditions in the distal braid delta. Trace fossils concentrated in FA7 suggest that metazoans were confined to the upper braid-delta front and could not tolerate the variable salinity of the braid delta. increased marine influence with stratigraphic height requires gradual transgression during deposition of the middle member of the Wood Canyon Formation, possibly as part of a lowstand systems tract.

AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is recognized as a good indicator of water quality as its concentration is influenced by land use, rainwater, windborne material and anthropogenic activities. Recent technological advances make it possible to characterize fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM), the fraction of DOM that fluoresces. Among these advances, portable fluorometers and benchtop fluorescence excitation and emission spectroscopy coupled with a parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) have shown to be reliable. Despite their rising popularity, there is still a need to evaluate the extent to which these techniques can assess DOM dynamics at the watershed scale. We compare the performance of in-situ measurements of FDOM with laboratory measurements of fluorescence spectroscopy within the context of two distinct glacierized watersheds in Peru. Glacierized watersheds represent unique testing environments with contrasting DOM conditions, flowing from pristine, vegetation-free headwaters through locations with obvious anthropogenic influences. We used an in-situ fluorometer and a portable multimeter to take 38 measurements of FDOM, pH and turbidity throughout the two catchments. Additionally, samples were analyzed in the laboratory using the EEM-PARAFAC method. Results were compared to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) measurements using standard high-temperature catalytic oxidation. Our results show that the three techniques together were able to capture the DOM dynamics for both studied watersheds. Taken individually, all three methods allowed detection of the watershed DOM main points of sources but in a more limited way. Due to the narrow bandwidth of the portable fluorometer used in the study, FDOM measurements were almost non-detectable to protein-like substances. Indeed, the more demanding EEM-PARAFAC was able to both differentiate between potential sources of DOM and provide an estimate of relative concentrations of different organic components. Finally, similar to FDOM but to a lesser extent, the DOC measurements showed some limits where protein-like substances make up most of the DOM composition. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Grazing effects on soil properties under different soil and environmental conditions across the globe are often controversial. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the overall magnitude and direction of the grazing effects on soils. This global meta-analysis was conducted using the mixed model method to address the overall effects of grazing intensities (heavy, moderate, and light) on 15 soil properties based on 287 papers published globally from 2007 to 2019. Our findings showed that heavy grazing significantly increased the soil BD (11.3% relative un-grazing) and PR (52.5%) and reduced SOC (-10.8%), WC (-10.8%), NO3-(-23.5%), and MBC (-27.9%) at 0-10 cm depth, and reduced SOC (-22.5%) and TN (-19.9%) at 10-30 cm depth. Moderate grazing significantly increased the BD (7.5%), PR (46.0%), and P (18.9%) (0-10 cm), and increased pH (4.1%) and decreased SOC (-16.4%), TN (-10.6%), and P (-23.9%) (10-30 cm). Light grazing significantly increased the SOC (10.8%) and NH4+(28.7%) (0-10 cm). Heavy grazing showed much higher mean probability (0.70) leading to overgrazing than the moderate (0.14) and light (0.10) grazing. These findings indicate that, globally, compared to un-grazing, heavy grazing significantly increased soil compaction and reduced SOC, NO3-, and soil moisture. Moderate grazing significantly increased soil compaction and alkalinity and reduced SOC and TN. Light grazing significantly increased SOC and NH4+. Cattle grazing impacts on soil compaction, SOC, TN, and available K were higher than sheep grazing, but lower for PR. Climate significantly impacted grazing effects on SOM, TN, available P, NH4+, EC, CEC, and PR. Heavy grazing can be more detrimental to soil quality based on BD, SOC, TN, C: N, WC, and K than moderate and light grazing. However, global grazing intensities did not significantly impact most of the 15 soil properties, and the grazing effects on them had insignificant changes over the years.

AB  - GDSL-type esterase/lipase proteins (GELPs) belong to the SGNH hydrolase superfamily and contain a conserved GDSL motif at their N-terminus. GELPs are widely distributed in nature, from microbes to plants, and play crucial roles in growth and development, stress responses and pathogen defense. However, the identification and functional analysis ofGELPgenes are hardly explored in soybean. This study describes the identification of 194GELPgenes in the soybean genome and their phylogenetic classification into 11 subfamilies (A-K).GmGELPgenes are disproportionally distributed on 20 soybean chromosomes. Large-scale WGD/segmental duplication events contribute greatly to the expansion of the soybeanGDSLgene family. The Ka/Ks ratios of more than 70% of duplicated gene pairs ranged from 0.1-0.3, indicating that mostGmGELPgenes were under purifying selection pressure. Gene structure analysis indicate that more than 74% ofGmGELPgenes are interrupted by 4 introns and composed of 5 exons in their coding regions, and closer homologous genes in the phylogenetic tree often have similar exon-intron organization. Further statistics revealed that approximately 56% of subfamily K members contain more than 4 introns, and about 28% of subfamily I members consist of less than 4 introns. For this reason, the two subfamilies were used to simulate intron gain and loss events, respectively. Furthermore, a new model of intron position distribution was established in current study to explore whether the evolution of multi-gene families resulted from the diversity of gene structure. Finally, RNA-seq data were used to investigate the expression profiles ofGmGELPgene under different tissues and multiple abiotic stress treatments. Subsequently, 7 stress-responsiveGmGELPgenes were selected to verify their expression levels by RT-qPCR, the results were consistent with RNA-seq data. Among 7GmGELPgenes,GmGELP28was selected for further study owing to clear responses to drought, salt and ABA treatments. TransgenicArabidopsis thalianaand soybean plants showed drought and salt tolerant phenotype. Overexpression ofGmGELP28resulted in the changes of several physiological indicators, which allowed plants to adapt adverse conditions. In all,GmGELP28is a potential candidate gene for improving the salinity and drought tolerance of soybean.

AB  - Sulphate soils, characterised by low pH conditions, are found worldwide, and are potentially large sources of metal contamination, often exceeding industrial emissions. Metal leaching from sulphate soils has been shown to be harmful to aquatic organisms, but the cascading effect on exposure in apex avian predators has not been studied earlier. With the present study we aimed at evaluating the potential of white-tailed eagle (Hatiaeetus albicilla) and great cormorant (Phatacrocorax carbo) nestlings, collected from nests located either in sulphate soil or control areas, for monitoring spatial contaminant trends of metals typically associated with sulphate soils. In blood of white-tailed eagles, the concentrations of aluminium and cobalt were significantly higher in sulphate soil areas. In blood of great cormorants, the concentrations of copper and manganese were so, while the concentration of zinc was found to be lower. Also, we observed an interaction between the latitude and soil type in cobalt and lithium concentrations of great cormorants, showing that concentrations in the sulphate soil associated nestlings rose more steeply towards the north than in the control group. Latitudinal trends of higher concentrations in the south were found in cadmium, manganese, and copper of white-tailed eagle nestlings, while thallium of white-tailed eagle nestlings, and thallium and zinc of great cormorant nestlings showed a latitudinal trend of higher concentrations in the north. Concentrations of several metals correlated positively within a species indicating covariation in metal exposure. Generally, the metal concentrations in both species were similar to levels reported to be below toxicity thresholds in other species. These results indicate, that white-tailed eagle and great cormorant nestling metal burdens may indicate environmental contamination from acidic sulphate soil runoff, and that they may act as indicators of latitudinal gradient identifying different contamination sources.

AB  - Livestock and poultry (LP) pollution affects water quality of water resources. In this study, spatio-temporal variations in amount, structure, and discharge of LP pollutant in the water source area of the Middle Route of South-to-North Water Diversion Project (MR-SNWDP) in China on the county scale were analyzed. In this regard, the gray water footprint (GWF) was employed as an indicator for quantitative evaluation of LP pollution to measure the impact of these parameters on local water resources. Based on the statistical data for the time period of 2000-2017, the results showed that the total amount of LP farming has steadily increased, except for a slight decrease in the years 2007 and 2014. Also, the counties, Dengzhou (DZ), Neixiang (NX), and Xichuan (XC), are found to be the biggest polluters. The GWF of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) was calculated to be 12.7, 8.6, and 2.8 billion m(3) in 2017, respectively, with GWF(TN) > GWF(TP) > GWF(COD). The pollution of TN caused by LP has a greater impact on water quality than COD and TP. In 2017, the water pollution level (WPL) of water source area is 0.28, it means LP pollution required 28% of the total local water resources to be diluted. Additionally, the WPL for DZ, NX, and XC was found to be greater than 1, and it is concluded that the water resources of these regions face an environmental threat. Based on the area scale of the water sources, policies and incidence of diseases mainly affected the changes in the number of LP farming. On the county scale, the total amount and structure of LP was affected by factors such as terrain, traffic, economic level, and breeding mode. It is recommended that different policies and disposal methods should be adopted based the LP farming conditions in different cities.

AB  - Very limited information is available on fibrous clay minerals transformation in the rhizosphere of agricultural crops; especially that of citrus trees (orange, Citrus sinensis and lemon, Citrus limon) extensively cultivated worldwide, despite a large number of investigations evaluated the environmental conditions for the formation and stability of these minerals. In this study, palygorskite changes within the rhizosphere and bulk soil of selected citrus species of different ages and the ability of these plants to extract Mg from palygorskite were investigated. Orange orchards aged 5, 10 and 20 years and lemon orchards aged 5, 20 and 50 years were selected in Fars Province, Iran. The ratio of 0.71 to 0.64 nm XRD peak area (indicator of the relative quantities of neoformed kaolinite) and different forms of soil Mg were determined. The 0.71/0.64 ratio showed the highest relative quantity of neoformed kaolinite in the rhizosphere of orange trees as compared to the bulk soil, which was consistent with available Mg. Such variation trend of these soil parameters was slightly different in lemon orchards. A significant change in available Mg and kaolinite neoformation rate in older age groups of orange trees were observed because of continuous cultivation, higher Mg demand and root uptake. Furthermore, hexagonal particles of neoformed kaolinite were observed in the rhizosphere of orange trees using TEM. Nonexchangeable Mg was higher in the rhizosphere of 50-year-old lemon orchard compared to the bulk soil, which was consistent with the relative quantity of neoformed kaolinite. In addition, the trend of nonexchangeable Mg variation was in line with that of kaolinite neoformation rate in the rhizosphere and bulk soils of lemon orchards. Leaf analysis showed that palygorskite weathering could meet orchards' physiological Mg demand and palygorskite kaolinitization might play a role in agricultural soils of arid to semi-arid regions with no dolomitic sources of Mg.

AB  - Simple Summary Current issues concerning animal welfare are receiving remarkable consideration among scientific communities and wildlife conservation organizations. In addition to the ethical and legal grounds of animal welfare, it is important to produce healthy and viable populations in captivity by ensuring optimum welfare. Wild species are reared in captivity but, unlike domestic animals, there is a lack of welfare assessment protocols for these wild species. In the current study, we developed and applied the first baseline welfare assessment protocol for Punjab urial (Ovis vignei punjabiensis). While developing this protocol, we gathered all possible and existing information about the biology and ecology of this species in its natural habitat. Since no welfare assessment protocol and husbandry guidelines exist for this species, we used a welfare assessment protocol for domestic sheep as the base and reference in developing the current protocol for captive Punjab urial. Later, we applied this protocol to three different herds of Punjab urial at two different facilities. Based on the initial results obtained, some areas were found to have shortcomings and recommended for quick corrective measures and improvements.
   Abstract To ensure that captive breeding and other associated programs are more robust and sustainable, it is of utmost importance to ensure optimum welfare. Although it is well known that standard welfare is crucial for successful captive breeding, there is still a lack of welfare assessment protocols for wild species. The current study aimed to develop a leading baseline welfare assessment protocol for assessing welfare in captive Punjab urial. This protocol is based on the welfare protocol for domestic sheep from the Welfare Quality((R)) project, coupled with all the information obtained from the published literature on the species' biology and ecology. This protocol consists of 4 principles, 12 criteria, and 31 animal- and resource-based indicators. The protocol was tested and applied to three different herds of Punjab urial at two different facilities. Initial results showed that some areas need to be improved for better captive breeding and management.

AB  - Introduction Specialised early intervention services have demonstrated improved outcomes in first-episode psychosis (FEP); however, clinical gains may not be sustained after patients are transferred to regular care. Moreover, many patients with FEP remain socially isolated with poor functional outcomes. To address this, our multidisciplinary team has developed a moderated online social media therapy (HORYZONS) designed to enhance social functioning and maintain clinical gains from specialist FEP services. HORYZONS merges: (1) peer-to-peer social networking; (2) tailored therapeutic interventions; (3) expert and peer-moderation; and (4) new models of psychological therapy (strengths and mindfulness-based interventions) targeting social functioning. The aim of this trial is to determine whether following 2 years of specialised support and 18-month online social media-based intervention (HORYZONS) is superior to 18 months of regular care.
   Methods and analysis This study is a single-blind randomised controlled trial. The treatment conditions include HORYZONS plus treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU alone. We recruited 170 young people with FEP, aged 16-27 years, in clinical remission and nearing discharge from Early Psychosis Prevention and Intervention Centre, Melbourne. The study includes four assessment time points, namely, baseline, 6-month, 12-month and 18-month follow-up. The study is due for completion in July 2018 and included a 40-month recruitment period and an 18-month treatment phase. The primary outcome is social functioning at 18 months. Secondary outcome measures include rate of hospital admissions, cost-effectiveness, vocational status, depression, social support, loneliness, self-esteem, self-efficacy, anxiety, psychological well-being, satisfaction with life, quality of life, positive and negative psychotic symptoms and substance use. Social functioning will be also assessed in real time through our Smartphone Ecological Momentary Assessment tool.
   Ethics and dissemination Melbourne Health Human Research Ethics Committee (2013.146) provided ethics approval for this study. Findings will be made available through scientific journals and forums and to the public via social media and the Orygen website.

AB  - Amphibians are a valuable indicator group to study potential impacts of climate change (CC) because reproduction is closely linked to the availability of fresh water. Climate projections for the humid subtropical region of South America predict an increase in temperature towards the southwest and an increasing of precipitation during the rainy season and decreasing during the dry season. In this context, we aimed to predict the changes in the distribution range of amphibian species and the variation in their richness. In addition, we attempted to determine the most vulnerable species in terms of the extent of habitat loss and the overlap of optimal species distributions by contrasting present and future species range. We modelled the current and future distribution of 55 amphibian species using an inductive approach to model the ecological niche with three different algorithms. We used WorldClim data for current climate and IPPC5 climate projections from Global Climate Model for two greenhouse gas concentrations at 2050. Depending on the CC scenario, between 48 and 57% of the species showed a decrease in their optimal distribution, and 9-10% of them are likely to be affected by further population fragmentation. We identified three types of patterns of change in the geographical distribution of the optimal areas: (I) reduction, (II) displacement, and (III) increase in their distribution range. Future new areas with favourable conditions may not be reached due to the low dispersion tendency of amphibians. For this reason, it is important to identify those current favourable areas that are maintained in the different future scenarios. In this sense, this study allows to highlight priority areas for the conservation of the studied species and to identify those being highly vulnerable to the predicted scenarios. Our results contribute to the knowledge of how different future climates scenarios could affect the conservation of the studied amphibian species and provide key information for the development of strategies and public policies for management and biodiversity conservation.

AB  - The identification of appropriate sanitation systems is particularly challenging in developing urban areas where local needs are not met by conventional solutions. While structured decision-making frameworks such as Community-Led Urban Environmental Sanitation (CLUES) can help facilitate this process, they require a set of sanitation system options as input. Given the large number of possible combinations of sanitation technologies, the generation of a good set of sanitation system options is far from trivial.
   This paper presents a procedure for generating a set of locally appropriate sanitation system options, which can then be used in a structured decision-making process. The systematic and partly automated procedure was designed (i) to enhance the reproducibility of option generation; (ii) to consider all types of conventional and novel technologies; (iii) to provide a set of sanitation systems that is technologically diverse; and (iv) to formally account for uncertainties linked to technology specifications and local conditions.
   We applied the procedure to an emerging small town in Nepal. We assessed the appropriateness of 40 technologies and generated 17,955 appropriate system options. These were classified into 16 system templates including on-site, urine-diverting, biogas, and blackwater templates. From these, a subset of 36 most appropriate sanitation system options were selected, which included both conventional and novel options.
   We performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the impact of different elements on the diversity and appropriateness of the set of selected sanitation system options. We found that the use of system templates is most important, followed by the use of a weighted multiplicative aggregation function to quantify local appropriateness. We also show that the optimal size of the set of selected sanitation system options is equal to or slightly greater than the number of system templates.
   As novel technologies are developed and added to the already large portfolio of technology options, the procedure presented in this work may become an essential tool for generating and exploring appropriate sanitation system options. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fugitive emissions are unavoidable releases that occur continuously throughout a process plant or wherever there are connections or seals between the process fluids and the external environment. The daily exposure of workers to such emissions, typically spread across an entire chemical plant, poses a serious threat to their health and safety. Previous works have focused on assessing the occupational health risks in chemical plants through indexes such as the inherent occupational health index and the integrated inherent safety index. The indexes serve as good proxy indicators for potential sources of occupational hazards (chemicals, process conditions) and process equipment. However, by considering the SourcePath-Receptor (SPR) model, the eventual health risk is also dependent on the path and receptor, where a potential leakage and exposure can occur, respectively. Typically, chemical plants are fitted with controls and mitigation measures known as protection layers (PL) to control hazards. Hence, the occupational health risks in chemical plants due to fugitive emissions require a more holistic methodology for assessment and evaluation. Therefore, a hybrid framework for assessing the occupational health risks from fugitive emissions was developed by adopting and integrating the concepts of source-path-receptor, layers of protection and hierarchy of control. The generic protection layers identified were classified according to the traditional hierarchy of controls. At the source, the protection layers identified were hazard elimination/substitution, inherently safer design, and engineering controls. Next, the maintenance and equipment reliability were identified as PL along the exposure path. Finally, at the receptor, worker-exposure was linked to management systems, procedural safety behaviour and culture. Therefore, the proposed methodology can be used for benchmarking and performance tracking of occupational health risk in a chemical plant over time, as the methodology includes the time-varying parameters of plant maintenance, management system compliance, safety behaviour and culture.

AB  - Safe driving constantly challenges the driver's ability to respond to the dynamic traffic scene under space and time constraints. It is of particular importance for older drivers to perform sufficient visual and motor actions with effective coordination due to the fact of age-related cognitive decline. However, few studies have been able to integrate drivers' visual-motor behaviours with environmental information in a spatial-temporal context and link to the cognitive conditions of individual drivers. Little is known about the mechanisms that underpin the deterioration in visual-motor coordination of older drivers.
   Based on a review of driving-related cognitive decline in older adults and the context of driver-vehicle-environment interactions, this paper established a conceptual framework to identify the parameters of driver's visual and motor behaviour, and reveal the cognitive process from visual search to vehicle control in driving. The framework led to a psycho-geoinformatics approach to measure older drivers' driving behaviours and investigate the underlying cognitive mechanisms. The proposed data collection protocol and the analysis and assessments depicted the psycho-geoinformatics approach on obtaining quantified variables and the key means of analysis, as well as outcome measures.
   Recordings of the driver and their interactions with the vehicle and environment at a detailed scale give a closer assessment of the driver's behaviours. Using geoinformatics tools in driving behaviours assessment opens a new era of research with many possible analytical options, which do not have to rely on human observations. Instead, it receives clear indicators of the individual drivers' interactions with the vehicle and the traffic environment. This approach should make it possible to identify lower-performing older drivers and problematic visual and motor behaviours, and the cognitive predictors of risky driving behaviours. A better targeted regulation and tailored intervention programs for older can be developed by further research.

AB  - Seagrasses are submerged marine plants that are anchored to the substrate and are therefore limited to assimilating nutrients from the surrounding water column or sediment, or by translocating nutrients from adjacent shoots through the belowground rhizome. As a result, seagrasses have been used as reliable ecosystem indicators of surrounding nutrient conditions. The Chandeleur Islands are a chain of barrier islands in the northern Gulf of Mexico that support the only marine seagrass beds in Louisiana, USA, and are the sole location of the seagrass Thalassia testudinum across nearly 1000 km of the coastline from west Florida to central Texas. Over the past 150 years, the land area of the Chandeleur Islands has decreased by over half, resulting in a decline of seagrass cover. The goals of this study were to characterize the status of a climax seagrass species at the Chandeleur Islands, T. testudinum, in terms of leaf nutrient (nitrogen [N] and phosphorus [P]) changes over time, from 1998 to 2015, and to assess potential drivers of leaf nutrient content. Thalassia testudinum leaf nutrients displayed considerable interannual variability in N and P content and molar ratios, which broadly mimicked patterns in annual average dissolved nutrient concentrations in the lower Mississippi River. Hydrological modeling demonstrated the potential for multiple scenarios that would deliver Mississippi River water, and thus nutrients, to T. testudinum at the Chandeleur Islands. Although coastal eutrophication is generally accepted as the proximate cause for seagrass loss globally, there is little evidence that nutrient input from the Mississippi River has driven the dramatic declines observed in seagrasses at the Chandeleur Islands. Rather, seagrass cover along the Chandeleur Islands appears to be strongly influenced by island geomorphological processes. Although variable over time, the often elevated nutrient levels of the climax seagrass species, T. testudinum, which are potentially driven by river-derived nutrient inputs, raises an important consideration of the potential loss of the ecosystem functions and services associated with these declining seagrass meadows.

AB  - Previous studies hailed thermal tolerance and the capacity for organisms to acclimate and adapt as the primary pathways for species survival under climate change. Here we challenge this theory. Over the past decade, more than 365 tropical stenothermal fish species have been documented moving poleward, away from ocean warming hotspots where temperatures 2-3 degrees C above long-term annual means can compromise critical physiological processes. We examined the capacity of a model species - a thermally sensitive coral reef fish, Chromis viridis (Pomacentridae) - to use preference behaviour to regulate its body temperature. Movement could potentially circumvent the physiological stress response associated with elevated temperatures and may be a strategy relied upon before genetic adaptation can be effectuated. Individuals were maintained at one of six temperatures (23, 25, 27, 29, 31 and 33 degrees C) for at least 6weeks. We compared the relative importance of acclimation temperature to changes in upper critical thermal limits, aerobic metabolic scope and thermal preference. While acclimation temperature positively affected the upper critical thermal limit, neither aerobic metabolic scope nor thermal preference exhibited such plasticity. Importantly, when given the choice to stay in a habitat reflecting their acclimation temperatures or relocate, fish acclimated to end-of-century predicted temperatures (i.e. 31 or 33 degrees C) preferentially sought out cooler temperatures, those equivalent to long-term summer averages in their natural habitats (similar to 29 degrees C). This was also the temperature providing the greatest aerobic metabolic scope and body condition across all treatments. Consequently, acclimation can confer plasticity in some performance traits, but may be an unreliable indicator of the ultimate survival and distribution of mobile stenothermal species under global warming. Conversely, thermal preference can arise long before, and remain long after, the harmful effects of elevated ocean temperatures take hold and may be the primary driver of the escalating poleward migration of species.

AB  - This work investigated selective micro-electromembrane extractions (mu-EMEs) of the colored indicators metanil yellow and congo red (visual proof-of-principle) and the small drug substances nortriptyline, papaverine, mianserin, and citalopram(model analytes) based on their acid-base strength. With two free liquid membranes (FLMs), the target analytes were extracted from aqueous donor solution, across FLM 1 (1-pentanol, 1-ethyl-2-nitrobenzene (ENB) or 4-nitrocumene (4-NC)), into aqueous acceptor solution 1, further across FLM 2 (1-pentanol, ENB or 4-NC), and finally into aqueous acceptor solution 2. All phases had volumes between 1.0 and 1.5 mu L and extractions were promoted by 200-300 V d.c. applied across the five-phase mu-EME system formed in a perfluoroalkoxy capillary tubing. The anode was located in acceptor solution 2 and the cathode was located in donor solution for mu-EMEs of acidic analytes, and locations of the electrodes were vice versa for mu-EMEs of basic analytes. After mu-EME, donor solution and acceptor solution 1 and 2 were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The model analytes migrated efficiently in the proposed mu-EME system, their migration behavior was controlled by pH in aqueous solutions and their selective fractionation into acceptor solution 1 and 2 was demonstrated based on their acid-base strength. Under optimal conditions, acceptor solution 2 contained 60% nortriptyline (pK(a) = 10.5) and less than 1% papaverine (pK(a) = 6.0) and acceptor solution 1 contained 17% nortriptyline and 27% papaverine after 15min of mu-EME. The five-phase mu-EME system was also compatible with human plasma samples. Work is in progress to further increase the fractionation capability, and to implement the concept into microfluidic platforms. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry (FA), the deviation from the normal symmetrical condition of a morphological trait having specific morphological symmetry, increases in response to environmental and genetic stress, is related to phenotypic plasticity and is considered a tool for monitoring a species conservation status. However, FA-stress relations are dependent on measured traits or species-specific characteristics such as mating system and habitat. This study investigates the relationships between FA, genetic diversity, population size, density and individual fitness traits (plant height, fruit and seed set), in the endemic Aquilegia thalictrifolia, a mixed breeder that is declining, but maintaining high levels of heterozygosity. Leaf and flower FA and other traits were investigated in 10 populations of A. thalictrifolia, the whole species range. As a result, we found similar patterns of FA in leaves and flowers between populations, indicating a homogenous level of stress between populations that differed for other traits. FA and the other traits were not related, including heterozygosity. Heterozygosity was not related to individual fitness traits with the exception of plant height. In accordance with other studies, we found that the role of FA as a tool for assessing the conservation status of a species or population should be reconsidered. However, we conclude that a low level of FA should not automatically be considered an indicator of good conservation status or low level of stress, because in species that evolved in highly stable environments it may indicate a scarce ability to plastically respond to environmental changes, as a consequence of environmental and genetic canalization. Further investigation of this point is needed.

AB  - Agricultural land use commonly exerts multiple stressors on the functioning of stream ecosystems, including leaf litter decomposition and the utilization of this resource in stream food webs. If stressors interact, their cumulative effects on biotic responses cannot be predicted from knowledge of individual stressor effects, posing challenges for management and restoration of ecosystems. We examined the individual and interactive effects of four common agricultural stressors and the role of litter quality on leaf litter decomposition and fungal decomposers. In 128 outdoor, flow-through mesocosms, we manipulated levels of nutrients, a nitrification inhibitor (dicyandiamide), deposited fine sediment and flow velocity. Interactions among these stressors can ensue because, for instance, they jointly affect physicochemical conditions around leaf litter colonized by fungi such as concentrations of dissolved oxygen and nutrients. The two litter species used, deciduous birch and evergreen mahoe, showed contrasting decomposition dynamics, and these differences influenced their response to stressors. Fungi were important for birch litter decomposition but played a minor role for mahoe. Overall, flow velocity reduction and deposited fine sediment had the strongest, mainly negative effects on fungi and litter decomposition, probably as a consequence of reductions in dissolved oxygen available to fungi. However, fine sediment substantially increased mahoe litter mass loss, pointing at fungi-independent processes being relevant for its decomposition. Although interactions among stressors were uncommon, they showed effects of the same magnitude as stressor main effects. Potential mechanisms underlying interactions included reductions in dissolved oxygen and changes in microbial community composition. Knowledge of the effects of multiple agricultural stressors and of litter quality on litter decomposition and litter-associated fungi is crucial for management of forested riparian corridors, which have been shown to efficiently mitigate impacts of agricultural stressors on streams. The contrasting responses of the litter species used in our study warrant consideration of species composition of the riparian vegetation.

AB  - We present a sociohydrological model that can help us to better understand the system dynamics of a smallholder farmer. It couples the dynamics of the six main assets of a typical smallholder farmer: water storage capacity, capital, livestock, soil fertility, grazing access, and labor. The hydroclimatic variability, which is a main driver and source of uncertainty of the smallholder system, is accounted for at subannual scale. The model incorporates rule-based adaptation mechanisms of smallholders (for example, adjusting expenditures on food and fertilizers and selling livestocks) when farmers face adverse sociohydrological conditions, such as low annual rainfall, occurrence of dry spells, or variability of input or commodity prices. We have applied the model to analyze the sociohydrology of a cash crop producing smallholder in Maharashtra, India, in a semisynthetic case study setting. Of late, this region has witnessed many suicides of farmers who could not extricate themselves out of the debt trap. These farmers lacked irrigation and were susceptible to fluctuating commodity prices and climatic variability. We studied the sensitivity of a smallholder's capital, an indicator of smallholder well-being, to two types of cash crops (cotton and sugarcane), water storage capacity, availability of irrigation, initial capital that a smallholder starts with, prevalent wage rates, and access to grazing. We found that (i) smallholders with low water storage capacities and no irrigation are most susceptible to distress, (ii) a smallholder's well-being is low at low wage rates, (iii) wage rate is more important than absolution of debt, (iv) well-being is sensitive to water storage capacity up to a certain level, and (v) well-being increases with increasing area available for livestock grazing. Our results indicate that government intervention to absolve the debt of farmers or to invest in local storage to buffer rainfall variability may not be enough. In addition, alternative sources of income may need to be provided, for instance by ensuring minimum wages or by providing more access to grazing areas.

AB  - Background: Cellulose-containing waste products from the agricultural or industrial sector are potentially one of the largest sources of renewable energy on earth. In this study, the biomethane potential (BMP) of two types of industrial paper wastes, wood and pulp residues (WR and PR, respectively), were evaluated under both mesophilic and thermophilic conditions, and various pretreatment methods were applied in the attempt to increase the methane potential during anaerobic digestion. The methanogenic community composition was investigated with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and the ANAEROCHIP microarray, and dominant methanogens were quantitated using quantitative PCR.
   Results: All pretreatments investigated in this study with the exception of the alkaline pretreatment of PR were found to increase the BMP of two paper industry wastes. However, the low recalcitrance level of the PR resulted in the pretreatments being less effective in increasing BMP when compared with those for WR. These results were supported by the physico-chemical data. A combined application of ultrasound and enzymatic pretreatment was found to be the best strategy for increasing methane yields. The retention time of substrates in the reactors strongly influenced the BMP of wastes subjected to the different pretreatments. In sludges from both paper wastes subjected to the various pretreatments, mixotrophic Methanosarcina species were found to dominate the community, accompanied by a consortium of hydrogenotrophic genera.
   Conclusions: Pretreating industrial paper wastes could be a potentially viable option for increasing the overall degradation efficiency and decreasing reactor retention time for the digestion of complex organic matter such as lignocellulose or hemicellulose. This would help reduce the environmental burden generated from paper production. Although there were minor differences in the methanogenic communities depending on the temperature of anaerobic digestion, there was little effect of substrate and pretreatment type on the community composition. Thus, methanogen community dynamics would not seem to be an appropriate indicator regarding BMP in the AD processes investigated.

AB  - Lameness in sows may be associated with pain and poor welfare and requires early detection and treatment. The objective of this study was to use the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug meloxicam, as a short-term analgesic to identify characteristics of pain-related lameness in sows. A total of 44 pregnant sows were selected from two experimental sites, and used in a 2 x 2 factorial design. Sows were visually categorized as either non-lame or lame (none with severe lameness), and were either assigned to a placebo (saline) or meloxicam (OA mg/kg body weight) treatment. Lameness was assessed using a force plate, kinematic and accelerometer tools on the day before, and after a single intramuscular injection of treatment solution. Data were collected in the same order and at the same time on both days, starting at 7:45, 9:15 and 12:15 for accelerometers, force plate and kinematics, respectively. Before treatment, lame sows made a greater number of steps per min than sound sows (P=0.013), and had a tendency to have a lower contralateral ratio of weight applied between the hind legs than sound sows (P=0.062). No other differences were observed between lame and sound sows before treatment. Injection of meloxicam decreased the stepping frequency of the left hind legs (P=0.014), increased the ratio of tarsal joint angle amplitude between contralateral hind legs (P=0.05), and tended to increase standing time after feeding in lame sows (P=0.09), indicating an improvement of the lameness condition and at least a short-term analgesic effect of meloxicarn. Overall, meloxicam effects on lameness variables were limited. The wide variability in the underlying clinical causes, severity and duration of these naturally occurring lameness cases, as well as the timing of lameness assessment in relation to treatment injection may explain the relative lack of treatment effects on kinematics and force plate variables. More research is needed to identify pathology-specific indicators of pain-related lameness. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Slope failures caused by rainfall on weathered granite are common occurrences in many parts of the world and it is more severe in Japan where there are a significant number of slopes susceptible to failure. At present, about 31,987 natural, and valley slopes are found to be susceptible to landslide disasters in Hiroshima Prefecture, the highest number of any prefecture in Japan. In Hiroshima Prefecture, the prefectural land is divided into 350 units of 5 km(2), and the hazard of each unit was assessed based on the rainfall data and past records of failures. However, the existing hazard assessment system was found not to be adequate of making better predictions of individual failures in the region, and moreover the system was developed without carrying out any reliable slope stability analyses. In this study, an attempt has been made to understand the mechanism of individual slope failure through seepage analyses and stability analyses. A series of laboratory model tests were conducted to develop the relationships among volumetric water content, degree of saturation, suction, and coefficient of hydraulic conductivity under unsaturated conditions. Field investigation and laboratory tests were conducted based on the four valleys which were identified as potentially hazardous zones in Higashi-Hiroshima city in Hiroshima Prefecture. Graphical relationships were developed among the volumetric water content, suction, rainfall intensity, coefficient of hydraulic conductivity, and degree of saturation for Masado soils. Based on the relationships developed, suction was calculated along the soil profile of natural valleys with the lapse of time Thus, shear strength parameters were determined based on the degree of saturation calculated from the data of volumetric water contents. The stability analyses revealed that the factor of safety gradually decreases with the formation of High Moisture Content Belt (HMCB) and drastically reduces with the formation of the water table. The susceptibility of failure for each of the four valleys is given based on the hazard assessment system, and is compared and discussed. (C) 2014 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

AB  - The ability to evaluate gait in a commercial poultry setting is an important aspect of assessing physical health and well-being. Previously, it was suggested that gait width or metatarsal adduction (MA) may be indicative of lameness in ducks. However, no published description of normal gait of Pekin ducks currently exists. Thus, our goal was to characterize the range of gait patterns of healthy commercial Pekin ducks. We set out to determine if MA or gait width has an effect on the ducks' ability to ambulate. We further characterized whether these gait measures are associated with structural abnormalities or tibial dyschondroplasia (TD), or with plasma corticosterone levels. one-day-old hatchlings (n = 110) were obtained and housed in aviary floor pens under environmental conditions that closely adhered to industry standards. Beginning on d 3, weekly footprint analyses were completed. Qualitative analyses revealed that ducks fell into 3 general categories in a normal distribution: wide, middle, and narrow stance. Beginning at d 1, a weekly subset of ducks (n = 10) was weighed and analyzed for pelvic limb structure and presence of gross evidence of TD. on d 1, ducks were randomly selected for dissection. Starting on d 7, ducks (n = 10) were selected across the 3 gait width categories for analyses. Tibial dyschondroplasia is observed in ducks regardless of the degree of MA or width of stance. No significant differences were observed in plasma corticosterone levels regardless of gait width or degree of MA. At this time, we conclude that TD may not be a risk factor in the development of MA, or the converse, that severe MA may not be a risk factor for TD; the presence of MA may not be indicative of lameness or a diminished level of well-being in and of itself. lastly, we report that our qualitative assessment of gait width is easily performed in any aviary or barn setting, is an indicator of future gait, and this qualitative assessment can be supported by anatomical measures.

AB  - Environmental variables and benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages were spatially and seasonally examined over two consecutive years (2000-2002) along a glacier and snowmelt river in the central-west of Argentina where lies the highest peak in America, Mount Aconcagua (6956 m elevation). The goal was to assess seasonal and altitudinal variability in benthic community structure and to define whether physical-chemical variables affect distribution of aquatic insects. The Mendoza River basin was characterised by high variability in flow and transparency, high conductivity, hard calcium sulphate water, neutral and alkaline pH, and dominant substrate composed of small blocks, cobbles, pebbles, and sand-silt. Richness of invertebrates was low, with the lowest taxonomic richness being recorded at the mouth. The dominant group with highest taxonomic richness was Diptera, although caddisflies, mayflies, beetles, and stoneflies were present. Seasonal and spatial variations in biotic and abiotic variables were detected. Maximal densities and taxonomic richness were recorded in autumn and winter. From Modified Morisita's Cluster analysis it was found that the system is divided into two groupings of sites related to each other by faunal composition. INDVAL revealed species turnover along the altitudinal gradient of some taxa: Andesiops, Massartellopsis, Edwarsina, Chelifera, and Ceratopogonidae had preference for the headwaters (2835-2425 m elevation), Smicridea murina and Baetodes for the lower section (1413-1085 m elevation), and Austrelmis for the middle and lower sections. The middle section (1846-1727 m elevation) was a transition area where taxa from the headwaters and the lower section coexisted. Generalised Linear Models evidenced that altitude was the major factor determining macroinvertebrate assemblages along the large arid Mendoza River and that the physical-chemical variables that most influenced variation in community structure were: transparency, bicarbonate concentration, pH and substrate type. Our results suggest that benthic macroinvertebrate structure and environmental variables are affected in different ways by seasonal and altitudinal variations.

AB  - The regional variability of sea level is an integral indicator of changing oceanographic conditions due to different processes of oceanic, atmospheric, and terrestrial origin. The present study explores the nature of sea level variability in the Barents Sea a marginal shelf sea of the Arctic Ocean. A characteristic feature that distinguishes this sea from other Arctic shelf seas is that it is largely ice free throughout the year. This allows continuous monitoring of sea level by space-borne altimeters. In this work we combine satellite altimetry, ocean gravity measurements by GRACE satellites, available hydrography data, and a high-resolution ocean data synthesis product to estimate the steric and mass-related components of sea level in the Barents Sea. We present one of the first observational evidence of the local importance of the mass-related sea level changes. The observed 1-3 month phase lag between the annual cycles of sea level in the Barents Sea and in the Nordic seas (Norwegian, Iceland, Greenland seas) is explained by the annual mass-related changes. The analysis of the barotropic vorticity budget shows that the mass-related sea level variability in the central part of the Barents Sea is determined by the combined effect of wind stress, flow over the varying bottom topography, and dissipation, while the impact of vorticity fluxes is negligible. Overall, the steric sea level has smaller amplitudes and mainly varies on the seasonal time scale. The thermosteric sea level is the main contributor to the steric sea level along the pathways of the Atlantic inflow into the Barents Sea. The relative contribution of the halosteric sea level is dominant in the southeastern, eastern, and northern parts of the Barents Sea, modulated by the seasonal sea ice formation/melt as well as by continental runoff. The variability of the thermosteric sea level in the Barents Sea is mostly driven by variations in the net surface heat flux, whereas the contribution of heat advection becomes as important as the ocean-atmosphere heat exchange at interannual time scales.

AB  - Crustaceans in the order Amphipoda are sensitive organisms for the assessment of sediment quality. In this work we performed 10-day toxicity tests on muddy sediments collected from a total of 29 sites in the Gulf of Finland, the Gulf of Riga and the Gulf of Bothnia (northeastern Baltic Sea) using Baltic Sea species such as the native amphipod Monoporeia affinis (Bousfield, 1989) and the invasive amphipod Gmelinoides fasciatus (Stebbing, 1899), and also compared these results with those of bioassays carried out using the standard test species, laboratory-cultivated amphipod Hyalella azteca (Saussure, 1858). The sediment samples (three cm of the upper layer) were collected by a GEMAX Dual Corer during the R/V "Aranda" cruises in August and September of 2009 and 2010. Toxicity of sediments in bioassays with M. affinis and G. fasciatus gave varied results depending on the amphipod species used. The lowest quality of sediments determined using M. affinis was recorded at sites located in the offshore and deepwater areas (60-100 m depths) of the Gulf of Finland characterized by hypoxic/anoxic conditions. Toxicity testing applying G. fasciatus showed that sediments at >50% of the study sites in the Gulf of Finland and in the Gulf of Riga can be assessed as highly contaminated. Males of G. fasciatus were significantly more sensitive to potential contamination in sediments than females. The lower survival of males under contaminant stress may result in a skewed sex ratio in natural populations and in a decline of reproduction success. The survival rate of G. fasciatus in the toxicity tests correlated positively with the Shannon diversity index (calculated for macrozoobenthos at the study sites), weight losses on ignition (%) in sediments, and it also showed a negative relation with the bottom water oxygen content (mg/l). The results suggest that G. fasciatus is the more sensitive species of the three amphipods tested and can be used as a indicator of sediment quality in the Baltic Sea and other water bodies.

AB  - The effect of long-term freshwater acclimation on the blood and plasma ion composition of Red Drum Sciaenops ocellatus was investigated with the goal of elucidating the necessity of ion remediation. Four replicates (n = 50) of freshwater-acclimated (FW) fish (1.6 0.2g) were raised in 25-m(3) tanks supported by 140,000 L of recirculating water. Four replicates (n = 50) of seawater (SW) fish groups were placed in 40-m(3) offshore cages at 32-35 psu. Blood was collected from 100 fish (FW = 578 +/- 50g; SW = 686 +/- 45g) of each group (FW, SW) after 8 months of rearing. During the grow-out phase, the survival of FW and SW fish was 57.5% and 92.2%, respectively. The water ion composition (mainly the Ca2+/K+ [43%] and Ca2+/Mg2+ ratios [1%]) explained 56.6% of the plasmatic ion variability in the fish groups. Freshwater exposure produced significant reductions in osmolality and in several plasma indicators (Na+, Cl-, and Mg2+); the K+ levels from FW fish were the most compromised parameter. The water Ca2+/Na+ ratio had a greater influence (44%) on the plasma chemistry parameters, mainly glucose and creatinine. Freshwater-acclimated fish had a higher percentage of hematocrit, hemoglobin, and red blood cells than SW fish, but the water quality explained only 12.5% of the blood parameter variability between the FW and SW groups. The results support the conclusion that Red Drum tolerates salinity variations and can adopt a relatively stable condition for short periods; however, the data suggest that Red Drum have only a limited ability to withstand a hyposmotic environment for long periods due to their limited ability in maintaining K+ concentrations without external supplementation. Freshwater environments with high Ca2+/Na+, Ca2+/K+, and Ca2+/Mg2+ ratios appear to be a chronic stress factor that should be considered in future experiments.

AB  - Informative genes from microarray data can be used to construct prediction model and investigate biological mechanisms. Differentially expressed genes, the main targets of most gene selection methods, can be classified as single-and multiple-class specific signature genes. Here, we present a novel gene selection algorithm based on a Group Marker Index (GMI), which is intuitive, of low-computational complexity, and efficient in identification of both types of genes. Most gene selection methods identify only single-class specific signature genes and cannot identify multiple-class specific signature genes easily. Our algorithm can detect de novo certain conditions of multiple-class specificity of a gene and makes use of a novel non-parametric indicator to assess the discrimination ability between classes. Our method is effective even when the sample size is small as well as when the class sizes are significantly different. To compare the effectiveness and robustness we formulate an intuitive template-based method and use four well-known datasets. We demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the template-based method in difficult cases with unbalanced distribution. Moreover, the multiple-class specific genes are good biomarkers and play important roles in biological pathways. Our literature survey supports that the proposed method identifies unique multiple-class specific marker genes (not reported earlier to be related to cancer) in the Central Nervous System data. It also discovers unique biomarkers indicating the intrinsic difference between subtypes of lung cancer. We also associate the pathway information with the multiple-class specific signature genes and cross-reference to published studies. We find that the identified genes participate in the pathways directly involved in cancer development in leukemia data. Our method gives a promising way to find genes that can involve in pathways of multiple diseases and hence opens up the possibility of using an existing drug on other diseases as well as designing a single drug for multiple diseases.

AB  - Starting in the 21(st) century and the challenges of the global economy, investors need to take vigorous tactics to face the competition for globalization. Financial investment environment changes with each passing day, investors' satisfaction are more and more discerning, and market demands can fluctuate unpredictably. While facing the constant changes of the global financial markets, it is important to know how to break through the current situation, maintain an advantage and continuously make a profit. Many investors have the pressure of competing to positively adapt, to form a competitive investment strategy, and to have a great project management strategy. The traditional business investment is not enough to deal with the issues regarding new and various economic challenges. This study will focus on answering the topic of this research: Reducing systematic risk through portfolio theory and macroeconomic model. This dissertation attempts to answer the main question and secondary issues and stays focus on the comparison of these industrial regions consisting of ten industrial regions comprised of two developed industrial regions (USA and Japan) and eight high-growth industrial regions (Four Asia Tigers and BRIC). Significantly, this research deals with quantitative and empirical analysis of the prominent features and the essential conditions for portfolio theory and macroeconomic model and to evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of twelve stock markets of the ten industrial regions by examining three hypotheses. The discussion of the invested systematic risk index among ten industrial regions is presented by measuring competitive comparison of the first hypotheses under the factor analysis through the use of the principle component method of factor analysis. Further, in terms of second hypothesis, measurement of the ten industrial regions competitive comparison was addressed by analyzing the macroeconomic indicators data under the rotated method (Varimax method). Lastly, in terms of assessing the first and second macroeconomic models (first hypothesis and second hypothesis), the measurement focused on the scenario analysis and empirical analysis through the use of the fluctuate percentage of stock price index and stock market capitalization of twelve stock markets from 2004 to 2008.

AB  - Iron (Fe) oxide mineralogy in most Australian soils is poorly characterized, even though Fe oxides play an important role in soil function. Fe oxides reflect the conditions of pH, redox potential, moisture, and temperature in the soil environment. The strong pigmenting effect of Fe oxides gives most soils their color, which is largely a reflection of the soil's Fe mineralogy. Visible-near-infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy can be used to identify and measure the abundance of certain Fe oxides in soil, and the visible range can be used to derive tristimuli soil color information. The aims of this paper are (1) to measure the abundance of hematite and goethite in Australian soils from their vis-NIR spectra, (2) to compare these results to measurements of soil color, and (3) to describe the spatial variability of hematite, goethite, and soil color and map their distribution across Australia. We measured the spectra of 4606 surface soil samples from across Australia using a vis-NIR spectrometer with a wavelength range of 350-2500 nm. We determined the Fe oxide abundance for each sample using the diagnostic absorption features of hematite (near 880 nm) and goethite (near 920 nm) and derived a normalized iron oxide difference index (NIODI) to better discriminate between them. The NIODI was generalized across Australia with its spatial uncertainty using sequential indicator simulation, which resulted in a map of the probability of the occurrence of hematite and goethite. We also derived soil RGB color from the spectra and mapped its distribution and uncertainty across the country using sequential Gaussian simulations. The simulated RGB color values were made into a composite true color image and were also converted to Munsell hue, value, and chroma. These color maps were compared to the map of the NIODI, and both were used to interpret our results. The work presented here was validated by randomly splitting the data into training and test data sets, as well as by comparing our results to existing studies on the distribution of Fe oxides in Australian soils.

AB  - There is increasing concern about the fate and effects of (geno)toxic and endocrine disrupting chemicals in sediments, highlighting the need to develop suitable monitoring tools. The deposit-feeding bivalve mollusc Scrobicularia plana has been put forward as a promising bioindicator of sediment contamination in estuaries. The recent demonstration of intersex in S. plana populations has been attributed to the feminisation of male clams following exposure to (xeno-)oestrogens, yet the mode of action of these endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) remains largely unclear. One hypothesis that warrants further investigation is the possible involvement of genotoxicity. The first objective of this study was to assess whether the blood cells of S. plana are suitable for genotoxicity screening, using the alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay. This was demonstrated successfully by exposing blood cells under in vitro conditions to a range of concentrations of the reference genotoxin hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)): strong correlations between H(2)O(2) concentration and various comet parameters were found. Subsequently, the Comet assay was used to test whether the natural oestrogen 17 beta-oestradiol (E2) and the synthetic (xeno)oestrogens ethinyloestradiol (EE2) and nonylphenol (NP) can produce genotoxic effects in S. plana, which might indicate possible involvement of mutagenicity in the mode of action of intersex development. In these short-term tests, clear genotoxic effects (significantly more DNA in the comet tail) were demonstrated by all EDCs, albeit only at high doses: 100 ng/L E2, 1 mu g/L EE2 and 100 mu g/L NP in vitro: and 1 mu g/L E2 and 1 mg/L NP after a 6-day in vivo exposure. Nevertheless, this study provides valuable preliminary data on the application and sensitivity of S. plana blood cells and suggests that the Comet assay is a useful tool, to screen for genotoxicity in infaunal clams and to examine further the links with higher order effects.

AB  - Global climate change can potentially increase the frequency of climate anomalies. Anomalously warm years may cause an increase in soil nitrogen (N) availability by stimulating N mineralization. To date, most studies addressing the effects of ecosystem warming have been conducted in relatively cold ecosystems and few studies have addressed impacts of interannual as opposed to continuous, multiyear warming. In this study, 12 intact soil monoliths were excavated from a tallgrass prairie site near Purcell, Oklahoma, USA and divided among four large flux chambers (EcoCELLs). During the first year, all four EcoCELLs were subjected to Oklahoma air temperatures and precipitation. During the second year, air temperature in two EcoCELLs was increased by 4 degrees C throughout the year resulting in an increase in soil temperature of 2.3 degrees C at 7.5 cm depth. During the third and fourth years, temperatures in the warmed EcoCELL returned back to 'normal' conditions. During the warming year, vegetation N content was not significantly affected by the warming treatment suggesting no change in N availability. Other N availability indicators (soil solution chemistry, leaching, and N adsorption by ion exchange resins) did not show any effect of warming. Soil solution, leaching, and ion exchange resins showed a large pulse of NH(4)(+) at the start of the study most likely due to disturbance caused by monolith excavation and transport but these effects were short-lived and had disappeared before the treatment started. The lack of a clear warming effect may be explained by a reduction in soil moisture in the warming treatments compared with the controls offsetting a potential stimulation of N mineralization in response to increased temperatures. As a result, effects of an anomalously warm year on N availability in warmer ecosystems may be small compared with colder ecosystems but are likely to depend on soil moisture status.

AB  - Different densities of (14)Carbon (C-14) labeled Spirulina platensis were fed to larval and juvenile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus with a body weight of 10 mg, 20 mg, 200 mg, 700 mg, 1000 mg, and 1800 mg at a constant temperature of 25 degrees C during 1-h feeding period. Ingestion rate (IR, mu gC/fish/h), assimilation rate (AR, mu gC/fish/h), and clearance rate (CR, mL/fish/hour, an indicator exhibiting the fish water filtration effort) of Spirulina were investigated by monitoring the fate of the C-14 labeled food. Quadratic regression models were developed for evaluation of ingestion and assimilation of raw Spirulina by larval and juvenile tilapia of different sizes under various algal densities. We estimated the threshold density (TD, mg/L) of Spirulina for tilapia of each size to sustain the basic metabolism when AR calculated from the models initially matched their respective values of resting carbon consumption requirement for respiration. The relationship between TD and body weight (BW, mg) could be expressed as TD=26.937 W-0248 (R-2=0.936). We estimated the efficient density (ED, mg/L) for the fish of each size to assimilate Spirulina without 'surplus' feeding of suspended raw Spirulina when AR calculated from the models reached their respective maxima. The relationship between ED and body weight (BW, mg) could be expressed as ED=220.03 BW-0203 (R-2=0.901). Larval and juvenile tilapia seem to utilize Spirulina in a feeding strategy of controlling the net intake and requirement of energy by conditioning the clearance rate on algal suspension at various densities of Spirulina. This feeding strategy becomes more effective with the development of the buccopharyngeal filter feeding apparatus. Only in an artificial ecological system, e.g. CERAS may provide sufficient densities of Spirulina for early larval tilapia without the soundly developed buccopharyngeal filter feeding apparatus to sustain the basic metabolism.

AB  - From June to December, we determined the effects of variations in biochemical composition oil delta C-13 of tree rings of 2-year-old oaks (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) growing under semi-natural conditions, and the dependence of these effects of water stress during the growth season. Percent abundance, carbon concentration and delta C-13 were measured in holocellulose, lignin, extractive-free wood, starch and a water-soluble fraction. Relative concentrations of lignin and holocellulose in the extractive-free wood varied little during the season or in response to water stress, indicating that these Compounds could not quantitatively explain the variations in whole-wood delta C-13. Among all sampled tree rings, the relative concentration of each structural Compound (holocellulose and lignin) accounted for less than 5% of the delta C-13 variability in whole wood. Variations in holocellulose and extractive-free wood delta C-13 between tree rings were almost identical (r > 0.95), whereas variations in lignin delta C-13 were less well correlated to these compounds. Whole-wood delta C-13 had a slightly altered isotopic signal compared with that of the structural compounds because of the presence of the extractive component. These results showed that variations in lignin delta C-13 and lignin concentration have little influence on extractive-free wood delta C-13 and whole-wood delta C-13. Rather, holocellulose influences delta C-13 the most. Thus, we confirmed that, for climatic reconstruction from tree rings, removal of extractives by soxhlet is generally Sufficient and sometimes unnecessary. Our findings also indicate that, in the case of rapid and severe water stress, the structural component did not accurately record the associated increase in delta C-13 because of dilution with previously formed organic matter and cessation of trunk growth. The effect of drought on carbon isotope ratios was more pronounced in the extractive compounds, making them good water stress indicators but Only oil a scale of days to months.

AB  - The present paper is a combined study on the medium and short-term evolution of the littoral between Chipiona and Rota (SW Spain). The analysis of coastal evolution over a period of 24 years (i.e. medium-term), was carried out using six, well temporally spaced, photogrammetric flights. Cliff top and dune toe were used as shoreline indicators to solve problems related to the use of watermark in tidal environments. Short-term littoral variations were monitored monthly by means of an electronic theodolite over a period of 2 years. The width variations of the dry beach were surveyed by always using a constant, average value for the mean sea level position derived from the numerous surveys carried out. The obtained data was representative of both seasonal and annual variations.
   Over medium-term, most of the littoral recorded erosion, while accretion has been recorded over recent years in the southern part. Coastal erosion was related to the impact of several storms and dune accretion was linked to the action of eastern winds.
   Over the short-term time frame, about the same percentage of coastal erosion and accretion was recorded. Most of the important accretion trends were observed at the central and southern parts of the littoral, the largest amount of erosion being recorded in the southern end of the littoral, in a nourished beach. All the studied beaches (except Punta Candor dunes) showed more short-term changes than medium-term ones, because of different factors, essentially the great seasonal variability of the studied beaches.
   The partial discrepancy between the medium and the short-term trends was related to the applied methodology, which demonstrates the problem of comparing different coastal features (dunes and cliffs on one hand, and beaches on the other) and to the implications of 2-3 years of lasting fair weather conditions that favoured beach and dune accretion, within an historical retreat tendency related to storm actions.

AB  - The aim of the study was the evaluation of the preventive and therapeutic efficacy of Finadyne in the event of MMA risk in sows. The experiment was conducted in two farms of similar environmental conditions. The study included 42 sows aged 1-3 years and 469 piglets born to these females. The animals, randomly chosen in each farm, were divided into 2 groups, i.e. experimental and control ones. In farm A 9 sows, while in farm B 12 females were included per group. Each sow of the experimental group was injected intramuscularly with Finadyne at a dose of 2 ml/50 kg b.w. (2 mg of flunixin/kg b.w.), and, if necessary, the injection of the product was repeated after 24 hours. The females of the control group were not treated with medicines at all. In total, the MMA syndrome occurred in 5 sows (23.80%) in the experimental groups in both farms, while 7 sows in the control groups (33.33%) were affected. Number and body weight of piglets at birth date were very similar in the tested groups. However, subsequently during the newborn piglets' lives the yield expressed by daily gains were statistically significant (p < 0.05) to the advantage of litters of the experimental sows. This is a measurable indicator of Finadyne action. In the group of the sows treated with Finadyne, the diarrhoea signs were found in 5 litters (23.80%), while in the control groups in 7 litters (33.33%). In the experimental groups, 11 piglets died up to 21 day of life, i.e. 4.70%, while in the control groups - 16 newborns (6.86%), i.e. 2.16% piglets more. It was also discovered that administration of the product to sows after farrowing had a positive influence on fertility, as well as an impact on mating efficacy and rejection rate. All in all, 95.20% of sows of the experimental groups were effectively inseminated, while 90.40% in controls.

AB  - Dams have major impacts on river hydrology, primarily through changes in the timing, magnitude, and frequency of low and high flows, ultimately producing a hydrologic regime differing significantly from the pre-impoundment natural flow regime. This paper presents the analysis of pre- and post-darn hydrologic changes from dams that cover the spectrum of hydrologic and climatic regimes across the United States. Our overall goals are to document the type, magnitude, and direction of hydrologic shifts because of impoundment. Using the entire database for the National Inventory of Dams (NID) for dams possessing longstanding U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) gages downstream, we identified 21 gage stations that met length-of record criteria encompassing an array of types of dams and spanning four orders of magnitude in contributing watershed area. To assess hydrologic changes associated with dams, we applied a hydrologic model, the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (I HA), supplemented with orientation statistics for certain hydrograph parameters. Dams had significant impacts on the entire range of hydrologic characteristics measured by IHA. For many characteristics, the direction and significance of effects were highly consistent across the 21 sites. The most significant changes across these sites occurred in minimum and maximum flows over different durations. For low flows, the 1-day through 90-day minimum flows increased significantly following impoundment. The 1-day through 7-day maximum flows decreased significantly across the sites. At monthly scales, mean flows in April and May tend to decline while mean flows in August and September increase. Other significant adjustments included changes in annual hydrograph conditions, primarily in the number of hydrograph reversals that has generally increased for almost all sites following impoundment. The number of high pulses has increased following impoundment but the average length declines. The mean rate of hydrograph rise and fall has declined significantly. These results indicate that the major pulse of darn construction during the previous century has modified hydrologic regimes on a nationwide scale, for large and small rivers. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - It's been known for a long time, that certain diseases are more frequent in lower socioeconomic classes. But knowledge about the nature of this association, its main risk factors and how to improve health outcomes in lower social groups is still limited.
   Social class has been defined by different indicators by e.g. occupation and job position or the highest school qualification achieved. For international comparisons different classifications such as "The Registrar General's Social Class Classification" or the "International Standard Classification of Education" have been used.
   Several European Studies show a higher prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular risk factors including smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia in lower socioeconomic classes. But this studies also show that all socioeconomic groups have access to medical services.
   The Data from the Swiss Health Survey show the distribution of cardiovascular risk factors and diseases by three levels of education: Behavioural factors such as smoking, obesity and physical inactivity are more commonly present in the lower socioeconomic groups. People with, a lower educational level visit their GP more often, whereas people with a higher level of educational consult specialists more frequently. Medical services are often used to check of blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol. An indication of state of health may be shown by medication and treatment for cardiovascular disease which is more prevalent in lower socioeconomic groups. The present discussion of explanations of the poorer state of health, in lower socioeconomic groups. beyond the classical risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Studies have shown that after the correction for risk factors a correlation remains between social class and state of health. It is believed, that psycho-. social factors such as self-esteem, control in the work-place or coping-strategies play an additional important role in staying healthy.
   Therefore prevention of cardiovascular disease should not be restricted to minimisation of risk factors or to the measurement of certain blood-values and treatments. Efforts must also go into creating the conditions for a healthier life and promote possibilities for healthier behaviour in all socioeconomic classes.

AB  - Phytoplankton samples collected from two cruises off the coast of Chile were analysed for pigment composition and absorption characteristics. High pigment concentrations (up to 20 mg chl-a m(-3)) were found in the upwelled waters over the shelf break off the coast of Concepcion during spring (October 1998), but relatively oligotrophic conditions were found further offshore. Similarly, stations further north (between Coquimbo and Iquique), sampled during the austral summer (February 1999), also showed low pigment concentrations, characterised by the presence of prymnesiophytes, and cyanobacteria including Prochlorococcus sp. The specific absorption coefficient of phytoplankton at 443 nm (a*(ph) (443)) was much higher for the offshore population than the inshore population, which was dominated by large diatoms. These differences are attributed to changes in pigment packaging and pigment composition. The relative proportion of non-photosynthetic carotenoids to chl-a, together with the ratio of the peak height of the Gaussian bands in the blue and red regions of the spectrum, p(435)/p(676), (an indicator of the importance of the packaging effect) could account for up to 92 % of the total variation in a*(ph) (443). Blue/green absorption ratios were strongly related to the relative concentration of 19'-hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin and fucoxanthin. A reasonable agreement was found between in situ and satellite estimates of chl-a (SeaWiFS data) despite the large variability in phytoplankton specific absorption coefficients, suggesting that the 'global' absorption-to-chlorophyll relationships encompass the regional variations observed off the coast of Chile. Satellite chl-a was overestimated in oligotrophic water when compared to HPLC chl-a measurements, apparently because of the high specific absorption coefficients of phytoplankton in the offshore waters. On the other hand, ship and satellite data were in closer agreement when in situ fluorometric chl-a data was used. It is likely that the correlation between in situ and satellite chl-a could be improved by using regional algorithms.

AB  - This article summarizes the broad individual differences in aggressiveness and its relationship with several other behavioral, physiological, and neurobiological characteristics that exist in an outbred laboratory strain of male feral rats. Based on the observations that the individual level of offensive aggressive behavior (i. e., the tendency to defend the home territory) is strongly related to the way they react to various other environmental challenges, it is argued that the individual's level of offensiveness is an important indicator and component of a more traitlike behavioral physiological response pattern (coping strategy) to environmental demands. The coping style of aggressive animals is principally aimed at a (pro) active prevention or manipulation of a stressor, whereas the nonaggressive individuals tend to passively accept or react to it. The (pro) active and reactive/passive behavioral coping styles are clearly associated with distinct patterns of autonomic/endocrine (re) activity and underlying neurobiological correlates and determinants. Consequently, these individual differences in aggression/coping style may not only determine the individual vulnerability to stress-related disease, and hence be an important factor in the population dynamics of the species, but may also determine responsivity to pharmacotherapeutic treatments. From an animal modeling point of view, it is argued that the aggressive extremes of this variation may, under the proper testing conditions, have an enhanced propensity to develop pathological forms of aggression and/or coping, for example, antisocial traits, violence, or impulsivity disorders. Finally, it is proposed that the use of these feral animals as base "material" for genetic association (i. e., QTL search, mRNA differential expression, nucleic acid microarray analysis) and manipulation (i. e., gene silencing or amplification by antisense ODN, siRNA, and/or viral gene-transfer methodologies) studies would most likely be the best option for dissecting successfully the genetic basis of both normal and pathological forms of aggression and/or coping.

AB  - Laboratory studies were conducted to establish the utility of otolith chemistry for tracing gulf menhaden Brevoortia patronus environmental histories. Menhaden larvae were hatched from eggs and reared to juveniles under constant conditions at 3 temperatures (18, 22, 26 degrees C) and 3 salinities (20, 26, 33.4). Whole otoliths from experimental fish along with their rearing waters were analyzed by ICPMS (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) and TIMS (thermal ionization mass spectrometry) to determine the effects of temperature and salinity on Sr concentration, Sr/Ca and Sr-87/Sr-86. A comparison of elemental composition by otolith type revealed significantly lower Sr concentrations and lower Sr/Ca ratios in the asteriscus versus the sagitta and lapillus. X-ray diffraction analyses for each otolith type determined that menhaden sagittae and lapilli are aragonite while their asterisci are vaterite. This suggests the type of calcium carbonate matrix deposited can affect the concentrations of trace elements incorporated into otoliths. In laboratory reared menhaden no significant relationships between Sr concentration or Sr/Ca ratios and temperature, salinity or menhaden growth rate were detected (ANOVA, p = 0.05). We found no indication that Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of menhaden otoliths were affected by water temperature. 87Sr/86Sr did reflect the salinity of the rearing water; however, the relationship between Sr isotope ratios and salinity Limits the utility of Sr isotope ratios as a precise indicator of salinity to low salinity environments (<20) or over wide ranges of salinity. A comparison between Sr isotope ratios of menhaden otoliths and menhaden vertebrae, along with an analysis of a vertebra from a reproductive adult bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli, showed there was no significant difference between otolith and vertebra Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios, indicating that other bony structures might be suitable for strontium isotope analyses in small individual fish.

AB  - Plant diversification through crop rotation or agroforestry is a promising way to improve sustainability of agroecosystems. Nonetheless, criteria to select the most suitable plant communities for agroecosystems diversification facing contrasting environmental constraints need to be refined. Here, we compared the impacts of 24 different plant communities on soil fertility across six tropical agroecosystems: either on highly weathered Ferralsols, with strong P limitation, or on partially weathered soils derived from volcanic material, with major N limitation. In each agroecosystem, we tested several plant communities for diversification, as compared to a matching low diversity management for their cropping system. Plant residue restitution, N, P and lignin contents were measured for each plant community. In parallel, the soil under each community was analyzed for organic C and N, inorganic N, Olsen P, soil pH and nematode community composition. Soil potential fertility was assessed with plant bioassays under greenhouse controlled climatic conditions. Overall, plant diversification had a positive effect on soil fertility across all sites, with contrasting effects depending on soil type and legumes presence in the community. Communities with legumes improved soil fertility indicators of volcanic soils, which was demonstrated through significantly higher plant biomass production in the bioassays (+18%) and soil inorganic N (+26%) compared to the low diversity management. Contrastingly, communities without legumes were the most beneficial in Ferralsols, with increases in plant biomass production in the bioassays (+39%), soil Olsen P (+46%), soil C (+26%), and pH (+5%). Piecewise structural equation models with Shipley's test revealed that plant diversification impacts on volcanic soil fertility were related to soil N availability, driven by litter N. Meanwhile, Ferralsols fertility was related to soil P availability, driven by litter P. These findings underline the importance of multifactorial and multi-sites experiments to inform trait-based frameworks used in designing optimal plant diversification in agroecological systems.

AB  - Given the limited data available for estuarine/marine fish species and potential risk of being exposed to the herbicide atrazine, additional toxicity data regarding sensitive life-stages are needed. As such, this work sought to characterize: 1) the acute larval toxicity, and 2) early life-stage toxicity of technical atrazine in the model marine species sheepshead minnow (Cyprinodon variegatus). Atrazine was observed to be slightly to moderately toxic towards C. variegatus under acute conditions (as per U.S. EPA 2017 criteria). After 96 h exposure, mortality rates of 5%, 15%, 35%, and 90% were observed among fish exposed to atrazine at 4.6, 7.6, 13, and 22 mg a.i./L, respectively. Sub-lethal effects were observed among surviving fish exposed to > 3.2 mg a.i/L. The 96 h LC50 was 13 mg a.i./L and the NOEC was 3.2 mg a.i./L. In the 33 d early-life stage test, mean embryo survival rates in 0.15, 0.30, 0.57, 1.1, and 2.2 mg a.i./L treatments ranged from 71% to 79% and were not different from survival in the control (78%). Following 28 d post-hatch exposure (Day 33), mean larval survival ranged from 98% to 100% in all treatments and the control. Larval length and wet weight were the most sensitive indicators of the toxicity of atrazine to early life-stage sheepshead minnow. The NOEC for growth was 1.1 mg a.i./L and the LOEC was 2.2 mg a.i./L. Based on these, the MATC for atrazine to sheepshead minnow embryos and larvae was estimated to be 1.6 mg a.i./L. These results were consistent with previous investigations in sheepshead minnow and other marine fish species. Based on the results, atrazine would not be expected to pose unacceptable risks for sheepshead minnow early life-stages at environmentally relevant concentrations.

AB  - Under the conditions of conceptual transition of public health policy from considering citizens as passive consumers of medical services to their awareness of their own active position in health preservation, it becomes fundamentally important to understand the types of health care attitudes of the population. The aim of the study was to make a typology of the population according to the nature of health-saving attitudes and to study its influence on the dissemination of healthy lifestyle practices. We have analyzed and summarized approaches to the interpretation of health-saving motivation and classification of health care motives. We reviewed the experience of applying cluster analysis in studies of health behavior. We found that most of them use self-preservation practices as indicators for typology, while the equally important value-motivational component is most often left out of sight. Our study is designed to fill this gap. The results of the sociological monitoring of the physical health of the Vologda Oblast population in 2020 served as the information base. The motives of health care were considered in inseparable interrelation with the degree of health care and responsibility for it. We used the cluster analysis method (hierarchical and k-means method) to make a typology of the population. In the course of clustering we identified three groups of population according to the nature of health saving attitudes: 1) responsible, but unmotivated, caring little or no concern for health, 2) sharing responsibility, motivated and caring for health, 3) responsible, motivated and caring for health. We defined a socio-demographic portrait of representatives of each cluster. Representatives of the third cluster lead the healthiest way of life, while more than half of the respondents of the first cluster do not take any measures in relation to health. The results of the study have an explicit practical value in terms of managing self-preservation behavior.

AB  - The driving strategy of train drivers has a large impact on the energy consumption. In recent studies the focus was on calculating the optimal eco-driving strategy, and measuring the exact amount of energy used during train runs. However, energy consumption is not the only key performance indicator that affects the operational performance of train or freight operating companies. In this study we define a set of key performance indicators, relevant to train operation, that are specific, measurable, assignable, realistic and time-related, and that are influenced by the driving strategy of the driver. These key performance indicators are safety, timeliness, energy consumption, workload of the driver, the environment, cost of maintenance and brand image. We chose four driving strategies that are most used in daily practice or most studied in the literature to assess these key performance indicators. Per key performance indicator we defined evaluation criteria to measure the impact of a driving strategy. We then defined key characteristics (e.g. track length, gradients), and conditions (e.g. speed restrictions, and load factor) based on which we defined test scenarios for three different train types. We then used the Radau Pseudospectral Method for solving the various optimal train control problems to compute the effect of the driving strategies on most of the key performance indicators. Our findings show amongst others, that a maximal coasting strategy causes the least environmental pollution, and in most scenarios its energy consumption coincided with the optimal energy-efficient train control strategy or it had an energy efficiency close to the optimal one. Furthermore, we found that on other key performance indicators there are differences between the driving strategies (e.g. in cost of maintenance), which should be considered when choosing a preferred driving strategy. Our results enable train and freight operating companies to make an informed decision when choosing a preferred driving strategy for their drivers, or when choosing a Driver Advisory System that supports this preferred driving strategy.

AB  - The waste generated in the processes of thermal disposal of sewage sludge introduced into the environment, for example, in the storage process, is subjected to the influence of rainwater, the result of which may be the leaching of many, often hazardous, components therefrom. Hazardous substances in eluates pose a risk of migration thereof into the ground and water environment and can also have a toxic effect on the biosphere. The water leaching test, used in Poland to evaluate environmental risk caused by waste, only shows the capacity to release substances contained in waste under specific conditions without the inclusion of their impact on the biosphere. In contrast, the evaluation of waste bio-toxicity is conducted using bioassays. The undertaken research aimed to examine whether the expansion of environmental risk assessment to include biotests with respect to potentially leach-able components from waste would be a better tool for the evaluation of their toxicity. The research included bioassays with the usage of Lepidium sativum, and Avena sativa plants and the Microtox screening test with the participation of Vibrio fischeri bacteria. The analyzed eluates from the ashes obtained through sewage sludge incineration and waste from the treatment of flue gas were characterized by alkaline reaction as well as high levels of chlorides and sulfates. The eluates from fly ashes demonstrated a varied bio-toxicity depending on the type of the test organism. In the case of Lepidium sativum, the inhibition of root growth was observed while Avena sativa was stimulated. With respect to the Vibrio fischeri bacteria, a toxic effect of eluates was not noted. The eluates from waste obtained through the treatment of flue gas had a toxic effect on every biotest. The usage of bioassays as supplementation of chemical research for the assessment of the influence of leachates from waste on the ground and water environment may significantly raise the effectiveness of monitoring and the quality management of water resources.

AB  - Soil phosphatase is commonly used as an indicator to evaluate the arsenic (As) toxicity in soil. However, the As ageing process and the accuracy of using soil phosphatase activity to assess As contamination under various soil water contents are not clearly known. This study explored the effects of soil moisture condition on the As fractions (soil solid phase species) and soil alkaline phosphatase (ALP) over time. Results showed that elevated soil moisture would increase the content of F1-F4 (water soluble, exchangeable, carbonate and organic-bound) and decrease the ratio of F6 (residual). Whereas, the F5 fraction (bound to Fe and Mn/Al oxides), although did not show significant variation in the early period (up to 15 d), showed an increase at later period (30 d). The As bioavailability (K) increased with increasing soil moisture. Ageing process exhibited two stages. In the stage1, as the ageing progress the fractions, F1, F2 and F3 (former) gradually transformed into F4, F5 and F6 (later) under all tested As concentrations. The second stage is that under the low As concentrations, F1 and F4 transformed to F5 fraction. While, under the high As concentrations (200 mg kg(-1) and 400 mg kg(-1)), F1 and F2 transformed to F4 and F5. Meanwhile, soil moisture had a significant influence on soil ALP activity. Soil ALP activity under 110% WHC was smaller than the activity of soil ALP under 35% WHC. The variation partitioning analysis (VPA) showed that soil moisture contributed 63.19% for this effect on soil ALP activity and was identified as the dominant factor. The value of ED10 indicated that the As toxicity under 35% WHC was greater than that under 110% WHC. This could be due to that the excessive moisture content depressed soil ALP activity. Therefore, it is important to consider soil moisture content while assessing the As toxicity to soil ALP.

AB  - The need of the substitute fuels in compression ignition engines has been the major requisite of the today's world. Due to progressive diminution in crude oil and their subsequent environmental effects many researchers are working on various alternative fuels like biodiesel, methanol, alcohols, CNG, LPG, biogas. Fulfillment of the stringent emission norms is also a great concern as the fuel suggested should also offer the desired performance and should be economically and environmentally proven. Hence the oil extracted from the waste tyre is the biggest emanating fuel tested for its behavioral analysis when blended with diesel on single cylinder Variable compression ratio diesel engine. Trials are conducted with 100% diesel and then 10%, 25%, 35%, 50%, 60%, 75% and 90% TPO (tyre pyrolysis oil) blends with diesel with varying the load. It is observed that the various performance indicators like BP, IP and BMEP are boosted with rise in the proportion of TPO in the fuel oil for all loads. Increase in the BTE is found highest for moderate load up to 2.6 kg and maximum for TPO 90. Mechanical efficiency found to be maximum at TPO 35 at higher load. Lower specific fuel consumption obtained for TPO10 blend at low load and maximum at TPO 60. From the emission analysis it is found that CO emission tends to reduce up to moderate load, but increases consistently further with the load. HC emission found to be decreased with increase in TPO proportions with minimum for TPO 90 at all loading conditions. CO2 emission gradually increased with progressive rise in the load and increases rapidly for higher loads. NOx emission and smoke increased gradually with increase in the TPO proportion. Analyzing the performance of TPO for different proportions with diesel, TPO 90 is the better alternative to enhanced output and efficiency. Whereas for lower fuel consumption and emissions TPO 10 be recommended. Again it is also seen that moderate proportion ofTPO (TPO35) gives highest cylinder pressure and reduction in the fragrant sulfur.

AB  - The genus Collarina Jullien, 1886 (Cribrilinidae Hincks, 1879) has until now been known from the Atlantic-Mediterranean region as just two species, C. balzaci (Audouin, 1826), synonym of Collarina cribrosa Jullien, 1886, type species of the genus, considered to be widely distributed from the northern British Isles to the SE Mediterranean, and C. fayalensis Harmelin, 1978 from the Macaronesian Isles. Abundant material collected in the Mediterranean and the NE Atlantic, coupled with examination of museum specimens, allowed better definition of the species-specific morphological features in this genus and some generic traits (ooecium formation, avicularia with nested cystids). Besides the redescription of C balzaci and C fayalensis, this study led to the description of four new species: C denticulata Harmelin, n. sp., recorded only in the Mediterranean, C. gautieri Harmelin, n. sp., present in both the NE Atlantic and the Mediterranean, C. macaronensis Harmelin, n. sp., from Madeira, Azores and Galicia, and C. speluncola Harmelin, n. sp., from the Mediterranean and the Gulf of Cadiz. A seventh morphotype (Collarina sp., from the Mediterranean, seemingly close to C speluncola Harmelin, n. sp., has been left unnamed pending the availability of more abundant material. It was proven that C. balzaci: 1) has often been confused with C. gautieri Harmelin, n. sp.; 2) is exclusively epiphytic (mainly on Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile, 1813 and brown seaweeds), with life-cycle adapted to ephemeral hosts; 3) is widely distributed in the Mediterranean, but also present in the Canaries on seaweeds, and has probably been overlooked in similar habitats in other warm-temperate NE Atlantic localities; and 4) is able to proliferate dramatically on Posidonia leaves in association with diatoms under unusual environmental conditions (Gulf of Gabes, chemical disturbance). All Collarina species live in coastal areas, mostly at shallow depth, in shaded microhabitats: plants (C. balzaci), dark cave walls (C. speluncola Harmelin, n. sp.) and small hard substrates, e.g. shells, pebbles, and anthropogenic debris (all other species).

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the environmental performance and sustainability of different management options for livestockwaste in Cyprus. The twomost common practices in the country, i.e. the use of anaerobic lagoons and conventional biogas plants, were compared with the innovative scheme developed in the LiveWaste project (LIFE12 ENV/CY/000544), which aims not only to produce bioenergy, but also to treat the digestate for nutrient recovery and water reuse. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology was combined with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to compare the performance of these alternatives. Four relevant indicators were selected for each dimension of sustainability (environmental, social and economic).
   The results of the evaluations showed that anaerobic lagoons are not an appropriate option for the sustainable management of livestock waste due to environmental (e.g. climate change, acidification and eutrophication) and social impacts (e.g. noise exposure, visual impact and risk perception for human health). Themost important strengths and weaknesses of anaerobic treatment with and without digestate treatment were identified. Compared to conventional anaerobic digestionwhere digestate is directly applied as an organic fertiliser, the technology proposed in the project entails higher technological complexity due to nitrogen removal and phosphorus recovery. The rise in chemical and electricity requirements increased the impacts on some indicators, such as climate change and operational cost (emissions of greenhouse gases and operation costs were around 50% higher), while reduced impacts in others due to proper nutrient management, as acidification and eutrophication impacts (which were 10 and almost two times lower, respectively).
   For the specific Cypriot conditions, where the overapplication of nutrients leads to pollution of water bodies, the innovative treatment scheme with higher technological development presents an interesting approach. Nevertheless, the treatment of the digestate should be analysed taking into account the specific characteristics of each scenario. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Above- and belowground production in coastal wetlands are important contributors to carbon accumulation and ecosystem sustainability. As sea level rises, we can expect shifts to more salt-tolerant communities, which may alter these ecosystem functions and services. Although the direct influence of salinity on species-level primary production has been documented, we lack an understanding of the landscape-level response of coastal wetlands to increasing salinity. What are the indirect effects of sea-level rise, i.e., how does primary production vary across a landscape gradient of increasing salinity that incorporates changes in wetland type? This is the first study to measure both above- and belowground production in four wetland types that span an entire coastal gradient from fresh to saline wetlands. We hypothesized that increasing salinity would limit rates of primary production, and saline marshes would have lower rates of above- and belowground production than fresher marshes. However, along the Northern Gulf of Mexico Coast in Louisiana, USA, we found that aboveground production was highest in brackish marshes, compared with fresh, intermediate, and saline marshes, and belowground production was similar among all wetland types along the salinity gradient. Multiple regression analysis indicated that salinity was the only significant predictor of production, and its influence was dependent upon wetland type. We concluded that (1) salinity had a negative effect on production within wetland type, and this relationship was strongest in the fresh marsh (0-2 PSU) and (2) along the overall landscape gradient, production was maintained by mechanisms at the scale of wetland type, which were likely related to plant energetics. Regardless of wetland type, we found that belowground production was significantly greater than aboveground production. Additionally, inter-annual variation, associated with severe drought conditions, was observed exclusively for belowground production, which may be a more sensitive indicator of ecosystem health than aboveground production.

AB  - This study discusses how to classify the type of RTS (Returns to Scale) in the framework of DEA production analysis under the assumption on a unique optimal solution on projection and a reference set. The RTS measurement is classified into two categories: input-based RTS and output-based RTS. The two measures depend upon the sign of an intercept (a) of a supporting hyperplane on a production possibility set. In the DEA framework, multiple solutions usually occur on the intercept. This study discusses how to handle such an occurrence of multiple intercepts within the framework of the input-based and output-based RTS classifications. As an application, this study applies the proposed approach to classify the type of RTS on large photovoltaic power stations, often referred to as "mega solar parks", in the United States (US) and Germany. The input-based RTS measurement identifies that US photovoltaic power stations are classified into increasing (64 stations: 80.0%), constant (5 stations: 63%) and decreasing (11 stations: 13.8%), respectively. German photovoltaic power stations are classified into increasing (73 stations: 91.3%), constant (7 stations: 8.8%) and decreasing (0 station: 0.0%), respectively. The finding is confirmed by the output-based RTS measurement on the German photovoltaic power stations. However, the output based RTS on US photovoltaic power stations shows an opposite result. The US photovoltaic power stations are classified into increasing (26 stations: 32.5%), constant (6 stations: 7.5%) and decreasing (48 stations: 60.0%), respectively. The decreasing RTS is because the US photovoltaic power stations have less efficiently operated than those of Germany in such a manner that they cannot produce sufficient outputs from a given level of inputs in such a manner that they have failed to utilize a scale merit for their operations.

AB  - A national-scale study of outcrossing potential within Chilean vascular flora was conducted using an upgraded algorithm, which adds parameters such as pollinator agents, climate, and geographic conditions. Datasets were organized and linked in a Web platform (), in which the development of a total outcrossing potential (TOP) predictor was formulated. The TOP predictor is the engine in the Web platform, which models the effect of a type of agricultural practice on others (coexistence calculation mode) and on the environment (biodiversity calculation mode). The scale for TOP results uses quintiles in order to define outcrossing potential between species as very low, low, medium, high, or very high. In a coexistence analysis considering 256 species (207 genera), the 10 highest TOP values were for genera Citrus, Prunus, Trifolium, Brassica, Allium, Eucalyptus, Cucurbita, Solanum, Lollium, and Lotus. The highest TOP for species in this analysis fell at high potential, 4.9% of the determined values. In biodiversity mode, seven out of 256 cultivated species (2.7%) were native, and 249 (97.3%) corresponded to introduced species. The highest TOP was obtained in the genera Senecio, Calceolaria, Viola, Solanum, Poa, Alstroemeria, Valeriana, Vicia, Atriplex, and Campanula, showing high potential in 4.9% of the values. On the other hand, 137 genetically modified species, including the commercial and pre-commercial developments, were included and represented 100 genera. Among these, 22 genera had relatives (i.e., members of the same genus) in the native/introduced group. The genera with the highest number of native/introduced relatives ranged from one (Ipomea, Limonium, Carica, Potentilla, Lotus, Castanea, and Daucus) to 66 species (Solanum). The highest TOP was obtained when the same species were coincident in both groups, such as for Carica chilensis, Prosopis tamarugo, and Solanum tuberosum. Results are discussed from the perspective of assessing the possible impact of cultivated species on Chilean flora biodiversity. The TOP predictor () is useful in the context of environmental risk assessment.

AB  - One of the main challenges in water management is to determine how the current water use can condition its availability to future generations and hence its sustainability. This study proposes the use of the Water Footprint (WF) indicator to assess the environmental sustainability in water resources management at the river basin level. The current study presents the methodology developed and applies it to a case study.
   The WF is a relatively new indicator that measures the total volume of freshwater that is used as a production factor. Its application is ever growing in the evaluation of water use in production processes. The calculation of the WF involves water resources (blue), precipitation stored in the soil (green) and pollution (grey). It provides a comprehensive assessment of the environmental sustainability of water use in a river basin. The methodology is based upon the simulation of the anthropised water cycle, which is conducted by combining a hydrological model and a decision support system. The methodology allows the assessment of the environmental sustainability of water management at different levels, and/or ex-ante analysis of how the decisions made in water planning process affect sustainability.
   The sustainability study was carried out in the Segura River Basin (SRB) in South-eastern Spain. The SRB is among the most complex basins in Europe, given its special peculiarities: competition for the use, overexploitation of aquifers, pollution, alternative sources, among others. The results indicate that blue water use is not sustainable due to the generalised overexploitation of aquifers. They also reveal that surface water pollution, which is not sustainable, is mainly caused by phosphate concentrations. The assessment of future scenarios reveals that these problems will worsen if no additional measures are implemented, and therefore the water management in the SRB is environmentally unsustainable in both the short- and medium-term.

AB  - Tree canopy cover significantly affects human and wildlife habitats, local hydrology, carbon cycles, fire behavior, and ecosystem services of all types. In addition, changes in tree canopy cover are both indicators and consequences of a wide variety of disturbances from urban development to climate change. There is growing demand for this information nationwide and across all land uses. The extensive inventory plot system managed by the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) offers a unique opportunity for acquiring unbiased tree canopy cover information across broad areas. However, the estimates it produces had not yet been examined for comparative accuracy with other sources. In this study, we compared four different methods readily available and with significant potential for application over broad areas. The first two, field-collected and photointerpreted, are currently acquired by FIA on approximately 44,000 plots annually nationwide. The third method is a stem-mapping approach that models tree canopy cover from variables regularly measured on forested plots and is efficient enough to calculate nationwide. The fourth is a Geographic-Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) approach that uses both high-resolution imagery and leaf-off LiDAR data and has reported very high accuracies and spatial detail at state-wide levels of application. Differences in the spatial and temporal resolution and coverage of these four datasets suggest that they could provide complementary information if their relationships could be better understood. Plot-and county-level estimates of tree canopy cover derived from each of the four data sources were compared for 11 counties in Maryland, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia across a range of urbanization levels. We found high levels of systematic agreement between field and photointerpreted, stem-mapped and field, photointerpreted and GEOBIA estimates. In several cases, the relationship changed with the level of tree canopy cover. GEOBIA produced the highest tree cover estimates of all the methods compared. Results are discussed with respect to known differences between the methods and ground conditions found in both forest and nonforest areas.

AB  - The accumulation of carbon in peatlands originates from the slow rate of Sphagnum litter decomposition. Vegetation shifts can alter the Sphagnum decomposition rate through a litter mixture effect. This is rarely studied in peatlands. In a site colonised by vascular plants, we examined the effect of mixing litters of Sphagnum species with those of Molinia caerulea and Betula spp. on litter carbon (C) dynamics. We tested that water content and pH may explain the potential non-additive litter mixing effect.
   Litter bags with Sphagnum cuspidatum or Sphagnum rubellum and M. caerulea or Betula spp. were placed in situ, in a Sphagnum decomposing environment and retrieved after 1 year of incubation. In the laboratory, the specific interaction between S. rubellum and M. caerulea was investigated. Solid, soluble and gaseous forms of C were studied in addition to the fluorescence of the dissolved organic matter (FDOM).
   Laboratory and field experiments showed that there is a non-additive effect of mixing S. rubellum and M. caerulea litter on C dynamics. The analyses of FDOM suggested a relatively higher living biomass in the laboratory-measured mixture than in the expected one. The in situ S. rubellum moist environment could stimulate the decomposition of M. caerulea that experiences much drier conditions in its native environment. In the laboratory experiment, M. caerulea were kept moist, and no significant difference in water content between the measured and expected mixture was found. Also, pH decreased in the measured mixture, ruling out any direct effect on microbial activity.
   The non-additive mixture effect observed in the laboratory may be triggered by an increase of the microbial biomass. This increase was not explained by direct moisture or a pH effect. The suggested hypothesis that a lower pH could affect the availability of labile organic substrate through increased organic matter (OM) hydrolysis and thus stimulate microbial growth has to be further studied.

AB  - If an integrated urban waste management system includes the informal recycling sector (IRS), there is a good chance that more solid waste is recycled' is common sense. However, informal integration brings additional social, environmental, and economic benefits, such as reduction of operational costs and environmental impacts of landfilling. Brazil is a global best practice example in terms of waste picker inclusion, and has received international recognition for its recycling levels. In addition to analysing the results of inclusive recycling approaches, this article evaluates a selection of the best Brazilian inclusive recycling practices and summaries and presents the resulting knowledge. The objective is to identify processes that enable the replication of the inclusion of the informal recycling sector model as part of municipal solid waste management. Qualitative and quantitative data have been collected in 25 Brazilian cities that have contracted waste pickers co-operatives for door-to-door selective collection of recyclables. Field data was collected in action research projects that worked with waste pickers co-operatives between 2006 and 2013. The Brazilian informal recycling sector integration model improves municipal solid waste recycling indicators: it shows an increase in the net tonness recycled, from 140 to 208tmonth(-1), at a much lower cost per tonne than conventional selective collection systems. Inclusive systems show costs of US$35 per tonne of recyclables collected, well below the national average of US$195.26. This inclusive model improves the quality of collected material and the efficiency of municipal selective collection. It also diminishes the negative impacts of informal recycling, by reducing child labour, and by improving the conditions of work, occupational health and safety, and uncontrolled pollution. Although treating the Brazilian experience as a blueprint for transfer of experience in every case is unrealistic, the results suggest that this approach to informal sector integration can be considered among the global best practices for informal sector integration. The article closes with recommendations for deploying technology in other urban areas throughout the world.

AB  - To assess the effect of nutrient limitation on phytoplankton growth, and its influence on seasonal variation in phytoplanlcton community structure, we investigated abiotic and biotic factors in surface and bottom waters at 20 stations in inner and offshore areas of Gwangyang Bay, Korea. Algal bioassay experiments were also conducted using surface water, to assess the effects of nutrient addition on the phytoplankton assemblages. The fate of major nutrients in the bay was strongly dependent on the discharge of freshwater from the Seomjin River. River flow during the rainy season provides a high nitrogen (N) influx, pushing the system toward stoichiometric phosphorus (P) limitation. However, at some times during the rainy season there was insufficient N to maintain phytoplankton growth because it was rapidly consumed through nutrient uptake by phytoplankton under stratified environmental conditions. Diatoms made a relatively large contribution to total phytoplankton biomass. The dominant diatoms, particularly in winter and summer, were Skeletonema marinoi-dohmii complex and Skeletonema tropicum, respectively, while Eucampia zodiacus and the cryptophyte Cryptomonas spp. dominated in spring and autumn, respectively, comprising more than 75% of the community at most stations. In the bioassay experiments the phytoplankton biomass increased by 30-600% in the +N (added nitrogen) and +NP (added nitrogen and phosphorus) treatments relative to the control and the +P (added phosphorus) treatments, indicating that phytoplankton growth can respond rapidly to pulsed nitrate loading events. Based on the algal bioassay and the field survey, the abrupt input of high nutrient levels following rainfall stimulated the growth of diatom assemblages including the Skeletonema genus. Our results demonstrate that the growth of centric diatoms was enhanced by inputs of N and Si, and that the concentrations of these nutrients may be among the most important factors controlling phytoplankton growth in Gwangyang Bay.

AB  - The development of light-emitting diode (LED) technology has resulted in widespread solid state lighting (SSL) use in consumer and industrial applications. Previous researchers have shown that LEDs from the same manufacturer and operating under same use-condition may have significantly different degradation behavior. Applications of LEDs to safety critical and harsh environment applications necessitate the characterization of failure mechanisms and modes. This paper focuses on a prognostic health management (PHM) method based on the measurement of forward voltage and forward current of bare LED under harsh environment. In this paper, experiments have been done on single LEDs subjected to combined temperature-humidity environment of 85 degrees C, 85% relative humidity. Pulse width modulation (PWM) control method has been employed to drive the bare LED in order to reduce the heat effect caused by forward current and high frequency (300 Hz). A data acquisition system has been used to measure the peak forward voltage and forward current. Test to failure (luminous flux drops to 70%) data has been measured to study the effects of high temperature and humid environment loadings on the bare LEDs. A solid state cooling method with a Peltier cooler has been used to control the temperature of the LED in the integrating sphere when taking the measurement of luminous flux. The shift of forward voltage forward current curve and lumen degradation has been recorded to help build the failure model and predict the remaining useful life (RUL). Particle filter has been employed to assess the RUL of the bare LED. Model predictions of RUL have been correlated with experimental data. Results show that prediction of RUL of LEDs, made by the particle filter model, works with acceptable error-bounds. The presented method can be employed to predict the failure of LED caused by thermal and humid stresses.

AB  - The analysis of the C-O stable isotope composition of coral reef fish otoliths from Taiaro, a French Polynesian atoll normally isolated from the Pacific Ocean, has been performed to address two main questions. The first is to confirm previous results which suggest that a lagoonal coral reef fish population is able to achieve its ontogenetic cycle without any open ocean phase. If so, are O isotopic values of otoliths an indicator of temperature fluctuations in the tropical Pacific Ocean related to climate change and in particular temperature variations of water masses? delta O-18 and delta C-13 values on both lagoon and open ocean fish otoliths caught in 2006 indicated clearly that O-isotopes reached the isotopic equilibrium; in contrast, all delta C-13 values exhibited a strong isotopic disequilibrium related to metabolic activity. Stable isotope compositions revealed a clear differentiation between fish from lagoons and those from the open ocean (with a delta O-18 enrichment of 1 % in favour of the lagoon). This confirmed a lack of connectivity between habitats and that fish from lagoon lived their entire life cycle in the lagoon. Both delta O-18 and delta C-13 data indicated differences between nucleus and edge signatures with changes in fish behavior from the larval life to adulthood (habitat, diet, etc.), and a clear adaptation of dietary behavior of lagoon fish. The comparison of the 2006 data set with those of 1994 showed that environmental conditions were stable in the lagoon, leading to a very narrow range of variations in the delta O-18 values. delta O-18 of fish otoliths of the open ocean exhibited a wider variation (+0.25 %) between 1994 and 2006, suggesting a decrease in temperature linked to a change of SST, which can be interpreted in terms of climate change associated with El Nino Southern Oscilation (ENSO). These differences could also be due to a switch of habitats during the life cycle of fish from the open ocean.

AB  - Iberian dry-cured ham is colonised by moulds during the ripening process. The environmental conditions occurring during the process including the salt content predisposes the surface to colonisation by Penicillium species, including Penicillium nordicum which can contaminate the curing ham with ochratoxin A (OTA). The objective of this study was to examine the effect of NaCl (10% and 22% = 0.94 and 0.87 water activity (a(w))) on the activation of two genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway for OTA production, otapksPN and otanpsPN, relative growth and phenotypic OTA production by three strains of P. nordicum (CBS 110.769, FHSCC1 and FHSCC2) on a ham-based medium over a period of 12 days at 25 degrees C. Growth of the three strains was faster at 0.87 than 0.94 a(w) on the ham-based media. However, some intra- and inter-strain differences were observed. Of the three strains, only two (CBS 110.789; FHSCC2) were able to express the two genes involved in the biosynthesis of OTA in the two salt treatments. RT-qPCR showed that the temporal expression of the two genes (otapksPN and otanpsPN) was relatively similar for the wild type strain (FHSCC2) at both 0.94 and 0.87 a(w) over the 12 day period. However, in the type strain (CBS 110.769) expression increased rapidly at 0.94 a but was significantly lower at 0.87 a(w). Expression of these two genes occurred after 3 day incubation, while phenotypic OTA production was observed only after 6 days in the two toxigenic strains. The other strain did not produce any OTA. The OTA concentrations confirmed the results observed with the molecular tools. This suggests that the RT-qPCR gene expression of these two genes may be a good early indicator of potential contamination of dry-cured ham with OTA during dry-cured ham ripening.

AB  - Aggression can generate anxiety, create uncertainty about its aftermath and jeopardise social relationships. Postconflict interactions serve as conflict management strategies to mitigate these consequences. Whereas postconflict interactions are well characterized in many animals, their functions are still insufficiently investigated. Four functional hypotheses have been proposed: stress reduction, relationship repair, self-protection and benign intent. We aimed to test these hypotheses in females of a tolerant macaque species, the crested macaque, Macaca nigra, under natural conditions, for three postconflict interactions: reconciliation, affiliation and aggression with third parties. Our results provide meaningful contrasts compared with findings in other species. We found no evidence that aggression had consequences for individuals' behavioural indicators of anxiety, although it increased the likelihood of secondary aggression with third parties. There was little evidence for the stress reduction hypothesis as the occurrence of any of the three postconflict interactions investigated had little effect on the measured behavioural indicators of anxiety. Conflict and dyad characteristics also had limited influence on anxiety. The relationship repair function was only partly validated: dyads with stronger bonds or that exchanged more support did not reconcile more often, but dyads with attributes related to the symmetry, stability and predictability (i.e. security) within relationships did. Patterns of initiation and directionality of postconflict interactions in this study population suggest that reconciliation may constitute the signalling of appeasement and benign intent. Furthermore, we found that aggression towards third parties may serve as a source of self-protection and reassertion of the females' social status. The distinctive pattern of postconflict management strategies revealed in wild female crested macaques appears to be related to their typically tolerant social style. These results demonstrate the usefulness of concomitantly studying aggression, postconflict interactions and their functions, to understand conflict management strategies comprehensively, while taking into account the level of social tolerance characterizing the studied society.

AB  - Glaciers are widely recognized as key indicators of climate change. Recent evidence suggests an acceleration of glacier mass loss in several key mountain regions. Glacier recession implies landscape changes in the glacial zone, the origin of new lakes and activation of natural disaster processes, catastrophic mudflows, ice avalanches, outburst floods, etc. The absence or inadequacy of such information results in financial and human losses. A more comprehensive evaluation of glacier changes is imperative to assess ice contributions to global sea level rise and the future of water resources from glacial basins. One of the urgent steps is a full inventory of all ice bodies and their changes. The first estimation of glacier state and glacier distribution on the territory of the former Soviet Union has been done in the USSR Glacier Inventory (UGI) published in 1965-1982. The UGI is based on topographic maps and air photos and reflects the status of the glaciers in the 1940s-1970s. There is information about 28 884 glaciers with an area of 7830.75 km(2) in the inventory. It covers 25 glacier systems in Northern Eurasia. In the 1980s the UGI has been transformed into digital form as a part of the World Glacier Inventory (WGI). Recent satellite data provide a unique opportunity to look again at these glaciers and to evaluate changes in glacier extent for the second part of the 20th century. About 15 000 glacier outlines for the Caucasus, Polar Urals, Pamir Alay, Tien Shan, Altai, Kamchatka and Russian Arctic have been derived from ASTER and Landsat imagery and can be used for glacier change evaluation. Results of the analysis indicate the steady trend in glacier shrinkage in all mountain regions for the second part of the 20th century. Glacier area loss for the studied regions varies from 13% (Tien Shan) to 22.3% (Polar Urals). The common driver, most likely, is an increase in summer air temperature. There is also a very large variability in the degree of individual glacier degradation, very much depending on the morphology and local meteorological conditions.

AB  - Annually laminated sediments in Lake Xiaolongwan, northeast China, contain a suite of n-alkanes (C-17-C-33) with a strong odd over even carbon number predominance. Biomarker n-alkane proxies (average chain length, Paq ratio, grass/tree ratio, carbon preference index and compound-specific delta C-13 values) were used to reconstruct climate changes that occurred over the last millennium. Compound-specific delta C-13 values show large differences between the distinctive chain length groups of n-alkanes that originate from algae, aquatic macrophytes and terrestrial plants. Long-chain n-alkanes (C-27-C-33) are predominantly derived from leaf wax lipids in the forest. Variations in long-chain n-alkane delta C-13 values may mainly record water-use efficiency, inasmuch as the contribution from C4 plants is negligible in the Lake Xiaolongwan catchment. Short- and middle-chain n-alkanes are mainly from algae and aquatic plants. They are strongly depleted in C-13. This feature may be linked to a methane-derived, negative delta C-13 pool and lake overturn, which regulates dinoflagellate blooms. Parallel fluctuations are observed in delta C-13(27-31) values, Paq, and the grass/tree ratio throughout the record. Variations in delta C-13(27-31) values and Paq are in agreement with historical documents on summer and winter climate conditions. They support earlier suggestions that delta C-13 values in the long-chain n-alkanes and Paq may be useful indicators of effective precipitation or drought stress in this forested area. The delta C-13(27-31) index and Paq show distinct decadal variations. Periods with high delta C-13(27-31) values and a low Paq index correspond with the warm phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Values are reversed during PDO cool phases. At the decadal timescale, summer monsoon rainfall in northeast China over the last millennium may have been regulated mainly by the PDO.

AB  - Much of the land available for application of biosolids is cropland near urban areas. Biosolids are often applied on hay or grassland during the growing season or on corn ground before planting or after harvest in the fall. In this study, mesophilic anaerobic digested (MAD) biosolids were applied at 56,000 L/ha on a sandy-loam soil over large containment lysimeters seeded to perennial covers of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), or planted annually to maize (Zea mays L). Portable rainfall simulators were to maintain the lysimeters under a nearly saturated (90%, volumetric basis) conditions. Lysimeter leachate and surface ponded water samples were collected and analyzed for somatic phage, adenoviruses, and anionic (chloride) and microbial (P-22 bacteriophage) tracers. Neither adenovirus nor somatic phage was recovered from the leachate samples. P-22 bacteriophage was found in the leachate of three lysimeters (removal rates ranged from 1.8 to 3.2 log(10)/m). Although the peak of the anionic tracer breakthrough occurred at a similar pore volume in each lysimeter (around 0.3 pore volume) the peak of P-22 breakthrough varied between lysimeters (<0.1, 0.3 and 0.7 pore volume). The early time to peak breakthrough of anionic and microbial tracers indicated preferential flow paths, presumably from soil cracks, root channels, worm holes or other natural phenomena. The concentration of viral contaminants collected in ponded surface water ranged from 1 to 10% of the initial concentration in the applied biosolids. The die off of somatic phage and P-22 in the surface water was fit to a first order decay model and somatic phage reached background level at about day ten. In conclusion, sandy-loam soils can effectively remove/adsorb the indigenous viruses leached from the land-applied biosolids, but there is a potential of viral pollution from runoff following significant rainfall events when biosolids remain on the soil surface.

AB  - Over a historical timescale, landscapes have been strongly affected by fluctuations in climate and by the impact of human societies. This study examines the historical evolution of mid-altitude fluvial systems in the Western Alps and Cevennes (SE Massif Central) in the context of marked climate and anthropogenic change at the end of the Little Ice Age (late 19th century). This work contributes to the reconstruction of river paleodynamics by investigating the nature and chronology of geomorphological changes in upper river basins. In order to produce a detailed reconstruction of hydromorphological changes, we combined two approaches: the study of historical archives and the use of bioindicators (the dating of terraces using dendrochronology and of silt benches using lichenometry in order to reconstruct the evolution of the river channels). The 19th century is a particularly propitious period for the study of surface dynamics because archives have preserved a wealth of qualitative and quantitative data concerning rivers (economic statistics, meteorological and hydrological observations, illustrative documents, descriptions by contemporary observers). It is also a period for which reliable dating methods are available for detrital deposits in rivers. The period provides new information on how the transition between the Little Ice Age and current climate conditions affected the evolution of drainage basins and stream channels by highlighting a succession of phases in the erosive process (e.g., the preparatory role of the drought of 1830-1838 in the erosion crisis of 1855-1870) and refining the chronology of events (very early onset of riverbed incision). The results highlight the effect of climate (small hydroclimatic fluctuations), amplified by strong anthropization, on the rhythm of landscape change and on the relative stabilization of the landscape at the end of the 19th century. In addition, the synchronization of phenomena on the two sides of the Rhone Valley shows that these changes took place on a regional scale. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sedimentation environments were reconstructed for the Early Vendian successions of the western slope of the Central Urals, which comprises one of the most complete sections of the terminal Precambrian system in northern Eurasia. It was shown that, despite the presence of several diamictite levels in the sections of the Serebryanka Group, mature and multiply recycled fine-grained siliciclastic materials (CIA = 65-77) were delivered into the sedimentation basin over the whole Early Vendian. Based on the lithochemical characteristics of shales, the climate of Serebryanka time can be estimated as semiarid-semihumid, similar to that dominating in Late Vendian paleocatchments. Based on relatively high Mo/Mn values (0.011-0.024), it was suggested that anoxic or similar conditions existed in the basin of Buton time, whereas other sedimentary complexes of the Serebryanka Group were formed in well aerated environments. The systematics of Sr, Ba, Zr, Cu, and V in fine-grained siliciclastic rocks and Sr isotopic data for carbonate rocks indicate that the sediments were accumulated in a fresh-water basin. The values of trace-element indicator ratios, e.g., Th/Sc, La/Sc, Th/Cr and others, in the shales of the Serebryanka Group and Nd model age estimates indicate that a variety of mainly Early Proterozoic complexes, ranging from granitoids to basic rocks, occurred in the Early Vendian paleocatchments. The basic rocks were eroded most extensively probably in the end of Serebryanka time. Based on the Ce/Ce* values of shales, it was concluded that submarine volcanism had no significant influence on sedimentation processes in the Early Vendian. An exception is Koiva and Kernos time, when hematite-bearing shales were accumulated in association with pillow basalts in some zones of the basin. The distribution of the compositions of shales from various formations of the Serebryanka Group in discrimination diagrams suggests that the Early Vendian sedimentary sequences were formed in passive geodynamic settings.

AB  - Coastal South Africa draws interdisciplinary interests due to the co-occurrence of a rich record for early human behavioral modernity, hyper-diverse vegetation with very high endemism (the Cape Floral Region), and globally influential oceanic and climate systems. High resolution and continuous climate and environmental records are needed to provide the context for the evolution of behavioral modernity and this diverse flora. Here we present the first such record for climate and environmental change from 90 000 to 53 000 years ago from the southern Cape coast. This important time span covers a burst of expression of several indicators of human behavioral modernity, as well as several key cycles in global climate change. Our research location is ideally placed near the location of several critical archaeological sites, near the boundary of the winter and summer rainfall regimes, and close to isotopically distinct floral zones. We used isotopic analysis of precisely dated speleothems to document shifting vegetation and rainfall, and show that the presence of winter rain and C3 grasses waxes and wanes in response to Southern Hemisphere shifts in SSTs and global temperature. When proxies of global temperatures indicate warmer conditions, delta O-18 and delta C-13 indicate more winter rain and more C3 grasses, respectively, and vice versa. This record displays abrupt and short-term changes previously undocumented. It is often argued that the Cape Floral Region partially owes its high diversity to relative climatic stability. Our record shows isotopic variability that at least matches that displayed in the Levantine Mediterranean system, so climatic stability may not have characterized the south coast. One short-lived phase of human technological innovation (the Still Bay) associated with early evidence for behavioral modernity occurs synchronous with an abrupt environmental perturbation. Early modern humans in this region confronted a variable climate and adapted quickly in a manner similar to behaviorally modern humans. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effects of crystal-plasticity on the U-Th-Pb system in zircon is studied by quantitative microstructural and microchemical analysis of a large zircon grain collected from pyroxenite of the Lewisian Complex, Scotland. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) mapping reveals a c. 18 variation in crystallographic orientation that comprises both a gradual change in orientation and a series of discrete low-angle (< 4 degrees) boundaries. These microstructural data are consistent with crystal-plastic deformation of zircon associated with the formation and migration of dislocations. A heterogeneous pattern of dark cathodoluminescence, with the darkest domains coinciding with low-angle boundaries, mimics the deformation microstructure identified by EBSD. Geochemical data collected using the Sensitive High Resolution Ion MicroProbe ( SHRIMP) shows a positive correlation between concentrations of the elements U, Th and Pb ( ranging from 20 - 60 ppm, 30-110 ppm, and 14 - 36 ppm, respectively) and Th/U ratio (1.13 - 1.8) with the deformation microstructure. The highest measured concentrations and Th/U coincide with low-angle boundaries. This enrichment is interpreted to reflect enhanced bulk diffusion of U and Th due to the formation and migration of high-diffusivity dislocations. Pb-207/Pb-206 ages for individual analyses show no significant variation across the grain, and define a concordant, combined mean age of 2451 +/- 14 Ma. This indicates that the grain was deformed shortly after initial crystallization, most probably during retrograde Inverian metamorphism at amphibolite facies conditions. The elevated Th over U and consistent Pb-207/Pb-206 ages indicates that deformation most likely occurred in the presence of a late-stage magmatic fluid that drove an increase in the Th/U during deformation. The relative enrichment of Th over U implies that Th/U ratio may not always be a robust indicator of crystallization environment. This study provides the first evidence of deformation-related modification of the U-Th system in zircon and has fundamental implications for the application and interpretation of zircon trace element data.

AB  - This paper presents the results of the studies performed from aboard the R/V Akademik Boris Petrov of the Vernadsky Institute of Geochemistry and Analytical Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, in 2002 2004 aimed at surveying the sites of dumping of potentially dangerous objects in Stepovoy, Abrosimov, and Tsivol'ka bays of the Kara Sea. These studies coupled the instrumental facilities of acoustic survey with the visual examination of the objects recovered and also included sampling of the bottom sediments and near-bottom water in the vicinity of the objects and away from them. Subsequently, the samples collected were analyzed using direct gamma spectrometry and radiochemical concentrating selected radionuclides. This allowed us to obtain a statistically reliable database on the specific concentrations of radionuclides ( cesium, strontium, cobalt, and plutonium) in the water column and in the bottom sediments. In selected parts of Stepovoy and Abrosimov bays, at the sites where containers were located, local areas with contaminated bottom sediments were registered in the immediate vicinity of the objects, in which significant concentrations of Cs-137 were detected. We also carried out experiments with the samples of the collected bottom sediments on the determination of the kinetic parameters of sorption in the sediment - solution system using the method of radioactive indicators. Taking into account the hydrological conditions, the results obtained allow one to explain particular features of radioactivity distribution in selected aquatic areas. Based on a comparison between the results of the studies performed in 1992 - 1994 and 2002 - 2004, we estimated the dynamics of the changes in the mean level of specific concentrations of radionuclides in the regions of the location of sunken objects in shallow-water bays of the Novaya Zemlya Archipelago. The registration of elevated concentrations of corrosive elements in the surface layers of the bottom sediments in these zones suggests a necessity of a multidisciplinary study consisting of regular repeated measurements at reference points in different areas aimed at before-the-fact prevention of possible leakages of radioactive substances from the sunken objects, which might result in a significant contamination of the environment.

AB  - Biodiversity issues have gained importance in forestry as a result of the increased awareness of forest landscape changes, but still there is much to do before forest management meets reasonable goals for forest protection and renewal of biodiversity. In this work, we focus on boreal forest landscapes, using Finland as a case study, and taking advantage of a valuable database-the National Forest Inventory (NFI). We explore a multicriteria approach by using a predictive habitat suitability model for three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactyius) based on Weights-of-Evidence (WofE) and a combination of remote sensing and field data derived from the Multisource Finnish National Forest Inventory (MS-NFI). The WofE model is a quantitative method used for combining evidence to examine the support for a given hypothesis. WE involves the estimation of a response variable (favourability for certain habitat occurrence) and a set of predictor variables (e.g. GIS layers containing environmental variables). WE is based on a log-linear form of Bayes' rule and uses the prior probability distribution and the likelihood of the data to generate a posterior probability distribution.
   Very few examples exist of WbfE being used to predict the spatial distribution of species or communities using biophysical descriptors. This work explores WofE as a tool for rapid biodiversity assessment using georeferenced species information. Since the method is dependent of the indicator species used as a surrogate of biodiversity value it can be applied for assessing biodiversity conditions of both managed and protected areas to help decision-making concerning protection of valuable habitats. Thus, the map of habitat suitability; represented as a range of probabilities of occurrence, offers an objective framework for evaluating the outcomes of different scenarios. Similarly, an objective assessment of habitat suitability provides a rational basis for management decisions incorporating impact on species habitat.

AB  - Background and Aims Root hair density (i.e. the number of root hairs per unit root length) in arabidopsis thaliana varies among individual plants in response to different nutrient stresses. The degree of such variation. defined as inequality, serves as a unique indicator of the uniformity of response within a plant population to nutrient availability.
   Methods Using the Gini coefficient (G) as an inequality index. the inequality of root hair density in Arabidopsis thaliana 'Columbia' was evaluated under conditions of nutrient stresses: in particular the effect of phosphorus and its interaction with ethylene.
   Key Results With decreasing phosphorus concentration. root hair density increased while inequality decreased logarithmically. The addition of the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) under high phosphorus increased root hair density and decreased inequality by 7-fold. Inhibition of ethylene action with 1-methylcyclopropene (MCP) and silver thiosulphate (STS) under lose phosphorus decreased root hair density. and increased inequality by 9-fold and 4 fold, respectively. The ethylene action inhibitors had little effect on root hair density under high phosphorus, but inequality increased 3-fold in the presence of MCP and decreased 2-fold in the presence of STS. Compared with the control, deficiencies in S, N and K increased inequality of root hair density, whereas deficiencies in P. Ca. B. Mn. Fe. Zn. Cu and Mg decreased inequality. In particular. the inequality of root hair density increased by over 2-fold under deficiencies of N or K. but decreased 14-fold under phosphorus deficiency.
   Conclusions The inequality analysis indicates a strong correlation between prevalent signals front the environment (i.e. phosphorus stress) and the response of the plant, and the role of ethylene in this response. As the environmental signals become stronger, art increasing proportion of individuals respond, resulting in a decrease in variation in responsiveness anion g individual plants as indicated by reduced inequality.

AB  - The objective of this review was to explore the relationship between lactational performance and health. We focused on lactational incidence rates (LIR) of the production diseases that are of economic importance to the dairy industry. Based on a review of I I epidemiological and 14 genetic studies we found little evidence that high yielding cows have increased risk of dystocia, retained placenta, metritis and left-displaced abomasum. Results for periparturient paresis were inconsistent. Whilst we found no phenotypical relationship between milk yield and the risk of ketosis and lameness, selection for higher milk yields will probably increase LIR for these diseases. Mastitis was the only disease where there was a clear relationship between milk yield and risk of infection. Continued selection for higher milk yields will worsen this situation. However, our overall conclusion is that reviewing existing literature, even with a structured literature selection, is inadequate to the task of elucidating the relationship between lactational performance and risk of production diseases. There are substantial problems with confounding effects and unaccounted for biological correlations. In the second part of the review we argue towards a common basis for addressing production diseases. We propose abnormal body mobilisation and immune competence as common currencies for metabolic and immune status and argue for the development of indicators of metabolic imbalance and the early development of diseases. Furthermore, we suggest the use of indicators of 'imbalance' to guide feeding according to the needs of individual cows with their specific genotype and management history. We believe that this approach has the potential to provide new diagnostic and decision support tools to improve animal health and reproduction, whilst simultaneously maintaining optimal production and efficiency. Further research is needed to identify and validate new indicators and individual feeding strategies. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier BY. All rights reserved.

AB  - The calcium ion serves many major roles in cellular processes, and therefore, its specific role in the regrowth of neurites after transection has been difficult to define. In the present study the effect of calcium on regrowth of transected rat superior cervical ganglion neurons in culture independent of its effects on neuronal survival was examined. Superior cervical ganglion neurons in culture for 10-14 days were preloaded with the calcium chelator 1.2 bis-(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM), and then the neurites were transected. The chelation of calcium inhibited the initiation of regrowth, and also decreased the number of branches in the regrowing neurite. In a second experiment, neurites were transected in zero calcium medium to eliminate calcium influx, and no regrowth was observed for up to 6 h after transection. At this time the medium was changed to 1.8 mM calcium, and the neurites showed regrowth 2 h afterwards. After neurite transection in 1.8 mm calcium there was a rise in calcium in the soma demonstrated with the calcium indicator dye Fluo-3 AM. This rise was attenuated with BAPTA-AM preloading or transection in zero calcium medium. Cultures were also grown in compartmented chambers which allowed isolation of the cell body from the neurite environment, and then the neurites were transected with the neurites in 1.8 mM calcium medium, and the cell bodies immersed in zero calcium medium. Under these conditions the majority of neurons showed a marked delay of initiation of regrowth.
   From these data we suggest the following about mammalian neurite regrowth after transection. (1) Calcium is necessary for the initiation of regeneration. (2) Calcium entry at the cell body is necessary for optimal initiation of neurite regrowth. (3) Intracellular calcium is necessary for the branching of regrowing neurites, (C) 2001 IBRO.

AB  - Syringodium filiforme does not exhibit physiological compensation as a function of season. This has important implications with respect to the diversity and spatial distribution of seagrass species, with Syringodium-like physiological characteristics, that are exposed to chronic low light conditions common to estuarine environments. Adult Syringodium filiforme plants were sampled at bimonthly intervals between August 1996 and August 1997 from a site in Lower Laguna Madre, Texas with a mean depth of similar to 1.2 m. Photosynthesis-irradiance (PI) experiments were conducted at ambient temperatures, in conjunction with measurements of reaction center density and size, to characterize photosynthetic apparatus structure and performance. Values for relative quantum yield (alpha; O-2 evolved per incident photon), compensation point (I-c), saturation point (I-k), dark respiration (R-d) and light-saturated photosynthesis (P-max), collected during late summer 1996, exhibited no significant differences from those collected in late spring 1997. Changes in pigment concentration, exhibiting no distinct seasonal pattern, were manifested in adjustments of both photosystem density and size. Densities for photosystem I (PSI) were highest during winter months (ca. 0.5 pmol mm(-3)); densities for photosystem II (PSII) exhibited no seasonal trend, ranging from 0.2 to 0.7 pmol mm(-3) Little variation was noted regarding the size of PSI (PSUP700), whereas, size estimates for PSII (PSUO2) were largest during winter and early-spring (ca. 5400 Chl-a P680(-1)). These data indicate that S. filiforme may have some capacity for altering photosynthetic apparatus structure. However, since alpha, I-c and I-k did not change with season, the benefit of such adjustments is not obvious. We suggest photophysiological parameters may not be reliable indicators of environmental stress in Syringodium filiforme, as this species does not exhibit a great potential for phenotypic plasticity. This work serves as a basis for future studies designed to address physiological compensation in seagrasses and the ability of coastal macrophytes to respond to environmental change (e.g. reductions in light availability).

AB  - The following oxygen-isotope fractionation factors for the gibbsite-water system (alpha(g-w)) have been obtained from a series of twenty-two synthesis experiments: 1.0119 +/- 0.0005 (51 +/- 2-degrees-C); 1.0144 +/- 0.0003 (25 +/- 0.1-degree-C); 1.0139 +/- 0.0003 (22-degrees-C +/- 2-degrees-C); and 1.0162 +/- 0.0012 (8 +/- 2-degrees-C). Isotopic equilibrium is considered to have been reached in the majority of cases because of the coincidence of results for syntheses using several different techniques. All three polymorphs of Al(OH)3, namely, gibbsite, bayerite, and nordstrandite, were identified in the synthesis products.
   Partial dissolution techniques have been applied to samples from twelve bauxite deposits to obtain the deltaO-18 value of both gibbsite and kaolinite. These data, plus previously published results, have been used to calculate alpha(g-w) values, using two independent methods: (1) by comparison with the deltaO-18 value of associated kaolinite, and (2) by comparison with the deltaO-18 value of local meteoric waters. The results show a spread of values from those obtained by synthesis experiments to values up to approximately 6parts per thousand higher. It is concluded that the spread of values is real and the deltaO-18 value of gibbsite is dependent upon its formation mechanism.
   It is suggested that the gibbsite samples which exhibit high alpha(g-w) values have either obtained their isotopic signature by inheritance during the desilication of kaolinite, or from exchange with oxygen-bearing anions such as sulphate, during the transport of aluminum as Al-OH complexes. The possibility that the high values are the result of evaporative modification of the fluid prior to gibbsite precipitation cannot be ruled out, but is unlikely, given that humid conditions are required for bauxite formation. Such conclusions suggest that the oxygen isotope composition of gibbsite is unsuitable as a palaeoclimatic indicator but may prove useful in providing genetic information on bauxite formation.

AB  - Carbon sequestration is a key soil function, and an increase in soil organic carbon (SOC) is an indicator of ecosystem recovery because it underpins other ecosystem services by acting as a substrate for the soil microbial community. The soil microbial community constitutes the active pool of SOC, and its necromass (microbial residue carbon, MRC) contributes strongly to the stable SOC pool. Therefore, we propose that the potential for restoration of degraded karst ecosystems lies in the abundance of soil microbial community and the persistence of its necromass, and may be measured by changes in its contribution to the active and stable SOC pools during recovery. We investigated changes in SOC stocks using an established space-for-time chronosequence along a perturbation gradient in the subtropical karst ecosystem: sloping cropland < abandoned cropland < shrubland < secondary forest < primary forest. Microbial biomarkers were extracted from soil profiles from surface to bedrock and used to measure the contributions of the soil microbial community composition (using phospholipid fatty acids, PLFAs) and MRC (using amino sugars) to SOC stocks at each recovery stage. The results showed that the SOC stocks ranged from 10.53 to 31.77 kg m(-2) and increased with recovery stage, with total MRC accounting for 17-28% of SOC. Increasing PLFAs and MRC abundances were positively correlated with improved soil structure (decreased bulk density) and organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient. Bacterial MRC contributes more to SOC stocks than fungal residue carbon during vegetation recovery. The PLFA analysis indicated that Gram positive bacteria were the largest microbial group and were relatively more abundant in deeper soils, and biomarkers for saprophytic and ectomycorrhizal fungi were more abundant in soils under woody vegetation. In conclusion, this study suggests that the soil microbial community in karst soils have the potential to adapt to changing soil conditions and contribute substantially to building SOC stocks after abandonment of agriculture in degraded karst landscapes.

AB  - Objectives: The relationship between poverty and health has been well addressed in public health research. The health effects of social and economic inequalities on working groups have also drawn the attention of occupational health scholars. Research addressing workers in low-paying jobs showed increased risks for poor health. This research examined the psychosocial factors associated with poor mental health and self-rated health among low-income bakery workers performing demanding tasks.
   Methods: Face-to-face interviews in 504 randomly selected bakeries in Lebanon provided data on socio-demographics, perception of the workplace environment, job security, job satisfaction, general health, and mental health.
   Results: In total, 16.5% of bakery workers reported poor self-rated health, and 45% reported poor mental health. Workers with a chronic illness were almost three times more likely to report poor self-rated health (OR = 2.86; 95% CI = 1.44-5.67), and those with musculoskeletal pain reported poor self-rated health five times as often (OR = 5.34; 95% CI = 2.9-9.80). Those with a chronic illness and musculoskeletal pain were twice as likely to report poor mental health (OR = 1.94; 95% CI = 1.07-3.50 and OR = 2.07; 95% CI = 1.32-3.23, respectively); and those dissatisfied with their job reported poorer self-rated health (OR = 2.18; 95% CI = 1.12-4.23) and mental health (OR = 2.57; 95% CI = 1.54-4.26). In addition, workers reporting job insecurity had poor mental health twice as often (OR = 1.93; 95% CI = 1.24-2.99). Low socioeconomic indicators showed a gradient association with both poor self-rated health and mental health.
   Conclusion: Reporting job dissatisfaction and insecurity, musculoskeletal pain, and chronic illness were associated with poor mental and self-rated health among bakery workers. Interventions to improve the working conditions of bakery workers are timely and essential. This research provided evidence for policy to guide occupational health practice and safeguard the health of bakery workers.

AB  - Recent climate changes have elicited diverse phenological shifts in the ecosystems of the Northern Hemisphere (NH), with changes in the end growth of season (EOS) varying considerably with time. Due to the anthropogenic forcing (e.g. anthropogenic radiative forcing, a al.), both the climate conditions and EOS greatly changed since 2000, but the relationship between the two remains unclear. To better understand the responses of EOS to climate change with time, we used Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and temperature, precipitation, and cloud cover during 1982-2000 and 2001-2015 separately, aiming to identify and quantify the spatiotemporal distributions of drivers of EOS across different biomes over the NH ( > 30 degrees). Considering separately these two distinct periods, we found that beginning in the 21st century both the proportion of positive significant pixels (increased by 9.2%) as well as the sensitivity (1.5 +/- 4.3 day degrees C -1 vs. 2.7 +/- 7.9 day degrees C-1) of the temperature vs. EOS relationship had increased. Precipitation affected EOS over a slightly increase area during these two periods, but the sensitivity decreased. Conversely, we found that the sensitivity of EOS to light availability increased for most of biomes, whereas the areas influenced increased by 7.9%. With respect to the sign of relationships between EOS and its drivers, we found that for high latitude regions (i.e., boreal forests and tundra), precipitation advanced EOS during 2001-2015 but delayed EOS during 1982-2000. Although precipitation has significant correlations for a larger area than temperature, its sensitivity was lower. Our results imply that the relative magnitude and sign of drivers of EOS has changed substantially over time and space. Improved representation of these dynamic changes will advance understanding of future climate change on plant phenology by ecosystem models.

AB  - The natural convection of a Nano Encapsulated Phase Change Materials (NEPCMs) suspension in a cavity with a hot wall having a time-periodic temperature is investigated. The top and bottom walls of the enclosure are insulated, the right side wall is kept at a constant temperature of T-c while the left side wall is considered as hot wall and is subjected to a time-periodic temperature. The NEPCM consist of capsules with phase change material PCM in their core. The phase change core of the capsules is covered by a shell. During the fusion or the solidification of the core, the phase change will absorb or release heat in the surrounding, when the temperature is close to the PCM fusion temperature. The partial differential equations governing the flow and heat transfer in the enclosure are formulated in the dimensionless form, and affective key dimensionless numbers and parameters are introduced. The finite element method is used to solve the governing equations. The accuracy of the results is verified by comparison to the benchmark solutions available in the literature. The average Nusselt number in the enclosure, as an indicator of the heat transfer performance, is analyzed. It is shown that the average Nusselt number in the enclosure follows a periodic variation with the same frequency of the temperature of the hot wall and with an amplitude that varies correspondingly with the temperature amplitude. The heat transfer in the cavity is enhanced when a higher fraction phi of the NEPCM is used, and a fraction of 5% provides the highest heat transfer. Increasing the volume fraction of nanoparticles from 2.5% to 5% enhanced the average Nusselt number by 21% and the maximum value of Nusselt number by 18.5%. The fusion temperature of nanocapsules is an important parameter affecting the thermal performance of the enclosure, mainly, when the fusion temperature is notably different from cold or hot-wall temperatures.

AB  - Ventilation rates were continuously monitored from 1 March 2012 to 13 May 2013 in two cage-free layer houses in California. The average number of brown Lohmann laying hens in each house was 33,300. Temperature, relative humidity, static pressure, and running status of 48 ventilation fans were continuously monitored and recorded every minute. Regression models were developed to relate house temperature and ventilation rate to inlet air temperature and to relate airflow rate to building static pressure (R-2 = 0.98). Results showed that the daily mean ventilation rate per hen ranged from 1.91 to 8.72 m(3) h(-1) hen(-1), averaging 4.49 +/- 1.53 m(3) h(-1) hen(-1). The standard uncertainty of daily mean ventilation rate was determined to be 3.7%. The 91 cm and 130 cm fans were found to perform at 82% and 63% of the manufacturer-rated airflow rates, respectively. Minimum and maximum static pressures were 11.0 and 50.6 Pa, respectively, corresponding to 2 and 16 running tunnel fans. When the house temperature exceeded 30 degrees C, an evaporative cooling system was activated, which could reduce the inlet air temperature by 6.3 degrees C and concurrently increased the indoor air humidity ratio by 3.4 g per kg dry air. Cooling pad efficiency was 66%. The sidewall fans and tunnel fans were operated at 65% and 20%, respectively, of the total time when layers occupied the houses. A new rational formula for calculating dry base ventilation rate was developed based on the ratio of water vapor volume to moist air volume. The developed models and data collected in this research can be used to calculate the ventilation rates in cage-free layer houses to ensure the healthy conditions needed for laying hens. The models and data can also be used in the design of cage-free houses and in calculating emissions of air pollutants from these houses.

AB  - Since the beginning of the Holocene, people have occupied the Central-south Brazilian coast, as it was a very productive estuarine environment. Living as fishers and mollusc gatherers, they built prehistoric shellmounds known as sambaquis, which can still be found today, constituting an important testimony of palaeodiversity and Brazilian prehistory. The aim of this research is to describe and characterize phytoliths from "Sambaqui da Tarioba", a shellmound situated in Rio das Ostras (Rio de Janeiro) in order to infer palaeoenvironmental information. The soil was delayered by artificial 10 cm sections which revealed five archaeological stratigraphic layers. A sample of mollusc shells (Iphigenia brasiliana) for each of these layers was used for dating based on C-14 method. Phytoliths were classified and counted by different types. Data analysis was done using phytoliths tree cover density (D/P) and drought stress (Bi%) indices and also a Principal Component Analysis for all registered variables. Previous dating results indicated an occupation period of about 500 years for the "Sambaqui da Tarioba". Regarding phytoliths, D/P index suggests a forest vegetation, and Bi% values indicate a strong drought stress. PCA analysis done using phytolith types, presence of charcoal, spicules of sponges and frustules of diatoms as well as age and deepness of the archaeological stratigraphic layers revealed three different groups (S1; S4 and S2-S3-S5), that are explained by the first and second components responsible for 70% of all variation in the data. In conclusion, the analysis of phytolith composition of the Tarioba shell mound indicated that the surrounding vegetation to this archaeological site around 3530(130)/3890(140) cal years BP consisted of dry forest. Although most of the data has indicated stability of the floristic and environmental conditions in this period, the PCA analysis indicated some changes overtime. Despite the many biases associated with information based on shell mounds, they are good data repositories on biodiversity and Late Holocene environments.

AB  - The aim of the study was to assess whether ichthyofauna variability follows the natural downstream gradient or the degradation gradient, and to assess the bioindication potential of fish zonation. The study was conducted along the entire length (795km) of the lowland Warta River, Poland, wherein the complexity of the ecotone zone and availability of hiding places for fish decreased downstream. The catchment of the middle course carried a heavy load of pollutants. In the lower course, groynes were common, the channel width exceeded 100 m and the mean discharge reached 210 m(3)/s. In 2011-2012, single-run electrocatches of fish and lampreys were performed at 73 sites, generally while wading along 100 m long reaches of both riverbanks (farthest upper course, depth <= 0.6 m) or drifting in a boat along a 500 m riverbank stretch (in the remaining river parts). An indicator species analysis allowed identification of species associated significantly with particular river sections: one (a rheophil) in the source fragment (S1), seven (all rheophilic) in the upper course (S2), three in the middle course (S3), and nine (including three rheophils) in the lower course (S4). On this basis, the S1 was classified as an impoverished grayling zone, S2 as a barbel zone, and S4 as the bream zone. Section S3 remained unclassified, as its ichthyofauna was in the worst condition due to: (i) the strong destabilizing upstream impact of the Jeziorsko dam reservoir, (ii) large amounts of wastewater discharged from towns located in the catchment area of this section and (iii) the lack of unpolluted tributaries that could serve as sources of recolonizers. In summary, in the human-modified Warta River, the variability of fish assemblages followed a degradation gradient, which was also reflected in the disturbed fish zonation. Consequently, this study confirms the usefulness of a fish fauna zonation analysis for the bioindication of large-scale human impacts in rivers.

AB  - Shifting cultivation (jhum) is a major land use practice in Mizoram. It was considered as an eco-friendly and efficient method when the cycle duration was long (15-30 years), but it poses the problem of land degradation and threat to ecology when shortened (4-5 years) due to increased intensification of farming systems. Studying beetle community structure is very helpful in understanding how shifting cultivation affects the biodiversity features compared to natural forest system. The present study examines the beetle species diversity and estimates the effects of shifting cultivation practices on the beetle assemblages in relation to change in tree species composition and soil nutrients. Scarabaeidae and Carabidae were observed to be the dominant families in the land use systems studied. Shifting cultivation practice significantly (P < 0.05) affected the beetle and tree species diversity as well as the soil nutrients as shown by univariate (one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), correlation and regression, diversity indices) and multivariate (cluster analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), canonical variate analysis (CVA), permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), permutational multivariate analysis of dispersion (PERMDISP)) statistical analyses. Besides changing the tree species composition and affecting the soil fertility, shifting cultivation provides less suitable habitat conditions for the beetle species. Bioindicator analysis categorized the beetle species into forest specialists, anthropogenic specialists (shifting cultivation habitat specialist), and habitat generalists. Molecular analysis of bioindicator beetle species was done using mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) marker to validate the beetle species and describe genetic variation among them in relation to heterogeneity, transition/transversion bias, codon usage bias, evolutionary distance, and substitution pattern. The present study revealed the fact that shifting cultivation practice significantly affects the beetle species in terms of biodiversity pattern as well as evolutionary features. Spatiotemporal assessment of soil-plant-beetle interactions in shifting cultivation system and their influence in land degradation and ecology will be helpful in making biodiversity conservation decisions in the near future.

AB  - Main conclusion This paper provides new insights into source-sink relationships and transpiration processes which will eventually help to interpret delta O-18 as a genotype selection and ecophysiological tool for maize adaptation to drought.
   Oxygen isotope composition (delta O-18) has been proposed as a phenotyping tool to integrate leaf transpiration in C-4 crops, such as maize. Within this context we hypothesize that delta O-18 in leaves may reflect primarily environmental and genetic variability in evaporative processes, but that this signal may become dampened in transit from source to sink tissues. The aim of this study was to assess the relative importance of transpirative or translocation-related factors affecting delta O-18 in plant tissues of maize. We performed two water regime experiments, one with two varieties under semi-controlled conditions, and another in the field with 100 genotypes during two consecutive years. The delta O-18 in organic matter at the leaf base was strongly correlated with the delta O-18 in stem water, indicating that it could be a good proxy for source water in extensive samplings. Compared to leaves, we observed an O-18 depletion in silks and grains, but not in stem-soluble organic matter. We interpret this as evidence of exchange with unenriched water from source to sink, but mainly occurring within sink tissues. Although grain yield (GY) and physiological variables did not show clear intra-trial patterns against delta O-18, the only tissues that correlated with GY in the linear regression approach were that of silks, giving an insight of evapotranspirative demand during female flowering and thus of potential maize lines that are better adapted to drought. This finding will eventually help to interpret delta O-18 as a genotype selection and ecophysiological tool for the adaption of maize and other crops to drought, offering insight into source-sink relationships and transpiration processes.

AB  - Rising demand on food is leading to an increase in irrigation worldwide to improve productivity. Irrigation, for pastoral agriculture (beef, dairy and sheep), is-the largest consumptive use of water in New Zealand. There is a potential risk of leaching of microbial contaminants from faecal matter through the vadose zone into groundwater. Management of irrigation is vital for protection of groundwater from these microbial contaminants and maintain efficient irrigation practices. Our research investigated flood and spray irrigation, two practices common in New Zealand. The aim was to identify the risk of microbial transport and mitigation practices to reduce or eliminate the risk of microbial transport into groundwater. Cowpats were placed on lysimeters over a typical New Zealand soil (Lismore silt loam) and vadose zone and the leachate collected after irrigation events. Samples of both cowpats and leachate were analysed for the microbial indicator Escherichia coil and pathogen Campylobacter species.
   A key driver to the microbial transport derived from the model applied was the volume of leachate collected: doubling the leachate volume more than doubled the total recovery of E. coli. The persistence of E. coli in the cowpats during the experiment is an important factor as well as the initial environmental conditions, which were more favourable for survival and growth of E. coli during the spray irrigation compared with the flood irrigation. The results also suggest a reservoir of E. coli surviving in the soil. Although the same was potentially true for Campylobacter, little difference in the transport rates between irrigation practices could be seen due to the poor survival of Campylobacter during the experiment. Effective irrigation practices include monitoring the irrigation rates to minimise leachate production, delaying irrigation until 14 days post-cowpat deposition and only irrigating when risk of transport to the groundwater is minimal.
   Aim: To compare the risk of microbial contamination of groundwater from cowpats using two irrigation practices onto pasture. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ancient lakes, which are important centres of biodiversity and endemism, are threatened by a wide variety of human impacts. To assess environmental impact on ancient Lake Ohrid we have taken short sediment cores from two contrasting site locations, comprising a site of urban pollution and an apparently pristine area. Recent impacts on water quality and ecology were assessed using sediment, geochemical, ostracode, and diatom data derived from analysis of two Pb-210-dated sediment cores spanning the period from 1918 to 2009. According to the index of geoaccumulation, sediments were often moderately contaminated with As. Fe and Ni concentrations often exceeded reported maximum limits above which harmful effects on sediment-dwelling organisms are expected. Productivity in the (pristine) south-eastern part of Lake Ohrid (Sveti Naum) is generally lower than in the north, probably due to the strong influence of spring discharge. Low ostracode and diatom concentrations, low abundance of the epilimnetic diatom Cyclotella ocellata, and low values of TOC and TIC indicate a lower productivity from the early 1920s to the late 1980s. Since the mid 1970s, increased relative abundance of C. ocellata and increasing diatom concentration indicate increasing productivity in the south-eastern part. Rising numbers of ostracode valves and higher TIC and TOC contents in both sediment cores indicate an increase in productivity during the late 1980s. A slight increase in productivity near Sveti Naum continued from the early 1990s until 2009, witnessed by rising TC, TIC, and TOC content and a generally high number of ostracode valves and ostracode diversity. The area near the City of Struga (site of urban pollution) is also characterized by rising TOC and TIC contents and, furthermore, by increasing Cu, Fe, Pb, and Zn concentrations since the early 1990s. The recent reduction in the number of ostracode valves and ostracode diversity is probably caused by a higher heavy metal load into the lake. This suggests that living conditions for the endemic species in Lake Ohrid have become less favourable in the northern part of the lake, which might threaten the unique flora and fauna of Lake Ohrid.

AB  - Few studies have verified the validity of behavioral and physiological methods of pain assessment in cattle. This prospective, blinded, randomized controlled experimental study aimed to validate different methods of pain assessment during acute and chronic (up to 21 d postintervention) conditions in dairy cattle, in response to 3 analgesic treatments for traumatic reticuloperitonitis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and mechanical sensitization were measured as indicators of centralized pain. Proteomics in the CSF were examined to detect specific (to pain intensity) and sensitive (responsive to analgesia) markers. Recordings of spontaneous behavior with video analysis, telemetered motor activity, pain scales, electrodermal activity, and plasma cortisol concentration were quantified at regular intervals. Cows were assigned to group 1 (n = 4, standard control receiving aspirin), group 2 (n = 5, test group receiving preemptive tolfenamic acid), or group 3 (n = 3, positive control receiving preemptive multimodal analgesia composed of epidural morphine, plus tolfenamic acid and butorphanol). Rescue analgesia was administered as needed. Generalized estimating equations tested group differences and the influence of rescue analgesia on the measurements. All 3 groups demonstrated a long-term decrease in a CSF protein identified as transthyretin. The decrease in transthyretin expression inversely correlated with the expected level of analgesia (group 1 < 2 < 3). Moreover, in group 1, CSF noradrenaline decreased long term, cows were hypersensitive to mechanical stimulation, and they demonstrated signs of discomfort with higher motor activity and "agitation while lying" recorded from video analysis. Decreased "feeding behavior," observer-reported pain scales, electrodermal activity, and plasma cortisol concentration were inconsistent to differentiate pain intensity between groups. In summary, changes in CSF biomarkers and mechanical sensitization reflected modulation of central pain in dairy cows. The spontaneous behavior "agitation while lying" was the only behavioral outcome validated for assessing acute and chronic pain in this visceral pain model.

AB  - 1. The number of offshore wind farms is rapidly increasing as they are a critical part of many countries' renewable energy strategies. Quantifying the likely impacts of these developments on wildlife is a fundamental part of the impact assessments required in many regions before permission for developments is granted. A key concern related to wind turbines is the risk of birds colliding with turbine blades. We present a novel method to generate species-specific flight height distributions which can be used to improve the assessment of collision risk by better reflecting the proportion of in-flight populations at risk of collision.
   2. Data describing the flight heights of birds from surveys of 32 potential offshore wind farm development sites were combined to estimate continuous distributions for 25 marine bird species. Observations of flying birds assigned to discrete height categories were treated as observations from independent multinomial distributions with a shared underlying continuous distribution. This analysis enables calculation of the uncertainty around the estimates of the proportion of the in-flight population at risk and consideration of different turbine designs.
   3. The mean r(2) for model fit across species was 085, and for seven of the species, good independent model validation (80% of independent observations within 95% confidence intervals) provides some confidence for use of the results at alternative sites.
   4. All species exhibited positively skewed flight height distributions. These results demonstrate that under the conditions in which the data were collected, raising hub height and using fewer, larger turbines are effective measures for reducing collision risk.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The methods presented here for modelling continuous flight height distributions provide measures of uncertainty and enable comparison of collision risk between different turbine designs. This approach will improve the accuracy of impact assessments and provide estimates of uncertainty, allowing better evidence to inform decision-making.

AB  - Vegetative filter strips (VFS) are proposed for protection of receiving water bodies and aquatic organisms from pesticides in runoff, but there is debate regarding the efficiency and filter size requirements. This debate is largely due to the belief that no quantitative methodology exists for predicting runoff buffer efficiency when conducting acute and/or chronic environmental exposure assessments. Previous research has proposed a modeling approach that links the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) PRZM/EXAMS with a well-tested process-based model for VFS (VFSMOD). In this research, we apply the modeling framework to determine (1) the most important input factors for quantifying mass reductions of pesticides by VFS in aquatic exposure assessments relative to three distinct U.S. EPA scenarios encompassing a wide range of conditions; (2) the expected range in percent reductions in acute and chronic estimated environmental concentrations (EECs); and (3) the differential influence of VFS when conducting acute versus chronic exposure assessments. This research utilized three, 30-yr U.S. EPA scenarios: Illinois corn, California tomato, and Oregon wheat. A global sensitivity analysis (GSA) method identified the most important input factors based on discrete uniform probability distributions for five input factors: VFS length (VL), organic-carbon sorption coefficient (K-oc), half-lives in both water and soil phases, and application timing. For percent reductions in acute and chronic EECs, VL and application timing were consistently the most important input factors independent of EPA scenario. The potential ranges in acute and chronic EECs varied as a function of EPA scenario and application timing. Reductions in acute EECs were typically less than percent reductions in chronic EECs because acute exposure was driven primarily by large individual rainfall and runon events. Importantly, generic specification of VFS design characteristics equal across scenarios should be avoided. The revised pesticide assessment modeling framework offers the ability to elucidate the complex and non-linear relationships that can inform targeted VFS design specifications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In regions of intensive pig and dairy farming, nutrient losses to the environment at farm level are a source of concern for water and air quality. Dynamic models are useful tools to evaluate the effects of production strategies on nutrient flows and losses to the environment. This paper presents the development of a new whole-farm model upscaling dynamic models developed at the field or animal scale. The model, called MELODIE, is based on an original structure with interacting biotechnical and decisional modules. Indeed, it is supported by an ontology of production systems and the associated programming platform DIESE. The biotechnical module simulates the nutrient flows in the different animal, soil and crops and manure sub-models. The decision module relies on an annual optimization of cropping and spreading allocation plans, and on the flexible execution of activity plans for each simulated year These plans are examined every day by an operational management sub-model and their application is context dependent As a result, MELODIE dynamically simulates the flows of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, copper, zinc and water within the whole farm over the short and long-term considering both the farming system and its adaptation to climatic conditions. Therefore, it is possible to study both the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the environmental risks, and to test changes of practices and innovative scenarios. This is illustrated with one example of simulation plan on dairy farms to interpret the Nitrogen farm-gate budget indicator It shows that this indicator is able to reflect small differences in Nitrogen losses between different systems, but it can only be interpreted using a mobile average, not on a yearly basis. This example illustrates how MELODIE could be used to study the dynamic behaviour of the system and the dynamic of nutrient flows. Finally, MELODIE can also be used for comprehensive multi-criterion assessments, and it also constitutes a generic and evolving framework for virtual experimentation on animal farming systems.

AB  - The advection initiative ADVEX within CarboEurope-IP conducted advection experiments at three European coniferous sites in 2005 and 2006. All experiments shared the same geometry and instrumentation. Data of the AD VEX experiments were used to calculate advective fluxes of carbon dioxide and sensible heat using exactly the same method. However, the advective flux of sensible heat can be assessed more easily than the carbon dioxide flux with its associated complex measurements of gas concentrations. We explored the possibility to use advective fluxes of sensible heat as a proxy for the corresponding flux of carbon dioxide despite somewhat differing sinks and sources. On average, advective fluxes of sensible heat were of opposite sign in relation to the advective fluxes of carbon dioxide for the three investigated sites, especially during nighttime. Therefore, the respective gradients were of opposite sign, on average, for vertical and (to a lesser extent) horizontal direction. This is not as obvious for horizontal direction as for the vertical direction. A scheme is presented to explain the correlation of the respective gradients for different conditions. Based on the gained insights and regression statistics, two simple empirical models were tested to derive advective fluxes of carbon dioxide from advective fluxes of sensible heat. Our results suggest that the advective flux of sensible heat could be taken as an indicator concerning the presence and sign of carbon dioxide advection. However, the suitability of advective fluxes of sensible heat as a quantitative proxy for advective fluxes of carbon dioxide is more problematic because the representativeness including the magnitude of advection derived from advection measurements is not yet clarified. An inspection of the budget of sensible heat and carbon dioxide revealed considerable changes by advection. The results indicate that the budget of carbon dioxide might be generally more affected by the investigated non-turbulent advective fluxes than the budget of sensible heat. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Talus flatiron sequences are ubiquitous landforms in arid and semiarid regions characterized by horizontal erodible rocks capped by more resistant rocks. Alternating phases of deposition and erosion lead to the formation of generations of talus flatirons in which ancient ones are located farther from the source cliff. The existing conceptual model of this systematic spatial distribution of talus flatirons is related to glacial-interglacial climatic cycles and to relatively high rates of cliff retreat. Three groups of talus flatirons were analyzed in the northeastern hyperarid Negev desert. The analyses include mapping, age determination using optically stimulated luminescence and cosmogenic nuclide exposure dating, electrical resistivity tomography and sedimentological and soil analyses. All talus flatirons contain gypsic-salic soil catena typical to hyperarid climate (< 80 mm yr(-1)). No pedogenic indicators of past wetter environments such as buried calcic soil horizons, evidence of intense biogenic activity, or buried organic material were observed. Be-10 exposure ages of the talus flatirons suggest that they were deposited during the middle Pleistocene; similar to 610 ka and similar to 170 ka for the oldest and intermediate-aged talus flatiron groups, respectively. These ages, combined with the present location of the talus flatirons relative to the source cliff yield retreat rates of 6-12 and similar to 200 m Ma(-1) for the bedrock cliff and talus flatiron apex, respectively, and in opposite directions. Our results show that (a) climatic changes at glacial-interglacial time scales are not the main controls over the formation of talus flatiron generation, and (b) that significant cliff retreat is not the main cause for the systematic spatial distribution of talus flatiron generations relative to the cliff. Our results indicate that the process of talus flatiron formation in the Negev desert must be associated with the balance between production, deposition, and removal of clasts under hyperarid conditions with only a minor cliff retreat.

AB  - The impact and frequency of forest harvesting could significantly affect soil microbial community (SMC) structure and functioning. The ability of soil microorganisms to perform biogeochemical processes is critical for sustaining forest productivity and has a direct impact on decomposition dynamics and carbon storage potential. The Wind River Canopy Crane Research Forest in SW, WA, provided a unique opportunity to study a forest chronosequence and the residual effects of harvesting on the SMC in comparison to old-growth forests. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of clear-cutting and stand age on temporal dynamics of SMC and physiological stress markers using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiling. Soil microbial PLFA profiles were determined seven times over 22 months (Nov. 02 to Sep. 04) in old-growth coniferous forest stands (300-500 years) and 8 (CC8)- or 25 (CC25)year-old replanted clear-cuts. PLFA patterns of the SMC shifted because of clear-cutting, but seasonal temporal changes had greater shifts than differences among stand age. The microbial biomass (total PLFA) and bacterial, fungal, and selected other PLFAs were significantly reduced in CC8 but not in CC25 sites relative to the old-growth sites. An increase in stress indicators [PLFA ratios of saturated/monsaturated and (cy17: 0+cy19: 0)/(16: 1 omega 7+18: 1 omega 7)] in late summer was related to water stress. Although the canopy and litter input are quite different for a 25-year clear-cut compared to virgin old-growth forest, we conclude that the composition of the microbial communities, 25 years after clear-cutting, has recovered sufficiently to be much more similar to old-growth forests than a recent clear-cut at this Pacific Northwest forest site. The study shows the potential of PLFA analysis for profiling microbial communities and their stress status under field conditions, but wide temporal shifts emphasize the need for sampling over seasons to fully interpret ecosystem management impacts on microbial populations.

AB  - Microbes are known to regulate both gene expression and protein activity through the use of post-translational modifications (PTMs). Common PTMs involved in cellular signaling and gene control include methylations, acetylations, and phosphorylations, whereas oxidations have been implicated. as an indicator of stress. Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 is a Gram-negative bacterium that demonstrates both respiratory versatility and the ability to sense and adapt to diverse environmental conditions. The data set used in this study consisted of tandem mass spectra derived from midlog phase aerobic cultures of S. oneidensis either native or shocked with 1 mM chromate [Cr(VI)]. In this study, three algorithms (DBDigger, Sequest, and InsPecT) were evaluated for their ability to scrutinize shotgun proteomic data for evidence of PTMs. The use of conservative scoring filters for peptides or proteins versus creating a subdatabase first from a nonmodification search was evaluated with DBDigger. The use of higher-scoring filters for peptide identifications was found to result in optimal identifications of PTM peptides with a 2% false discovery rate (FDR) for the total data set using the DBDigger algorithm. However, the FDR climbs to unacceptably high levels when only PTM peptides are considered. Sequest was evaluated as a method for confirming PTM peptides putatively identified using DBDigger; however, there was a low identification rate (similar to 25%) for the searched spectra. InsPecT was found to have a much lower, and thus more acceptable, FDR than DBDigger for PTM peptides. Comparisons between InsPecT and DBDigger were made with respect to both the FDR and PTM peptide identifications. As a demonstration of this approach, a number of S. oneidensis chemotaxis proteins as well as low-abundance signal transduction proteins were identified as being post-translationally modified in response to chromate challenge.

AB  - The changes in concentrations of the Fusarium mycotoxins nivalenol (NIV), deoxynivalenol (DON), and zearalenone (ZEN) in harvested maize (Zea mays) grain with time of harvest were determined, as well as how those changes were affected by the hybrid grown. The study used five hybrids in commercial use, three of these resistant to mycotoxin accumulation under New Zealand growth conditions (3902, 3787, 3394) and two less resistant (3751, 3514). The trial was conducted at five well-maintained long-term maize research sites over the three major maize-growing regions of New Zealand. Results showed that apart from seasonal effects, hybrid choice was the major factor affecting the incidence and concentration of mycotoxins in harvested maize grain. Susceptible hybrids were significantly more likely to contain mycotoxins and to have high concentrations. It was determined that harvest date also had an impact on mycotoxin concentrations, with the best indicators of increased mycotoxin risk being either a prolonged time elapsed since the crop first reached 28% kernel moisture, or a very late (late June or July) harvest. ne possibility of a site effect was also observed. At one site in the Waikato region, cob and kernel moisture contents were determined over most of the season, and the collected grain measured for infection by Fusarium species, and for contamination by mycotoxins. This showed that once the kernel moisture content fell below 30%, a substantial increase in Fusarium infection is likely. When this occurs, further delays in harvest can compromise grain quality and lead to increased mycotoxin contamination. The level of fungal infection and mycotoxin contamination would have been markedly less if the crops had been harvested earlier than they were, with the most susceptible hybrids being most affected. The study showed that although there may exist a reasonably wide harvest window for resistant hybrids planted at good sites, with more susceptible hybrids it is imperative to harvest as soon as practical, but that even then, mycotoxin contamination can be present.

AB  - The present work was planned to study the effects of different lighting regimes in both mild and hot periods of the year on New Zealand White doe rabbit traits. The light regimes used were natural daylight as control, 16 h light and 8 h darkness, 12 h light and 12 h darkness, and 8 h light and 16 h darkness. The traits studied were thermoregulatory parameters ( respiration rate and temperatures of ear, rectum and skin), type of mating necessary, conception rate, gestation period, fur plucking, behavioural indicators of stress, litter size, litter weight, kit body weight, kit daily gain in weight, milk yield, kit milk intake, efficiency of conversion of milk into live-weight gain and kit mortality, at weekly intervals between birth and weaning at 35 days. Estimation of temperature-humidity index indicated that the doe rabbits were exposed to very severe heat stress, during the hot period of the year.
   Period of the year ( heat stress) affected adversely many of the doe traits studied. The effects were significant (P < 0.001, 0.01 or 0.05) on thermoregulatory parameters (respiration rate and temperatures of ear, rectum and skin), litter weight at days 21 and 28 of age, kit body weight at birth, milk yield of the doe at day 7 of suckling and milk intake per kit at 7 and 14 days of age.
   Exposure of doe rabbits to a long daylight regime affected adversely many of the traits studied, while the contrary occurred with short daylight. The effects were significant (P < 0.001, 0.01 or 0.05) on litter size at all ages except at birth, litter weight at 14, 21 and 28 days of age, milk yield on all days studied, efficiency of conversion of milk into live-weight gain at days 7, 21 and 28 and mortality at birth and pre-weaning.
   There was no significant interaction between period of the year and light regime on any of the traits examined. Therefore, only the main factors are reported.

AB  - The elevated plus-maze is a commonly used model to identify putative anxiolytic and anxiogenic drugs. However, the validity of elevated plus-maze and other recently developed variants such as the elevated zero-maze has recently been questioned on the grounds that both the reference anxiolytic drug chlordiazepoxide and the psychostimulant d-amphetamine increase open arm exploration and stimulate locomotor activity. These findings suggest that measures of ''anxiety'' in the elevated maze cannot be adequately dissociated from simple changes in locomotor activity, which may confound the interpretation of results obtained using these models. A variety of approaches to assess drug effects on locomotor activity in the elevated maze have been suggested, including the use of total and closed arm entries, as well as supplementary tests such as exploration of the holeboard apparatus. However, all these approaches utilise the measurement of exploration in a novel environment, and as such, could potentially be influenced by either changes in anxiety or locomotor activity. Recently, it has been shown that ethological measures of ''risk assessment'', such as stretched-attend postures and head-dipping, are sensitive indicators of drug-effects in the elevated maze. The present study assessed the utility of ethological analysis in dissociating locomotor activity from ''anxiety'' by comparing the effects of d-amphetamine to those of chlordiazepoxide in the rat elevated zero-maze. The results showed that both chlordiazepoxide and d-amphetamine increase the amount of time spent in the open arms and reduce "risk assessment" without increasing line crossing or rearing. These results confirm that under certain test conditions, psychostimulants are capable of producing ''false-positives'' in elevated maze models, and that both traditional methods and the ethological measures used in this study fail to unequivocally dissociate drug effects on anxiety from effects on locomotor activity. Further studies using other species and different classes of psychostimulants are warranted to determine the generality of these findings. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding the response of Chlorophyll a concentration (Chl-a, an indicator of phytoplankton biomass) to environmental factors is critical for eutrophication management. Light and nutrients often act as two main limiting environmental factors in large and shallow lakes. However, the limitation status is usually not considered explicitly when building empirical relationships even though the growth limitation is the possible mechanism controlling the behaviors of these relationships. Here we chose a typical large and shallow eutrophic lake (Lake Okeechobee) to study the response of Chl-a concentration under different growth limitation conditions. Using an existed decision tree model followed by Carlson's trophic state index, monitoring data from 1994 to 2020 were classified into light-limitation, nitrogen-limitation, or phosphorus-limitation. The spatio-temporal patterns of limitation status were revealed. By subdivision of observations according to these growth limitation classes, our results demonstrated three main findings. First, algae responded differently between light limitation and nutrient limitation. Chl-a concentrations were lower with smaller variability when light was limiting than those when nutrient was limiting. In addition, the evolution of Chl-a in enduring nutrient limitation events were more dynamic. Second, limitation-specific regressions provided a more straightforward interpretation compared with those without consideration of limitation status. Chl-a - nutrient relationship based on limitation classification displayed a higher R2 with a positive slope. This positive slope indicates the sensitivity of Chl-a to that specific nutrient. Moreover, response of Chl-a to phosphorus was successfully detected by identifying P-limited samples. Otherwise, the Chl-a - TP response would be muted since nitrogen is the main limiting nutrient in Lake Okeechobee. Third, a spatial heterogeneity of Chl-a - TN relationship was revealed by Bayesian hierarchical modelling. This indicates the necessity of focusing more on hot spots where Chl-a displays a higher sensitivity to increase of nutrient. Our findings demonstrate the advantage of developing the limitation-specific and zonespecific relationships between algal biomass and environmental factors.

AB  - In hot environments, rabbits are exposed to heat stress, which leads to significantly reduced production performance, and consequently, economic losses. Hence, new nutritional strategies to alleviate the adverse effects of increasing temperatures have become highly needed. This study aimed to test the efficacy of the high-energy diet with or without high protein levels to improve the tolerance of growing rabbits raised under heat stress circumstances. A total of 75, 35-day-old male New Zealand White rabbits (598.1 +/- 0.77 g) were used for 56 days. The rabbits were alienated into five treatment groups. The W-NP-NE group was kept during the winter season (thermo-neutral condition) and fed on the basal diet (normal protein and normal energy). The other four treatment groups were kept during the hot climate summer season. The S-NP-NE group was fed a basal diet. The S-NP-HE group was fed on a normal protein and high-energy diet, while the S-HP-NE group was fed a high protein and normal energy diet. The S-HP-HE group was fed a high protein and high-energy diet. The results revealed that chronically heat-stressed rabbits showed a reduction in feed intake, feed utilization, growth performance indices, red blood cells, white blood cells, blood hemoglobin, total protein, albumin, and glucose compared to the thermoneutral group. However, a significant increase in triglyceride, total cholesterol, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase levels was obvious. A significant elevation in thermoregulatory indicators, including rectal temperature, respiration rate, and heart rate, was observed in S-NP-NE group. However, increasing dietary energy and protein levels alone or in combination significantly reduced the harmful impacts of chronic temperature stress on the rabbit's growth, feed utilization, thermoregulatory, and biochemical indicators. Rabbits of the SHP-HE group showed the highest economic efficiency. In conclusion, increasing energy and protein concentration alone or in combination may be a practical tool to enhance the growth, thermoregulatory indicators, blood constituents, and economic efficiency of heat-stressed rabbits.

AB  - Soils vary depending on the type and intensity of interactions between the geoforms(1) and the soils. Coastal geoforms, due to special soil-forming features, contain less evolved but distinctive soils with different physicochemical and morphological properties. The particle size distribution (PSD) is one of the most important indicators to understand the dominant conditions in sedimentary environments and determination of soil parent material. The purpose of this study was to use the PSD throughout the soil profile as an auxiliary analytical characteristic to identify the landforms in combination with surface topography and soil-forming factors. The estuarine geomorphic environment of the southeastern coast of the Caspian Sea, with about 480 km(2) area, a semi-arid climate (350 mm precipitation, 17.6 degrees C temperature) and coastal marine environment, was studied. Grid sampling consisting of 4 rows 6 km apart and 20 points in each row 1 km apart; 15 profiles; 61 auger holes, and 4 inaccessible points was performed. In total, 456 soil samples from soil profiles and auger points were collected. In addition to routine analyses, detailed PSD analysis (20 hydrometer readings) was done in all samples. Maps of the size fractions were prepared using ArcGIS 10.6 for each layer to illustrate 3D variations in PSD. Three types of granulometric curves including: 1) a sigmoid curve characteristic of free sediment accumulation, 2) a logarithmic curve characteristic of a torrential flow or splay deposit and 3) a parabolic curve characteristic of an accumulation forced by an obstacle obstructing the flow were determined across the study area and at different depths. The spatial (from the coast to a distance of 20 km) and temporal (across different layers from the soil surface to a depth of 120 cm) PSD variations were found to be significant in the study area. This information is useful in identifying lagoons, barriers, alluvial terraces and small islands in the coastal plain areas.

AB  - The enhancement of rabbit female functional longevity, that is the ability to avoid voluntary culling, is a paramount aspect for the sustainability of meat rabbit production; this trait represents a direct indicator of female robustness. The objective of our study was to compare the functional longevity of five rabbit lines at their foundation and at fixed times during their selection processes. Four of them are maternal lines (A, V, H and LP) selected for litter size at weaning. The fifth line is the paternal line R, founded and selected for post-weaning daily gain from 28 to 63 days. The comparison at foundation involved the complete data set (from March 1980 to March 2013; records of 15,670 does) and pedigree (19,405 animals). Latter comparisons were made when all lines shared the same environmental and management conditions, from March 1997 to September 1998 and from March 2011 to September 2012. In these second comparisons, the same model as that used in the comparison at foundation was used, but now the additive effect was excluded, only data from the corresponding periods were considered. At their foundation, lines V, H and LP showed larger functional longevity than lines A and R, being LP line that with the longest productive life. In the latter comparisons, lines A and R still showing the lowest functional longevities. However, as the selection process evolves, the differences between these two lines and the others were reduced. It could be concluded that the average longevity of a population greatly depends on the criteria followed for its foundation. In addition, along the selection for litter size, the differences of longevity between lines tend to decrease, this is due to an unintended selection for functional longevity, since only offspring from females reaching three parturitions are selected as breeding animals for the next generation.

TI  - Coleoborers (Curculionidae: Scolytinae) in native and homogeneous systems of Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa bonpl.) in the Southern Amazon, Brazil
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Brazil nut is one of the most important species of the Amazon due to its socioeconomic importance. Especially in homogeneous production systems, it may be susceptible to damage by wood-boring insects, as by the subfamily Scolytinae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae); thus, inadequate management conditions can cause economic damage. Therefore, the objective of the present work is to evaluate the occurrence of wood-boring insects (Curculionidae: Scolytinae) in native and homogeneous systems of Brazil nut in the Meridional Amazonian, Brazil. The study was conducted in three environments: Brazil Nut Native Anthropized, Homogeneous Brazil Nut and Brazil Nut Native Preserved. Twelve ethanol (96 degrees GL) traps were installed in each environment during four sampling periods. The data were submitted to entomofaunistic analysis, Pearson ' s correlation analysis and cluster analysis. A total of 2,243 individuals from 31 species were sampled, of which 23 were from the Brazil Nut Native Anthropized nut, 24 from the Homogeneous Brazil Nut and 26 from the Brazil Nut Native Preserved. Some species are restricted to a specific environment, such as Corthylocurus vernaculus Wood & Bright, 1992 and Xyleborus biconicus Eggers, 1928, in relation to Brazil Nut Native Anthropized, Xyleborus tolimanus Eggers, 1928 that occurred only in Homogeneous Brazil Nut and Corthylus antennarius Schedl and Hypothenus bolivianus Wood & Bright, 1992 verified only in Brazil Nut Native Preserved. In the faunistic analysis, we highlight the species Xyleborus affinis (Eichhoff, 1868), which was the most representative one in the three environments and a super-dominant species in all four sampling periods. Among the species considered indicator due to their high representativeness in the sampling, only Premnobius cavipennis Eichhoff, 1878 showed a significant negative correlation between its abundance and the minimum temperature for environments Homogeneous Brazil Nut and Brazil Nut Native Preserved. There was a greater similarity between the Brazil Nut Native Anthropized and the Brazil Nut Native Preserved; these two environments showed dissimilarity with the Homogeneous Brazil Nut. Monitoring wood-boring insects in Brazil nut agroecosystems is fundamental for the establishment of integrated pest management strategies.

AB  - The new generation Manufacturing Executions System (MES) is considered as one of the most important solutions supporting the idea of Industry 4.0. This is confirmed by research conducted among companies interested in the implementation of the Industry 4.0 concept, as well as the publications of researchers who study this issue. However, if MES software is a link that connects the world of machines and business systems, it must take into account the specifics of the supported production systems. This is especially true in case of production systems with a high level of automation, which are characterised by flexibility and agility at the operational level. Therefore, personalization of the MES software is proposed for this class of production systems. The aim of the article is to present the MES system personalization method for a selected production system. The proposed approach uses the rules of Bayesian inference and the area of customisation is the technological structure of production, taking into account the required flexibility of the processes. As part of the developed approach, the variability index was proposed as a parameter evaluating the effectiveness of the production system. Then, the results of evaluation of the current system effectiveness by use of this index are presented. The authors also present the assumptions for the developed MES personalization algorithm. The algorithm uses the rules of Bayesian inference, which enable multiple adjustments of the model to the existing environmental conditions without the need to formulate a new description of reality. The application of the presented solution in a real facility allowed for determining production areas which are the determinants of system instability. The implementation of the developed algorithm enabled control of the generated variability in real time. The proposed approach to personalization of MES software for a selected class of production systems is the main novelty of the presented research and contributes to the development of the described area of research.

AB  - Precision medicine emphasizes predictive, preventive and personalized treatment on the basis of information gleaned from personal genetic and environmental data. Its implementation at health systems level is regarded as multifactorial, involving variables associated with omics technologies, public genomic awareness and adoption tendencies for new medical technologies. However, interrelationships of the various factors and their synergy has not been sufficiently quantified. Based on a survey of 270 participants involved in the use of molecular tests (omics-based biomarkers, OBMs), this study examined how characteristics of omics biomarkers influence precision medicine implementation outcomes (ImO) through an intermediary factor, public genomic awareness (represented by User Response, UsR). A structural equation modelling (SEM) approach was applied to develop and test a 3 latent variable mediation model; each latent variable being measured by a set of indicators ranging between three and six. Mediation analysis results confirmed a partial mediation effect (an indirect effect represented as the product of paths 'a' and 'b' (a*b)) of 0.36 at 90% confidence level, CI = [0.03, 9.94]. Results from the individual mediation paths 'a' and 'b' however, showed that these effects were negative(a = -0.38, b = -0.94). Path 'a' represents the effect of characteristics of OBMs on the mediator, UsR; 'b' represents the effect of the mediator, UsR on implementation outcomes, ImO, holding OBMs constant. The results have both theoretical and practice implications for biomedical genomics research and clinical genomics, respectively. For instance, the results imply better ways have to be devised to more effectively engage the public in addressing extended family support for extended family cascade screening, especially for monogenic hereditary conditions likeBRCA-related breast cancer and colorectal cancer in Lynch syndrome families. At basic biomedical research level, results suggest an integrated biomarker development pipeline, with early consideration of factors that may influence biomarker uptake.

AB  - The population acceleration and better lifestyle submit new challenges for wheat researchers to breed wheat (Triticum sativum) cultivars with upgraded yield, quality, and resistance against abiotic stresses such as drought, so exploiting all available natural relatives of cultivated wheat and introducing even sensitive ones may be a useful approach to save time and efforts. Normally, the seedling stage is highly drought vulnerable, but for sensitive cultivars, the situation is more frustrating. We examine the potentiality of two regulating hormones in the upregulation of two wheat cultivars varying in their drought susceptibility at the seedling stage comparatively evaluated by morpho-physiological traits as indicators of drought tolerance. All the studied traits revealed cultivar-dependent variation in response to water deficit where cv. Sids 1 was tolerant and cv. Beni-suef 5 was sensitive. Shoot/root ratio, total water content, total dry weight, chlorophyll stability, total osmotic potential, osmoregulatory components, viz., soluble carbohydrates, soluble proteins and proline, membrane damage trait in terms of LOX, antioxidant defense system enzymatically in terms of APX, CAT, POD, SOD, and total antioxidant as drought tolerance indicators were the troubling shot due to water shortage in both cultivars. The damaging impacts of water deficit on these traits were conceived for sensitive cultivar compared with the tolerant one. Exogenous application of jasmonic acid (JA) or kinetin (K) efficiently conferred drought tolerance to sensitive cultivar to withstand harsh conditions in earlier stages and to perform comparably with tolerant ones. Applied hormones prompted unequivocal inversion from a state of downregulation to upregulation regarding all drought tolerance traits via reallocation of photoassimilates to vegetative sinks, thus promoting growth, increasing the accumulation of some osmoregulation compounds and thus increased tissue vigor and regulated the activity of antioxidant enzymes as well as morphological modulation attained by the restoration of shoot/root ratio. The results would promisingly be supportive of research programs seeking to develop anti-drought stress practices for sensitive wheat cultivars.

AB  - Rainfall-triggered shallow landslides represent a major threat to people and infrastructure worldwide. Predicting the possibility of a landslide occurrence accurately means understanding the trigger mechanisms adequately. Rainfall is the main cause of slope failures in Slovenia, and rainfall thresholds are among the most-used tools to predict the possible occurrence of rainfall-triggered landslides. The recent validation of the prototype landslide early system in Slovenia highlighted the need to define new reliable rainfall thresholds. In this study, several empirical thresholds are determined using an automatic tool. The thresholds are represented by a power law curve that links the cumulated event rainfall (E, in mm) with the duration of the rainfall event (D, in h). By eliminating all subjective criteria thanks to the automated calculation, thresholds at diverse non-exceedance probabilities are defined and validated, and the uncertainties associated with their parameters are estimated. Additional thresholds are also calculated for two different environmental classifications. The first classification is based on mean annual rainfall (MAR) with the national territory divided into three classes. The area with the highest MAR has the highest thresholds, which indicates a likely adaptation of the landscape to higher amounts of rainfall. The second classification is based on four lithological units. Two-thirds of the considered landslides occur in the unit of any type of clastic sedimentary rocks, which proves an influence of the lithology on the occurrence of shallow landslides. Sedimentary rocks that are prone to weathering have the lowest thresholds, while magmatic and metamorphic rocks have the highest thresholds. Thresholds obtained for both classifications are far less reliable due to the low number of empirical points and can only be used as indicators of rainfall conditions for each of the classes. Finally, the new national thresholds for Slovenia are also compared with other regional, national, and global thresholds. The thresholds can be used to define probabilistic schemes aiming at the operative prediction of rainfall-induced shallow landslides in Slovenia, in the framework of the Slovenian prototype early warning system.

AB  - Despite the importance of delineating spatial modelling of gully headcuts (GHs) in erosion-prone environments, assessments of the factors that control the occurrence of headcuts is lacking. To fill this gap in the research, we identified 129 GHs field surveys. These 129 cases were randomly divided into two groups: 90 GHs (70%) for model training and 39 GHs (30%) for model validation. Subsequently, new unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery is used to develop spatial modelling to predict the location of GHs at sites prone to soil erosion in Golestan Province, Iran. Mapping GHs enables evaluation of 4 machine-learning techniques (or ensembles) - best-first decision tree (BFTree), bagging best-first decision tree (Bag-BFTree), random-subspace best-first decision tree (RS-BFTree), and rotation-forest best-first decision tree (RF-BFTree) - for modelling GHs. We use the information-gain ratio method to analyze the relationships between GHs and 22 GH conditioning factors. The 4 ensemble outputs are validated using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The areas under the curves (AUCs) for prediction rates of the ensemble methods applied to the training group are BFTree - 883%, Bag-BFTree - 92.7%, RS-BFTree - 95.7%, and RF-BFTree - 93.2%. The AUCs for the model-validation group cases, however, are 84.9%, 94.1%, 97.4%, and 9.18%, respectively. Therefore, RS-BFTree is, statistically, the most effective ensemble method for accurate modelling of GHs. Variable-importance analyses using information-gain ratio indicate that out of 22 GH-influential factors, land use, slope degree, and slope-length are of more importance in developing of GH occurrence. Finally, to address the need for detailed observations and highly accurate erosion data in the field, UAV image-acquisition technologies are demonstrated. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the Zielin oilfield in the Polish part of the Southern Permian Basin, oil and gas are produced from an Upper Permian Main Dolomite (Ca2) isolated platform. The paleohigh developed on a volcanic cone formed in Early Rotliegend time. Based on microfacies analysis of Ca2 reservoir rocks from four wells (Zielin-1, -2, -3 and -3KBis), four microfacies types are distinguished: peloidal dolomitized wackestone, intraclastic dolomitized rudstone and floatstone, biogenic boundstone, and intraclastic-bioclastic dolomitized packstone. In view of the lack of source rocks on the Zielin paleohigh revealed by Rock-Eval analyses, this isolated carbonate platform is regarded as a reservoir for migrating hydrocarbons. Biomarker analyses of two crude oils and nine carbonate rocks from the Zielin isolated carbonate platform and five crude oils from surrounding wells of the nearest Gorzow, Cychry, and Namylin platforms indicate an origin for the oils from oil-prone type II kerogen, sourced from organic matter deposited under anoxic/suboxic conditions in a carbonate environment. Compared to organic matter extracted from the rock samples, oils from the Zielin-2 and 3KBis wells are characterized by higher values of the pristane/phytane (Pr/Ph) and dibenzothiophene/phenanthrene (DBT/P) ratios, lower relative concentrations of polyalkylaromatics, as well as a higher maturity evaluated from the methylphenanthrene (MPI-1) and methyldibenzothiophene (MDR) indices. The molecular composition of sesquiterpanes, n-alkylbenzenes, and polyalkylnaphthalenes revealed a diverse specificity within the oils analyzed and allowed their separation into two groups. Oils Roasko-4, Zielin-2, Zielin-3KBis, and Namylin-1 represent group I, whereas Barnowko-3, Mostno-2 and Cychry-2 group II. From the gradient direction in the n-decane/naphthalene ratio and maturity for respective crude oils belonging to group I, it is concluded that the oils accumulated in the Zielin atoll migrated from NW to SE following subsidence and tilting of the platform in this part of the Main Dolomite basin.

AB  - The stress caused by social changes that Russia's population experienced due to the change of the socio-economic order forced them to choose adaptation behavior strategies: from active influence on the environment to avoiding problems. In these conditions, the developing branch of knowledge - the sociology of adaptation - was interested in the socio-economic aspects of the issue associated with changes in living standards, social status and economic behavior strategies of members of different stratification groups and the impact of different types of capital. However, studying adaptation as a component of social health is equally important. The goal of the present paper is to study social adaptation of Russia's population and identify its groups with different adaptation potential. We focus on adaptation in terms of resource and subject-activity approaches. European Social Survey data (Russia, sample size is 2,484 people) serve as an empirical base of our research. We consider social adaptation through the indicators of its result: adaptation level and through resources. We identify four latent variables using latent structural analysis of the observed variables that reflect different aspects of adaptation. Two of them characterize the result of adaptation: positive mental health and subjective activity (active behavioral practices in a changing environment). The other two are adaptation resources: internal (high adequate self-assessment, subjectivity, internal locus of control) and external (social support). Using latent-structural analysis we determine the grounds for stratification of Russian society according to the "social adaptation" criterion. We identify groups that are problematic in terms of the dynamics of adaptation processes in the case of the changes in the initial data such as an increase in the external load or a decrease in external resources. We reveal that from the standpoint of the subject-activity approach the maladjustment of an individual is connected with their alienation in professional activity. The novelty of our work lies in the fact that it implements an interdisciplinary approach to the study of social adaptation.

AB  - Grime's CSR species life-strategy theory (competition-stress-ruderality) provides a conceptual framework to classify species into competitive (growing under high productivity, low disturbance), stress-tolerant (low productivity, low disturbance) and ruderal (high productivity, high disturbance). Importantly, this classification is based on the assumption that the niche space of disturbance and productivity is filled unevenly: while in productive habitats species can adapt to different disturbance regimes, species of low-productivity and disturbed habitats do not exist, resulting in a triangular distribution of species optima along axes of disturbance and productivity. This assumption has often been criticised, but it has not yet been put under a rigorous test.
   Here we use existing data on niche positions of central European plant species to test this hypothesis, namely its prediction that species adapted to jointly stressed (low-productive) and disturbed habitats do not exist. We use Ellenberg indicator values and newly developed indicator values for disturbance as proxies of species positions in the space of productivity and disturbance.
   We found that positions of species optima along the gradients of productivity and disturbance severity are not independent of each other, with very few species adapted to low-productive and severely disturbed habitats. In contrast, there is no relationship between productivity and disturbance frequency; a number of species occur in low-productive and frequently disturbed habitats. The relationship between productivity and disturbance severity can be either due to tradeoffs between life history traits responsible for response to disturbance and productivity (as originally assumed by Grime) or due to historical rarity of severely disturbed habitats in unproductive conditions and consequent absence of evolution of species adapted to them. Our data are based on one specific flora, shaped by glaciations and early introduction of agriculture, but the question of what causes this pattern can be resolved by future analyses of floras with different evolutionary and ecological histories.

AB  - Sediment yield can be a sensitive indicator of catchment dynamics and environmental change. For a glacierized catchment in the High Arctic, we compiled and analyzed diverse sediment transfer data, spanning a wide range of temporal scales, to quantify catchment yields and explore landscape response to past and ongoing hydroclimatic variability. The dataset integrates rates of lake sedimentation from correlated varve records and repeated annual and seasonal sediment traps, augmented by multi-year lake and fluvial monitoring. Consistent spatial patterns of deposition enabled reconstruction of catchment yields from varve- and trap-based fluxes. We used hydroclimatic data and multivariate modeling to examine annual controls of sediment delivery over almost a century, and to examine shorter-term controls of sediment transfer during peak glacier melt. Particle-size analyses, especially for annual sediment traps, were used to further infer sediment transfer mechanisms and timing. Through the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age, there were no apparent multi-century trends in lake sedimentation rates, which were over three times greater than those during the mid-Holocene when glaciers were diminished. Twentieth-century sedimentation rates were greater than those of previous millennia, with a mid-century step increase in mean yield from 240 to 425Mg km(-2)yr(-1). Annual yields through the twentieth century showed significant positive relations with spring/summer temperature, rainfall, and peak discharge conditions. This finding is significant for the future of sediment transfer at Linnevatnet, and perhaps more broadly in the Arctic, where continued increases in temperature and rainfall are projected. For 2004-2010, annual yields ranged from 294 to 1330Mg km(-2)yr(-1). Sediment trap volumes and particle-size variations indicate that recent annual yields were largely dominated by spring to early summer transfer of relatively coarse-grained sediment. Fluvial monitoring showed daily to hourly sediment transfer to be related to current and prior discharge, diurnal hysteresis, air temperature, and precipitation.

AB  - The use of pesticides for pest control has an impact on both environment and human health. In 2015, the Mauritian government expressed the wish to develop organic farming which further spiked the interest of the local community following the detection of pesticides residues in samples sourced from different vegetable markets across the Island. But to what extent can producers respond to this request from the local society? Given that production methods were poorly documented, we surveyed 298 vegetable growers (beans, cabbages, tomatoes, potatoes, cucurbits, etc.) in order to analyze their phytosanitary practices and evaluate their impact on environment. The purpose of this survey is to provide answers to the following questions: How do producers actually use pesticides? What constraints do they face? Producers are rather old (60% are over 50 years old) and few have basic training which is rarely specific to agriculture. Moreover, almost two-thirds of the respondents do not own the land they cultivate which in turn leads them to adopt a risk averse position and focus on maximising their gains - monetary or otherwise - from their plot over a span of time. The majority of producers have recourse to preventive treatments to protect their crops against the numerous pests identified. Between 11 and 53 treatments per year are thus carried out depending on the crop rotation patterns. Nearly 60 insecticides and fungicides are commonly used by producers. "Phyto'Aide'', a tool which aims at facilitating the decision-making process, allowed us to evaluate,ex ante, the risk of transferring these substances to the environment. It turned out that risks are important for all pesticides because good phytosanitary practices are inadequately, if at all, followed by most producers. Under these conditions, new strategies for crop protection against pests are needed. We propose in this article different clues for improvement but also a strategy to assist these producers in responding to society's demand for a safe and healthy production.

AB  - In forestry, site productivity is commonly described using the concept of site index (SI) and its effect on the potential mean annual increment. Although a unified causal explanation between SI and productivity is still missing, operational methods have been developed to determine SI on the basis of the existing tree crop or other indirect indicators of environmental drivers. In ecology, progress has been made in deriving productivity from the carbon balance, including photosynthesis, respiration and tissue longevity, but considerable gaps remain in quantifying the impact of soil processes on below-ground carbon allocation which would be crucial for closure of the total carbon balance. Recent empirical studies in Finland have found significant and consistent differences in the foliage to fine-root ratio and fine-root lifetime between the conventional SI based on field layer vegetation in geographical vegetation zones. In this study, we utilised this information to bridge the gap between the large body of empirical information on SI and productivity, and productivity as derived from the carbon balance. We incorporated assumptions concerning the climate and soil response of the carbon balance components in a process-based model, PipeQual, and applied the approach to Norway spruce stands in Fenno-Scandian conditions. The results agreed well with an empirical growth and yield model and provided fairly accurate projections for two contrasting test sites. The study provided insights into the role of the component processes of productivity. Importantly, the north-south gradient of productivity was equally attributed to a northward decrease in temperature and an increase in carbon allocation to fine roots. This cautions against climate change projections on the basis of current growth variation with temperature and calls for improved mechanistic models incorporating plant, soil and microbial interactions in regulating the soil-forest carbon and nitrogen fluxes.

AB  - The effectiveness of growing winter cover crops to mitigate nitrogen (N) leaching can be widely variable, even within a single climatic zone. We sought to investigate key drivers of this variability for the Canterbury Plains of New Zealand. First, through an analysis of local field experiments, we quantified the local variability in the effectiveness of cover crops to reduce N leaching. We then calibrated and applied a biophysical model to isolate the impact of potential drivers of this variability. Crop management (cover crop sowing date), soil water holding capacity (WHC) and inter-annual weather variability (30 years of historical climate) were selected as main factors to be investigated. The analysis of local literature showed that, compared to fallow treatments, winter cover crops reduced N leaching by an average (+/- 95% CI) of 17 +/- 8.2 kg N ha(-1). This represented a median N leaching reduction of similar to 50% with a wide interquartile range (6-75%). The modelling study showed that the delay in sowing dates consistently reduced the average effectiveness of cover crops, from >80% for March- to <25% for June-sown crops. For any "sowing date by soil WHC" scenario, there was also a large year to year variability. This was caused by the stochastic effect of inter-annual weather variability on the dynamics of crop N demand and soil N supply. For the conditions assumed in the modelling study, a sensitivity analysis of simulated results showed that sowing dates were the main contributor to total variability in the effectiveness of cover crops, followed by weather, factor interactions and soil WHC. These results suggest the need for caution when interpreting data from individual field trials due to the impact of inter-annual variability and interactions among multiple drivers on cover crop effectiveness. In addition, our analysis highlights the value of complementary methodologies, such as biophysical modelling, for extending the inference space of individual field studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the last decades, sustainable development has been one of the key guiding principles in the European Union policies. It is based on a three-pillar framework - economic development, social development and environmental protection - that are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. As energy appears to be the cornerstone of economic growth, Europe 2020 strategy emphasizes the importance to make European Union more sustainable by means of the establishment of a long-term approach with a clear guidance to climate change. However, empirical literature about methods to elaborate SD indexes is scarce. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to obtain a Synthetic Index of Energy Sustainable Development for EU-15. Based on 33 variables, three indexes are calculated related to energy security of supply, competitive energy market and environmental protection dimensions which are later aggregated into a Synthetic Index. Our results show that Denmark, the Netherlands, France, Portugal and UK have the better scores. The success of these member states is given by the development of a suitable management in their energy policies regarding the reduction of their energy dependency, the increase of competitiveness in their energy markets and the establishment of measures to increase climate change protection. New reinforcing policies are necessary in intermediate member states based on new energy saving actions (in the cases of Sweden, Austria and Finland), the introduction of more competition in its energy market (in the case of Italy) and environment protection actions (in the case of Germany). Greater efforts are necessary in member states that have the worst results (Spain, Ireland, Greece, Belgium and Luxembourg). EU's budget support should be available for these member states in order to develop new and more effective actions that allow them to secure access to importations of energy sources under the best possible conditions while supplying energy at competitive prices and protecting the environment. It requires better coordination of national energy policies and greater cooperation between member states. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the effect of land use intensity, soil parameters and vegetation on protistan communities in grassland soils. We performed qualitative (T-RFLP) and quantitative (qPCR) analyses using primers specifically targeting the 18S rRNA gene for all Eukarya and for two common flagellate groups, i.e. the Chrysophyceae and the Kinetoplastea. Both approaches were applied to extracted soil DNA and RNA, in order to distinguish between the potentially active protists (i.e. RNA pool) and the total protistan communities, including potentially inactive and encysted cells (i.e. DNA pool). Several environmental determinants such as site, soil parameters and vegetation had an impact on the T-RFLP community profiles and the abundance of the quantified 18S rRNA genes. Correlating factors often differed between quantitative (qPCR) and qualitative (T-RFLP) approaches. For instance the Chrysophyceae/Eukarya 18S rDNA ratio as determined by qPCR correlated with the C/N ratio, whereas the community composition based on T-RLFP analysis was not affected indicating that both methods taken together provide a more complete picture of the parameters driving protist diversity. Moreover, distinct T-RFs were obtained, which could serve as potential indicators for either active organisms or environmental conditions like water content. While site was the main determinant across all investigated exploratories, land use seemed to be of minor importance for structuring protist communities. The impact of other parameters differed between the target groups, e.g. Kinetoplastea reacted on changes to water content on all sites, whereas Chrysophyceae were only affected in the Schorfheide. Finally, in most cases different responses were observed on RNA- and DNA-level, respectively. Vegetation for instance influenced the two flagellate groups only at the DNA-level across all sites. Future studies should thus include different protistan groups and also distinguish between active and inactive cells, in order to reveal causal shifts in community composition and abundance in agriculturally used systems.

AB  - Forest edges are important features of wooded farmland. Their role for biodiversity was investigated using tree microhabitats (TMH) as an indirect indicator of forest biodiversity. Because they are managed more intensively, trees in the edges of fragmented temperate woodlands are likely to host more TMH than trees in their interior. In this study, we tested this hypothesis in relation to tree density, diameter, species composition and the structure and management of woodland edges. We selected 28 woodlands with edges differing by their structure and the adjacent fields. Eleven types of TMH were recorded in two transects set up in the edges and interior of the woodlands. TMH density was significantly higher in the woodland edges (4.67 +/- 0.78 per 100 m(2) area) than in the interior (1.86 +/- 0.23 per 100 m(2) area). Some TMH - patches of bark loss, cracks, sap runs and epiphytes - were significantly more abundant in the edges than in the interior. These results were accounted for by the convergence of several factors: (i) significantly higher tree density in woodland edges, (ii) a significantly higher proportion of TMH host trees in woodland edges, (iii) a larger tree diameter on average in woodland edges and, even in the same given size class, a higher frequency of TMH host trees, and (iv) greater abundance in woodland edges of tree species more likely to host TMH, even with small diameters. The positive relationship found between the height of the bottom of the crown and TMH abundance may have resulted from abiotic factors (micro-climatic conditions) related to long management rotations, but we did not demonstrate any direct effect of management practices. Given the large number of forest taxa, but also farmland taxa, that depend on TMH, woodland edges should be reconsidered as zones of high potential interest for forest biodiversity conservation.

AB  - In the Early Cretaceous an epicontinental sea covered most of what is nowadays Northwest Germany. Sediments accumulated in a synsedimentary subsiding basin, the Lower Saxony Basin (= LSB), which formed the southern extension of the proto-North Sea. Two sedimentary successions of mid-Hauterivian age (calcareous nannofossil zones BC8-9) were correlated by means of coccolith biostratigraphy. The sections represent (a) a marginal marine environment, <10 km distance from the former coastline, dominated by sandy deposits (Emlichheim), and (b) the basin centre, about 50 km offshore, with clay dominated sedimentation (Resse). Our study aims at reconstructing the palaeoceanography of the LSB in the mid Hauterivian and at comparing the nannofossil assemblages of the two different settings.
   In the Emlichheim area (German-Dutch borderland) the Gildehaus Sandstone is represented by coarse siliciclastics and intercalated mudstone intervals. The mud-dominated matrix contains rich and diverse calcareous nannofossil assemblages, which in combination with lithology allow for a sequence stratigraphic interpretation of the Gildehaus Sandstone. The mu of the Resse section (basin centre) contain a rich nannofiora and an abundant ammonite fauna. The latter shows an alternation of endemic, Tethyan and Boreal taxa, which shed light on the palaeoceanographic conditions of the LSB in the mid-Hauterivian.
   Quantitative analyses of the calcareous nannofossil assemblages show an offset between the abundances of the fertility indicators Zeugrhabdotus erectus and Biscutum constans. In Emlichheim, Z. erectus is present in higher abundances than B. constans, in Resse B. constans is dominating. These results confirm previous ideas regarding the palaeoecological preferences of the two species. At the same time they indicate palaeoceanographic differences between the both sections.
   In Resse, calcareous nannofossils show a pronounced increase in abundance that coincides with the diversification of the ammonite fauna. The combined nannofossil-, ammonite and delta O-18(bel)-datasets suggest, that the changes in the biota of the mid-Hauterivian (calcareous nannofossil zone BC8) are related to an increase in surface water fertility that goes along with fluctuations of relative sea level and a moderate warming.

AB  - Today, approximately one-fourth of the world's population includes 1,620 million persons who are part of the expanding Islamic Ummah. Muslims are found in large numbers in all regions of the world but are concentrated in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and selected successor states to the former Soviet Union. Despite the obvious wealth of some Islamic nations most Muslims live under conditions of poverty, joblessness, illiteracy, ill health, social and political unrest and, in some regions, religious extremism. Using the extensively pre-tested Weighted Index of Social Progress, this paper reports a 40-year time series analysis of the nature, extent, and pace of social change that is taking place within 53 of the 57 member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). Data are reported at four levels of analysis. Selected data also are reported for both the OIC-as-a-whole and for the world-as-a-whole. The present analysis offers a sometimes bleak, but generally optimistic, picture of the dramatic differences that characterize development patterns within Islamic countries, subregions, and regions. Particular attention is given to: (a) the legacy of colonialism that persisted for some OIC states until as recently as 1991; (b) the recurrent social unrest that continues to characterize development in many Islamic states, e.g., the "Arab Spring" (Vision of Humanity 2012); (c) the presence or absence of marketable natural and human resources; and, (d) the significant contributions being made to the development of Islamic countries by the United Nations' Millennium Development Campaign (United Nations 2005) and the OIC's Ten-Year Programme of Action (OIC 2005). However, the important social gains reported in this paper for some countries and geographic regions remain highly variable, potentially reversible, unless the collective wishes of Islamic nations are translated into concerted actions both within OIC member states and the larger world community of nations.

AB  - Anthropogenic alterations of woodland habitat may influence stopover biology, which in turn could alter the stress physiology of migratory landbirds. Woodland stopover habitats are scarce in the Northern Prairie region of North America and consist of native riparian corridor woodlands (corridors) and smaller, more isolated woodlots of anthropogenic origin around farmsteads (woodlots). Corridor habitats have been greatly reduced since the time of European settlement, but woodlot habitats have appeared over this same time period. In this study, we compared stopover biology and stress physiology of migratory landbirds using natural and anthropogenic woodland habitats. We first tested for differences between birds in the two habitats for baseline corticosterone (CORTB) and the magnitude of the stress response for individual species, taxonomic families and foraging guilds. Plasma corticosterone increased significantly for all bird groups in both habitats following 30 min of restraint stress (CORT30), and neither CORTB nor the magnitude of the stress response (CORT30 - CORTB) differed significantly between birds in the two habitats. Secondly, because CORTB levels are often elevated and CORT secretion following a stressor is often suppressed for birds in poor body condition, we hypothesized that woodland migrants with higher fattening rates would show reduced CORTB and a robust stress response. We tested this hypothesis by assessing the relationships between plasma corticosterone and plasma metabolites associated with refuelling. We found that CORTB was negatively associated and the magnitude of the stress response positively associated with plasma triglycerides (an indicator of fat deposition), with opposite patterns for corticosterone and plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate (an indicator of fat catabolism). These data suggest that both corridor and woodlot habitats serve as effective stopover habitat and that the reduction of corridor habitat and increased reliance on anthropogenic woodlots is not detrimental to the stress physiology of migrants in a region with limited woodland habitats.

AB  - P>1. Benthic algal communities are shaped by the availability of nutrients and light and by herbivore consumption. Many studies have examined how one of these factors affects algal communities, but studies simultaneously addressing all three are rare.
   2. We investigated the effects of nutrients, light and a herbivore (the snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum) on benthic stream algae in a fully factorial experiment in 128 circular streamside channels. Four nutrient levels (none added to highly enriched), four snail grazing pressures (no snails to 777 individuals m-2) and two light levels (ambient and 65% reduced) were applied. Colonising algae were dominated by diatoms (Bacillariophyta), which were determined to species using acid-cleaned samples and assigned to functional groups according to their physiognomic growth form.
   3. Diatom community structure changed considerably in response to our manipulations. Light had the strongest influence (as indicated by manova effect size), whereas nutrients had an intermediate effect and grazing was fairly weak. Relative abundances of six common diatom taxa decreased under reduced light, whereas five others became more prevalent. Eight taxa benefitted from nutrient enrichment, while three became rarer. Grazing affected the relative density of only one common taxon, which increased at higher grazing pressure.
   4. Diatom functional groups also responded strongly. 'Low profile' taxa dominated at low resource levels (nutrients and especially light), whereas 'high profile' and 'motile' taxa became markedly more prevalent at higher resource levels.
   5. Two-way interactions between experimental factors were quite common. For example, Planothidium lanceolatum and Rossithidium petersenii responded more strongly to nutrient enrichment at reduced than at ambient light, whereas Cocconeis placentula responded more strongly at ambient light. For diatom functional groups, the benefit of nutrient enrichment for 'motile' diatoms was greater at ambient than at reduced light.
   6. Our results imply that multifactor experiments are required to determine the main forces driving the composition of benthic algal communities. Further, our findings highlight the considerable potential of using functional algal groups as indicators of changing environmental conditions to complement the traditional taxonomic approach.

AB  - To determine the relationship between the spatial dinoflagellate cyst distribution and oceanic environmental conditions, 34 surface sediments from the Eastern and Western Mediterranean Sea have been investigated for their dinoflagellate cyst content. Multivariate ordination analyses identified sea-surface temperature, chlorophyll-a, nitrate concentration, salinity, and bottom oxygen concentration as the main factors affecting dinoflagellate cyst distribution in the region. Based on the relative abundance data, two associations can be distinguished that can be linked with major oceanographic settings. (1) An offshore eastern Mediterranean regime where surface sediments are characterized by oligotrophic, warm, saline surface water, and high oxygen bottom water concentrations (Impagidinium species, Nematosphaeropsis labyrinthus, Pyxidinopsis reticulata and Operculodinium israelianum). Based on the absolute abundance, temperature is positively related to the cyst accumulation of Operculodinium israelianum. Temperature does not form a causal factor influencing the accumulation rate of the other species in this association. Impagidinium species and Nematosphaeropsis labyrinthus show a positive relationship between cyst accumulation and nitrate availability in the upper waters. (2) Species of association 2 have highest relative abundances in the Western Mediterranean Sea, Strait of Sicily/NW Ionian Sea, and/or the distal ends of the Po/Nile/ Rhone River plumes. At these stations, surface waters are characterized by (relative to the other regime) higher productivity associated with lower sea-surface temperature, salinity, and lower bottom water oxygen concentrations (Selenopemphix nephroides, Echinidinium spp., Selenopemphix quanta, Quinquecuspis concreta, Brigantedinium spp. and Lingulodinium machaerophorum). Based on both the absolute and relative abundances, Selenopemphix nephroides is suggested to be a suitable indicator to trace changes in the trophic state of the upper waters. The distribution of Lingulodinium machaerophorum is related to the presence of river-influenced surface waters, notably the Nile River. We suggest that this species might form a suitable marker to trace past variations in river discharge, notably from the Nile.

AB  - An increasing number of reports discuss the role reactive oxygen species (ROS) have in cellular pathologies and cellular signaling processes. Critical to elucidating the underlying chemical mechanism behind these biological processes is the development of novel sensors and reporters with chemical sensitivity and, more importantly, molecular specificity, enabling the spatial and temporal monitoring of a specific ROS concentration in live cells. Here we report for the first time on the application of BODIPY-alpha-Tocopherol adduct (B-TOH), a novel lipophilic fluorescent antioxidant indicator, toward detection of peroxyl radicals in model lipid membranes and their imaging in the lipid membrane of live cells. Studies conducted in model lipid membranes show a 5-fold fluorescence enhancement upon reaction of liposome-embedded B-TOH with peroxyl radicals. The enhancement is independent of the solution pH and membrane composition. In studies in live cells performed under states of growth factor withdrawal and increased oxidative stress, a significant increase in B-TOH emission was also observed. Exogenous sources of free radicals were utilized herein, namely, N,N'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium dichloride (also known as methyl viologen or paraquat) and uncoated nonemissive CdTe nanoparticles, a source of Cd2+. The recorded fluorescence intensity of B-TOH was proportional to the concentration of the dye and to the level of cellular oxidative stress. By employing fluorescent dyes such as Lysotracker and Nile Red, we demonstrate the formation of peroxyl radicals in subcellular locations in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12 cells) and in primary mouse hippocampal neural cells under oxidative stress conditions. Specifically, we observed peroxyl radicals in lysosomes. The assessment of the subcellular distribution of B-TOH in living cells deprived from growth factors and/or under oxidative stress may be useful in the future in determining subcellular sites of lipid peroxidation. In summary, results from this study underscore the potential of B-TOH as a sensitive and specific probe enabling the molecular imaging of peroxyl radicals in the lipid membranes of live cells.

AB  - Eighteen important Quaternary loess paleosoil sites have been studied across the European loess belt. They included approximately 50 buried soils, the over and/or underlying loess and the present-day surface soils (where possible). From the numerous types of secondary CaCO3 accumulations recognized, only the small scale accumulations are discussed in this paper, including calcified root cells, CaCO3 hypocoatings, needle-fiber calcite, powdery calcite coatings, earthworm biospheroliths, and calcite pseudomorphs on gypsum. Most of the features studied are found in the rhizosphere microecosystem. Each of these features showed a unique relationship with organic matter, micro-organism and plant distribution, moisture and leaching processes. For example, the exceptional abundance of calcified root cells is an indicator of a long stability of soil surface during favorable climatic conditions. Needle-fiber calcite is related to biomineralization of saprophytes in soils with sufficient moisture and decomposing organic matter. The presence of powdery calcite coatings covering clay and Mn coatings in non-calcareous soils indicates a change from leaching to non-leaching soil moisture regimes, Earthworm biospheroids provide arguments for a relative stability of the soil surface, without rapid burial processes or drastic, prolonged water stress. Finally, gypsum pseudomorphs are indicators of changes in local climatic parameters. In addition to a discussion of the genesis and the dynamics of the various accumulations, several examples are given to show how these accumulations can be used as indicators of a changing environment, such as renewed loess deposition, the extent of drought or varying intensity of leaching during the year, To conclude, various forms of small scale secondary CaCO3 accumulations are common in the loess paleosoils and each type has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the evolution of the paleoenvironment. Therefore, it is proposed that their individual presence or absence throughout the pedostratigraphical levels and throughout the (paleo)topography should be recorded at all scales of observation.

AB  - This paper contains a description of the procedure for monitoring the cytoplasmic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+](i)) from intact neurones and glial cells in acutely isolated cerebellar slices. The loading of cells with the calcium indicator fura-2. was achieved by slice incubation in Tyrode solution containing 5 mu M fura-2 acetoxymethylester (fura-2/AM) and 0.02% (w/v) pluronic-F127 under a controlled (temperature, 35 degrees C; humidity, 98%; and gas, 5% O-2 + 95% CO2) environment. In such conditions, different cellular elements of the cerebellum (namely granule neurones, Bergmann glial cells and Purkinje neurones) acquired fura-2 at different rates. Ten minutes of slice incubation gave adequate staining of granule neurones only, 20 min of incubation allowed calcium-dependent changes of fluorescence signal measurements in Bergmann glial cells, whereas loading of Purkinje neurones required 40 min of slice exposure to fura-2/AM. In order to assure dye deesterification, slices were kept in continuously gassed bicarbonate-buffered solution for not less than 1 h thereafter. The fluorescence signals (excited at 360 and 380 nm) were collected from either a 25-mu m or 40-mu m area limited by fixed diaphragm inserted in front of the photomultiplier tube; an individual cell was positioned in approximately the centre of the fluorescence measurement area. These signals were comprised of [Ca2+](i)-related changes in fura-2 fluorescence recorded from a cell of interest and background fluorescence. The latter resulted from the summation of slice autofluorescence, signals from the fura-2 acquired by neighbouring tissue and signals from fura-2 compartmentalized by intracellular organelles. After the end of fluorescence recordings, the cell was internally dialysed with dye-free intracellular solution in order to determine the actual levels of background fluorescence. In parallel, electrophysiological properties were determined, allowing identification of cell type and viability. The background fluorescence values were then used to correct fluorescence recordings by subtraction from original traces. Corrected records were used for [Ca2+](i) calculation.

AB  - In order to investigate the effects of PCBs on biotransformation enzymes and metabolism, 4-week-old common elder ducklings were exposed to single ip doses of 3,3',4,4' tetrachloro-biphenyl (CB 77) (5 or 50 mg/kg) or the technical mixture Clophen A50 (Clo A50) (50 or 200 mg/kg). The control group was injected with corn oil only (5 ml/kg). Comparison of CB patterns in adipose tissue of the Clo A50 injected groups with the original Clo A50 mixture revealed specific reduction of congeners with vicinal H atoms in the meta and para positions, suggesting biotransformation by the monooxygenase system (MO) as the most probable cause. For the group injected with 200 mg Clo A50, a difference in congener pattern was shown between liver and adipose tissue. This indicates either a saturation of the hepatic biotransformation capacity, or slow redistribution of the congeners from the adipose tissue to the site of metabolism (liver). Using only one adipose tissue concentration point in time, indicative biological half-lives for metabolisable congeners were calculated from congener pattern changes, ranging from 3.6 days for CB 44 to 16.1 days for CB 101. CB 77 caused a dose-dependent induction of total cytochrome P450, whole liver cytochrome P450, EROD and PROD activity. On the contrary, Clo A50 had no inducing effects after this specific incubation period. PROD activity measurements suggest that the PROD assay may not be not a suitable indicator for CYP2B induction in common elder ducklings. Sex difference and parasitic infection had no influence on the biochemical responses measured. Internal dose-induction response curves were established; a very tentative maximum no effect level on toxic equivalents (TEQ) basis is suggested (7 ng TEQ/g lipid). Under these incubation conditions, exposure to CB 77 and Clophen A50 did not influence the infection rates of the intestinal parasite Polymorphus botulus (Acanthocephala).

AB  - Bottom sediments in surficial and short-core samples collected in different parts of highly polluted Mariut Lake, Nile Delta, EgyPt, record th, increased anthropogenic influence during the past century. The study is based on identification of lithofacies in shot-core sections integrated with petrographic analyses of grain size and composition of the sand-size fraction in both core and surficial samples. Most Mariut lacustrine subfacies that date back to the last century me similar to those in modern Nile Delta lagoons (Idku, Burullus, Manzala), and also to older lagoon deposits examined in Holocene core sections. During this century, the lake has become artificially separated into three distinct regions, each with different petrologic attributes. These differences are a function of both natural and man-influenced factors in the three settings: sabkha-desert conditions prevail in the topographically most isolated western sector southwest of Alexandria; totally enclosed artificial salt ponds in the central sector, south of Alexandria's industrial complex, into which waters are pumped from the sea; and much lower salinity sub-basins in ea.tern Mariut which receive large, amounts of fresh water, much of it polluted, through a series of canals, sewage outfalls and drains. With time, there have been lake-wide changes such as decreased proportions of benthic fauna, including molluscs.  Marked variations related to specific sub-basins include the formation of very dark, distinctly layered sediment subfacies in central Mariut, and deposits rich in bio-precipitate carbonate and plant debris in the eastern put of the lake. These latter water plant-related carbonate crusts are herein interpreted as indicators of increased pollution and eutrophication. The much increased domestic, industrial and agricultural wastes discharged into Mariut, particularly in eastern sub-basins, have serious potential consequences for the large, rapidly growing population of the Alexandria region. Closely integrated sedimentological and geochemical study of bottom sediments should be carried out to carefully monitor anthropogenic related changes.

AB  - Plant control of rhizosphere pH is important for nutrient mobilization and uptake, and also affects microbial activity and pathogens in the vicinity of the root. Limited information is available on the ability of plant species and genotypes within a species to induce pH changes in the rhizosphere. A growth chamber study was conducted to characterize patterns of pH change within the rhizosphere of selected genotypes in an alkaline environment with a balanced nutrient supply. After germination in incubators, seedlings of 32 genotypes of maize (Zea mays L.), soybean (Glycine max. L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), sordan [sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), sudangrass (Sorghum sudanese L.) hybrid], wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), oats (Avena sativa L.), and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) were transferred into aseptic agar medium (pH 7.6) with bromocresol purple indicator. Ability of the embedded roots to induce rhizosphere pH change was followed by photographing the color change of the bromocresol purple indicator. The pH for selected genotypes at different root zones (maturation, elongation, meristematic) was also monitored by a microelectrode at l-, 2-, 3- and 4-mm distances from the root surface. Rhizosphere acidification for selected genotypes within a species were in the order: soybean, Hawkeye > PI-54169; maize, Pioneer-3737 > Pioneer-3732 > CM-37; sordan, S-757 > S-333; sorghum, SC-33-8-9EY congruent-to SC-1 18-15E; barley, Bowman > Primus 11; oats, Hytest > SD-84104. The pH patterns within the root system varied from species to species. The highest amount of acidification was found at the elongation and meristematic zones for soybean, while the highest amount of acidification was found at the maturation zone for barley under the same experimental conditions. The agar method allowed the determination of a genotype's capability to induce rhizosphere pH changes while the microelectrode method is necessary for quantifying the spatial variation of specific root developmental zones with high resolution.

AB  - Hundreds of kilometres of West Tennessee streams have been channelized since the turn of the century. After a stream is straightened, dredged, or cleared, basin-wide ecologic, hydrologic, and geomorphic processes bring about an integrated, characteristic recovery sequence. The rapid pace of channel responses to channelization provides an opportunity to document and interpret vegetation recovery patterns relative to otherwise long-term, concomitant evolution of river geomorphology. Nearly 150 sites along 15 streams were studied in the Obion, Forked Deer, Hatchie, and Wolf River basins. Channels of these streams, except that of the Hatchie River main stem, have undergone major modifications along all or parts of their courses. This paper presents the eco-geomorphic analyses and interpretation of a large multidisciplinary study, with special reference to the interrelated hydrogeomorphic aspects of channel recovery. Quantitative plant ecological analyses were conducted to infer relative bank stability, to identify indicator recovery species, and to determine patterns of vegetation development through the course of accelerated channel evolution. Binary-discriminant and ordination analyses show that distinctive riparian-species patterns reflect a six-stage model of channel evolution and can be used to infer channel stability and hydrogeomorphic conditions. Woody vegetation initially establishes on low- and mid-bank surfaces at the same location and time that bank accretion begins, and corresponds to the site of initial geomorphic restabilization. The linkage of channel bed aggradation, woody vegetation establishment, and bank accretion all lead to recovery of the channel. Pioneer species are hardy and fast growing, and can tolerate moderate amounts of slope instability and sediment deposition; these species include river birch (Betula nigra), black willow (Salix nigra), boxelder (Acer negundo), and silver maple (Acer saccharinum). High stem densities and root-mass development appear to enhance bank stability. Tree-ring analyses suggest that on average 65 yr may be required for recovery after channelization.

AB  - In the turkey fattening two-line crossbreds from proper breeding are used in the Czech Republic. Sire and dam lines are bred to a certain level for utility properties.  Paternal lines selection is focussed expecially on the growth intensity, while maternal lines selection mainly on egg laying. During this kind of breeding an additive component of genotype variability is used, where changes m muscles, skeleton growth and fat content also correspond to changes in live weight.
   The aim of this experiment was to evaluate characteristics of meat efficiency of turkey parental lines and their hybrid under the equal conditions and in relation to the breeding aim.
   300 one-day old turkey chicks were included in the experiment. Turkey chicks were divided into three groups according to genotype. Hundred turkey chicks were in the group and each group included four repetitions. In the first group there were turkey chicks of paternal line 79, where the growth intensity, measured by live weight in the 84th day of their life, is the main selection criterion. During breeding a directional type of selection, a combined method, is applied. The group II represented turkey chicks of maternal line 72, which is selected on egg laying, determined by number of eggs layed in the course of 140 days. For egg laying a directional type of selection, a combined method, is applied, during selection on growth a stabilization selection is used. In the group III crossbreds of both lines are used.
   Turkey clucks were housed on a fitter in the house devided into 12 boxes. During the experiment a day of 24 hours of light was used. Till the age of 42 days the KR I feed mixture was fed, in the period between the age of 43 to 84 days the KR II mixture was fed and to turkeys of the age between 85 to 140 days the KR III mixture (Tab. I) was administered.  Turkey hens were fed up to the age of 84 days and turkey cocks up to the age of 140 days.
   At the age of 8.4 days a carcass analysis for four turkey cocks and four turkey hens from the group was carried out. Carcass analysis was performed for turkey cocks at the age of 140 days - always for five turkey cocks from the group. In the carcass analyses breast and thigh muscles are presented without skin. Through chemical analyses dry matter, crude protein and fat were determined in the breast and thigh muscles.
   Feeding experiment was supplemented with nitrogen balance and growth test to the age of 21 days for.36 turkey chicks. In each group there were three repetitions, each with four turkey chicks. Turkey chicks were housed m one-floor balance cages.  Balance retention of nitrogen was observed at the age from seven to fourteen days. All conditions of the external environment were coincident with feeding experiment.
   According to the results of growth (Tab. IV) there are obvious significant differencies (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) in live weight of particular groups at the age of 84 days. In accordance with breeding purpose the highest live weight was found in paternal line 79 (5985 g) and the lowest in maternal line 72 (4177 g). Growth of turkey chicks of the third group of final hybrid was intermediary in relation to parents (5037 g). The differencies presented were preserved also at the age of 140 days. Also feed consumption per 1 kg of gain (2.05 kg, 2.66 kg, 2.39 kg) was connected with the growth of turkey chicks. The differencies among groups were statistically insignificant.  Carcass analysis (Tab. VII and VIII), especially in relation to muscles share, shows the same differencies among the groups, where the paternal tine had significantly higher (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) muscles share of the live weight (40.52 %) in comparison with maternal line (38.21 %). Content of abdominal fat and fat content in the breast and thigh muscles is at certain variance with these results. The highest fat content was almost always found out in the third group in final hybrid. It is obvious from the results, that an additive genotype component is considerably applied for the indicators observed and that the selection method used during breeding the paternal and maternal population corresponds to breeding purpose. Nitrogen balance showed that the turkey chicks of final hybrid are taking nitrogen worse than parental lines.

AB  - The geochemical characteristics of sulfur and nitrogen contents and isotopic compositions in a special coal, the Late Permian bark coal of southern China, were investigated by systematic petrographic and geochemical methods. The results show that barkinite is the major maceral component in the test samples, ranging from 12.4% to 76.4%. Increasing S-org and decreasing S-py contents with rising barkinite contents imply that the precursor plants of bark coal have a significant influence on the sulfur occurrence. The delta S-34 values of organic and pyritic sulfur for bark coal vary from-12.8 parts per thousand to +10.9 parts per thousand and -5.4 parts per thousand to +11.5 parts per thousand, respectively. High sulfur concentration (>2%) but rather variable 834S(org) values for Mingshan and Changguang coal seams suggest different sources of biogenic and non-biogenic secondary sulfur, respectively. Related delta N-15 values in bark coal range from 1.6 parts per thousand to 5.6 parts per thousand, with an average of 3.0 parts per thousand. The delta N-15 values within the same coal seam profile display inhomogeneous features, with a maximum deviation of 2.5 parts per thousand, indicating some degree of microbial degradation during the peat accumulation stage. According to the distributions of delta N-15 vs delta S-34(org) and S-py, the three bark coal seams MS, CG1, and CG2 may have resulted from different coal-forming systems. For the MS coal seam, negative delta S-34(org) values and large positive delta N-15 values resulted from incomplete denitrification coexisting with strong bacterial sulfate reduction. As the coal-forming system altered from an open to a closed state and the water column changed towards anoxic conditions, N-fixation and nitrification, as well as the suppression of bacterial sulfate reduction, occurred for the CG coal seams, causing positive delta S-34(org) values but gradually negative delta N-15 values in the bark coal of these seams.

AB  - The main objective of the article is to evaluate the investment activity of large cities in Poland in the area of developing a low-carbon economy in 2014-2020, co-financed by European Union funds. This article poses several research questions, namely: Do large cities with environmental problems actively obtain EU funding to develop a low-carbon economy? What are the main socio-economic and environmental determinants of the level of the EU funding absorption among large cities in the research area? The empirical research was conducted on the basis of the data from the Ministry of Investment and Economic Development in Poland, which is responsible for the implementation of cohesion policy funds and from the Local Data Bank of Statistics Poland. Under the 2014-2020 perspective, 223 such projects have been implemented for a total of PLN 21 billion (EUR 4.74 billion). The projects focused on: transportation, electricity, gaseous fuels, steam, hot water and air for air conditioning systems, and environmental and climate change activities. In terms of both the number and the value of EU funds spent, great variation has been observed. Analysis of the correlation relationships showed a highly positive correlation between selected indicators of investment activity in the field of low-carbon economy co-financed by EU funds (especially taking into account the value of investments per area) and socio-economic indicators of Polish metropolises. Metropolises with high demographic, economic, and financial potential have proven to be more effective beneficiaries. Interestingly, no correlation was found between investment activity in the low-carbon economy and the level of environment pollution in large cities. This means that, unfortunately, pro-environmental activities depend on the state of finances of the cities, and not necessarily on the actual needs, even taking into account the fact that the EU covers a large proportion of the costs.

AB  - Citizen science is essential for nationwide ecological surveys of species distribution. While the accuracy of the information collected by beginner participants is not guaranteed, it is important to develop an automated system to assist species identification. Deep learning techniques for image recognition have been successfully applied in many fields and may contribute to species identification. However, deep learning techniques have not been utilized in ecological surveys of citizen science, because they require the collection of a large number of images, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To counter these issues, we propose a simple and effective strategy to construct species identification systems using fewer images. As an example, we collected 4,571 images of 204 species of Japanese dragonflies and damselflies from open-access websites (i.e., web scraping) and scanned 4,005 images from books and specimens for species identification. In addition, we obtained field occurrence records (i.e., range of distribution) of all species of dragonflies and damselflies from the National Biodiversity Center, Japan. Using the images and records, we developed a species identification system for Japanese dragonflies and damselflies. We validated that the accuracy of the species identification system was improved by combining web-scraped and scanned images; the top-1 accuracy of the system was 0.324 when trained using only web-scraped images, whereas it improved to 0.546 when trained using both web-scraped and scanned images. In addition, the combination of images and field occurrence records further improved the top-1 accuracy to 0.668. The values of top-3 accuracy under the three conditions were 0.565, 0.768, and 0.873, respectively. Thus, combining images with field occurrence records markedly improved the accuracy of the species identification system. The strategy of species identification proposed in this study can be applied to any group of organisms. Furthermore, it has the potential to strike a balance between continuously recruiting beginner participants and updating the data accuracy of citizen science.

AB  - The lacustrine black shales of the Chang 7 member are the main source rocks and the most important unconventional (shale oil) petroleum resources in the Ordos Basin, North China. A series of continuous core samples was analysed for main, trace, and rare earth elements. The development of thin or laminar tuffs and tuffaceous mudstones and the enrichment of Fe, Mn, and other elements demonstrate that the Chang 7 member was influenced by event deposition, such as volcanic and hydrothermal activity. The ancient lake had brackish water and a relatively high sedimentation rate during the deposition of the Chang 7 member. The palaeoclimate in the early stage was warmer and wetter than that in the middle-late stage of the Chang 7 period. The geochemical proxies for palaeoproductivity and palaeoredox indicate that the ancient lake had a relatively high primary productivity with an anoxic to euxinic sulphide bottom water in the Chang 7(3) stage, which decreased to dyoxicoxic water during the Chang 7(1+2) periods. A parameter dataset comprising 11 elemental proxies related to the reconstruction or evaluation of the depositional environment and palaeoproductivity was analysed using principal component analysis (PCA). The first principal component (PC1) accounted for 59.88% of the total variance in the original dataset and mainly represented the characteristics of palaeoproductivity and redox conditions; thus, it can be interpreted as an indicator of these factors. Based on the excellent positive linear correlation between the total organic matter content of the Chang 7 samples and the PC1 scores, the enrichment of organic matter in the Chang 7 member was mainly controlled by palaeoproductivity and the preservation environment. PCA is an effective method for dimensionality reduction and visualisation of multi-element geochemical data, which allows for a more comprehensive and in-depth understanding of geological samples. This work provides a practical application of chemometrics in elemental geochemistry. This can serve as a model for other studies.

AB  - Simple Summary The effects of lighting wavelength on the behavior of laying hens are not yet completely known. This study observed three groups of birds housed under different lighting colors (blue, green, and red) for 90 days. Important differences were found regarding the unrest and cluster behaviors of the birds. It was found that, at shorter wavelengths (blue light), birds became more agitated, while, at longer wavelengths (red light), birds became more clustered. When subjected to cold or heat stress, birds expressed unrest and cluster behaviors in different ways, indicating that further studies should be conducted to better clarify the effects of lighting on the behavior and well-being of laying hens. Laying hens are affected by the intensity, wavelength, and duration of light, and the behavioral patterns of these animals are important indicators of stress. The objective of the present study was to evaluate cluster and unrest behaviors of lying hens submitted to three environments with different treatments of monochromatic lighting (blue, green, and red). For 29 weeks, 60 laying hens from the Lohmann variety were divided into three groups and monitored by surveillance cameras installed on each shed ceiling and directed to the floor. Each group was housed in a small-scale shed and maintained under a monochromatic lighting treatment. The recordings were made at two times of the day, 15 min in the morning and 15 min in the afternoon, and the videos were processed, segmented, and analyzed computationally. From the analysis of the images, the cluster and unrest indexes were calculated. The results showed the influence of lighting on these behaviors, displaying that the birds were more agitated in the treatments with shorter wavelengths. Cluster behavior was higher in birds housed under red light. There was an interaction between the lighting treatments and the thermal environment, indicating that more studies should be carried out in this area to better understand these behavioral changes.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder mainly characterized by memory loss with deficits in other cognitive domains, including language, visuospatial abilities, and changes in behavior. Detecting diagnostic biomarkers that are noninvasive and cost-effective is of great value not only for clinical assessments and diagnostics but also for research purposes. Several previous studies have investigated AD diagnosis via the acoustic, lexical, syntactic, and semantic aspects of speech and language. Other studies include approaches from conversation analysis that look at more interactional aspects, showing that disfluencies such as fillers and repairs, and purely nonverbal features such as inter-speaker silence, can be key features of AD conversations. These kinds of features, if useful for diagnosis, may have many advantages: They are simple to extract and relatively language-, topic-, and task-independent. This study aims to quantify the role and contribution of these features of interaction structure in predicting whether a dialogue participant has AD. We used a subset of the Carolinas Conversation Collection dataset of patients with AD at moderate stage within the age range 60-89 and similar-aged non-AD patients with other health conditions. Our feature analysis comprised two sets: disfluency features, including indicators such as self-repairs and fillers, and interactional features, including overlaps, turn-taking behavior, and distributions of different types of silence both within patient speech and between patient and interviewer speech. Statistical analysis showed significant differences between AD and non-AD groups for several disfluency features (edit terms, verbatim repeats, and substitutions) and interactional features (lapses, gaps, attributable silences, turn switches per minute, standardized phonation time, and turn length). For the classification of AD patient conversations vs. non-AD patient conversations, we achieved 83% accuracy with disfluency features, 83% accuracy with interactional features, and an overall accuracy of 90% when combining both feature sets using support vector machine classifiers. The discriminative power of these features, perhaps combined with more conventional linguistic features, therefore shows potential for integration into noninvasive clinical assessments for AD at advanced stages.

AB  - Intensive loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantation management in the southeastern United States includes mid-rotation silvicultural practices (MRSP) like thinning, fertilization, competitive vegetation control, and their combinations. Consistent and well-designed long-term studies considering interactions of MRSP are required to produce accurate projections and evaluate management decisions. Here we use longitudinal data from the regional Mid-Rotation Treatment study established by the Plantation Management Research Cooperative (PMRC) at the University of Georgia across the southeast U.S. to fit and validate a new dynamic model system rooted in theoretical and biological principles. A Weibull pdf was used as a modifier function coupled with the basal area growth model. The growth model system and error projection functions were estimated simultaneously. The new formulation results in a compatible and consistent growth and yield system and provides temporal responses to treatment. The results indicated that the model projections reproduce the observed behavior of stand characteristics. The model has high predictive accuracy (the cross-validation variance explained was 96.2%, 99.7%, and 98.6%; and the prediction root mean square distance was 0.704 m, 19.1 trees ha(-1), and 1.03 m(2)ha(-1) for dominant height (DH), trees per hectare (N), and basal area (BA), respectively), and can be used to project the current stand attributes following combinations of MRSP and with different thinning intensities. Simulations across southern physiographic regions allow us to conclude that the most overall ranking of MRSP after thinning is fertilization + competitive vegetation control (Fert + CVC) > fertilization only (Fert) > competitive vegetation control only (CVC), and Fert + CVC show less than additive effect. Because of the model structure, the response to treatment changes with location, age of application, and dominant height growth as indicators of site quality. Therefore, the proposed model adequately represents regional growth conditions.

AB  - Assessment and management of effluent discharges are key to avoiding environmental deterioration. Often compliance with discharge regulations and permits is based on a limited set of chemical parameters, while information on whole effluent hazardous properties (toxicity, bioaccumulation potential, persistence) and environmental risks is lacking. The need to collect those data and to become more effective in quickly identifying high-risk activities, without extensive laboratory testing, has led to the development of screening tools to complement information on chemical composition. A simple, Tier 1 screening "toolbox" is proposed which is comprised of solid-phase microextraction with gas chromatographic (SPME-GC) analysis, the in-vitro ecotoxicity assay Microtox, and a simple weathering assay. When combined with dilution modeling, screening-level risk assessments can be performed, providing additional lines of evidence to support a weight of evidence type of analysis. Application of the toolbox enables prioritization of discharges that may be deemed to require higher tier assessment. The toolbox was trialed on a number of produced water samples collected from offshore oil and gas facilities and effluents from petroleum processing and manufacturing sites. In contrast to what has been reported for petroleum products, results showed only moderate correlation between bioavailable hydrocarbons (bHCs) and toxicity, which might be related to the possible presence of toxic contaminants from other chemical classes or to methodological issues such as suboptimal conditions during transport. The methods employed were quick, inexpensive, and simple to conduct. They require relatively small volumes of sample, which is especially advantageous when evaluating discharges from remote offshore facilities. The toolbox adds valuable information on whole effluent properties to existing data, for example, on chemical composition, which can improve understanding of which discharges are more likely to pose a risk to the environment and so require further investigation or risk management.

AB  - The drought has enormous adverse effects on agriculture, water resources and environment, and causes damages around the world. Drought risk assessment and prioritization of drought management can help decision makers and planners to manage the adverse effects of drought. This paper aims to determine the risk of drought in Iran. At the first stage, standardized precipitation index (SPI) was calculated for the period 1981-2016. Then the probability map of different drought classes or drought hazard probability map were prepared. After that the indicator-based vulnerability assessment method was used to determine the drought vulnerability index. Five indices including climate, topography, waterway density, land use and groundwater resources were chosen as the most critical factors of drought in Iran and followed by the analytical hierarchy process questionnaire, the weights of each index were obtained based on expert opinions. Fuzzy membership maps of each index and sub-index were prepared using ArcGIS software. The drought vulnerability map of Iran was plotted using these weights and maps of each indicator. Finally, the drought risk map of Iran was provided by multiplying drought hazard and vulnerability maps. According to the 43-completed questionnaires by experts, climate index has the highest vulnerability to drought. Climate does not have an important role in drought hazard index, but it is the most crucial factor to classified drought vulnerability index. The results showed that central, northeast, southeast and west parts of Iran are at high risks of drought. There are regions with different risks in Iran due to unusual weather and climatic conditions. We realized that the climate and the groundwater situation is almost the same in the central, east and south parts of Iran, because the land use plays a crucial role in the drought vulnerability and risk in these areas. The drought risk decreases from the center of Iran to the southwest and northwest.

AB  - Sexually and socially selected signals are predicated to express the present and past condition of individuals and thereby their capacity to cope with environmental challenges. The concentration of corticosterone in feathers (CORTf) has been validated as a marker of activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis in birds during feather development. Measurements of CORTf can thus express the physiological stress of migratory birds during non-breeding periods of the annual cycle when feathers moulted in the wintering range are analysed. Thus, negative trends of ornament expression with CORTf may be predicted. Unpigmented plumage patches may constitute signals of phenotypic quality and are used in many species in social interactions by both sexes. Pied Flycatchers of both sexes Ficedula hypoleuca show white forehead and wing patches during the breeding season, of which the forehead and part of the wing patch (tertials) are moulted on the wintering grounds before spring migration. These patches are used as signals in social and sexual interactions and their expression has been previously related to several indicators of physiological status. We collected tertials of females during nestling provisioning in a Spanish population and determined their CORTf in the laboratory. CORTf was thus measured in some of the prenuptially moulted feathers used as signals of social dominance by breeding females. According to AICc model selection, CORTf turned up in all the best models explaining forehead patch size and in most best models for wing patch size when controlling for age and size. Both forehead and wing patch sizes were negatively related to CORTf, although the trend for wing patch size was not significant. This indicates that breeding females expressing large unpigmented patches experienced low levels of stress during the prenuptial moult in their winter quarters, or that strongly signalling individuals present a lower level of activation of the HPA axis.

AB  - Grazing exclusion has been proved to be an effective approach for naturally restoring degraded rangelands. Still, the effect of this management practice on plant community composition and structure is ambiguous, especially under prolonged and repeated drought events. Here, we investigated the responses of community composition (i.e. incidence-based) and structure (i.e. abundance-based) to short-term sheep grazing exclusion under severe drought episode in the arid steppes of Alfa-grass (Stipa tenacissima L.) with a long evolutionary history of grazing. Individual species responses were tested based on species occurrence and abundance in either grazed or grazing-excluded steppes. Besides, indicator species analysis was used to identify species indicative of grazing-excluded steppes. Likewise, incidence-based and abundance-based alpha-diversity, beta-diversity and functional groups' diversities were quantified using Hill Numbers and compared between the two steppe managements types. Under severe drought conditions, sheep grazing exclusion allowed the apparition of a large number of increasers, colonizers, and native indicator plant species. It also improved the size of regional species pool and increased overall incidence-based and abundance-based alpha-diversity. Moreover, grazing exclusion decreased the abundance-based beta-diversity at local scale but increased it at landscape scale. The incidence-based beta-diversity significantly decreased at the landscape scale. Grazing exclusion enabled a significant spatial structuration of abundance-based beta-diversity components by maintaining high balanced variation in species abundance at large spatial scale and greater abundance-gradient at fine-scale. Our results suggest that the implementation of shortterm grazing exclusion in arid steppes would be the appropriate management practice for vegetation and habitat during prolonged droughts since it permits the recovery of native plant species and affects positively the size of the regional species pool, the overall incidenceand abundance-based alpha-diversity as well as the abundance-based beta-diversity (chiefly at landscape scale).

AB  - Detailed maps of vegetation facilitate spatial conservation planning. Such information can be difficult to map from remotely sensed data with the detail (thematic resolution) required for ecological applications.
   For grass-dominated habitats in the South-East of the UK, it was evaluated which of the following choices improved classification accuracies at various thematic resolutions: 1) Hyperspectral data versus data with a reduced spectral resolution of eight and 13 bands, which were simulated from the hyperspectral data. 2) A vegetation classification system using a detailed description of vegetation (sub)communities (the British National Vegetation Classification, NVC) versus clustering based on the dominant plant species (Dom-Species). 3) The month of imagery acquisition.
   Hyperspectral data produced the highest accuracies for vegetation away from edges using the NVC (84-87%). Simulated 13-band data performed also well (83-86% accuracy). Simulated 8-band data performed poorer at finer thematic resolutions (77-78% accuracy), but produced accuracies similar to those from simulated 13-band or hyperspectral data for coarser thematic resolutions (82-86%). Grouping vegetation by NVC (84-87% accuracy for hyperspectral data) usually achieved higher accuracies compared to Dom-Species (81-84% for hyperspectral data). Highest discrimination rates were achieved around the time vegetation was fully developed.
   The results suggest that using a detailed description of vegetation (sub)-communities instead of one based on the dominating species can result in more accurate mapping. The NVC may reflect differences in site conditions in addition to differences in the composition of dominant species, which may benefit vegetation classification. The results also suggest that using hyperspectral data or the 13-band multispectral data can help to achieve the fine thematic resolutions that are often required in ecological applications. Accurate vegetation maps with a high thematic resolution can benefit a range of applications, such as species and habitat conservation. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Due to the increasing freshwater deterioration and demand for irrigation, there is pressing need to reclaim and reuse wastewater for agricultural operations. While this practice is gaining significant traction in developed world, it is quite rare in most developing countries with inadequate or no functional sewerage facilities and treatment systems at both municipal and industrial levels occasioned by high investment and operational costs. Consequently, wastewaters generated are in complex heterogenous mix of industrial, domestic, municipal and agricultural runoff wastewater. Biological technologies which utilize the expertise of microorganisms are considered robust, efficient and economically attractive for treatment of wide range of wastewaters and they have high suitability in developing countries. This work therefore assessed the potential of suspended growth biological process (SGBP) for reclamation and reuse of mixed wastewater composed a mixture of domestic effluent, pharmaceutical, textile, petroleum discharges and agricultural runoff for irrigation of edible crops (lettuce and beets) with plants phenological parameters as measuring indicators. The germination and phenological characteristics of crops were studied in a hydroponic unit under four irrigation regimes: tap water as control, mixed wastewater, SGBP treated wastewater, and tap water mixed with nutrient solution as upper control, for a duration of 45-d. The results proved that the SGBP treated wastewater had no negative impact on germination responses of the seed crops. However, residual recalcitrant compounds caused early stunted growth in plant root systems with resultant limited access to nutrients. Consequently, plant vegetative growth and phenological development as well as chlorophyll production were reduced. In comparison to nutrients supplemented solution, nutrients deficiency and imbalance in treated wastewater contributed to the poor development in irrigated plants. The outcomes of seed germination and plant growth experiments show a positive indication for reuse of mixed wastewater in agriculture. However, there is need for further research to explore the long-term benefits and limitations of reusing such treated wastewater.

AB  - Changes in the intensity of the influx of the Tsushima Warm Current (TWC) in the south-central part of the Japan Sea (JS), or East Sea in Korean, were reconstructed for the last 460 kyr at IODP Site U1427 using the composition and abundance of the coccolithophore assemblage. In addition, the recent distribution of coccolithophore taxa in the JS and the East China Sea was assessed using electron microscopy.
   Coccolithophore assemblages, dominated by Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa species, and coccolith abundance reveal a strong relationship between sea level and ocean variability over the last five glacial/interglacial cycles, in good agreement with planktic foraminiferal data. Three different circulation modes based on calcareous nannofossil and foraminifera TWC indicators were proposed for the JS. Coccolith production was low and TWC indicators (i.e., Gephyrocapsa oceanica, Catcidiscus leptoporus s.l., and Helicosphaera carteri) absent due to the isolation of the JS during glacials in response to global sea level falls (Mode 1). In contrast, coccolith abundance and TWC indicators reach a maximum due to the most intense TWC flow through the Tsushima Strait during interglacials (Mode 3). Intermediate conditions (Mode 2) are characterized by moderate/high coccolith numbers, presence of TWC coccolith indicators, and rare TWC planktic foraminifera indicators. This mode resulted in intermittent variations in the contribution of the TWC and East China Sea coastal water due to relatively low sea level stands (ca. -90 m to -20 m). Coccoliths dominated the carbonate sequence prior to MIS 8 and were major contributors to the total carbonate of the sediment at Site U1427, suggesting high coccolithophore productivity and a bloom-type environment during MIS 11 and 9. These changes in the carbonate chemistry caused by glacio-eustacy in the JS at the northwest margin of the Pacific Ocean should be considered in future paleoceanographic and paleoclimate models.

AB  - Purpose Faced with the increasing threat from seawater intrusion, it is of great importance to explore the effect of the increase of water and salt on the coastal wetland soil quality. A simulation experiment was designed in this study to identify the impact of water and salt on soil quality in the coastal wetland of Jiaozhou Bay, China.
   Materials and methods Three soil quality indices were applied to investigate the influence of different water and salt conditions on soil quality. Every index was computed by applying the total data set (TDS) and minimum data set (MDS) methods. The TDS included nine soil quality properties determined in 96 samples including pH, bulk density (BD), total organic matter (TOM), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (AK), sucrase activity (SA), urease activity (UA), and alkaline phosphatase activity (APA). Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to selected indicators for MDS.
   Results and discussion Soil quality decreased with the increase of salt content, and it increased first and then decreased with the increased water content. The soil samples with 60% water content had the lowest quality. Meanwhile, the nutrient indicators and enzyme activity in these soil samples were also lower than those in the other water gradients. The results of soil quality classification showed that the soil quality was mostly reckoned as moderate quality (grade III) and below and only a fraction of these samples was grade I based on all indices.
   Conclusions The results showed that too much water and salt in soil can decrease soil quality, and the effect of water was more obvious than salt. The results of match and kappa statistical analyses indicated that soil quality estimated by the weighted additive soil quality index was more accurate than those estimated by the additive soil quality index and Nemoro soil quality index. Besides, the agreement values of TDS were higher than those of MDS.

AB  - Hydrocarbons with an Ediacaran-Early Cambrian origin from the central Sichuan Basin, South China were investigated for biomarker compositions. They were obtained by solvent extraction from the Upper Ediacaran reservoir core samples, which contain abundant solid bitumen. The solid bitumen is widely believed to be formed by thermal cracking of early-charged oils in the reservoirs, which have presumed source rocks of an Ediacaran-Early Cambrian age. Thermal maturity parameters based on phenanthrenes and aromatic steroids suggest a very high thermal maturity for the extracted hydrocarbons, which is consistent with the severe maturation undergone by their host reservoirs. Age-diagnostic biomarkers including C-30 24-isopropylcholestanes and mid-chain monomethyl alkalies support source rocks of an Ediacaran-Early Cambrian age. The extracted hydrocarbons have very similar biomarker signatures, which include high relative abundance of acyclic isoprenoids and pristane/phytane < 1; high abundance of 2a-methylhopanes; high abundance of C-27 to C-29 steranes with a slight preference for either C-27 or C-29 homologues; high relative abundance of diasteranes; the concomitant presence of 24-n-propyl and 24-isopropylcholestanes and 24-isopropy 1/2 4-n-propylcholestanes > 1; and the presence of C-26 norcholestanes, methyl- and ethyisteranes. The presence of hopanoids including extended series and methylhopanes indicates contributions from prokaryotic bacteria while the presence of various steroids including regular steranes and methylsteranes indicates contributions from the eukaryotic algae. Parameters based on tricyclic terpane and hopane, dibenzothiophene/phenanthrene ratios, and C-27 diasteranes/ (diasteranes + regular steranes) ratios suggest a major shale source, but a mixed shale-carbonate source cannot be completely excluded. Presence of C-30 demethylsteranes, low pristane/phytane ratios, high gammacerane index, and presence of 28,30-dinorhopane and 2-methyhopanes indicate that the source rocks were deposited in a stratified, anoxic marine depositional environment with enhanced salinity conditions.

AB  - HVAC systems account for more than 40% of energy consumption in buildings to provide satisfactory indoor environments for occupants. The integration of personalized thermal comfort in the operation of HVAC systems has been shown to be highly effective in enhancing energy efficiency of buildings. To this end, research efforts have proposed personalized thermal comfort assessment through voting (i.e., occupant feedback) and profiling as well as physiological response measurement. In this study, we have proposed a novel approach for enabling RGB video cameras as sensors for measuring personalized thermoregulation states - an indicator of thermal comfort. If their feasibility for thermoregulation state inference could be established, optical cameras provide a cost-effective and omnipresent solution for distributed measurement of thermal comfort and consequently control of HVAC systems for energy saving. Accordingly, we have proposed a framework that draws on the concepts of thermoregulation mechanisms in the human body as well as the Eulerian video magnification approach. The framework is composed of several components including face detection, skin pixels isolation, image magnification. And calculation of detection index to infer subtle blood flow variations to the facial skin surface (i.e., blood perfusion), which is due to thermoregulation adjustments. In order to minimize the impact of variable illumination condition and the ambient noise on the results, different combinations of methods for framework components were taken into account. The feasibility assessments were conducted through an experimental study with 21 participants under low (20 degrees C) and high (30 degrees C) temperatures. In total, 16 positive cases out of 18 statistically significant cases were observed resulting in 89% of success rate using the most promising combinations of the methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework could contribute to realization of a non-intrusive, cost-effective, and ubiquitous distributed thermal comfort assessment that has been proven critical in increasing energy efficiency of the HVAC system through distributed control feedback.

AB  - DC, also referred to as Delta-C, measures enhanced light absorption of particulate matter (PM) samples at the near-ultraviolet (UV) range relative to the near-infrared range, which has been proposed previously as a woodsmoke marker due to the presence of enhanced UV light-absorbing materials from wood combustion. In this paper, we further evaluated the applications and limitations of using DC as both a qualitative and semi-quantitative woodsmoke marker via joint continuous measurements of PM2.5 (by nephelometer pDR-1500) and light-absorptive PM (by 2-wavelength and 7-wavelength Aethalometer (R)) in three northeastern US cities/towns including Rutland, VT; Saranac Lake, NY and Ithaca, NY. Residential wood combustion has shown to be the predominant source of wintertime primary PM2 .5 emissions in both Rutland and Saranac Lake, where we conducted ambient measurements. In Ithaca, we performed woodsmoke plume measurements. We compared the pDR-1500 against a FEM PM2.5 sampler (BAM 1020), and identified a close agreement between the two instruments in a woodsmoke-dominated ambient environment. The analysis of seasonal and diurnal trends of DC, black carbon (BC, 880 nm) and PM2.5 concentrations supports the use of DC as an adequate qualitative marker. The strong linear relationships between PM2.5 and DC in both woodsmoke-dominated ambient and plume environments suggest that DC can reasonably serve as a semi-quantitative woodsmoke marker. We propose a DC-based indicator for woodsmoke emission, which has shown to exhibit a relatively strong linear relationship with heating demand. While we observed reproducible PM2.5-DC relationships in similar woodsmoke-dominated ambient environments, those relationships differ significantly with different environments, and among individual woodsmoke sources. Our analysis also indicates the potential for PM2.5-DC relationships to be utilized to distinguish different combustion and operating conditions of woodsmoke sources, and that DC-heating-demand relationships could be adopted to estimate woodsmoke emissions. However, future studies are needed to elucidate those relationships.

AB  - The Northern Zone rock lobster fishery in South Australia is extensive, covering ca. 207 000 km(2). Managed under transferable quotas, the majority of the annual total allowable commercial catch (TACC) is taken on eastern inshore grounds, targeting the smaller redder lobsters favoured by Chinese buyers. The confined nature of fishing under the TACC system has led to concerns of localized spatial depletion and suggested a need for spatial management. A regional partition of the TACC was proposed. Formal prescriptive decision-rule tables for setting regional TACCs annually were constructed based on target exploitation rates. A target exploitation rate of 20% historically produced zero average yearly change in biomass and, in previous bioeconomic projection modelling, achieved near-optimal net economic return. Using an age-based fishery assessment model that fits to catch totals by both weight and number landed, conditioning on fishing effort and mean weights-at-age, we estimated harvestable biomass for three regions. The management response was to establish inner and outer subzones where separate TACC decision rules are now adopted. Basing the harvest strategy on a target exploitation rate underlies a simple direct method for constructing decision-rule tables for setting TACC using the indicator of previous year's catch per unit effort (cpue). In the normal cpue range, a constant target exploitation rate is applied. At lower levels of stock abundance, below a designated upper limit reference point of cpue, the exploitation rates used to assign TACCs are set to decline linearly from the normal target level, reaching zero at a designated lower-limit reference cpue point below which the fishery is closed. At higher levels of cpue, stakeholders agreed to a TACC cap, under which exploitation rate decreases if biomass rises. This case study applies where formal harvest strategy decision rules for quota-based lobster fisheries are considered at finer spatial scales.

AB  - The aim of this paper is the assessment of the hydrocarbon potential and maturity of Silurian intervals from the Calarasi-Bordei Verde-Biruinta perimeter - East Moesian Platform. All the information gathered from the wells drilled in the mentioned perimeter is used for the evaluation of the "shale gas" potential, too. This major sedimentary basin has all geological conditions for hydrocarbons generation, migration and accumulation. The main conclusions of the all geo-analyses are the following: the XRD analyses show that the samples consist of clay minerals with organic material, the organic matter contained in the samples of the wells shows widely distributed type of organoclasts. In absence of true vitrinite originating from higher plants in these Lower Paleozoic series, the various encountered organic remains consist of Tasmanites, microporous or homogeneous fragments, structured fragments of graptolites, oxidized or naturally rich in oxygen organoclasts inherited from the continent (phytoclasts, fungal remains). The maturity of the Silurian at Tandarei borehole is established taking into account the fluorescence of the Tasmanites and the reflectance of graptolites; the maturity increases with depth between 0.70 and 1% eq. VRo. The organic matter of Biruinta and Calarasi boreholes is overmature with maturity of around 1.40-1.55% at 400 m in Biruinta and a maturity increase with depth between 1.85 and 2.05% eq. VRo in Calarasi borehole. Those values are mainly deduced from vitrinite/graptolite correlation. According to the maturity trend deduced of Calarasi and Tandarei boreholes, the high maturity of Biruinta for such a low burial (around 400 m) indicates a possible erosion around 3400 m due to uplift. The Silurian studied samples consist of carbonated claystones with an organic matter of type II with relatively low residual TOC content: less than 1.2% weight for the overmature boreholes (Biruinta and Calarasi) and less than 1.6% weight in Tandarei borehole.

AB  - The tacit assumption of functional ecology is that traits affect plant fitness. However, this link is mediated by demography, e.g. specific leaf area is not affecting changes in abundance directly but through vegetative multiplication or generative reproduction of plants it means via demographic processes. We propose that in herbaceous perennials, architectural traits that capture shoot development constitute simple morphological surrogates of a number of demographic functions (shoot lifespan, lateral spread, multiplication rate). A shoot is a reiterated basic unit of a plant body in herbs and is easily recognizable as an individual. We propose that potential shoot lifespan (shoot cyclicity) may serve as a simple character relevant to demographic processes of clonal herbs while whole plant longevity plays a similar role for non-clonal herbs. Therefore we examined relationships of shoot and whole-plant lifespans with a key trait of the plant economic spectrum (specific leaf area, SLA) for a large set of Central European temperate zone herbs. We also investigated whether shoot and whole-plant lifespan are non randomly distributed along environmental gradients, using indicator values and their distribution among plant community types. Finally, we analysed whether shoot cyclicity underlies differences in temporal turnover of plants in species-rich meadows. Our analyses showed that fast-growing species had shorter shoot and/or plant lifespan and preferred more productive environmental conditions, but the relationship was not strong. In addition, the two lifespan measures were independent of each other, indicating that shoot lifespan captures a rather different aspect of plant demography than whole-plant longevity. Turnover of perennial plants with annual shoots in meadow community was much higher than that of plants with long-lived shoots. Whole-plant and shoot lifespan constitute promising proxy variables for a mechanistic link between functional traits and community ecology in the temperate zone and deserves further attention.

AB  - Most work on cliff notches in the Tropics and Subtropics has been on calcareous substrates that experience chemical or biochemical corrosion and the erosional and protectional effects of boring and encrusting marine organisms. There are deep notches in coarse andesitic lahar deposits along the subtropical western coast of the La Paz Peninsula in Baja California, Mexico. Many notch-forming mechanisms cannot operate here. There are no visible marine organisms at the cliff foot, the waves are generally too weak to dislodge rock fragments, there is little loose material for abrasion, and the substratum is resistant to corrosion. To determine the processes of notch formation, and their rates of erosion due to weathering and debris removal, rock samples were alternatively immersed in water for 90 min and then dried in air for one or two weeks to simulate conditions in the upper high tidal zone, corresponding to the deepest part of the notches in the field. These experiments ran for 17 months and used either fresh water to determine the efficacy of wetting and drying, or synthetic sea water to include the additional effect of salt weathering. The results suggested that salt weathering is more effective in this environment than wetting and drying and, because one week of drying was more effective than two weeks, that optimum notch development is probably closer to the neap than to the spring high tidal levels. As the experimental rock breakdown could also result from chemical weathering, rock samples were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The results suggested that, despite some Mg and Ca leaching, chemical weathering is not important in this area. Although the dominant notch-forming mechanism is salt weathering, field evidence implied that its efficacy rapidly increases with exposure to wave action, probably because of more frequent and stronger spray and splash and possibly because of the premature removal of loosened, weathered grains.

AB  - The fungus Leptosphaeria maculans that causes blackleg can attack winter rape throughout the entire growing season. Therefore, appropriate treatments were designed to simulate environmental factors that may occur under field conditions. The callus tissue of winter rape was treated with abiotic stress in the form of cold (2 degrees C) and temperature change (2/20 degrees C and 20/2 degrees C), and biotic stress in the form of secondary metabolites of L. maculans. The following parameters were analyzed: total phenolics, the activity of L-phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), catalase, respiration intensity, heat emission, and metabolic activity determined by means of 2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride (TTC) assay. Additionally, the changes in the electrical potential, known as a sensitive indicator of biochemical changes in the callus tissue, were measured. The obtained results seem to indicate rather increased stress, caused by temperature (2 or 20 degrees C) or its changes (2/20 degrees C, 20/2 degrees C) and the secondary metabolites of L. maculans than a cross reaction. The factor that most strongly affected the metabolism of winter rape callus tissue was the temperature change, which masked the changes caused by the fungal secondary metabolites or intensified their adverse effects. The only parameters that could be regarded as reliable indicators of the callus tissue response to the elicitation with secondary metabolites of L. maculans were catalase activity and respiration intensity. Additionally, a protective function of low temperature involved a reduction in catalase activity, resulting in increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), key molecules inducing the defense mechanisms during pathogenesis. Only the changes in L-phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activity and the accompanying changes in the content of phenolic compounds can be considered as beneficial effects of low temperature (2 degrees C) on a more efficient callus acclimation to the biotic stress.

AB  - Rhizobial inoculation has a positive impact on plants growth; however, there is little information about its effect on soil microbial communities and their activity in the rhizosphere. It was therefore necessary to test the effect of inoculation of Acacia senegal (L.) Willd. seedlings with selected rhizobia on plant growth, structure and diversity of soil bacterial communities and soil functioning in relation to plant provenance and soil origin. In order to carry out this experiment, three A. senegal seeds provenance from Kenya, Niger, and Senegal were inoculated with selected rhizobial strains. They have been further grown during 4 months in greenhouse conditions in two non-disinfected soils, Dahra and Goudiry coming respectively from arid and semi-arid areas. The principal component analysis (ACP) showed an inoculation effect on plant growth, rhizospheric bacterial diversity and soil functioning. However, the performances of the rhizobial strains varied in relation to the seed provenance and the soil origin. The selected rhizobial strains, the A. senegal provenance and the soil origin have modified the structure and the diversity of soil bacterial communities as measured by principal component analysis/denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analyses. It is interesting to note that bacterial communities of Dahra soil were highly structured according to A. senegal provenance, whereas they were structured in relation to rhizobial inoculation in Goudiry soil. Besides, the impact of inoculation on soil microbial activities measured by fluorescein diacetate analyses varied in relation to plant provenance and soil origin. Nevertheless, total microbial activity was about two times higher in Goudiry, arid soil than in Dahra, semi-arid soil. Our results suggest that the rhizobial inoculation is a suitable tool for improving plants growth and soil fertility. Yet, the impact is dependent on inoculants, plant provenance and soil origin. It will, therefore, be crucial to identify the appropriate rhizobial strains and plant provenance or species in relation to the soil type.

AB  - We propose here a delivery drug-polymer system using poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPA) nanohydrogels that enables pimaricin to be protected from hostile environments and allows the controlled release of the antifungal through environmental stimuli. We synthesized 2 nanohydrogels, 1 with 100% N-isopropylacrylamide (PNIPA(5)) and 1 with 80% N-isopropylacrylamide copolymerized and 20% acrylic acid (PNIPA-20AA(5)). Both were then, loaded with a pimaricin aqueous solution. The pimaricin release profiles of these 2 nanohydrogels were considerably different: PNIPA(5) released 10% and PNIPA-20AA(5) released 30% with respect to the free pimaricin release. Moreover, the diffusion experiments showed that pimaricin was released from the PNIPA-20AA(5) nanohydrogel for up to 3 times longer than free pimaricin. Therefore, incorporating acrylic acid as comonomer into the PNIPA nanohydrogel resulted in a slower but more continuous release of pimaricin. The highest pimaricin levels were reached when the most hydrophilic nanohydrogel was used. The bioassay results showed that the pimaricin-nanohydrogel system was highly effective in inhibiting the growth of the indicator strain in conditions of thermal abuse. The spoilage in acidified samples stored under fluorescent lighting was reduced by 80.94%+/- 33.02% in samples treated with a pimaricin-loaded nanohydrogel, but only by 19.91%+/- 6.68% in samples treated with free pimaricin. Therefore, 2 conclusions emerge from this study. One is that the nanohydrogel delivery system could impede the degradation of pimaricin. The other is that the inhibitory effect of the antifungal on yeast growth is more pronounced when it is added included into the nanohydrogel to the food, especially in an acidic environment. Practical Application: This article presents relevant results on the use of nanohydrogels in food packaging. Nanohydrogels could provide protection so that the pimaricin remains active for a longer time. They also allow the controlled release of pimaricin, which thus regulates the unnecessary presence of the antifungal in the food.

AB  - In this study, the impact of Escherichia coli emissions from a sewage treatment plant on the bathing water quality of Dublin Bay (Ireland) is assessed using a three-dimensional hydro-environmental model. Before being discharged, the effluent from the plant is mixed with cooling water from a thermal-electrical power generation plant, creating a warm buoyant sewage plume that can be 7-9A degrees C higher and is less saline than the ambient water in the bay. The ability of the three-dimensional model in representing such a stratified condition is assessed based on a comparison of its results with two-dimensional modelling results. Hydrodynamic simulations of water levels and flow velocities in Dublin Bay were obtained using the TELEMAC-3D model in one case and the depth-averaged TELEMAC-2D model in the other. The results of each model were separately used as inputs to the water quality model SUBIEF-3D to simulate the transport and fate of E. coli in the bay and to generate maps of E. coli concentrations over the bay. In addition, the necessity for three-dimensional modelling in simulating the effects of wind direction on the dispersion of E. coli was demonstrated by comparing the results of three-dimensional and two-dimensional model simulations with a number of different wind directions. The comparison showed that the three-dimensional model performed better than the depth-averaged model in simulating the hydrodynamics and resulted in better simulation of the water quality processes in the bay. In particular, the three-dimensional model had reasonably simulated the timing of the delivery of E. coli to the bay. Moreover, the effect of wind on the movement of the buoyant plume of pollution and on the E. coli distribution was found to be more pronounced with the three-dimensional hydrodynamics. The results demonstrate the need for three-dimensional simulations in situations of density differences or significant wind influences.

AB  - This paper presents a comparative analysis of the leaf litter decomposition of two alien (Acer negundo, A. pseudoplatanus) and one native (A. platanoides) maple species. The leaf litter fall of Acer pseudoplatanus was collected in the Girionys Park, situated in the south-west of Kaunas, and leaves of A. platanoides and A. negundo were collected in the Santaka park, located in the eastern part of Kaunas in the autumn of 2008. A laboratory incubation experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of alien and native maple species on ecosystem functioning, the response of microbial transformations and decomposition of maple litter. The study quantified the amount of CO2 evolved from the decaying litters and the population of fungi, bacteria associated with the soil in forests under decomposing leaves. Decomposition of maple leaf litter was studied under laboratory conditions using the respiration technique. Chemical composition of the litters was determined before incubation by the dry combustion method. The decay rate of the maple litters varied significantly between species. Acer negundo litter decayed more rapidly (K-w = 0.003488) than A. platanoides (K-w = 0.002046) or A. pseudoplatanus (K-w = 0.00166). This variation in decomposition rate corresponded with indicators of litter quality (C/N ratio, N and C) with decomposition mostly being explained by C content. The CO2 evolution differed significantly between the species; it was considerably higher in alien A. negundo litter. Bacteria and fungi quantities varied in soil associated with the three maple species. Microbial populations were similar in the soils associated with A. platanoides and A. negundo, while densities were lower on the site associated with A. pseudoplatanus. CO2 evolution was positively correlated with the number of fungi and bacteria in the soil under maple litter. The leaves of A. negundo showed the fastest decomposition rate, and it is likely that faster nutrient cycling will occur in the soil where A. negundo grows and provides evidence how invasive species may alter the functioning of forest systems.

AB  - Demand for nonsolar energy and concern about the implications of fossil fuel combustion have encouraged examination of energy use associated with agriculture. The United States is a global leader in pig production, and the United States swine industry is centered in Iowa. Feed is the largest individual input in pig production, but the energy consumption of the Iowa swine feed production chain has yet to be critically examined. This analysis examines nonsolar energy use and resulting 100-yr global warming potential (GWP) associated with the swine feed production chain, beginning with cultivation of crops and concluding with diet formulation. The nonsolar energy use and accompanying 100-yr GWP associated with production of 13 common swine feed ingredients are estimated. Two diet formulation strategies are considered for 4 crop sequence x ingredient choice combinations to generate 8 crop sequence x diet formulation scenarios. The first formulation strategy (simple) does not include synthetic AA or phytase. The second strategy (complex) reduces CP content of the diet by using L-lysine to meet standardized ileal digestibility lysine requirements of pigs and includes the exogenous enzyme phytase. Regardless of crop sequence x diet formulation scenario, including the enzyme phytase is energetically favorable and reduces the potential excretion of P by reducing or removing inorganic P from the complete diet. Including L-lysine reduces the CP content of the diet and requires less nonsolar energy to deliver adequate standardized ileal digestible lysine than simply feeding soybean meal. Replacing soybean meal with full-fat soybeans is not energetically beneficial under Iowa conditions. Swine diets including dried distillers grains with solubles and crude glycerol require approximately 50% more nonsolar energy inputs than corn-soybean meal diets or corn-soybean meal diets including oats. This study provides essential information on cultivation, processing, and manufacture of swine feed ingredients in Iowa that can be coupled with other models to estimate the nonsolar energy use and 100-yr GWP of pig production.

AB  - Some strong reflections about 3 to 5 m thick were observed at depths of 25-60 metres below the sea floor using deep-towed, 5 kHz subbottom profiler data in the Turkish shelf and upper slope of the Eastern Black Sea at water depths of 250 to 700 m. Strong reflections of this kind are generally attributed to shallow and localized gas accumulations. We, however, observed that the reflection polarity of these strong reflections was positive, suggesting that they do not correspond to reflections from the upper boundary of a possible gas front. In this study, we evaluate these reflections to determine if they represent hydrogen sulphide-rich shallow gas hydrate layers, which would be an unusual gas hydrate occurrence in a shallow marine environment.
   The existence of gas hydrate formations in thermobaric conditions, as in our study area (shallower water depths and relatively higher temperatures), depends completely on the gas composition in the hydrate structure; it is possible for gas hydrates to be stable only if they are formed by a certain amount of hydrogen sulfide together with methane. We closely examined the hydrogen sulphide potential of the area and found that the maximum total hydrogen sulfide concentration in the surficial sediments in the area was, at 5550 ppm, enough to produce hydrogen sulphide-rich gas hydrates.
   Using geoacoustic and geochemical data, we propose a conceptual model for the formation of shallow hydrogen sulfide-rich gas hydrates. According to this model, conjectural gas hydrate layers in the area should be formed along the boundary between a sulphate-reducing zone and an underlying carbonate reducing zone, where methane comes into contact with hydrogen sulphide. We also propose that the strongly reflective appearance of these layers on the subbottom profiler data indicates that the hydrate zone consists of a number of gas hydrate sheets with a decreasing thickness towards the seabed, interbedded with non-hydrate-bearing sediments.

AB  - Biological pretreatment methods of waste-activated sludge (WAS) have recently received attention because of their efficiency and relatively low investment. The application of hydrolysis/acidification step before methanization in anaerobic digestion or the two-phase anaerobic digestion process constitutes one of these methods. Two phase (thermophilic acidification and mesophilic methanogenesis) anaerobic digestion of WAS was investigated and reported to perform better in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD) solubilization, volatile solids destruction, gas production, and pathogen indicator reduction. The solids loading rates (SLR) used in these studies were significantly high (6.5-28.9 g volatile solids (VS)/L . day). It is well-known that high SLRs along with low retention times lead to higher acidification in two-phase systems. However, WAS from different wastewater treatment plants is likely to have different concentrations due to different process configurations and operational practices that lead to lower solids loading rates. Therefore, this study investigated the performance of thermophilic anaerobic preacidification of WAS prior to conventional mesophilic (methanogenic) anaerobic digestion at low SLRs (0.98-3.93 g VS/L . day). To this purpose, continuous anaerobic acidogenic reactors with no recycle were operated at two different HRT (or SRT) values of 2 and 4 days, and three different SLR values of 0.98, 1.97, and 3.93 g VS/L . day. After the acidification reactors reached to steady-state conditions, the preacidified WAS samples (or the effluents of thermophilic acidogenic anaerobic reactors) and raw WAS samples (or the feeds to the thermophilic acidogenic anaerobic reactors) were subjected to biochemical methane potential (BMP) assay. Results indicated that thermophilic preacidification led to a 20.9-34.8% increase in dissolved (soluble) COD concentration and 18.2-33.3% CODt reduction in acidogenic reactors. When the CODt removals observed for preacidification and BMP were both considered, preacidification (or phase separation) has led to 26.2-49.4% additional CODt removal. It is apparent from these results that beneficial effect of preacidification on CODt removal is sustained for low SLRs (0.98-3.93 g VS/L . day).

AB  - Many undertakings have used either a single value or a narrow window of temperatures as a threshold for the freezing of water within rock. These temperatures vary from 0 to -5 degrees C, with most windows being in the range -1 to -4 degrees C. Based on thermal data, these thresholds are commonly used to 'count' the number of freeze-thaw events as a basis for determining freeze-thaw weathering. Data collected from northern Canada indicate that the temperature at which freezing occurs can vary substantially, even for the same site. Using exotherm and zero curtain observations from bricks, at angles of 90 and 45 degrees, aligned to the four cardinal aspects, the various temperatures at which water froze are shown. Bricks on the north and east commonly did exhibit freezing, based on exotherms, within the window -1 to -5 degrees C, while data for the south and west aspects showed substantial variation, with freezes sometimes between -6-4 and -8-9 degrees C. The data were evaluated for evidence of zero curtain effects (indicative of water freezing), but no unequivocal events could be found, and it is suggested that, at the scale of observation used here, they are unlikely. It would therefore appear that the use of thermal thresholds may not be meaningful for evaluation of freeze-thaw events. The available data also indicate many instances when temperatures went substantially subzero (e.g. -20 degrees C) and yet no indication of water freezing occurred - most likely because there was no water available to freeze. This indicates that any form of freeze-thaw event counting, in the absence of some indicator of the presence of water and that it actually froze, is flawed, as thermal conditions alone are not adequate to indicate the occurrence or not of actual freeze-thaw weathering events. These data suggest that evaluations of freeze-thaw occurrence based simply on thermal thresholds may be substantially in error. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background: Female mate choice may be adaptive when males exhibit heritable genetic variation at loci encoding resistance to infectious disease. The Hamilton-Zuk hypothesis predicts that females should assess the genetic quality of males by monitoring traits that indicate health and vigor (condition-dependent choice, or CD). Alternatively, some females may employ a more direct method of screening and select mates based on the dissimilarity of alleles at the major histocompatibility loci (we refer to this as opposites-attract, or OA). Empirical studies suggest that both forms of mate choice exist, but little is known about the potential for natural selection to shape the two strategies in nature.
   Results: We used computer simulation models to examine the evolutionary fates of the two forms of mate choice in populations at risk for infection by debilitating parasites. We found that populations exhibiting random mating (no mate choice) can be invaded and replaced completely by individuals practicing CD type mate choice. We also found that an allele encoding OA choice can increase when rare in randomly mating populations, but that it does not go to fixation under selection. A similar result was obtained when the OA strategy was introduced into populations practicing CD mate choice. As before, we found that the OA choice allele will increase when rare, and that it will not go to fixation under selection. The converse however was not true, as CD individuals gain no rare advantage when introduced into an OA population.
   Conclusions: Taken together, the results suggest that, when rare, OA is the best strategy for parasite evasion (of those considered here). The consequence of OA increasing in the population, however, is to reduce the parasite driven genotype oscillations and facilitate the breakdown of linkage disequilibrium at the disease-resistance loci. This leads to a neutrally stable situation in which different strategies have equal fitness, and suggests that multiple forms of mate choice may be expected to occur in populations at risk from infectious disease.

AB  - Biogenic opal produced by vascular plants, diatoms, and siliceous sponges have been found in soils and terrestrial sediments of all continents except Antarctica since the middle of the 19th century. The opal particles range in size from fine silt to fine sand. Almost all soils contain detectable opal up to levels of 2-3%, and a significant number contain values in excess of 5%. Even higher values have been found from soils and sediments of all continents in a wide range of soil types. The most important factor is poor soil drainage and seasonal to permanent water logging. This encourages the proliferation of silica producing organisms. Such conditions have been found in the soils and aquatic sediments of the monsoonal tropics, tropical rain forests, temperate forests, tropical savanna, tropical islands, semi-arid grasslands and savanna, and temperate woodland and grassland. The presence of a volcanic substrate also appears favourable in some cases, but is not necessary. Biogenic opal preferentially collects in the A horizon of soils and, to a lesser extent, in the B horizon. This preferential distribution facilitates identification of palaeosols in stacked soil sequences. Biogenic opal is also a component of windblown dust, even in and environments. Biogenic opal is significant to regolith processes in a number of ways. Firstly, as in the case in marine environments, it is likely to be important in silica cycling and storage because of its greater lability compared to quartz. Secondly, dissolution and reprecipitation of opal A as opal CT or micro-quartz may play a role in cementation and silicification of regolith to form silica hardpans and silcrete. Thirdly, the organisms that form biogenic opal can have considerable palaeoenvironmental significance and be valuable in reconstructing regolith evolution. Finally, some forms of biogenic silica, in particular sponge spicules, can present a health hazard. Their high abundance in some soils and sediments needs to be considered when assessing the health implications of airborne dust. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study compared two different approaches for assessing biological potential of reclaimed soils: 1) an empirical mathematical model for topsoil microbial evaluation comparing measured values with model minimum for microbial biomass carbon (MB-C) and with model maximum for extracellular extractable organic carbon (EX-C) and 2) actual and laboratory estimation of microbial parameters associated with mineralization activity of the whole microbial community: respiration rate (RR), glucose-stimulated potential respiration response (PR), biomass specific respiration rate (qCO(2)) and capability to utilize easily available organic substrate. Six different reclaimed dumps from North Bohemian Brown Coal Basin were selected for that purpose. The selected sites formed a reasonably wide range of possible results of reclamation process. The soils in the first category (two sites suitable for agronomic management and one extensive meadow) were found to have well developed MB-C (72 to 78% of model minimum) associated with relatively high mineralization activity. Model findings were fully confirmed by estimation of actual and potential mineralization parameters: relatively low content of EX-C; high ratio PR/PR: 13.8 to 15.2 and relatively high conversion rate of added glucose-C to biomass-C. The opposite situation was found in the case of technically adjusted dump without a prospect for biological reclamation: low MB-C content (22% of model minimum); relatively high content of EX-C associated with low mineralization activity; extremely low potentiation of respiration response by glucose (PR/RR ratio 3.2). Both compared experimental approaches were able to detect positive changes in reclaimed dump overlaid with unsuitable loamy loess after application of organic materials (increased MB-C content, increased mineralization capacity, lower maintenance energy requirements and higher biosynthesis of MB-C from available organic substrate). Biomass specific respiration rate was confirmed to be a sensitive indicator of physiological stress both in field and laboratory conditions, particularly when evaluated simultaneously with EX-C.

AB  - Reduction of porcine parvovirus, bovine enterovirus and faecal enterococci were measured in biogas reactors continuously run on manure and manure supplemented with household waste at 35 degrees C and 55 degrees C and in batch test run at 70 degrees C. The aim of the experiments was to study the sanitation effect of anaerobic digestion and to evaluate the use of faecal enterococci as an indicator of sanitation. Parallel studies on the reduction of virus and faecal enterococci were done in physiological saline solution. Heat inactivation was found to be an important factor in thermophilic biogas plants and the overall dominant factor at 70 degrees C. However, other environmental factors with a substantial virucidal and bactericidal effect were involved in inactivation. The death rates for faecal enterococci were generally higher than for porcine parvovirus and lower than for bovine enterovirus. For faecal enterococci, a logarithmic reduction of 4 (corresponding to the recommended minimum guaranteed retention time) was obtained after 300 hours at 35 degrees C and after 1-2 hours at 55 degrees C. In continuously-fed reactors, a high reduction rate was initially seen for the virus tested, followed by a reduction in the rate. For porcine parvovirus, a minimum guaranteed retention time of 11-12 hours is necessary at 55 degrees C in the initial phase (0-4 hours) and 54 hours hereafter (4-48 h). Correspondingly, for bovine enterovirus a MGRT of 23 hours was necessary at 35 degrees C and < 0.5 hours at 55 degrees C. The data indicate that faecal enterococci measurements give a good indication of inactivation of enterovirus and other more heat sensitive virus, especially under thermophilic conditions. Parvovirus is very suitable for comparative investigations on inactivation in the temperature range of 50-80 degrees C, due to the extreme thermal resistance of this virus. However, in stipulating sanitation demands for biogas reactors it seems more reasonable to use less resistant virus, such as a reovirus or picornavirus, which better represents the pathogenic animal virus.

AB  - Rockmagnetic properties of a number of oceanic basalt samples collected by the DSDP/ODP drillings after Leg 45 as well as one dredge haul were investigated in conjunction with palaeomagnetic characteristics of the same samples. The electron-probe micro-analysis (EPMA) study indicated that chemical composition of the primary titanomagnetites has a variety, particularly in minor constituent elements such as Al2O3, MgO, MnO, and V2O3. The variation in chemical composition in the primary phase of titanomagnetites seems to be controlled by changes in temperature, oxygen fugacity and volatile pressure during the crystallization as well as chemistry of residual liquid in magma. General crystallization trend is found, that is, the later crystallized titanomagnetites have higher ulvospinel component (higher titanium oxide and lower iron oxide) due to decrease in temperature and oxygen fugacity. It is established that minor constituent elements are good indicators of crystallization sequence of titanomagnetites in the contrast of variation in major constituent elements. In the later stage, Al2O3 and MgO (spinel component) and V2O3 decrease, whereas MnO increases, although there is a reversed crystallization trend with a few elements in several cases. This reversed trend may suggest that there are discontinuous changes of environmental condition in magma to control titanomagnetite chemistry during a crystallization sequence. The primary variation of chemistry shows different trends of the secondary variation due to oxidation. Oxidation process of titanomagnetites contained in oceanic basalts was examined in detail by means of an improved EPMA technique being able to directly determine the absolote contents of oxygen in materials. The result of the quantitative oxygen measurement shows that the oxidation process of titanomagnetites is not a simple process by changes of ferrous ions to ferric ones with acrretion of oxygen but associated with migration of iron ions of the titanomagnetite lattice. This is consistent with the results of recent studies on oxidation processes of titanomagnetites in oceanic basalts.

AB  - The effect of rainfall on crop fertilization factors, such as macronutrients and yield, were studied during a long-term field experiment on a calcareous sandy soil with low humus content in North Hungary at the OrbottyAn Experimental Station of Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences from 1961 to 2004. At the time of the set-up of the experiment, in 1959, the soil's ploughed layer had the following characteristics: pH(H2O): 7.5-7.8, pH((KCI)): 6.9-7.1, humus content: 0.6-1.0%, clay content: 5%, CaCO3 content: 3-7%, AL soluble P2O5 and K2O content: 40-60 and 50-100 mg-kg(-1). The experiment included ten treatments in five replications, giving a total of 50 plots (35 M-2 each) arranged in a Latin square design. From the 1st to the 25th year the fertilization rates were 0, 50 and 100 N kg center dot la(-1) year(-1); 0 and 54 kg P2O5 ha(-1) center dot year(-1); 0 and 80 kg K2O ha(-1) - year(-1) and their combinations. From the 26(th) year on these rates were 0 and 120 kg N ha(-1) center dot year(-1); 0, 60 and 120 kg P205 ha(-1) center dot year(-1) and 0, 60 and 120 kg K2O ha(-1) center dot year (-1) and their combinations. The major findings can be surnmarised as follows. At average rainfall years on the control plots without any mineral fertilization the rye yield in monoculture stabilised at a level of around 0.8 t - ha(-1) (Table 3). The yield doubled (1.8-1.9 t center dot ha(-1)) in the N, NP and NK treatments while the full NPK doses gave the maximum yield of 2.1 t center dot hal (-1)significantly (mean: 1.7 t - ha(-1)). Without mineral fertilization on the control plots in droughty and dry years yields of 0.7 t center dot ha (-1)and 0.8 t - ha(-1)ere h(a)rvested. This was a 13% yield reduction in droughty years ascompared with an average year. Yield depressions of 33, 16, 21 and 20% were caused bydrought (dry and droughty years) in the N, NP, NK and NPK treatments. In wet year the yield was 0.9 t - ha-' in the control plots, representing a yield grown of 12.5% compared with average years (0.8 t - Ila). In the case of N, NP, NK nutrition the increase ill the harvested main yield was 43. 1 % while NPK treatments led to yield increment of 36.9% only. In the very wet years the rye yield declined even more than in case of drought. The unfertilised plots yielded25% less than in the average years. In the case of unfavourable nutrition (N, NP, NK) the decrease in the main grain yield was 32.8% and in the case of NKP plots the negative effects was 26.2%. Rye in monoculture has approx. 29.4% less tolerance of very wet years than to dry. This yield depression is in line of Mdrton et al. (2007) statement whereas the over-wet conditions could be resulted oxygen deficiency in the crop's root zone. Depending on the nutrient supplies, significant quadratic correlations were observed between the rainfall quantity and the yield (Control: R=0.7489***, N: R=0.8974***, NP: R=0.8020***, NK: R=0.7370***, NPK: R=0.9047***, mean R2=0.8180; 66.9%) during the vegetation period. The increase in grain yield per mm rainfall ranged from 3.0 to 6.
   4 kg ha(-1) in the case of optimum rainfall supplies, while the quantity of rainfall during the vegetation period required for the production of I kg air-dry yield ranged from 1529 t 3360 litres in the case of maximum yield. Based on the meteorological database for the 44 years of the long-term experiment (1961-2004) the frequency of years in which the rainfall was optimum for various levels of nutrient supply was as follows: control: 2%, N: 7%, NP: 7%, NK: 9%, NPK: 7%, giving an average of 6% over the treatments. This suggests that the occurrence of optimum rainfall supplies and the possibility of achieving optimum yields in the rye production will decline in the future, Under two different arable site plant ecological conditions (rainfall quantity, NPK fertilization) the yield average of rye in monoculture on calcareous sandy soil (OrbottyAn) was 86% less than that achieved in a biculture (rye and potato) on acidic sandy soil (Nyirlugos).

AB  - Introduction
   Given the strong global socio-economic growth that have experienced developed countries during the second half of the last century, there have been numerous hydraulic actions aimed at increasing water supply to ensure the strong expansion of urban, agricultural and hydroelectric production (Tortajada, 2016). The availability of water in sufficient quantity and quality has acquired a first-rate interest in meeting urban, tourist and rural demands in territories with a natural shortage of water resources (Rico et al., 2013). In this sense, the hydraulic planning of developed countries was based initially on the so-called "old hydraulic policy" based on the construction of canals, transfers and reservoirs and, since the last decades of the 20th century, with the so-called "nonconventional sources" or "alternatives" such as the use of purified and desalinated water (Fragkou and McEvoy, 2016).
   In Spain, investments in hydraulic infrastructure (public and private) in the last hundred years have resulted in the construction of more than 1,200 large reservoirs, more than 20 large desalination plants and various transfers of different capacity ( Hernandez-Mora et al., 2014). For example, the main water transfers in Spain (around forty) add up to a capacity of about 1,300 hm(3)/year, which represents less than 3% of the guaranteed resources, which amount to 46,000 hm(3).
   Objectives and Methodology
   This research poses two main objectives. The first one is to analyze the socio-economic repercussions derived from the implementation of the Tagus-Segura Aqueduct (ATS) (1979) in the southeast of Spain. The second one, to analyze the future changes in the normal functioning of this hydraulic infrastructure in the future scenarios of climate change and the corrective measures and strategies carried out to mitigate their effects (proposals and alternatives).
   It has also been consulted on the different regulations that have a direct influence on the functioning of the ATS: Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC); Law 10/2001, of July 5, of the National Hydrological Plan (NHP); Royal Decree-Law 2/2004, of June 18, amending the Law 10/2001, of July 5, of the National Hydrological Plan; A.G.U.A. Program (2004) (Actions for the Management and Use of Water Royal Decree Law 2/2004); Law 21/2013 of December 9, on Environmental Assessment; Royal Decree 773/2014 of 12 September (Memorandum); Law 21/2015, of July 20, of Montes; And the Tagus Hydrological Plan (Royal Decree 1/2016, of 8 January). Likewise, the estimated rainfall effects in the area of study in the different reports on climate change have been analyzed (AEMET, 2017, CEDEX, 2017, IPCC, 2014).
   Results
   The participation of the ATS in the systems of supply of drinking water in high of the basin of the Segura is decisive. This work is carried out by the Commonwealth of Canals del Taibilla (MCI), which has become a key public agency for the management of water resources for urban uses in the southeast of Spain (Rico, 2016). At present, MCT has an approximate area of 12 thousand square kilometers and supplies potable water in primary network up to 79 municipalities, belonging to the provinces of Murcia, Alicante and Albacete, with a population estimated at 2.5 million inhabitants that can grow in another million more during the summer if the tourist contingent is considered.
   This population has had regular supply of drinking water in their homes, even during periods of intense drought, thanks to the existence of the ATS, the diversification of sources of supply, with the increasing participation of non-conventional resources and the temporary assignment of rights of water use; and to the good management carried out by the MCT and the companies in charge of the down management, have significantly increased the performance of the network.
   The process of the global warming that is evident in the last decades could have three direct effects on the water resources existing in the peninsular territory and, therefore, in the areas of hydrological planning analyzed, Tagus and Segura:
   Reduction of precipitation and, therefore, of available water resources, accompanied by an increase in temperatures and potential evapotranspiration
   Changes in the seasonality of rainfall
   Increase in the irregularity of the rains, which would lead to an increase in extreme events (droughts and heavy rainfall events)
   Besides, in relation to the new operating rules (limit of 400 hm(3)) (before were in 240 hm(3)), it can be seen that, if they had been in force since 1979, the ATS had not operated on numerous occasions (1983-84, 1992-93, 1995-96, 2005-07, 2008-09 and 2015-16). This is obviously due to the fact that the new rules of exploitation are more conservative and conform to new needs and realities that are more objective and fair than the previous ones. On the other hand, if the hypothetical reduction of 7% is taken into account (reduction of the rainfall due to climate change), it can be seen how practically, this reduction would not mean a substantial change in the normal operation of the ATS, since to handle that threshold of reduction, the transfer would be closed taking into account both the currently and the hypothetical reduction volumes of 7%. In addition, during these four decades of ATS operation, there have been several cyclical episodes of drought (1980-85, 1992-95, 2004-09 and 2014-16), that is to say, "conjunctural" dry periods which have affected the headwater of the Tagus river every ten years. Therefore, what can be deduced from this analysis is that the operation of the ATS will be conditioned, rather than by the effects of the reduction of precipitation, by the succession of dry episodes and, evidently, by the new rules of regulation, more conservative and in favor of the donor basin.
   Conclusions
   From what can be learned from the analyzed case is that the ATS is a hydraulic infrastructure that has allowed the socio-economic development of the southeast of Spain, although it is an infrastructure questioned since its implementation in 1979 by the tensions between the donor and receiving basins. In the southeast of Spain, the commitment to desalination (National Hydrological Plan, 2001 and AGUA Program, 2004) has become a solution to increase the supply of water resources in the southeast of Spain, although they try to make this resource the solution to the long-standing controversy surrounding the ATS. It will be expected if the forecasts of climate change and reduction of contributions that have been realized on the headwater of the Tagus, where the so-called "effect 80" has become evident, and how the new operating rules can influence the operation of this infrastructure. Alongside this, a greater involvement of the State, the Autonomous Communities and the different political forces could be achieved in order to achieve a National Water Pact, with measures to adapt to climate change. Within these consensus measures, the maintenance and/ or revision of existing transfers should not be ruled out, or the possibility of carrying out others of a moderate size that could function from the normative development of articles 67 to 72 of TRLA.

AB  - Background, Aims and Scope. Despite the large number of studies on the forms of sulfur in marine deposits, investigations on sulfur organic compounds are still rare. It is known that the processes leading to formation of intermediate and final sulfur compounds (including organic ones) in modern deposits are the results of microbiological transformation of sulfur containing proteins, as well as the microbiological reduction of sulfate ions. The latter are finally reduced by anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacteria to H2S, HS- and S2-; the total sum of these is referred to as 'hydrogen sulfide' in chemical oceanography. Further, the formation of reduced sulfur organic derivatives (sulfides and polysulfides) is the result of interaction of the organic substance destruction products with the sulfide ions. In such cases, the main source of organic substances, as well as sulfates for the sulfur reducing processes, is the pore water in the sediments. The choice of the target of our study is based on the fact that the eastern part of the Gulf of Finland water area receives the bulk of the anthropogenic load of the St. Petersburg region. Low vertical intermixing of the water thickness is observed there (thus creating a deficiency of oxygen near the bottom), and the bottom sea current transfers the polluted salty water of the Baltic Sea into the Neva Bay. The whole of the above are the preconditions for the formation of sulfur-bearing organic compounds.
   A great number of bottom sediment samples for analytical surveys were collected in the Eastern Gulf of Finland during research expeditions in the years of 1997 and 2001. These were screened for structures of sulfur organic microcontaminants, including organic forms of sulfur, using advanced instrumentation and experienced personnel in our two, cooperating laboratories. This work is a part of the research being carried out on organic micro-admixtures present in bottom sediments, and is the summary of our findings on previously unstudied sulfur organic substances there.
   Materials and Methods. A number of sulfur organic compounds present in nineteen bottom sediment samples from the Eastern Gulf of Finland (EGF) were characterized by high performance gas chromatography connected to low and high resolution mass spectrometers (GC/LRMS and GC/HRMS). The structure screening was carried out as compared with literature and library m ass spectra, and taking the GC retention times into account. In the cases of an absence of mass spectra not in the literature, interpretation of the most probable structures was performed with the help of high resolution mass-spectrometric data, fragmentation rules for sulfur-bearing organic substances and ICLU simulation of spectra. These data were registered to form a conclusive 'fingerprint' for identification and confirmation of the structure of each novel compound found, e.g. by later syntheses of authentic model compounds. The relative contents of sulfur organic compounds were determined from MS response ratios of each compound to 2-fluorine naphthalene (internal standard). Results. This paper is a completion of work, which has been published in part as three papers in the European journal of Mass Spectrometry. As the total study result, 43 sulfur-bearing compounds were characterized. The mass spectra of 20 of them were found in the literature. The most probable structures for the 23 compounds whose mass-spectra were not available in the literature data were proposed. All of those 23 compounds were detected in bottom sediments for the first time, and 5 of them were described as originating from plants or being generated by chemical synthesis products, while, the remaining 18 substances were previously unknown. The structures of these were deduced to be most probably the following (in order of their GC retention): dichloromethyl thiylsulfenylchloride, chloromethyl dichloromethyl disulfide, 3,4-dithiacyclohexene, 1,2,4-trithiacycloheptane, 1,2,3-trithiacyclohexane, tetrathiacyclopentane, 3,4,5-trithiacyclohexene, 1,2,4-trithiacyclohexane, cyclopropylhydrotrisulfide, 1,2-dithiane-3-thiol, 1,3-dithiane-2-thiol, bis(trichloromethyl)-tri-sulfide,1,2,4,5-tetrathiacyclohexane, 1,2,3,,4-tetrathiacycloheptane, 1,2,3,4-tetrathiacycloheptane, 1,2,3,4-tetrathia-cyclo-hexane, pentathiacyclohexane, and 1,2,4,6-tetrathiacyclooctane. The highest amounts of sulfur organic compounds were found in the deepest, bottom areas in the open part of the sea, where the salinity was highest, and oxygen deficiency occurred as well. Also, some coastal places with a high solid matter deposition rate had elevated contents of sulfur organic, compounds.
   Discussion. From the 43 sulfur organic compounds found, the HRMS data provided the atomic composition of the molecular ions for 16 compounds with a high confidence (see Table 3). The LRMS spectra could be identified with catalogue or literature spectra in 29 cases.
   The MS information obtained was insufficient in two cases: 1) The obvious molecular ion (at m/z 110) of compound 1 was not visible in LRMS. 2) For compound 43, the HRMS measurement, due to the low intensity (2%) of the molecular ion (m/z 210), could not exclude the presence of 2 oxygen atoms (instead of one sulfur atom) in the molecule. Major fragments, however, of our 43, certainly contained no oxygen atoms according to HRMS. The limited LRMS data in the literature, for an isomer of 43, had m/z values of all fragments different from those of the compound found by us.
   The retention times (RT) formed one more evidence for identity between compounds in different samples. The use of different non-polar columns in GC and similar, but not identical, temperature programs produced eluted peaks of novel and known compounds in each sample (mixture) in GC/HRMS and GC/LRMS. These gave sets of RTs which were in a very significant linear correlation (measured example R = 0.999866, p = 1.85E-06, N = 5). Therefore, the RTs in the HRMS analysis systems could be converted to values comparable with those from the LRMS device.
   The RT values, HRMS m/z values, LRMS spectra, and ICLU simulation results for each organic sulfur compound form an identification 'fingerprint'. The interpretation of these experimental data, with supporting use of fragmentation rules, allow the giving of a provisional name and structure to the 'suspect'. In this study and in environmental surveys of micropollutants in general, the compounds suspected of anthropogenic or natural origin occur at low levels in complex mixtures. Therefore, no bulk amount of an authentic, pure model substance for the suspect is available quite often. The most probable name and structure from the fingerprint data are very useful in guiding the preparation of the model substance for a conclusive identification. Similarly, the unknown criminal can be identified in advance by forensic science and his fingerprint, DNA, etc. as registered before the arrest. The analogy can be found in the literature and CAS register of organic polysulfides, which in great part consists of the results of sensitive mixture analysis methods.
   Conclusions. Sediment of the Eastern Gulf of Finland is over large areas anaerobic, as indicated by the existence of novel, non-oxygenated sulfur organic microcontaminants. These substances were most abundant in anoxic and saline, deep bottom regions, and, in addition, in one coastal area near industrial discharges. This occurrence, and also the limited information about sulfur organic compounds in scientific literature, is considered evidence for the dominantly natural processes in their formation.
   Recommendations and Perspectives. The importance and necessity of investigating the sulfur organic compounds in the bottom sediments, result from the fact that their presence can be an indicator of stable anaerobic processes. Similarly, the oxygen disappearance (anoxia) in the marine water, due to a high concentration of the sulfate ions and relatively high content of organic matter, is practically always connected with the appearance of hydrogen sulfide and sulfides. The generation of sulfur organic compounds precedes the formation of the new, or expansion of the existing anaerobic ('hydrogen sulfide') zones, which lead to such environmental disasters as mass destruction of hydrobionts. Many organic compounds of sulfur, including sulfides and polysulfides, are toxic to the aquatic organisms. Therefore, in addition to the danger of mass wholesale deaths of marine fauna in the bottom sediments region, there exists a probability of secondary pollution of the water thickness as well, due to the entry of those substances from bottom sediments in the water when the environmental conditions are changed (storm), weather, floods, geological activity of the earth's crust, etc.).

AB  - The modes of interactions between plants and plant-associated microbiota are manifold, and secondary metabolites often play a central role in plant-microbe interactions. Abiotic and biotic (including both plant pathogens and endophytes) stress can affect the composition and concentration of secondary plant metabolites, and thus have an influence on chemical compounds that make up for the taste and aroma of fruit. While the role of microbiota in growth and health of plants is widely acknowledged, relatively little is known about the possible effect of microorganisms on the quality of fruit of plants they are colonizing. In this work, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) plants of five different cultivars were grown in soil and in hydroponics to investigate the impact of the cultivation method on the flavor of fruit, and to assess whether variations in their chemical composition are attributable to shifts in bacterial microbiota. Ripe fruit were harvested and used for bacterial community analysis and for the analysis of tomato volatiles, sugars and acids, all contributing to flavor. Fruit grown in soil showed significantly higher sugar content, whereas tomatoes from plants under hydroponic conditions had significantly higher levels of organic acids. In contrast, aroma profiles of fruit were shaped by the tomato cultivars, rather than the cultivation method. In terms of bacterial communities, the cultivation method significantly defined the community composition in all cultivars, with the bacterial communities in hydroponic tomatoes being more variable that those in tomatoes grown in soil. Bacterial indicator species in soil-grown tomatoes correlated with higher concentrations of volatiles described to be perceived as "green" or "pungent." A soil-grown specific reproducibly occurring ASV (amplicon sequence variants) classified as Bacillus detected solely in "Solarino" tomatoes, which were the sweetest among all cultivars, correlated with the amount of aroma-relevant volatiles as well as of fructose and glucose in the fruit. In contrast, indicator bacterial species in hydroponic-derived tomatoes correlated with aroma compounds with "sweet" and "floral" notes and showed negative correlations with glucose concentrations in fruit. Overall, our results point toward a microbiota-related accumulation of flavor and aroma compounds in tomato fruit, which is strongly dependent on the cultivation substrate and approach.

AB  - Despite widespread recognition of its great promise to aid decision-making in environmental management, the applied use of metabarcoding requires improvements to reduce the multiple errors that arise during PCR amplification, sequencing and library generation. We present a co-designed wet-lab and bioinformatic workflow for metabarcoding bulk samples that removes both false-positive (tag jumps, chimeras, erroneous sequences) and false-negative ('dropout') errors. However, we find that it is not possible to recover relative-abundance information from amplicon data, due to persistent species-specific biases.
   To present and validate our workflow, we created eight mock arthropod soups, all containing the same 248 arthropod morphospecies but differing in absolute and relative DNA concentrations, and we ran them under five different PCR conditions. Our pipeline includes qPCR-optimized PCR annealing temperature and cycle number, twin-tagging, multiple independent PCR replicates per sample, and negative and positive controls. In the bioinformatic portion, we introduce Begum, which is a new version of DAMe (Zepeda-Mendoza et al., 2016. BMC Res. Notes 9:255) that ignores heterogeneity spacers, allows primer mismatches when demultiplexing samples and is more efficient. Like DAMe, Begum removes tag-jumped reads and removes sequence errors by keeping only sequences that appear in more than one PCR above a minimum copy number per PCR. The filtering thresholds are user-configurable.
   We report that OTU dropout frequency and taxonomic amplification bias are both reduced by using a PCR annealing temperature and cycle number on the low ends of the ranges currently used for the Leray-FolDegenRev primers. We also report that tag jumps and erroneous sequences can be nearly eliminated with Begum filtering, at the cost of only a small rise in dropouts. We replicate published findings that uneven size distribution of input biomasses leads to greater dropout frequency and that OTU size is a poor predictor of species input biomass. Finally, we find no evidence for 'tag-biased' PCR amplification.

AB  - Enteric pathogens can be present in drinking water catchments due to several point and non-point sources of faecal contamination. Pathogen and contaminant signatures will decay due to environmental stresses, such as temperature, Ultra Violet (UV) radiation, salinity, and predation. In this study, we determined the decay of the culturable faecal indicator bacterium (FIB) Escherichia coli (E. coli), two sewage-associated marker genes (Bacteroides HF183 and crAssphage CPQ_056), and enteric pathogens (Campylobacter spp., human adenovirus 40/41, and Cryptosporidium parvum) in two freshwater laboratory microcosms using culture-based, quantitative PCR (qPCR) and vital dye (determine the fraction of viable Cryptosporidium oocysts) assays. Freshwater samples from the Lake Wappa and Lake Wivenhoe (Australia) were seeded with untreated sewage and C. parvum oocysts, and their declining concentrations were measured over a 28-day period. Moreover, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was also undertaken to determine the change/shift in sewage-associated bacterial communities using SourceTracker. Overall, culturable E. coli and the HF183 marker gene decayed significantly (p < 0.05) faster than did the qPCR measured enteric pathogens suggesting that the absence of culturable FIB or qPCR HF183 in water samples may not indicate the absence of pathogens. The decay of crAssphage was similar to that of HAdV 40/41 and other pathogens tested, suggesting crAssphage may be a better surrogate for enteric viruses in sub-tropical catchment waters. The decay rates were greater at 25 degrees C compared to 15 degrees C, suggesting that FIB and pathogens persist longer in the winter season compared to summer. Overall decay rates of the tested microorganisms in this microcosm study suggest that sub-tropical conditions, especially temperature, have a negative impact on the persistence of tested microorganisms. Sewage-associated bacterial communities also showed similar patterns. Based on the results, which showed differences in simulated summer and winter temperatures for pathogen decay, corresponding management options and treatment need to be adjusted accordingly to minimize human health risks effectively.

AB  - Direct measurement of the acidity (pH) of ambient aerosol particles/droplets has long been a challenge for atmospheric scientists. A novel and facile method was introduced recently by Craig et al. (2018), where the pH of size-resolved aerosol droplets was directly measured by two types of pH-indicator papers (pH ranges: 0-2.5 and 2.5-4.5) combined with RGB-based colorimetric analyses using a model of G - B (G minus B) vs. pH(2). Given the wide pH range of ambient aerosols, we optimize the RGB-based colorimetric analysis on pH papers with a wider detection range (pH similar to 0 to 6). Here, we propose a new model to establish the linear relationship between RGB values and pH: PHpredict = a . R-normal + b . G(normal) + c . B-normal. This model shows a wider applicability and higher accuracy than those in previous studies and is thus recommended in future RGBbased colorimetric analyses on pH papers. Moreover, we identify one type of pH paper (Hydrion (R) Brilliant pH dip stiks, lot no. 3110, Sigma-Aldrich) that is more applicable for ambient aerosols in terms of its wide pH detection range (0 to 6) and strong anti-interference capacity. Custommade impactors are used to collect lab-generated aerosols on this type of pH paper. Preliminary tests show that, with a collected particle size range of similar to 0.4-2.2 mu m, the pH paper method can be used to predict aerosol pH with an overall uncertainty <= 0.5 units. Based on laboratory tests, a relatively short sampling time (similar to 1 to 4 h) is speculated for pH prediction of ambient aerosols. More importantly, our design of the impactors minimizes potential influences of changed environmental conditions during pH paper photographing pro- cesses on the predicted aerosol pH. We further show that the routinely adopted way of using pH color charts to predict aerosol pH may be biased by the mismatch between the standard colors on the color charts and the real colors of investigated samples. Thus, instead of using the producer-provided color charts, we suggest an in situ calibration of pH papers with standard pH buffers.

AB  - There is ample evidence that phenotypic traits are important mate choice criteria. Yet, we still know little about the importance of behavioural plasticity in attracting mates, although females could gain direct and/or indirect fitness benefits by choosing males that can adjust their behaviour to environmental fluctuations. Plasticity in foraging tactic use, particularly, might be a key determinant of fitness that could guide mate choice. In this study, we thus asked whether female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) prefer males exhibiting greater plasticity in their foraging tactic use. We measured individual plasticity in a producer-scrounger game where males and females, playing in turn, were exposed to two seed distribution treatments, and females could monitor the males' behaviour, unbeknownst to them. Subsequently, we measured the time each female spent in front of the males they had previously observed in the expectation that females would exhibit a general preference for males with greater plasticity in tactic use. Contrary to our expectation, we found that females did not unanimously prefer the males exhibiting greater plasticity but differed widely in their preference with more plastic females showing a stronger preference for male plasticity compared to the other females. Thus, our findings suggest that differences among females in their mating preference would contribute to maintaining differences in plasticity in tactic use. Significance statement Mate choice is a crucial decision in an individual's life that directly impacts its fitness. Given that females could benefit from choosing males capable of responding to changes in environmental conditions, we asked in this study whether female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) prefer males exhibiting greater plasticity in their foraging tactic use. We let females observe males expressing plasticity in a social foraging context and scored their mate preference for male plasticity. We found that females differed in their preference for male plasticity in tactic use, with more plastic females exhibiting a stronger preference for male plasticity compared to the others. Our results indicate that behavioural plasticity may be used as a mate choice criterion and hence suggest that mate choice might contribute to maintaining differences in male behavioural plasticity.

AB  - Although simultaneous interpreting (SI) is generally recognized as a highly demanding cognitive activity in nature, the role of cognitive processes in SI fluency is yet to be determined. While utterance fluency refers to the set of objectively determined oral features of utterances, cognitive fluency means the speaker's efficient mobilization and integration of underlying cognitive processes responsible for utterance production. An investigation into the relationship of the two dimensions of fluency helps to reveal the cognitive bases of interpreting. This study explores the predicting power of cognitive fluency in the utterance fluency development of L2 (English)-L1 (Chinese) SI output of trainee interpreters. Cognitive fluency was operationalized as measures of lexical access, linguistic attention control, and working memory capacity. Measures of utterance fluency were obtained through simulated SI tasks under conditions of low and high input rates. Twenty-eight trainees interpreted two speeches, one with a high input rate and the other with a low input rate, at the beginning and end of an SI training period of 13 weeks. A bilingual corpus of the participants' SI output was built, and indicators of SI utterance fluency were annotated systematically. Utterance fluency was indexed by the speech rate, mean length of run, phonation time ratio, mean number of silent pauses, and mean number of disfluencies. Results of analyses indicated that (1) the predicting power of cognitive fluency for SI utterance fluency development was only shown under high cognitive load over a training period of 13 weeks; (2) predictors for the development of SI utterance fluency tended to be the efficiency of cognitive processes involved in the target language production stage; and (3) the inclusion of measures of working memory capacity significantly increased the predicting power of cognitive fluency for SI utterance fluency development. This study for the first time provides evidence for the role of cognitive fluency in trainee interpreters' SI utterance fluency development, having implications for the theoretical framework of cognitive fluency and the information processing mechanism in interpreting process, as well as for interpreter aptitude tests and interpreting pedagogy.

AB  - Simple Summary The live animal export industry is under increasing public scrutiny to ensure optimal animal welfare conditions are met. To date, the main animal-based welfare indicator used to review and regulate this industry has been mortality. For a proactive industry wanting to transition to reporting on animal welfare not mortality, a broader suite of measures is needed. We reviewed a total of 71 potential animal welfare measures, identifying those measures that would be appropriate for use throughout the live export chain for feeder and slaughter livestock animals, and categorised these as animal-, environment- and resource-based. After considering the industry-specific constraints for animal welfare assessments, measures were categorised according to their application to the three identified sectors of the live export industry. We identified measures already undertaken or that are relevant for specific situations as part of the industry. Further research is currently underway to validate the applicability and value of these measures. Animal welfare is an important issue for the live export industry (LEI), in terms of economic returns, community attitudes and international socio-political relations. Mortality has traditionally been the main welfare measure recorded within the LEI; however, high mortality incidents are usually acted upon after adverse events occur, reducing the scope for proactive welfare enhancement. We reviewed 71 potential animal welfare measures, identifying those measures that would be appropriate for use throughout the LEI for feeder and slaughter livestock species, and categorised these as animal-, environment- and resource-based. We divided the live export supply chain into three sectors: (1) Australian facilities, (2) vessel and (3) destination country facilities. After reviewing the relevant regulations for each sector of the industry, we identified 38 (sector 1), 35 (sector 2) and 26 (sector 3) measures already being collected under current practice. These could be used to form a 'welfare information dashboard': a LEI-specific online interface for collecting data that could contribute towards standardised industry reporting. We identified another 20, 25 and 28 measures that are relevant to each LEI sector (sectors 1, 2, 3, respectively), and that could be developed and integrated into a benchmarking system in the future.

AB  - Lake water salinity, an important indicator of lake hydrological conditions, is critical to deciphering terrestrial paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental changes. The proportion of C-37:4 alkenone to total C-37 alkenones (%C-37:4) and the relative abundance of archaeol to caldarchaeol (ACE) are promising salinity indices in lacustrine settings. Developing regional calibrations for both indicators is challenging due to limited datasets and a poor understanding of the factors that influence them. Here we present %C-37:4 and ACE data collected from 55 lakes in mid-latitude Asia with a wide salinity range, to evaluate how well the two proxies can be correlated with salinity and to infer potential influencing factors. The %C-37:4 values only show a weak negative correlation with salinity from all investigated lakes. The occurrence of C-37:3 alkenone isomer and abnormal values in the alkenone C37/C38 ratio might signal species shifts or environmental factors that compromise the %C-37:4-salinity relationship in our data set. Seasonal bias in alkenone production could further obscure this %C-37:4-salinity relationship. A stronger relationship emerges after removing samples influenced by these factors: %C-37:4 = -8.56 * log(10) (salinity) + 80.6, r(2) = 0.62, n = 37; or %C-37:4 = -13.46 * log(10) (salinity) + 101.48, with uncertainty in both variables considered. The ACE values show a strong positive correlation with salinity from all investigated lakes: ACE = 2.27 * 10(-4)* salinity + 25.4, r(2) = 0.75, n = 68; or ACE = 1.86 * 10(-4)* salinity + 38.1, with uncertainty in both variables considered. However, substantial deviations of the ACE values in low salinity range (<60,000 mg/L) and majority of the ACE shift in the range of 60,000-100,000 mg/L suggest that the ACE primarily responds to Euryarchaeota/Archaea community changes when a salinity threshold is crossed. Accordingly, both lake salinity indicators have the potential to reconstruct past salinity changes when their influencing factors could be constrained, and the two independent proxies, when they are used together, could further refine salinity reconstructions.

Higher than expected levels of methane, non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), and NOx have been observed in areas close to oil and NG operation facilities. Large uncertainties in the oil and NG operation emission inventories reduce the confidence level in the impact assessment of such activities on regional air quality and climate, as well as in the development of effective mitigation policies. In this work, we used ethane as the indicator of oil and NG emissions and explored the sensitivity of ethane to different physical parameterizations and simulation setups in the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model using the US EPA National Emission Inventory (NEI-2011). We evaluated the impact of the following configurations and parameterizations on predicted ethane concentrations: planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterizations, daily re-initialization of meteorological variables, meteorological initial and boundary conditions, and horizontal resolution. We assessed the uncertainties around oil and NG emissions using measurements from the FRAPPE and DISCOVER-AQ campaigns over the northern Front Range metropolitan area (NFRMA) in summer 2014. The sensitivity analysis shows up to 57.3% variability in the normalized mean bias of the near-surface modeled ethane across the simulations, which highlights the important role of model configurations on the model performance and ultimately the assessment of emissions. Comparison between airborne measurements and the sensitivity simulations indicates that the model-measurement bias of ethane ranged from -14.9 to -8.2 ppb (NMB ranged from -80.5% to -44 %) in regions close to oil and NG activities. Underprediction of ethane concentration in all sensitivity runs suggests an actual underestimation of the oil and NG emissions in the NEI-2011. An increase of oil and NG emissions in the simulations partially improved the model performance in capturing ethane and lumped alkanes (HC3) concentrations but did not impact the model performance in capturing benzene, toluene, and xylene; this is due to very low emission rates of the latter species from the oil and NG sector in NEI-2011.

AB  - We investigate our ability to assess transfer of hexavalent chromium, Cr(VI), from the soil to surface runoff by considering the effect of coupling diverse adsorption models with a two-layer solute transfer model. Our analyses are grounded on a set of two experiments associated with soils characterized by diverse particle size distributions. Our study is motivated by the observation that Cr(VI) is receiving much attention for the assessment of environmental risks due to its high solubility, mobility, and toxicological significance. Adsorption of Cr(VI) is considered to be at equilibrium in the mixing layer under our experimental conditions. Four adsorption models, that is, the Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin, and linear models, constitute our set of alternative (competing) mathematical formulations. Experimental results reveal that the soil samples characterized by the finest grain sizes are associated with the highest release of Cr(VI) to runoff. We compare the relative abilities of the four models to interpret experimental results through maximum likelihood model calibration and four model identification criteria (i.e., the Akaike information criteria [AIC and AIC(C)] and the Bayesian and Kashyap information criteria). Our study results enable us to rank the tested models on the basis of a set of posterior weights assigned to each of them. A classical variance-based global sensitivity analysis is then performed to assess the relative importance of the uncertain parameters associated with each of the models considered, within subregions of the parameter space. In this context, the modelling strategy resulting from coupling the Langmuir isotherm with a two-layer solute transfer model is then evaluated as the most skilful for the overall interpretation of both sets of experiments. Our results document that (a) the depth of the mixing layer is the most influential factor for all models tested, with the exception of the Freundlich isotherm, and (b) the total sensitivity of the adsorption parameters varies in time, with a trend to increase as time progresses for all of the models. These results suggest that adsorption has a significant effect on the uncertainty associated with the release of Cr(VI) from the soil to the surface runoff component.

AB  - Context Global climatic changes are increasingly producing observable shifts in species distributions. It is widely believed that the northern distribution of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in North America is limited by cold winter temperatures and deep snow. Under all climate change scenarios, it is likely that the adverse effects of winter will diminish, which may result in a northward expansion of the distribution of white-tailed deer.
   Aims The goal of this project was to quantify the drivers of white-tailed deer distribution identified from a set of climate and land cover variables. We wanted to forecast changes to the northern limit on white-tailed deer distribution under several climate change scenarios.
   Methods We used an occupancy-modelling approach to identify the variables or combination of variables that best estimated the occupancy of white-tailed deer across a 140-site camera-observation network operating from 2013 to 2015. We validated our model using data from a mammal atlas from 1993. We used available data from climate change scenarios to predict and map changes to the northern limit of white-tailed deer distribution for three time horizons up to 2100.
   Key results Our models indicated that both climate and land cover had a determining influence on the northern limit of white-tailed deer distribution in our study area. Variables describing winter climate, in particular temperature and snow depth, were most closely associated with the northern edge of white-tailed deer distribution, and land cover variables added explanatory power. Our predictions suggested that white-tailed deer distribution will expand northward, given the retreat of severe winters.
   Conclusions White-tailed deer distribution is controlled by land-based habitat indicators and limited at a northern boundary by the severity of winter climate. Current CO2 emission scenarios indicate that winter conditions will no longer limit the northern distribution of white-tailed deer in our study area by the year 2100.
   Implications Under all climate change scenarios, the influx of white-tailed deer to new northern environments will likely impact the dynamics of other wildlife populations. The management of species such as moose (Alces alces) and caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in these regions must anticipate the disruptive potential of white-tailed deer.

AB  - Understanding of terrestrial carbon and water cycles is currently hampered by an uncertainty in how to capture the large variety of plant responses to drought. In FLUXNET, the global network of CO2 and H2O flux observations, many sites do not uniformly report the ancillary variables needed to study drought response physiology. To this end, we outline two data-driven indicators based on diurnal energy, water, and carbon flux patterns derived directly from the eddy covariance data and based on theorized physiological responses to hydraulic and non-stomatal limitations. Hydraulic limitations (i.e. intra-plant limitations on water movement) are proxied using the relative diurnal centroid (C*(ET)), which measures the degree to which the flux of evapotranspiration (ET) is shifted toward the morning. Non-stomatal limitations (e.g. inhibitions of biochemical reactions, RuBisCO activity, and/or mesophyll conductance) are characterized by the Diurnal Water-Carbon Index (DWCI), which measures the degree of coupling between ET and gross primary productivity (GPP) within each day. As a proof of concept we show the response of the metrics at six European sites during the 2003 heat wave event, showing a varied response of morning shifts and decoupling. Globally, we found indications of hydraulic limitations in the form of significantly high frequencies of morning-shifted days in dry/Mediterranean climates and savanna/evergreen plant functional types (PFTs), whereas high frequencies of decoupling were dominated by dry climates and grassland/savanna PFTs indicating a prevalence of non-stomatal limitations in these ecosystems. Overall, both the diurnal centroid and DWCI were associated with high net radiation and low latent energy typical of drought. Using three water use efficiency (WUE) models, we found the mean differences between expected and observed WUE to be -0.09 to 0.44 mu mol mmol(-1) and -0.29 to -0.40 mu mol mmol(-1) for decoupled and morning-shifted days, respectively, compared to mean differences -1.41 to -1.42 mu mol mmol(-1) in dry conditions, suggesting that morning shifts/hydraulic responses are associated with an increase in WUE, whereas decoupling/non-stomatal limitations are not.

AB  - Soil physicochemical properties can be regarded as an important tool to assess soil health, which further form a base for biological activity in soil. These soil physicochemical properties are comparable in identical land-uses and so reflect similar soil microbial properties. However, the changes in land-use types and their effects on soil physicochemical and microbial properties are largely debated and rather unclear.
   The aim of this study is to assess the impact of land-use types and soil depth on physicochemical properties (Organic C, total N, C/N ratio, available phosphorus, bulk density, pH and electrical conductivity), nitrogen forms (Nitrate-N, ammonium-N, organic N, mineralizable N, microbial biomass N and extractable organic N) as well as microbial indices (basal respiration, respiratory quotient, microbial quotient, microbial biomass). Land use types- farmland, orchard, grassland and abandoned land served as horizontal factors while soils at 0-10 cm, 10-30 cm and 30-60 cm depth were used as vertical factors for accessing the physicochemical and microbial properties. Discriminant analyses (DA) indicated that soil microbial properties were affected by both land-use types and soil depths than nitrogen and physicochemical properties in our study. We found that the overall trend of percentage of discriminant function 1 (DF1) was highest for microbial indices (similar to 90%) > nitrogen (similar to 80%) > physicochemical properties (similar to 70%). All investigated soil properties differed with higher significance by land-use types than by soil depths. The results further indicated that among all investigated soil properties in different land-use types, electrical conductivity, mineralizable nitrogen and microbial biomass carbon served as best discriminating indices. Regarding soil depths, total organic carbon followed by mineralizable nitrogen and basal respirations were found to be the decisive indicators of soil conditions.
   Overall, our results demonstrate the sensitivity of various soil properties and their differential provenience along horizontal and/or vertical gradients. These outcomes suggest that differences in land-use types are reflected in soil physicochemical properties that are actual drivers of soil microbial properties in this region. Thus they are promising guideline tools for further studies related to soil quality, soil management and sustainability in long run.

AB  - The objective of the study is to identify new patterns of formation deposits and ore occurrences of different metallogenic specialization in the Volnovakhskaya ore zone of junction of the Priazovsky megablock of Ukrainian Shield with the Donbas in connection with the nature of the deep structure of lithosphere.
   The analysis of geophysical, geological, petrological and radiogeochemical information on the specifics of the formation, placement of the main types of deposits and ore occurrences at the junction of the Priazovsky megablock of the Ukrainian Shield with the Donbas in close connection with the features of the deep structure of the lithosphere, asthenosphere and fault tectonics was carried out. The features of the deep structure of the lithosphere and their physical parameters that affect the conditions of metallogenic diversity and intensive ore genesis in the formation of deposits and ore occurrences of various metallogenic specializations in the Volnovakhskaya ore zone were revealed. The analysis of metallogenic specialization of the main manifested area of research stages of tectonic activation was carried out. We have obtained new patterns in the formation of different deposits and ore occurrences in junction zone of the Priazovsky megablock of the Ukrainian Shield and the Donbas, including uranium ore occurrences. In particular, their connection with the focal structures of repeated magmatism of various composition, hydrothermal activity, halos of secondary metasomatic changes of host rocks within the deep faults and their crossing points over the zone of abrupt change in thickness of the lithosphere of the slope of the Ukrainian Shield, and the formation of barogradient zones in the asthenosphere in the process of the Earth's evolution.
   The practical significance of this research is to increase the efficiency of metallogenic forecasts by expanding the range of metallogenic diversity and intensity of ore genesis, geophysical and petro-geochemical indicators of primary scale concentration of ore components of different metallogenic specialization in the asthenosphere. This makes it possible to reasonably determine the prospects of the territories for the possibility of forming large ore concentrations of different metallogenic specialization with the allocation of areas of their most probable localization.

AB  - Introduction. Since there are no data on correlation and regression analysis of the main indicators of personal insurance. Also with the aim of identifying the main problems of personal insurance and directions of their solution in the context of increasing the competitiveness of the insurance market, we have carried out correlation and regression studies on the interdependence of insurance premium receipts, insurance premiums life, life insurance, pension contributions and retirement benefits.
   Materials and methods. Scientific research of the main problems of personal insurance was based on the application of the following methods: abstract-logical, system analysis and grouping for studying the main problems of the insurance market and directions of problem solving. The method of correlation-regression analysis was used to study the statistical interdependence between such indicator, the amount of insurance premiums and the number of insurance contracts, the sum of insurance premiums in general and insurance premiums for health insurance, as well as medical insurance payments, etc.
   Results and discussion. The main risks of the personal insurance market are global risks (the cyclical nature of the development of the world financial and economic system), macroeconomic and microeconomic risks (rates of changes in the national economy and individual branches), financial risks (unsatisfactory financial condition of insurance companies, low quality of assets of insurers) and commercial risks.
   Correlation regression analysis of indicators of life insurance showed high reliance life insurance premiums of total premiums collected, as the correlation coefficient is 0,669, the relationship between the studied elements directly, with determination coefficient of 0,447, that factor variable (gross premiums) determines the 44,7% rate dependent life insurance premiums. Similar to the dynamics and nature of the situation characterizing the dependence of pension payments from pension contributions, higher values of correlation coefficients and determination.
   Conclusions. Increasing the competitiveness of the insurance market will help to overcome such risks to the personal insurance market as global risks, macroeconomic and microeconomic risks, financial and commercial risks. The main problems of personal insurance are defined by the low level of public confidence in insurers, insurers' fraud, the slow pace of economic restructuring and low incomes. In addition, the high level of dependence of life insurance premiums from the total amount of insurance premiums shows positive trends in the country's insurance market development.

AB  - The aim of this study was to explore the factors influencing patterns of space use of commercial free-range laying hens and their relation to welfare indicators. Three free-range laying hen flocks were studied during one production cycle by collecting spatial locations on 150 individually tagged hens per flock. At the end of production, welfare and morphometric measures were collected. The results indicated that use of the outdoor area was lower during midday (P < 0.05), but remained stable across age periods (P > 0.05). Tagged hens were classified according to their use of the outdoor area (heavy, medium, light, or never) per age period. A total of 49.5% were never observed using the outdoor area, which was higher than any other category (P < 0.05). In addition, the early experience of the hens using the outdoor area during the first 16 wk (20 to 36 wk) determined the level of use of the outdoor area at later ages (P < 0.05). Most use of space parameters did not vary according to age period (P > 0.05); only activity center indoors increased (P < 0.05), while mean distance from the hen house tended to increase (P = 0.053). However, birds with a higher frequency of use of the outdoor area had larger home ranges and activity centers (r = 0.956, r = 0.964 P < 0.05, respectively) and showed lower plumage damage (r = -0.337, P < 0.05) and a lower incidence of footpad dermatitis (r = -0.307, P < 0.05). On the contrary, birds showing higher total walked distance indoors showed a higher incidence of footpad dermatitis (r = 0.329, P < 0.01). We conclude that there exist individual differences in the use of the outdoor area, with early experience (20 to 36 weeks) during the production period being the most relevant factor affecting outdoor area use. Birds visiting the outdoor area more frequently also used larger areas. In addition, individual patterns of space use had some relevance on the incidence on foot pad dermatitis and plumage condition.

TI  - Sedimentary sources and processes in the eastern Arabian Sea: Insights from environmental magnetism, geochemistry and clay mineralogy

LA  - English
AB  - The spatial distribution patterns of surficial sediment samples from different sedimentary domains (shallow to deep-sea regions) of the eastern Arabian Sea were studied using sediment proxies viz. environmental magnetism, geochemistry, particle size and clay mineralogy. Higher concentrations of magnetic minerals (high chi(lf)) were recorded in the deep-water sediments when compared with the shallow water sediments. The magnetic mineralogy of one of the shallow water samples is influenced by the presence of bacterial magnetite as evidenced from the chi(ARM)/chi(lf) vs. chi(ARM)/chi(fd) biplot. However, the other samples are catchment-derived. The high correlation documented for chi(lf), anhysteretic remanent magnetisation (chi(ARM)) and isothermal remanent magnetisation (IRM) with Al indicates that the deep-sea surficial sediments are influenced by terrigenous fluxes which have been probably derived from the southern Indian rivers, the Sindhu (the Indus) and the Narmada-Tapti rivers. A lower Mn concentration is recorded in the upper slope sediments from the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) but a higher Mn/Al ratio is documented in the lower slope and deep-sea sediments. Clay minerals such as illite (24-48.5%), chlorite (14.1-34.9%), smectite (10.6-28.7%) and kaolinite (11.9-27.5%) dominate the sediments of shallow and deep-sea regions and may have been derived from different sources and transported by fluvial and aeolian agents. Organic carbon (OC) data indicate a low concentration in the shallow/shelf region (well oxygenated water conditions) and deeper basins (increased bottom-water oxygen concentration and low sedimentation rate). High OC concentrations were documented in the OMZ (very low bottom-water oxygen concentration with high sedimentation rate). The calcium carbonate concentration of the surface sediments from the continental shelf and slope regions (<1800 m) up to the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge show higher concentrations (average = 58%) when compared to deep basin sediments (average = 44%). Our study demonstrates that particle size as well as magnetic grain size, magnetic minerals and elemental variations are good indicators to distinguish terrigenous from biogenic sediments and to identify sediment provenance.

AB  - Soil is the largest pool of carbon after the ocean. The assessment of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks under different types of vegetations is critical for evidence-based implementation of soil carbon trading under different market mechanisms. Using data from 490 permanent soil sample plots with elevations ranging from 271 m to 3238 m above sea level, from three different watersheds in Nepal, this study aims to compare SOC under five different forest types and determine whether forest types could be indicator of SOC: Shorea robusta; mixed broadleaf; Schima-Castanopsis; pine; and Rhododendron-Quercus forests. In each vegetation type forests with dense canopies (>= 70% canopy cover) have higher amounts of SOC than that of open canopy forests (<70% canopy cover). On average, with up to 30 cm soil depth, dense canopy Rhododendron-Quercus forest has the highest amount of SOC (14,136 g C/m(2)), followed by dense canopy mixed broadleaf forest (12,576 g C/m2). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicates significant differences in soil organic carbon (SOC) amounts across the five forest types (df = 485, F=17.299, p=0.000) and therefore forest types could be indicator of SOC. Moreover, within the similar altitudinal zone and topographic, edaphic and climatic environments: soils under the mixed species forests have higher amounts of SOC than that of single species dominated forests; and soils under forests with nitrogen fixing trees have a higher amount of SOC than those from other forests. Therefore, in addition to forest types these two conditions within the given vegetation types could work as sub-indicators of SOC. In comparison with global studies, all Nepalese forest types had much higher levels of SOC. Only two of the seven factors/indicators investigated (altitude and average age of dominant trees) were found to have significant impacts (r=0.33 to 0.64) on SOC and only in the dense and sparse canopy pine forests. The reasons of not having any impacts of all other factors on SOC in different vegetation types have been discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The temporal depth and spatial breadth of observations from platforms such as Landsat provide unique perspective on ecosystem dynamics, but the integration of these observations into formal decision support will rely upon improved uncertainty accounting. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations offer a practical, empirical method of accounting for potential map errors in broader ecosystem assessments. However, unless steps are taken across simulations to vary the probability density functions (PDFs) that control simulated map error, the large number of map units to which those PDFs are applied may cause convergence of mean simulated conditions and an artificial reduction of MC estimates of uncertainty. For MC simulation of errors in categorical maps, we introduce a technique we call "PDF weaving" which both: 1) allows variation of PDFs across simulations; and, 2) explicitly aligns the resulting range of simulated populations with estimates and uncertainties identified by traditional monitoring methods such as design-based inventories. This approach is based on solving systems of linear equations and inequalities for each simulation. Each system incorporates linear constraints related to the unchanging distribution of area among classes in the original map (akin to the fixed longitudinal "warp" on a loom) with variable linear constraints related to the class distribution to be simulated in any one iteration (analogous to the perpendicular, variable fibers of the "weft"). Additional constraints specify how many map units to treat as "correct" based on validation exercises at the map unit level. Solution of these systems provides PDFs which will simulate error at both the map unit level and the population level in a way that is consistent with validation exercises and available population-level estimates. We illustrated this approach in an assessment of the effects of wildfire and harvest on carbon storage over 20 years on a forested landscape in the western United States (US). This assessment utilized the Forest Carbon Management Framework (ForCaMF) approach, which is being implemented by the US National Forest System (NFS). Results showed that simulating map error through the use of dynamic PDFs can contribute significant, realistic uncertainty in a Monte Carlo analysis, but that impacts of fire and harvest on carbon storage may nevertheless be dearly identified and differentiated using remotely sensed maps of vegetation and disturbance.

AB  - Background: Depression and cardiovascular diseases due to arteriosclerosis are both frequent and impairing conditions. Depression and (subclinical) arteriosclerosis appear to be related in a bidirectional way, and it is plausible to assume a partly joint causal relationship. However, the biological mechanisms and the behavioral pathways that lead from depression to arteriosclerosis and vice versa remain to be exactly determined.
   Methods/design: This study protocol describes the rationale and design of the prospective BiDirect Study that aims at investigating the mutual relationship between depression and (subclinical) arteriosclerosis. BiDirect is scheduled to follow-up three distinct cohorts of individuals ((i) patients with acute depression (N = 999), (ii) patients after an acute cardiac event (N = 347), and (iii) reference subjects from the general population (N = 912)). Over the course of 12 years, four personal examinations are planned to be conducted. The core examination program, which will remain identical across follow-ups, comprises a personal interview (e. g. medical diagnoses, health care utilization, lifestyle and risk behavior), a battery of self-administered questionnaires (e. g. depressive symptoms, readiness to change health behavior, perceived health-related quality of life), sensory (e. g. olfaction, pain) and neuropsychological (e. g. memory, executive functions, emotional processing, manual dexterity) assessments, anthropometry, body impedance measurement, a clinical work-up regarding the vascular status (e. g. electrocardiogram, blood pressure, intima media thickness), the taking of blood samples (serum and plasma, DNA), and structural and functional resonance imaging of the brain (e. g. diffusion tensor imaging, resting-state, emotional faces processing). The present report includes BiDirect-Baseline, the first data collection wave.
   Discussion: Due to its prospective character, the integration of three distinct cohorts, the long follow-up time window, the diligent diagnosis of depression taking depression subtypes into account, the consideration of relevant comorbidities and risk factors, the assessment of indicators of (subclinical) arteriosclerosis in different vascular territories, and the structural and functional brain imaging that is performed for a large number of participants, the BiDirect Study represents an innovative approach that combines population-based cohorts with sophisticated clinical work-up methods and that holds the potential to overcome many of the drawbacks characterizing earlier investigations.

AB  - The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), at ca. 55.8 Ma, is one of the most studied instances of past greenhouse gas-induced global warming. As such, it provides a rich opportunity to examine the impact of such global change on local climates. The effects of increased continental and sea surface temperatures on local precipitation and humidity during the PETM remain poorly constrained and studies reveal complex, regional differences: whilst some localities appear to experience a net increase in humidity, others exhibit the opposite. Crucially, there are few records of hydrological change from tropical regions. Recent onshore drilling expeditions in Tanzania have yielded expanded sedimentary sections, deposited in a marine environment, that span much of the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene and show exceptionally good preservation of both calcareous microfossils and organic matter. The PETM interval has previously been constrained by both biostratigraphy and carbon isotopic records and spans ca. 7 m of section. Lipid distributions, including various terrestrial, marine and bacterial biomarkers and their hydrogen isotopic compositions, as well as mineralogy, were used to examine East African vegetation and hydrological responses to the global change occurring at the PETM. Although total organic carbon contents decrease, the concentrations of both higher plant (n-alkanes, n-alkanoic acids) and soil bacterial (glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers) biomarkers increase dramatically at the onset of the PETM negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE), suggesting an increased discharge of fluvial sedimentary organic matter. Similarly, mineralogical indicators of terrestrial input - including Ti/Al and Si/Al ratios, quartz contents and, notably, the proportion of kaolinite - also increase at the onset of the CIE. However, higher plant leaf wax n-alkanes (C-27, C-23 and C-31) become more deuterium-enriched throughout the same interval, suggesting a more arid and/or hotter, rather than a more humid, environment This evidence collectively suggests an East African early PETM climate characterised by overall hot and arid conditions punctuated by intense, perhaps seasonal, precipitation events. These data match observations from other locations at mid-latitudes, suggesting that the humid climate often suggested for the PETM was not globally widespread. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - An artichoke is a commonly cultivated vegetable in the Mediterranean region. It is cultivated for an immature flower head. In Poland the artichoke is cultivated as an annual plant because of its high temperature demands. It is difficult to determine the most optimal harvest stage and the most often it is based on expensive chemical analysis. In the years 2007-2009 there was a research undertaken to specify the most optimal harvest stage of flower heads. In order to determine a development stage of head the height of flower bud in the middle part of the receptacle was measured directly after harvest. The unit weight of each head, the level of bracts deflection, content of dry weight, L-ascorbic acid, raw protein, raw fibre and total sugars in whole heads and their fractions: receptacle and bracts were determined. On the basis of obtained results it was stated that the size of flower buds on an inflorescence axis is a sign of full synchronization of head development and changing environmental conditions during artichoke vegetation. The edible part of artichoke, a receptacle, had more dry weight, total sugars, L-ascorbic acid and raw protein and less raw fibre in comparison to inner bracts. The increase of flower buds height on receptacle was accompanied with the increase of dry weight, raw fibre and total sugars content in heads and its fractions. The longer flower buds in the middle part of inflorescence the lower content of total protein in whole heads and bracts and the higher content of this component in receptacle. It was stated that the size of flower buds was negatively correlated with content of L-ascorbic acid as with the increase of flower buds height in receptacle the content of L-ascorbic acid in whole heads and it's fractions decreased. The obtained results show that the level of bracts deflection may the selection indicator to determine harvest maturity. This feature of artichoke head allows to visually determine its harvest usability. Receptacles of Symphony content more dry matter, total protein and less total sugars than those of Madrigal. Intermediate values were found in Symphony and Madrigal for L-ascorbic acid and crude fibre.

AB  - Filter-feeding bivalve mollusks (shellfish) can bioaccumulate pathogenic microorganisms in up to 1000-fold higher levels than overlying waters, and therefore disease risks are associated with consuming raw or partially cooked shellfish. Many of these shellfish-borne diseases are due to enteric bacteria and viruses associated with fecal contamination. To control shellfish-borne diseases, guidelines for shellfish harvest waters and shellfish meat have been devised, which include cleansing of contaminated shellfish by depuration in controlled systems, heat pasteurization, or relay to clean waters. This study examines the depuration of oysters (Crassostrea virginica) and hard shell clams (Mercinaria mercinaria) in a flow-through depuration system under variable temperature (12 degrees C. 18 degrees C, and 25 degrees C), salinity (8 ppt, 18 ppt, and 28 ppt), turbidity (<1 NTU, 10 NTU, and 20 NTU), pH (pH 7 and pH 8), and algae conditions (0 cells/mL and 50,000 cells/mL), with constant dissolved oxygen (5-7 mg/L). Oysters and hard shell clams were artificially contaminated with enteric microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecal's, coliphage MS2. Poliovirus type-1 and Hepatitis A virus HM-175 (HAV), then depurated in 5-day trials with daily sampling. In oysters, optimizing environmental parameters of water temperature improved E. coli. MS2, poliovirus and HAV depuration, and optimized salinity improved E. coli, E. faecalis, and MS2 depuration rates. In hard shell clams, salinity improved E. coli and E. faecalis depuration rates. Adjusting turbidity, pH or algae did not improve microorganism depuration in either oysters or hard shell clams, with the exception of turbidity on E. faecalis in hard shell clams. Microorganism depuration rates in oysters from greatest to least were: MS2>E. coli>E. faecalis>poliovirus>HAV, and in clams depuration rates from greatest to least were: E. coli>E. foecalis>HAV>MS2>poliovirus. Because E. coli and E. faecalis were removed at faster rates than HAV and poliovirus, these fecal bacteria appear to be poor process indicators of the virological quality of depurated oysters and hard shell clams.

AB  - Purpose Methiocarb and metaldehyde are the most common molluscicides applied in agricultural and horticultural fields in Portugal and elsewhere in Europe. The application of molluscicidal baits to control slug and snail populations can pose a threat to non-target organisms like terrestrial isopods, because they are detritivorous and may feed on the toxic baits applied to the soil surface. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects and understand the modes of action of these molluscicides to terrestrial isopods.
   Materials and methods In this study, the terrestrial isopod Porcellionides pruinosus was exposed to these two molluscicides, and the time to lethality was evaluated. Biochemical indicators (biomarkers) are known to provide early warning signs of environmental pollution or stress conditions to the organisms, by measuring cellular or molecular responses of the target organism to xenobiotic agents. Therefore, to evaluate modes of action and effects and also to see if biomarkers can be used as early warning tools in molluscicidal exposures, three different enzymes, glutathione S-transferase (GST), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and catalase (CAT), were analysed upon single exposures and binary mixtures tests.
   Results and discussion These two molluscicides showed to be of extreme concern regarding terrestrial isopods, as all animals died after 24 h of exposure to methiocarb, and only 20% survived after 56 h of exposure to metaldehyde. Results indicate that the carbamate methiocarb inhibited significantly AChE activity, but no effects were observed in CAT and GST levels. The exposure to metaldehyde had no effects on AChE, but a decrease in GST activity as well as a general increase in CAT activity was observed at the higher exposure period tested (32 h). The combined exposure of the two molluscicides resulted in a general decrease in AChE and CAT activity, but no visible effects were observed in terms of GST activity.
   Conclusions The LT50 values found in the single exposures to both molluscicides were very low, especially in the case of the carbamate methiocarb. The use of several biomarkers was a suitable tool to understand the mode of action of these two molluscicides in this isopod species.

AB  - The farm household responsibility system (FHRS) was adopted in Chinese rural areas during the economic reform in the early 1980s. Since then, many farm households have increased cropping intensity by using large quantities of nitrogen (N) fertilizers in their responsible fields to increase agricultural income. However, intensive cropping systems with low N input are still common in remote places of the southwestern region of China. Maintenance and improvement of soil quality in intensive cropping systems is critical for sustaining agricultural productivity and environmental quality for future generations. The effects of intensive cropping of vegetables on paddy rice (Oryza sativa L.) yield using small quantities of N fertilizers through N mineralization of paddy soil in irrigated rice-based multiple cropping systems were studied in 15 paddy fields in Sichuan Province, China for 3 years. Intensification of vegetable cropping with negative N balance and removal of vegetable crop residues has greatly decreased total N (TN) contents in paddy soil leading to low levels of effective cumulated soil temperature and thickness of plow layer. As a result, the N mineralization in paddy field during paddy rice growing period was decreased. In addition to the low levels of chemical fertilizer N input and residual mineral N input, the lower level of N mineralization in paddy fields and low N recovery efficiency decreased the amount of N accumulated in above-ground biomass of paddy rice at maturity, resulting in limited rice yields. The amount of mineralized N only correlated with TN (partial correlation analysis). Therefore, in paddy fields with very low N input, the N mineralization in paddy soil during the paddy rice-growing period was the major limiting factor affecting the total yield increases. In addition, a decline in soil fertility can be determined using TN as an indicator. To improve paddy rice yield and avoid soil deterioration, the development and adoption of rational soil management programs are needed. These include input of plant residues, conscientious soil tillage for the maintenance of soil temperature and thickness of the plow layer, and the split application of fertilizer for the improvement of N recovery efficiency.

AB  - Diverse plant remains recovered from an archaeological site of Chalcolithic-Early Historic age in the Bhairabdanga area of Pakhanna (latitude 23 degrees 25'N, longitude 87 degrees 23'E), situated on the west bank of the Damodar river, Bankura district, West Bengal, India, include food grains, wood charcoals, and palynomorphs. Radiocarbon dating of the recovered biological remains reveal the age of the site as (3 320 +/- 400) to (2 080 +/- 80) yr BP. The food grains were identified as Oryza sativa L. and Vigna mungo L, and seeds of Brassica cf. campestris L. were also found; these indicate the agricultural practice and food habits of the ancient people living at Pakhanna from the Chalcolithic to the Early Historic period. Sediments including plant remains have been broadly divided into two zones, considering archaeological findings and radiocarbon dating. Analysis of the plant remains (i.e. wood charcoals and palynomorphs) in addition to cultivated food grains has revealed that a rich vegetation cover existed in this area, with a prevailing tropical and humid climate, comprising the timber-yielding plants Shorea sp., Terminalia sp., and Tamarindus sp., with undergrowths of diverse shrubs and herbs during the Chalcolithic period (zone I) dated (3 320 +/- 400) yr BP. Comparatively poorer representation and frequency of plant remains indicate a drier climate during the Early Historic period (zone II) dated as (2 110 +/- 340) to (2 080 +/- 80) yr BP. Comparisons of the archaeobotanical data recovered from the Chalcolithic and Early Historic period and also a principle components analysis indicate a change in the climate of the area from tropical and humid at (3 320 +/- 400) yr BP to tropical and drier conditions at (2 110 +/- 340) to (2 080 +/- 80) yr BP. The present-day tropical, dry deciduous vegetation of the area suggests that climate change has occurred in the area since the contemporaneous past. The plant remains database has been utilized to reconstruct the settlement pattern of the community living in the site between (3 320 +/- 400) and (2 080 +/- 80) yr BP. The community settled near the riverbank, practicing cultivation.

AB  - A case study on the application of the River Water Quality Model No. 1 (RWQM 1) is presented in order to illustrate the importance of modelling a sediment compartment for an ecologically meaningful assessment of the impact of wastewater effluents and combined sewer overflows. The focus of this case study is on the compartmentalisation approach of the RWQM 1 that makes such a description possible. In contrast to this, a strongly simplified biochemical submodel is used that considers only oxygen and dissolved substrate. The object of the case study is the River Lahn, a moderately polluted 5th order stream in Germany. for which the connectivity of surface/subsurface flows and mass fluxes within river sediments have been intensively investigated. The hyporheic flow between a downwelling and upwelling zone of a riffle-pool sequence has been studied with the aid of tracer experiments and continuous records of water constituents. High diurnal fluctuations of oxygen travelled to considerable depth of the sediment and oxygen in the interstitial water decreased considerably while travelling through the riffle, Starting with the implementation of a strongly simplified version of the biochemical part of the RWQM 1, but with the consideration of a sediment pore water compartment in addition to the water column compartment, a calibration procedure is performed using tracer data from the water column and the sediment. The calibrated model is then used to study the system response to wastewater treatment plant effluent and combined sewer overflow emissions. The modelling approach makes it possible to quantify the sediment oxygen demand and the spatial and temporal extent of sediment zones with oxygen depletion. However, the spatially averaged approach does not account for inhomogeneities in the sediment. It is shown that for this river with its alluvial coarse sediments even moderate emissions from sewerage systems may be high enough to drop sediment oxygen concentrations to low levels while those in the surface flow remain close to saturation. Similarly, it is demonstrated that combined sewer overflows may cause anoxic sediment oxygen conditions for extended time periods. The implications for ecologically sound river water quality modelling and for specific quality objectives are discussed.

AB  - We tested how variable nitrogen availability affects the above- and below-ground growth of first-year Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings and carbon allocation to defensive allelochemicals and storage. Concentrations of free amino acids were considered as indicators of nutritive quality. Suitability of seedlings for polyphagous Lygus rugulipennis Popp. (Heteroptera: Miridae) was tested with oviposition preference and nymphal growth experiments. At the end of the growing season, needle length increased while root biomass decreased with elevated N fertilization, but shoot length was not affected. Concentration of starch in needles and roots, representing carbon storage, was not significantly affected by N fertilization, although there was a decrease in the starch concentration of needles when nitrogen input increased. Nitrogen fertilization significantly increased the pool of total and nonessential amino acids in the shoots. Arginine, proline and glutamine were the individual amino acids most affected by elevated N. Of the carbon-based defence compounds, total resin acid concentrations in shoots were significantly reduced with elevated nitrogen in 9-wk-old seedlings. Palustric acid and neoabietic acid were the most affected individual resin acids, whereas foliar monoterpenes were not influenced by N availability. Total phenolics in shoot and root showed variable response. The increasing effect of nitrogen on the oviposition rate of Lygus females was almost linear. Mean relative growth rate of the nymphs was significantly affected by the level of N fertilization, but the mortality of nymphs was high in all treatments. The results suggest that in nitrogen-rich environments the needle growth of small Scots pine seedlings is improved, but their susceptibility to insect attack is increased and they remain less defended as predicted by the carbon/nutrient balance hypothesis. Total phenolics and resin acids, representing phenylalanine and mevalonic acid pathways, respectively, were both reduced by increased nitrogen availability. Together with the simultaneous increase of foliar free nitrogen in the form amino acids, the nutritive value of seedlings is ameliorated and this might explain susceptibility of nursery-grown, N fertilized seedlings to polyphagous Lygus bugs.

AB  - The issue of psychosocial factors and concurrent conditions associated with AB is a relatively new approach in the study of Awake Bruxism (AB). In the present study a population of 84 dental students were assessed for probable AB with two modes of AB assessment: Single point self-report (SR) and ecological momentary assessment through a designated smartphone application (BA). The two assessment modes were compared with regard to their ability to phenotype subjects as far as the following psychosocial and behavioral variables are concerned: Gender; depression; somatization; oral behaviors; chronic pain and associated pain symptoms in the head, neck and scapula. Two-way ANOVA showed main effect of SR for the following variables: Chronic Pain Intensity score (F-(1,F-49) = 6.441, p < 0.02), migraine/headache (F-(1,F-81) = 7.396, p < 0.01), pain in neck (F-(1,F-81) = 6.726, p < 0.05), pain in scapula (F-(1,F-81) = 8.546, p < 0.005) and the oral behaviors of pushing the tongue forcefully against the teeth (F-(1,F-81) = 5.222, p < 0.05) and inserting the tongue between the upper and lower teeth (F-(1,F-81) = 5.344, p < 0.03). The effect of SR on the habit of chewing gum was borderline (F-(1,F-81) = 3.369, p = 0.07). Main effect of BA was found for depression (F-(1,F-81) = 6.049, p < 0.05), while the effect of BA on somatization was borderline (F-(1,F-81) = 3.657, p = 0.059). An interaction between SR and BA groups could be observed for the behavior of biting, chewing or playing with the tongue, cheeks or lips (F-(1,F-81) = 4.117, p < 0.05). The results suggest that a combination of a single-point self-report referring to the past 30 days, and an ecological momentary assessment supplying information about the actual timing of the report, can help us to better assess AB, as well as increase our ability to define the phenotype of subjects with AB as far as psychosocial and behavioral factors are concerned.

AB  - The technical performance and economic analysis of a developed hybrid solar-electric dryer (HSED) were investigated in this research work with respect to energy, exergy, and environmental sustainability. Experimental investigations were performed with and without load during the rainy season, in which the sunshine periods were affected by intertropical discontinuity, prompted by cold-prevalent wind interference from the Atlantic Ocean and regional water catchment. Thermal characteristics and drying efficiency of the hybrid dryer, as well as the effect of different drying temperatures (50, 60, and 70 degrees C), air velocities (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 ms(-1)), and sample thicknesses (10, 15, and 20 mm) on the overall and specific energy usage for 1,500 g batch size of fresh sliced tomato samples, were investigated. The percent energy contributions of the solar and electric heat units at varying air velocities were also determined. Results obtained indicate that the mean solar collector efficiencies during sunshine hours ranged between 24.6 and 70.3%. The total and specific energy consumption of tomato slices (Lycopersicon esculentum) varied between 5.61-120.31 kJh and 5.18-167.59 kJhg(-1), respectively. Analysis of variance results show that drying air temperature, sample thickness, and velocity of air were significant atP> 0.05. The percent energy contribution by solar and electric heat units varied between 44.57-56.24% and 43.76-55.43%, respectively. Drying time and drying efficiency ranged between 130 +/- 7 and 330 +/- 5 min and 4.33-36.38%, respectively. The average energy efficiency of the hybrid system increased from 15.67 to 38.17%, whereas the mean exergy efficiency varied between 32.2 and 87.9%. The sustainability indicators such as ratio of waste exergy, sustainability index, and improvement potential of the HSED ranged from 0.083 to 0.158, 1.93-6.77, and 0.099-0.289 kJs(-1), respectively. Optimum drying conditions for improved final quality were given. The economic analysis established that the HSED could save up to $1,490.33 per annum with a low payback period (0.72 years), thus making the dryer cost effective and economically viable. Prospects for improvement and future works were highlighted.

AB  - Global experience related to increased pork production shows that breeding work has become an integral part of the technology, since it is impossible to further improve breeding and performance traits of animals without it and therefore the greater production of better quality pork. The paper presents the results of the breeding process arrangement for creation of F-1 parental pig. Substantiation of breeding techniques when creating the final parental groups of sows (F1) with a high adaptive ability was based on complex methods to evaluate breeding animals, including traditional methods of domestic breeding and breeding indices. Evaluation of combination compatibility of breed-linear hybrids with the use of breeding indices during mating of parent initial forms allows to determine efficiency of using Yorkshire sows with Landrace boars, and Landrace sows with Yorkshire boars (final parental sows (F1)), which had significantly better reproductive indicators in comparison with BLW x BM genotype sows. Particularly efficient compatibility was recorded when selecting Yorkshire sows and Landrace boars. It was determined that in modern conditions an increase in the efficiency of breeding and pedigree work in pig breeding was based on the use of genetic methods, including: individual assessment of pedigree species according to the main breeding traits, evaluation of genome of each breeding animal, and use of breeding indices allowing to identify the true genetic potential of animals and predict performance traits of their offspring. The research relevance lies in using the innovative methodology for comprehensive assessment of combination compatibility of parental pairs, unified for pig husbandries and pig farms, which will make it possible to 10% accelerate the breeding process of forming the final parental forms of sows, ensure obtaining offspring with predictable reproductive, fattening and meat traits, and good adaptive ability. Acknowledgments. The research was carried out as part of the State Research and Development Program "High Technologies and Engineering for 2016-2020", task " To develop a set of biotechnological techniques and methods based on DNA technology and breeding indices ensuring accelerated creation of new final parental forms in pig breeding with high adaptive ability".

AB  - Mules found working in Egyptian brick kilns are often faced with poor welfare from being over worked, overloaded, having multiple lesions from ill-fitted harnesses, poor body scores, and receiving aversive treatment by handlers. Reports have frequently revealed aggressive responses by mules toward their handlers. The main goal of this study was to investigate whether mule aggression is an innate act toward people or is a reactive response to rough handling procedures by their handlers. A total of 374 mules from 50 different kilns were assessed and their handlers were interviewed. The handler's questionnaire recorded the following parameters: handler's age, experience, and common beliefs about the aggression of brick kiln mules, and also data regarding load weights, working hours, and husbandry procedures carried out by the handlers were collected. The data were analyzed and correlations between parameters were tested using SPSS 17.1. Handlers' data showed that 79% of participants believed that mules are inherently difficult to handle, 65% used nose ropes/metal chain for driving their mules, and 67% responded that mules must be beaten to work properly. Behavioral assessment revealed that 66% of mules were alert. Approach tests indicated that 30% of the mules exhibited signs of aggression (e.g., bite threat) when approached by an unfamiliar handler and only 16% showed signs toward their handlers (familiar). The assessment of body lesions showed that mistreatment-induced lesions (42%) were more predominant than other categories of body lesions. Significant correlations (P <= 0.05) were found between mules' aggressive responses toward observers and the following parameters; body condition score (r(s) = 0.42), along with the handler's age (r(s) = -0.53), level of experience (r(s) = -0.34), handler's common beliefs about mule aggression (r s = 0.64), and the nature of the work they were involved with at the kilns (work hours, r(s) = -0.63; load weight, r(s) = 0.38). Based on the results of this study, we concluded aggressive interactions exhibited by mules were most likely initiated by harsh, violent handling. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A detailed organic geochemical evaluation of potential source rock samples (n = 350) collected from outcrops and wells in the Cenozoic Moghan Basin, NW Iran, was undertaken using whole rock (Rock-Eval pyrolysis, organic petrography) and extract (GC and GC-MS) analyses. The studied intervals consist of Eocene to Miocene shale/sandstone successions interpreted to have been deposited in nearshore marine conditions. Three potential source rock intervals were investigated: the Salm Aghaji Formation (lower Middle Eocene), the lower member of the Ojagheshlagh Formation (upper Middle Eocene), and the Ziveh Formation (Oligo-Miocene). The results were used to evaluate the samples' petroleum potential and thermal maturity. A range of maturity parameters indicate that these source rocks are in the early oil generation window in the study area, and outcrop samples are less mature than subsurface samples. Rock-Eval T-max values for the outcrop and subsurface samples range from 410-442 degrees C and 438-445 degrees C, respectively. At a regional scale, there is an eastwards increase in thermal maturity which reaches the main oil window (ca. 3000 m) in the east of the Moghan Basin, as indicated by both VRo measurements and maturity-sensitive biomarkers. Fair to moderate TOC contents (averaging 0.72, 0.99 and 0.78 wt.%) were recorded respectively for the Salm Aghaji, Ojagheshlagh and Ziveh Formations. Average HI values of less than 200 mg HC/g TOC (131, 178 and 104 respectively for the three formations) indicate the dominance of Type III kerogen. This is consistent with detailed molecular parameters which show a dominance of C-29 steranes over C-27 and C-28 homologues. These observations are interpreted to indicate a nearshore marine depositional environment with an abundant terrigenous organic matter input. However, HI values of several samples fall into the range of 250 to 650 mg HC/g TOC showing the local presence of Type II kerogen. Thus the geochemistry and maturity results from this study suggest that shale-rich intervals in the Salm Aghaji, Ojagheshlagh and Ziveh Formations may be potential source rocks for the oil shows which have been recorded in wells in the Moghan Basin.

AB  - Fluoride is the atmospheric pollutant with the highest phytotoxicity arising from aluminum smelting fertilizers, glass and, ceramic industry. The most affected plant organ is the leaf, in which the fluoride penetrates through two main ways: absorption by epidermis cuticle or absorption by stomata. Species susceptible to fluoride are potential tools in bioindicator studies because they provide a means for detecting the presence of the pollutant in the environment at a low cost. The aim of this study is to evaluate the sensibility of Spondias purpurea L. (Anacardiaceae) to fluoride through the simulated fog. Simulation was performed by applying 500 ml of solution containing 15 mg L-1 of potassium fluoride per plant for 20 min daily and for 10 consecutive days. The data of leaflet abscission, visual damage, and climate conditions were recorded daily. At the end of the experiment, data from the cell death analysis, electrolyte leakage determination, and accumulation of the fluoride in the dried matter were collected. Moreover, samples for phenolic compound accumulation, anatomical, and micromorphological analyses were collected. After 24 h, the appearance of visible damage was observed in the leaves with fluoride treatment. This damage consisted, mostly, of necrosis, chlorosis, and leaf apical shriveling. The necroses manifested in gray and brown discoloration. Leaf abscission was intense in the young leaves. Microscopic damage consisted of protoplast retraction, phenolic compound accumulation, collapse, hyperplasia, and cell rupture. Turgidity loss, epicuticular wax erosion, and damage of stomata and trichomes beyond the presence of fungal hyphae were noted in the epidermis. Evans Blue detected dead cell groups in the transition region between the necrosis and the apparent healthy area. Fluoride affected the selective permeability of the membrane, which was observed in this study according to the high rate of electrolyte leakage. Plants exposed to fluoride accumulated 14.48 times more fluoride in their leaves than plants in the control group. It follows that S. purpurea is susceptible to fluoride and responds quickly to the presence of this pollutant. Marginal and apical necrosis, presence of phenolic compounds, fluoride accumulation, anatomical alterations, and leaflet abscission in the young leaves are biomarkers of fluoride effects in this species. Therefore, S. purpurea is potentially useful in biomonitoring programs.

AB  - The thick and continuous Mio-Pliocene sedimentary successions of the Focsani Depression in the Dacian Basin of Romania provide an excellent opportunity to study the paleoecological changes in the Eastern Paratethys during the time when the Mediterranean and Black Sea experienced major sea level fluctuations related to the closure and re-opening of the marine connection to the Atlantic Ocean during the Messinian Salinity Crisis. These successions form the basis of high-resolution magneto-biostratigraphic studies that allow a detailed correlation to the standard Geological Time Scale. Here, we analyze the paleoenvironmental evolution of the East Carpathian foredeep by integrating micro- and macropaleontological data and sedimentological analyses. The ostracod and mollusc fossil associations from the Ramnicu Sarat river section indicate that the late Maeotian depositional environment was characterized by shallow waters and littoral to fluvio-deltaic sediments. The Maeotian-Pontian boundary (6.04 Ma) is marked by a marine ingression, comprising benthic (agglutinated and calcareous) and planktonic (Streptochilus spp.) foraminifera and nanofossils. Following this marine ingression, the Lower Pontian (Odessian; 6.04-5.8 Ma) fauna shows an increased bathymetry of the basin. The presence of ostracod species with eye tubercles indicates depositional environments within the photic zone (<100 m). The Middle Pontian (Portaferrian; 5.8-5.5 Ma) is marked by a widespread sea level lowering resulting in dominant fluvio-deltaic conditions. This ecostratigraphy demonstrates that the main Messinian sea-level draw down (at 5.6-5.5 Ma) occurred in mid-Portaferrian times. Paleoenvironmental indicators show that the water level in the Focsani Depression dropped less than 100 m during Mediterranean desiccation. The Dacian Basin remained filled with water, suggesting a positive hydrological balance for the region. This is compatible with the presence of a shallow barrier at Dobrogea (the Galati passage), separating the Dacian Basin from the Black Sea Basin during the late Miocene. The Portaferfian-Bosphorian boundary (5.5 Ma) is marked by a second transgressive event, but this time without marine foraminifera. We conclude that the Dacian Basin formed a semi-isolated entity during the Portaferrian and experienced connectivity to the Black Sea domain during the Odessian and Bosphorian. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The load of total nitrogen (TN) in stream water was surveyed in the Nagara River Basin (2,000 km(2)), central Japan Multivariate analysis placed the TN data in an environmental and social context, relating TN to land use conditions such as geologic features, population density, and percentage of the population using the sewer system Multivariate analysis was used to examine relationships among the land use distribution with and without human activity and the amount of pollution effluent from waste water treatment plants (WWTP) The pollution load in stream water is related to characteristics of the land cover in the river basin, so the influence of land use on the pollutant load was investigated. However, key factors affecting the pollutant load are human activities associated with the land use In this study, a relationship between pollutant load, land use, and human activity is developed Land use was estimated from Landsat data using ISODATA clustering The distribution of the land cover factors was related to human activities, e. population density, agricultural production, industrial wastewater discharge, percentage of sewered population, and stock breeding in the catchment Multivariate analysis related the TN data to land use and human activities However, the types of land use were found to be insufficient to evaluate the TN, which appeared to be largely governed by other human-related factors such as industrial wastewater discharge, agricultural production, population density, and livestock density Socioeconomic data, were obtained from government agencies The results indicate that the TN load outflow characteristics of the study catchment were affected not only by outside human activity, but also largely by the various human activities in the small drainage basin. Industrial waste water contributed as much to the pollution load outflow as did human activity. This is shown quantitatively in that land use information collected at the same time as that collected on human activities provides effective baseline data The model proposed here is suitable for evaluating best management practices.

AB  - Brachiopods are the most widely used biological constituents for the determination of stable C- and O-isotopic compositions in Paleozoic sediments. In the present study, critical precautions for obtaining reliable isotope values and maximum possible reliability are discussed. Samples were taken in the tectonically undisturbed and exceptionally well-preserved Silurian sequence on Gotland (Sweden). The state of preservation of brachiopod shells was examined by cathodoluminescence (CL) microscopy and by comparison of shell ultrastructures with those of recent brachiopods. Nine types of ultrastructure are distinguished and attributed either to biological differences or to diagenetic alterations. For isotope analyses, only largely unaltered areas of the secondary, fibrous shell layer should be used. Shell layers with other types of ultrastructure (primary, tertiary, laminar) may have isotopic compositions different from the assumed seawater value even when diagenetically unaltered. Only brachiopod taxa with a shell succession that includes a sufficiently thick secondary shell layer (e.g., Spiriferida. Rhynchonellida, Orthida) give reliable, mutually corresponding isotope values, indicating that the shell calcite precipitated at or near equilibrium with ambient seawater. Brachiopods with other kinds of shell successions (Strophomenida, Pentamerida) as well as other calcite-shelled organisms (trilobites, ostracodes) give non-equilibrium isotopic results and therefore should not be used. By restricting the samples to one species or to a group of closely related species, even minor differences in primary isotopic composition can be excluded. In the Silurian of Gotland, the stratigraphically widely distributed spiriferid Atrypa reticularis was selected for study.
   Considering the type of record, four different taphonomic assemblages are defined. In autochthonous assemblages of specimens, which lived contemporarily, original values of carbon as well as oxygen isotopes can be evaluated with a reliability of < +/- 0.4 parts per thousand. This allows the recognition of minor, hydrographically produced differences between neighbouring, contemporary facies areas and the determination of small (< 1 parts per thousand) isotopic excursions. Thus. besides being indicators of hydrographic conditions in ancient oceans, stable carbon- and oxygen-isotope compositions can be used as a stratigraphic tool that provides correlations, sometimes even within biozones.

AB  - This paper presents carbon isotope data on soil organic matter (SOM) collected along an ecosystem transect that includes a wooded savannah (cerrado), a tropical semideciduous forest (cerrad (a) over tilde o), a forest transition type and a tropical forest. The study area is located in the Rondonia state, southwestern Brazilian Amazon region. C-14 data of total soil organic matter and charcoal indicate that the organic matter in these soils is at least Holocene in age. The forest and forest transition sites are characterized by delta(13)C soil depth profiles generated typically by C-3 plants, indicating no major changes in plant communities have occurred in this region during the time period represented by the isotope data. In contrast, the cerrado and cerrad (a) over tilde o have experienced significant vegetation changes during the Holocene. The delta(13)C data (-30 parts per thousand to -27 parts per thousand) obtained in the deepest part of the profile at the cerrad (a) over tilde o site show the expansion of the C-3 forest vegetation into this region during early Holocene. A vegetation change consisting of increased C, plant influence is reflected in the C-13-enriched values (-19 parts per thousand to -16.0 parts per thousand) at both sites during the middle Holocene. The recent part of the C-13 record shows a clear expansion of C-3 vegetation, particularly at the cerrad (a) over tilde o site. The regression/expansion of the forest and savannah vegetation documented at the cerrad (a) over tilde o and cerrado sites is probably related to changes from a humid to a drier climate and a return to more humid conditions and is in agreement with palaeoclimatic information reported for Brazil and the Bolivian Altiplano. This study suggests that large areas in the Amazon basin have been affected by vegetation changes during the Holocene and that soil organic matter in the transition areas between savannah and forest ecotones contains a valuable palaeorecord of vegetation changes in the Amazon region.

AB  - Our aim is to analyze the extent to which the psychosocial aspects can characterize the affective states of the teachers, administrative staff, and undergraduate and postgraduate students during the quarantine. A questionnaire was answered by 1,328 people from the community of the Universitat de Barcelona (UB), Spain. The survey was partially designed ad hoc, collecting indicators related to sociodemographic variables, the impact of COVID on the subjects or in their personal context, the psychosocial context of coexistence and perceived social support, characteristics related to the physical context during the quarantine, and labor conditions. Additionally, it included two validated instruments: the Survey Work-Home Interaction-Nijmegen for Spanish Speaking Countries (SWING-SSC) validated in Spanish and PANAS, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. Classification and Regression Trees (CART) were performed to identify which variables better characterize the participants' level of positive and negative affective states. Results according to groups showed that students are the ones who have suffered the most as a result of this situation (temporary employment regulation, higher scores in negative work-home and home-work interaction, lower scores in positive home-work interaction, and negative effects of teleworking). Additionally, they reported a higher mean score in interpersonal conflict and worse scores with regard to negative affective states. Based on sex, women were the ones whose environment was shown to be more frequently affected by the pandemic and who exhibited more negative effects of teleworking. In general terms, participants with the highest scores in negative affective states were those who perceived an increase in conflict and a high negative effect from work spilling over into their personal lives. On the contrary, participants with the highest levels of positive affective states were those with medium to low levels of negative home-work interaction, over 42.5 years old, and with medium to high levels of positive work-home interaction. Our results aim to help higher education to reflect on the need to adapt to this new reality, since the institutions that keep pace with evolving trends will be able to better attract, retain, and engage all the members of the university community in the years ahead.

AB  - Heat stress significantly impacts dairy production. Skin temperature (Tskin) is demonstrated to be critical to the thermal comfort of animals. The predictive models for Tskin of dairy cattle have great potential in guiding climate control systems in dairy barns to mitigate the heat stress of dairy cows efficiently. This study aimed to develop thermal models to predict the Tskin of dairy cows. Ten models were constructed based on integrating the existing models and formulas associated with the heat production and loss from the body surface and respiratory systems. The models were categorized into the two-layer and the three-layer models according to whether the core layer is included or not. The models were also categorized into the thermoregulatory and the mechanistic models based on the sub-model outside the skin surface. The prediction performances of the models were quantitively evaluated by comparing the predicted values with the Tskin measured by infrared thermography. 85 Holstein cows were included, and 453 infrared images that contained the mean and maximum Tskin were collected in this study. The root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2) were adopted as the performance metrics. The results show that the two-layer mechanistic model, including the actual core-body temperature, performed best for the mean Tskin with RMSE, MAE, and R2 of 0.649, 0.516, and 0.891, respectively. The two-layer thermoregulatory model, incorporating the estimated core-body temperature, provided satisfactory prediction performance for the maximum Tskin with RMSE, MAE, and R2 of 0.770 degrees C, 0.580 degrees C, and 0.793, respectively. The models generally performed better under heat stress conditions of the temperaturehumidity index >= 72, with all the performance metrics considered. Besides, in comparison to the mean Tskin, the maximum Tskin is less sensitive to environmental parameters but more correlated with the core-body temperature. It seems that the maximum Tskin is a more appropriate representation of skin temperature in dairy cattle than the mean Tskin.

AB  - Reduction in greenhouse gas emission from beef production is essential to the survival of the beef industry from environmental and social-economic perspectives. There are different systems available to measure methane from animals, but they are expensive, not easily accessible, and not suitable for large-scale methane measurements on the farm. Therefore exploring indicator traits, which are easy to measure, cost-effective, and suitable for large-scale measurement, are recommended. The objectives of this study were to examine the diversity of fecal methanogen profile among efficient and inefficient beef heifers on pasture and investigate methanogen profile as a possible proxy to predict methane emission in beef cattle consuming a forage diet. Forty pregnant (1st trimester) heifers previously classified for postweaning residual feed intake adjusted for off-test back fat (RFIfat; 20 high and 20 low) were included in this study. To determine individual pasture grazing intake, heifers were dosed with 1 kg of C-32 labeled pellets once per day from Day 0 to Day 12, and fecal samples were collected twice daily from Day 8 to Day 15. Fecal samples from Days 8, 10, and 12 were analyzed for their methanogen profile. Animals were monitored individually for methane and carbon dioxide production using a GreenFeed Emissions Monitoring system. Total methanogen population and methanogenic community diversity of fecal samples were not different (P > 0.1) between low and high RFIfat, groups, as measured by quantitative PCR and alpha- and beta-diversity indices. However, both groups had a different methanogen profile; the relative abundance of Methanobrevibacter wolinii and relatives were higher (P < 0.002), while that of Methanosphaera species ISO3-F5 was lower (P < 0.01) in low RFIfat, cattle compared to the high RFIfat, group. We also demonstrated that fecal methanogen profiles may be a useful proxy in predicting daily methane and carbon dioxide emissions with an adjusted R-2 of 0.53 and 0.33, respectively, for low RFIfat at heifers and 0.46 and 0.57, respectively, for the high RFIfat group.

AB  - The main problem explored in this study is how Taiwan and other countries meet the challenges of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals regarding energy transition by using legal instruments or policy bundles. This study adopts textual analysis and legal policy analysis as its main form of research methodology, and the theory of energy justice, as well as principles of energy management, to correlate with the Sustainable Development Goals. Furthermore, this study aims to construct an analysis structure for national energy transition and to analyze the current situation within Taiwan's electricity sector reforms, while providing evidence of the national experience of electrical industry reforms as an international reference. This study also compares the differences between the seventh Sustainable Development Goal relationship and national energy transitions in Taiwan and Japan, based on the similar initiative of the revised Electricity Act with the policy bundle. This study specifically finds that, firstly, the theory for energy justice is connected with the principles for energy management, owing to the same concepts of "Fair Competition", via the recognition of "Energy Development and Poverty", which correlates with "Environment Protection". Therefore, the concept of energy transition proposed in this study integrates national energy development policy goals and combines them with environmental sustainability, the green economy, and social equity. Secondly, the national energy transition in Taiwan is a response to the Sustainable Development Goals, and electricity sector-related laws could be used as legal tools for national energy transition. This study concludes that Taiwanese and Japanese governments can strengthen their environmental regulations to promote fair competition directly, with fair competition then being able to enhance stable electricity supply, to enable these countries to move towards the seventh Sustainable Development Goal and its indicators. Finally, the analysis structure used in this study could be used as a policy analysis tool for other countries during their own energy transition, when a nation is willing to strategically reform its electricity sector and make sustainable choices regarding transition paths and policy bundles that are suitable for the situation of the individual country. Then, a nation can make revisions to its laws and formulate a policy that is in line with local conditions, while as simultaneously implementing the Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - This article examines distinguishing features of terrorist-oriented criminality in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, exploring quantitative indicators of certain types of crimes. It is concluded that the current level of political violence in Vietnam is low. Using a wide range of data sources on composite indicators (Global Terrorism Index, Global Terrorism Database and Global Peace Index), it is concluded that to date Vietnam has recorded a low level of political violence. The research explores basic "criminogenic" conditions or factors that lead to relevant risk of growth of political violence. It should be noted that to some extent ethnic tensions still exist in Vietnam. There is also a great concern about criminal activity of a number of domestic and international terrorist organizations, which, in the short or long term, could disrupt domestic political situation and escalate terrorism. The researchers argue that although political and religious motives (e.g. establishing an Islamic state) underlie certain terrorist activities of international terrorist organizations and the fact that Muslims in Vietnam make up about 0,1 % of the country's population, Vietnam's international commitment to counter-terrorism is likely to make it a target of retaliation by these organizations. In addition, there is a possibility that these organizations may commit terrorist acts within the territory of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam to support and fund terrorist activities in the future. We summarized that as at present in force Criminal Code of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam includes special provisions that carry liability for individual acts showing signs of terrorism (arts. 113, 299, 300 CC SRV) and norms within international obligations that cover criminal liability for other crimes of terrorist nature (crimes with indicators of terrorization). The comparative legal analysis of anti-terrorist statutes presented in the 2015 version of the Criminal Code of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam reveals legal and technical defects in certain material elements of terrorist offences. It is noted that Vietnamese legislator distinguishes two forms of terrorism: "traditional" terrorism, which pursues political aims (criminal acts against the people's government, committed for the purpose of combating it) and terrorism aimed at creating a climate of fear in society.

AB  - Soil management practices affect rhizosphere microorganisms and enzyme activities, which in turn influence soil ecosystem processes. The objective of this study was to explore the effects of different nitrogen application rates on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rhizosphere soil microorganisms and enzyme activities, and their temporal variations in relation to soil fertility under supplemental irrigation conditions in a fluvo-aquic region. For this, we established a split-plot experiment for two consecutive years (2014-2015 and 2015-2016) in the field with three levels of soil moisture: water deficit to no irrigation (W1), medium irrigation to (70 +/- 5)% of soil relative moisture after jointing stage (W2), and adequate irrigation to (80 +/- 5)% of soil relative moisture after jointing stage (W3); and three levels of nitrogen: 0 kg ha(-1) (N1), 195 kg ha(-1) (N2) and 270 kg ha(-1) (N3). Results showed that irrigation and nitrogen application significantly increased rhizosphere microorganisms and enzyme activities. Soil microbiological properties showed different trends in response to N level; the highest values of bacteria, protease, catalase and phosphatase appeared in N2, while the highest levels of actinobacteria, fungi and urease were observed in N3. In addition, these items performed best under medium irrigation (W2) relative to W1 and W3; particularly the maximum microorganism (bacteria, actinobacteria and fungi) amounts appeared at W2, 5.37x10(7) and 6.35x 10(7) CFUs g(-1) higher than those at W3 in 2014-2015 and 2015-2016, respectively; and these changes were similar in both growing seasons. Microbe-related parameters fluctuated over time but their seasonality did not hamper the irrigation and fertilization-induced effects. Further, the highest grain yields of 13309.2 and 12885.7 kg ha(-1) were both obtained at W2N2 in 2014-2015 and 2015-2016, respectively. The selected properties, soil microorganisms and enzymes, were significantly correlated with wheat yield and proved to be valuable indicators of soil quality. These results clearly demonstrated that the combined treatment (W2N2) significantly improved soil microbiological properties, soil fertility and wheat yield on the Huanghuai Plain, China.

AB  - The article presents the results of 7 years of field research (2011-2016) of the main elements of winter wheat (T. aestivum L.) growing technologies Kolchuga variety, namely: sowing dates, seed sowing norms and plant nutrition optimization. The need for this study is due to the warming of the climate, the change in soil fertility and the emergence of new winter wheat varieties and biological products. Results of the researches, showed us the significant influence of sowing terms and the introduction of a moderate dose of mineral fertilizers and the implementation of foliar feeding in the main periods of vegetation of winter wheat plants on the level of yield of the Kolchuga variety was established. With the shift of sowing terms from September 10th to October 10th, the yield of the studied variety increased from 3.73 to 4.92 t/ha(-1). The seeding rates and sowing terms significantly influenced the formation of winter wheat grain quality. The highest mass fraction of protein (15.0%) and gluten (30.7%) in winter wheat grain was formed for sowing on October 20th.
   The use of Organic D2 and Escort - bio biological products contributed to an increasement in the yield of winter wheat grain at 1.53-1.59 t/ha(-1) or 52.9-55.0%. The positive effect of optimization of the main elements technology for increasing the quality of winter wheat grain is confirmed. Thus, if without fertilizers on average for the years of research the grain of Kolchuga variety contained of 11.2% protein, the application of only mineral fertilizers before sowing provided an increase in this indicator by 6.7%, and the carrying out of foliar fertilizing on their background provided an increase by 8.2-13.2%. It was determined that some better quality indicators of different grains of the investigated winter wheat variety for joint application of N30P30 and foliar dressing of winter wheat crops twice during the vegetation season with Escort-bio preparation. Thus, for this nutrition variant the content of crude gluten in winter wheat grain was 24.2%, and the protein content was 12.9%.

AB  - Background: Ketosis in dairy cattle has been shown to cause a high morbidity in the farm and substantial financial losses to dairy farmers. Ketosis symptoms, however, are difficult to identify, therefore, the amount of ketone bodies (mainly beta-hydroxybutyric acid, BHB) is used as an indicator of subclinical ketosis in cows. It has also been shown that milk BHB concentrations have a strong correlation with ketosis in dairy cattle. Mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR) has recently became a fast, cheap and high-throughput method for analyzing milk components. The aim of this study was to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on the MIR-predicted milk BHB to identify genomic regions, genes and pathways potentially affecting subclinical ketosis in North American Holstein dairy cattle.
   Results: Several significant regions were identified associated with MIR-predicted milk BHB concentrations (indicator of subclinical ketosis) in the first lactation (SCK1) and second and later lactations (SCK2) in Holstein dairy cows. The strongest association was located on BTA6 for SCK1 and BTA14 on SCK2. Several SNPs on BTA6 were identified in regions and variants reported previously to be associated with susceptibility to ketosis and clinical mastitis in Jersey and Holstein dairy cattle, respectively. One highly significant SNP on BTA14 was found within the DGAT1 gene with known functions on fat metabolism and inflammatory response in dairy cattle. A region on BTA6 and three SNPs on BTA20 were found to overlap between SCK1 and SCK2. However, a novel region on BTA20 (55-63 Mb) for SCK2 was also identified, which was not reported in previous association studies. Enrichment analysis of the list of candidate genes within the identified regions for MIR-predicted milk BHB concentrations yielded molecular functions and biological processes that may be involved in the inflammatory response and lipid metabolism in dairy cattle.
   Conclusions: The results of this study confirmed several SNPs and genes identified in previous studies as associated with ketosis susceptibility and immune response, and also found a novel region that can be used for further analysis to identify causal variations and key regulatory genes that affect clinical/subclinical ketosis.

AB  - The availability of water is a growing concern for flooded rice production. As such, several water-saving irrigation practices have been developed to reduce water requirements. Alternate wetting and drying and mid-season drainage have been shown to potentially reduce water requirements while maintaining rice yields when compared to continuous flooding. With the removal of permanently anaerobic conditions during the growing season, water-saving irrigation can also reduce CO2 equivalent (CO2eq) emissions, helping reduce the impact of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the long-term impact of water-saving irrigation on soil organic carbon (SOC)-used here as an indicator of soil health and fertility-has not been explored. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis to assess the effects of common water-saving irrigation practices (alternate wetting and drying and mid-season drainage) on (i) SOC, and (ii) GHG emissions. Despite an extensive literature search, only 12 studies were found containing data to constrain the soil C balance in both continuous flooding and water-saving irrigation plots, highlighting the still limited understanding of long-term impacts of water-saving irrigation on soil health and GHG emissions. Water-saving irrigation was found to reduce emissions of CH4 by 52.3% and increased those of CO2 by 44.8%. CO2eq emissions were thereby reduced by 18.6% but the soil-to-atmosphere carbon (C) flux increased by 25% when compared to continuous flooding. Water-saving irrigation was also found to have a negative effect on both SOC-reducing concentrations by 5.2%-and soil organic nitrogen-potentially depleting stocks by more than 100 kgN/ha per year. While negative effects of water-saving irrigation on rice yield may not be visible in short-term experiments, care should be taken when assessing the long-term sustainability of these irrigation practices because they can decrease soil fertility. Strategies need to be developed for assessing the more long-term effects of these irrigation practices by considering trade-offs between water savings and other ecosystem services.

AB  - Interannual variations in ecosystem primary productivity are dominated by water availability. Until recently, characterizing the photosynthetic response of different ecosystems to soil moisture anomalies was hampered by observational limitations. Here, we use a number of satellite-based proxies for productivity, including spectral indices, sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence, and data-driven estimates of gross primary production, to reevaluate the relationship between terrestrial photosynthesis and water. In contrast to nonwoody vegetation, we find a resilience of forested ecosystems to reduced soil moisture. Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence and data-driven gross primary production indicate an increase in photosynthesis as a result of the accompanying higher amounts of light and temperature despite lowered light-use-efficiency. Conversely, remote sensing indicators of greenness reach their detection limit and largely remain stable. Our study thus highlights the differential responses of ecosystems along a tree cover gradient and illustrates the importance of differentiating photosynthesis indicators from those of greenness for the monitoring and understanding of ecosystems.
   Plain Language Summary The capacity of vegetation to thrive and to sequester carbon depends on how much water they can have access to. In this work, we evaluate how different types of satellite observations can describe the response of vegetation to changes in soil moisture over the entire planet. The first source of observation measures only the greenness of the land surface, the second measures light that is emitted by pigments in plants which are photosynthetically active (chlorophyll fluorescence), and the third are simulations of gross carbon uptake derived from machine learning techniques. For periods of water shortage all three indicate a reduction of growth in ecosystems with few trees. However, in cold boreal forests, when soil moisture is particularly low, we still detect an increase in photosynthesis due to higher light and temperature conditions, but this is not reflected in the greenness indicator. This work illustrates how lack of water is not necessarily harmful for catching carbon through photosynthesis, but to monitor this effect, we need remote sensing indicators that measure more than just how green the plants are, and fluorescence is likely a good candidate.

AB  - Beachrocks are a common feature along the Brazilian coast and although their occurrence in intertidal zones is concentrated in tropical regions, similar formations have been described submerged on the continental shelf in subtropical regions. In the state of Parana, submerged sandstones are present on the continental shelf and their formation could be associated with the cementation of beach sediments. This would provide an excellent indicator of the stabilization of the coastline during lower sea-level periods. In this study, samples were identified and collected in Parana. State, Southern Brazil, at depths between 18 and 33 meters in the continental shelf and at 6 meters depth in the Paranagua Bay inlet. As in situ observations proved problematic, analysis relied mainly on their petrography, mineralogy, ages and isotopic values (delta C-13 and delta O-18). Whole rock dating demonstrated that the oldest acquired sample was formed 28109-26406 cal. years BP, being exposed to atmospheric conditions during the Last Glacial Maximum. This exposure is reflected in its cements, composed uniquely of microcrystalline and spar calcite, and on its delta O-18/delta C-13 values, which indicates formation on a fresh water environment. Contrarily to most carbonate cemented products described along Brazilian coastline, delta C-13 values ranged between -26.36 and -51.07 parts per thousand on all other samples, interpreted as a result of cement precipitation prompted by methane, either: in a paleo-estuarine/paleo-lagunar to transgressive environment buried under a pile of coarser material or; after transgression and drowning of organic-rich sediments by coarser sediments, and due to upward migration of methane on the sedimentary column. Both processes would result in cements identified on these samples, apart from the one collected closer to shore which indicates some freshwater influence. Two of the samples separated by 15km distance perpendicularly to the actual coastline and 1 lm depth difference yielded max and minimum ages of 7913 and 7452 cal. years BP. Such a short time span between these samples could be either the result of their formation on a linked environment or older carbon signature from drowned environments being present on younger cements.

AB  - paper presents the environmental, climate and vegetation changes reconstructed for the last 14.6 kyr cal BP from the Marbore Lake sedimentary sequence, the highest altitude record (2612 m a.s.l.) in the Pyrenees studied up to date. We investigate the sensitivity of this high altitude site to vegetational and climate dynamics and altitudinal shifts during the Holocene by comparing palynological spectra of the fossil sequence and pollen rain content from current moss pollsters. We hypothesize that the input of sediments in lakes at such altitude is strongly controlled by ice phenology (ice-free summer months) and that during cold periods Pollen Accumulation Rate (PAR) and Pollen Concentration (PC) reflect changes in ice-cover and thus is linked to temperature changes. Low sedimentation rates and low PC and PAR occurred during colder periods as the Younger Dryas (GS-1) and the Holocene onset (12.6-10.2 kyr cal BP), suggesting that the lake-surface remained ice-covered for most of the year during these periods. Warmer conditions are not evident until 10.2 kyr cal BP, when an abrupt increase in sedimentation rate, PC and PAR occur, pointing to a delayed onset of the Holocene temperature increase at high altitude. Well-developed pinewoods and deciduous forest dominated the mid montane belt since 9.3 kyr cal BP until mid-Holocene (5.2 kyr cal BP). A downwards shift in the deciduous forest occurred after 5.2 kyr cal BP, in agreement with the aridity trend observed at a regional and Mediterranean context. The increase of herbaceous taxa during the late-Holocene (3.5 kyr cal BP-present) reflects a general trend to reduced montane forest, as anthropogenic disturbances were not evident until 1.3 kyr cal BP when Olea proportions from lowland areas and other anthropogenic indicators clearly expand. Our study demonstrates the need to perform local experimental approaches to check the effect of ice phenology on high altitude lakes sensitivity to vegetation changes to obtain more realistic reconstructions of mountain vegetation belts dynamics.

AB  - Knowledge about the behavior and reactions of separate soil components with trace elements (TEs) and their distribution coefficients (K(d)s) in soils is a key issue in assessing the mobility and retention of TEs. Thus, the fate of TEs and the toxic risk they pose depend crucially on their K-d in soil. This article reviews the K-d of TEs in soils as affected by the sorption system, element characteristics, and soil colloidal properties. The sorption mechanism, determining factors, favorable conditions, and competitive ions on the sorption and K-d of TEs are also discussed here. This review demonstrates that the K-d value of TEs does not only depend on inorganic and organic soil constituents, but also on the nature and characteristics of the elements involved as well as on their competition for sorption sites. The K-d value of TEs is mainly affected by individual or competitive sorption systems. Generally, the sorption in competitive systems is lower than in mono-metal sorption systems. More strongly sorbed elements, such as Pb and Cu, are less affected by competition than mobile elements, such as Cd, Ni, and Zn. The sorption preference exhibited by soils for elements over others may be due to: (i) the hydrolysis constant, (ii) the atomic weight, (iii) the ionic radius, and subsequently the hydrated radius, and (iv) its Misono softness value. Moreover, element concentrations in the test solution mainly affect the K-d values. Mostly, values of K-d decrease as the concentration of the included cation increases in the test solution. Additionally, the K-d of TEs is controlled by the sorption characteristics of soils, such as pH, clay minerals, soil organic matter, Fe and Mn oxides, and calcium carbonate. However, more research is required to verify the practical utilization of studying K-d of TEs in soils as a reliable indicator for assessing the remediation process of toxic metals in soils and waters.

AB  - Several paleoclimate records such as from Chinese loess, speleothems or upwelling indicators in marine sediments present large variations of the Asian monsoon system during the last glaciation. Here, we present a new record from the northern Andaman Sea (core MD77-176) which shows the variations of the hydrological cycle of the Bay of Bengal. The high-resolution record of surface water delta O-18 dominantly reflects salinity changes and displays large millennial-scale oscillations over the period 40 000 to 11 000 yr BP. Their timing and sequence suggests that events of high (resp. low) salinity in the Bay of Bengal, i.e. weak (resp. strong) Indian monsoon, correspond to cold (resp. warm) events in the North Atlantic and Arctic, as documented by the Greenland ice core record. We use the IPSL_CM4 Atmosphere-Ocean coupled General Circulation Model to study the processes that could explain the teleconnection between the Indian monsoon and the North Atlantic climate. We first analyse a numerical experiment in which such a rapid event in the North Atlantic is obtained under glacial conditions by increasing the freshwater flux in the North Atlantic, which results in a reduction of the intensity of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. This freshwater hosing results in a weakening of the Indian monsoon rainfall and circulation. The changes in the continental runoff and local hydrological cycle are responsible for an increase in salinity in the Bay of Bengal. This therefore compares favourably with the new sea water delta O-18 record presented here and the hypothesis of synchronous cold North Atlantic and weak Indian monsoon events. Additional sensitivity experiments are produced with the LMDZ atmospheric model to analyse the teleconnection mechanisms between the North Atlantic and the Indian monsoon. The changes over the tropical Atlantic are shown to be essential in triggering perturbations of the subtropical jet over Africa and Eurasia, that in turn affect the intensity of the Indian monsoon. These relationships are also found to be valid in additional coupled model simulations in which the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is forced to resume.

AB  - For economic science HC concept is known for at least the last fifty years in the works of Schultz (1964), Becker (1962), when such issues as productivity and effectiveness of individual were touched. Therefore, in the current economic theories it is also very important to recognize the role of human capital and its management necessity, to understand the HC formation and application as a manageable process, which you need knowing well both in micro and in macro level.
   Evaluation of HC in macro level should include not only direct HC evaluation, but environmental evaluation as well. There must be evaluated not only the formal value of HC, but also the material, economical, social, environmental conditions, determining its appliance productivity and the need of systematic approach to HC.
   HC system evaluation framework in country level consists of a number of social and economic indicators, which depending on their size and system performance are expressed in various sizes of absolute or relative indicators. The integration of these indicators into a single one, form an integrated index. For various phenomena to investigate and analyze in practice, the index method is used often, which helps to reveal the links and the structure between the researched phenomena (Human Development Index (Human development report 2011), the index of Genuine Wealth Assessment (Genuine Wealth Assessment (2012), and so on.).
   Applying index calculation method, this article aims to reveal the indicators characterizing the formation principles of HC system, creating their evaluation methodology and on its base performing a comparative HC system-level analysis among the EU countries. The paper presents the main advantages of multi-factor indices method application, evaluating particular areas of social and economic activities; there is also proposed a seven stages process of HC system's integrated index formation and its practical adaptability comparing the selected EU countries and determining their level of HC development.
   The results of accomplished comparative evaluation of HC system in the 27 European Union countries using five groups of indices (social, innovation, consumer value - income, costs, and economic development) allowed creating an information basis selecting the effective indices, making it possible to evaluate the formation level of HC system in individual EU countries.

AB  - In this study, 91 strains, originating from meat products, were subjected to a step-by-step screening and characterisation to search for potential protective cultures to be used in the cooked cured meat industry. Strains were first tested on their homofermentative and psychrotrophic character and salt tolerance. Secondly, the antibacterial capacities towards Listeria monocytogenes, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc carnosum and Brochotrix thermosphacta were determined in an agar spot test. In total, 38% of the tested strains were inhibitory towards all indicator strains. However, 91%, 88% and 74% of the strains could inhibit, respectively, L. monocytogenes, B. thermosphacta and Leuc. mesenteroides. Finally, 12 strains, with the highest antibacterial capacities, were evaluated on their competitive nature by comparing their growth rate, acidifying character and lactic acid production at 7degreesC under anaerobic conditions in a liquid broth. All 12 strains, except for a bacteriocin producing Lactobacillus plantarum strain and the lactocin S producing Lactobacillus sakei 148, combined a fast growth rate with a deep and rapid acidification caused by the production of high levels of lactic acid. The 12 selected strains were then further, investigated for their growth capacity on a model cooked ham product to establish whether the presence of these cultures on the ham did not negatively influence the sensory properties of the ham. All strains grew in 6 days at 7degreesC from a level of 10(5)-10(6) to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g and again the bacteriocin producing L. plantarum strain was the slowest growing strain. As the glucose level of the model cooked ham product was low (0.09+/-0.03%), growth of the putative protective cultures resulted in glucose depletion and a limited lactic acid production and accompanying pH decrease. Cooked ham inoculated with isolates 13E, 10A, 14A (all three identified as L. sakei subsp. carnosus by SDS-PAGE) and with strains L. sakei 148 (LS5) and L. sakei subsp. carnosus SAGA 777 (LS8) were not rejected by the sensory panel at the 34th day of the vacuum packaged storage at 7degreesC. Therefore, these strains could have potential for the use as protective culture in cooked meat products. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) is the parameter most commonly used as chemical indicator for fish response to acidification. Empirical relationships between fish status of surface waters and ANC have been documented earlier. ANC is commonly calculated as the difference between base cations ([BC]=[Ca2+]+[Mg2+]+[N+]+[K+]) and strong acid anions ([SAA] = [SO42-] + [NO3-]+ [Cl-]). This is a very robust calculation of ANC, because none of the parameters incorporated are affected by the partial pressure of CO2, in contrast to the remaining major ions in waters, pH ([H+]), aluminum ([Aln+]), alkalinity ([HCO3-/CO32-]) and organic anions ([A(n-)]). Here we propose a modified ANC calculation where the permanent anionic charge of the organic acids is assumed as a part of the strong acid anions. In many humic lakes, the weak organic acids are the predominant pH-buffering system. Because a significant amount of the weak organic acids have pK-values < 3.0-3.5, these relatively strong acids will permanently be deprotonated in almost all natural waters (i.e. pH>4.5). This means that they will be permanently present as anions, equal to the strong acid inorganic anions, SO42-, NO3- and Cl-. In the literature, natural organic acids are often described as triprotic acids with a low pK(1) value. Assuming a triprotic model, we suggest to add 1/3 of the organic acid charge density to the strong acid anions in the ANC calculation. The suggested organic acid adjusted ANC (ANC(OAA)), is then calculated as follows: ANC(OAA) = [BC] - ([SAA] + 1/3CD*TOC]) where TOC is total organic carbon (mg C L-1), and CD = 10.2 is charge density of the organic matter (mueq/mg C), based on literature data from Swedish lakes. ANC(OAA) gives significant lower values of ANC in order to achieve equal fish status compared with the traditional ANC calculation. Using ANC(OAA) the humic conditions in lakes are better taken into account. This may also help explain observations of higher ANC needed to have reproducing fish populations in lakes with higher TOC concentrations. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB  - Stable carbon and oxygen isotopic analyses were conducted on small (< 10 mm), spherical Pleistocene carbonate soil nodules from 53 different levels in a 9.15-m soil auger collected in northern Western Australia. The delta(13)C and delta(18)O values range from -4 to 0parts per thousand and -9 to -6parts per thousand (Pee Dee Belemnite standard), respectively. Comparison of these values to the delta(13)C values of coexisting soil organic matter (SOM) reveals marked differences between the two records. The SOM values record an enrichment of similar to16parts per thousand through the section, whereas the carbonate values record only a 4parts per thousand variability. Application of a diffusion-production model to the data indicates isotopic disequilibrium between the two carbon records. One possible interpretation of the apparent isotopic disequilibrium is that the nodules formed at depths of similar to1 cm, but this interpretation is not supported by field observations. An alternative is that the soil organic matter currently in the profile was emplaced after nodule formation. Such a scenario would have to have occurred numerous times during the Late Pleistocene as the nodules grew below different soil zones through time. A third explanation is that diagenetic alteration of the carbonates in the presence of dissolved inorganic groundwater carbon has occurred. This interpretation is consistent with the widely fluctuating regional groundwater table. It is also supported by petrographic fabrics and heterogeneous cathodoluminescence patterns indicative of initial pedogenic development of the nodules and then at least one dissolution event, multiple precipitation events, prolonged nodule growth by displacive spars and microspars, cementation, and recrystallization of some micrite. The results illustrate potential problems for (1) the use of some pedogenic carbonate isotopic records as proxies for environmental change, and (2) the use of 'altered' delta(18)O values and 'unaltered' delta(13)C values as screening tools for the presence or absence of diagenesis. The results highlight the necessity of understanding regional environmental conditions and diagenetic histories prior to using pedogenic carbonates in paleoreconstructions.

AB  - Long-term changes in the carbohydrate composition of 5 different vascular plant tissues, including black mangrove leaves and wood (Avicennia germinans), cypress needles and wood (Taxodium distichum) and smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), were measured as these tissues decomposed over a 4 yr period under sub-aqueous conditions. Carbohydrate composition was measured using a molecular-level analysis for neutral sugars and a modified version of the MBTH (3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone hydrochloride) method for colorimetric determination of total carbohydrate yields. Minimal cross contamination from non-carbohydrate vascular plant constituents indicated the MBTH method was highly specific for carbohydrates. The difference between total carbohydrate yields using the MBTH method and total neutral sugar yields revealed a substantial carbohydrate fraction (7-23% of the total plant carbon) in fresh and senescent tissues that was not identified at the molecular level. The molecularly uncharacterized fraction of carbohydrates probably consisted of ketoses, uronic acids and amino sugars.
   The decomposition series demonstrated certain features about carbohydrate diagenesis not apparent from previous short-term degradation studies. During the latter phase of decomposition (2-4 yr), selective carbohydrate loss relative to bulk tissue was not evident in 2 of 3 herbaceous tissues. This indicates that carbohydrates may be of similar reactivity as bulk tissue in highly decomposed particulate organic matter. The extent and timing of all compositional changes were tissue dependent, yet certain trends emerged which were consistent with geochemical observations. In herbaceous tissues, both glucose and xylose were selectively degraded while deoxy sugars increased in relative abundance. These changes resulted in an increased abundance of initially minor neutral sugars and a general trend towards a more uniform neutral sugar composition. A clear reduction in carbohydrate yields (mg carbohydrate carbon/100 mg organic carbon) among all tissues provided the most consistent indicator of diagenetic status. Total carbohydrate yields, mole percentages of glucose and percent deoxy sugars in highly degraded herbaceous tissues were similar to those measured in particulate organic matter fractions of major world rivers, and provide diagenetic parameters which link relatively fresh plant tissues to their degraded counterparts in aquatic environments.

AB  - Stressful conditions in animal production facilities may exacerbate the fecal shedding and foodborne transmission of non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica. Dairy cows are reservoirs of this zoonotic microorganism, and its prevalence has roughly doubled in the past decade on dairy farms in United States. Dairy cows are commonly overstocked at the feed bunk, and stressors placed on the animal prior to parturition may exacerbate Salmonella shedding. However, no studies have evaluated the impact of overstocking and metabolic stress on fecal concentrations of the pathogen. Therefore, we conducted a field trial with 120 multiparous dairy cows randomized into one of four treatment groups with different stocking densities at the feed bunk during the periparturient period as follows: US, understocked from -60 to -1 DRC; OS, overstocked from -60 to -1 DRC; USOS, understocked from -60 to -26 DRC/overstocked from -25 to -1 DRC; and OSUS, overstocked from -60 to -26 DRC/ understocked from -25 to -1 DRC. Fecal and blood samples were collected at four time points relative to calving. qPCR assays were used to quantify Salmonella invA gene and total bacterial community from fecal samples, and a subset of isolates recovered from fecal bacterial culture were characterized using pulsed field gel electrophoresis and serotyping. Serum non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) were measured as a metabolic stress indicator using an immunoassay. Multivariable analyses were performed to test if changes in Salmonella concentrations were associated with stocking density, energy balance, or days relative to calving. From fecal isolates, three Salmonella serovars were identified, S. Cerro; Kentucky; Meleagridis. Concentrations of Salmonella increased as cows approached calving. Higher stocking densities at the feed bunk did not impact total bacterial community or NEFA; however, cows in the overstocked groups had higher Salmonella fecal concentrations. Further, cows with higher NEFA concentrations after calving had a higher likelihood of detection of Salmonella. Future farm interventions should aim to reduce environmental and metabolic stress during the periparturient period to decrease the dissemination of Salmonella to cattle, the environment, and humans.

AB  - In tropical environments, dairy cattle production is constrained by several factors, including climate. The seasonal loss of milk due to heat stress is a recurring challenge for many dairy producers. The objective of this study was to detect heat stress thresholds, milk yield loss and individual animal variations using random regression models for dairy cattle from test-day milk records. Data were obtained from the Kenya Livestock Breeders Organization for the years 2000-2017 and merged with weather data. The weather parameters were grid-interpolated solar and meteorological data obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Prediction Of Worldwide Energy Resources (NASA/POWER). After editing, the records comprised 49 993, 45 251 and 36 136 test-day records for first, second, and third lactations, respectively, for the four main dairy breeds: Friesian (68.0%), Ayrshire (21.1%), Jersey (7.6%) and Guernsey (3.3%). Variance components were estimated using Restricted Maximum Likelihood in ASReml software. Random regression models with third-order Legendre polynomials were fitted to the average and individual lactation curves and the reaction norms. An extended factor analytic variance structure for the random cow effects was used to estimate (co)variances between days in milk and thermal load. The daily average temperature (TA) and temperature humidity index (THI) were identified as the most suitable thermal load indicators for assessing milk yield losses. Considering a one day lag, the estimated heat stress thresholds were about 22 degrees C and 69 index units for TA and THI, respectively. Almost no differences were observed for estimated residual variances between the thermal load indicators, indicating there was no better model fit by TA or THI. The heat stress thresholds and milk loss patterns are important for management of dairy production systems in the tropics with climatic conditions similar to this study. Data recording should be improved as a tool to monitor the expected impacts of climate change and mitigation measures. (c) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Background:
   Menstruation is a natural phenomenon which is an indicator of women's health that occurs throughout the reproductive years of every female. This phenomenon is unique to the females and governed by the girl's general health condition, genetic, socioeconomic, and nutritional factors. Although it is a normal physiological process, most females experience some degree of pain and discomfort in their menstruation period. Even though there are limited studies so far reported about the issue in some other parts of the country, there is no scientific evidence in the present study area.
   Objective:
   To assess menstrual-associated discomfort and associated factors among undergraduate students in Ambo University, Central Ethiopia, 2018.
   Methods:
   Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted at Ambo University from 30 March to 30 April 2018. Stratified sampling technique was used and 748 study participants were randomly selected from faculties using a multi-stage sampling procedure. Only data from 713 study participants were entered into EpiData 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 20.0 software. Logistic regression was used to associate factors with menstrual-associated discomfort. All statistical tests were considered as significant at a p-value of < 0.05.
   Result:
   The prevalence of menstrual-associated discomfort was found to be 68.6%. The variables age (Being younger) (adjusted odds ratio = 3.9 (95% confidence interval: 1.28, 11.78)), Tigire ethnicity (adjusted odds ratio = 2.4 (95% confidence interval: 1.02, 5.75)), unmarried (adjusted odds ratio = 2.1 (95% confidence interval: 1.21, 3.76)), smokers (adjusted odds ratio = 2.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.12, 4.29)), drinking caffeine (adjusted odds ratio = 1.8 (95% confidence interval: 1.17, 2.74)), amount of flow (adjusted odds ratio = 2.4 (95% confidence interval: 1.28, 4.62)), and duration of pain (adjusted odds ratio = 4.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.93, 9.29)) were significantly associated with menstrual-associated discomfort.
   Conclusion:
   This study revealed that majority of the participants was experienced with menstrual-associated discomfort. As the tendency of smoking cigarettes, drinking caffeine, and amount of flow is increased, menstrual associated discomfort is increased. Therefore, specific plan of action and support is urgently needed in order to enlighten and treat menstrual-associated discomfort.

AB  - The management of agricultural production systems alters the properties of the soil and affects its functionality. To measure changes and their intensity, tools sensitive to the function to be measured are required. The objectives of this work were: to know the agricultural history of the area, defining classes of land according to the peasants, identifying the current production systems and their management, as the basis for selecting appropriate soil quality indicators. Soil quality indicators provide objective quantitative information on the intensity of change due to land use, and its effect on the functionality of productive systems. We propose to incorporate the empirical knowledge of producers, collected through interviews, application of surveys and direct observation. This is an intermediate approach of a qualitative nature, as complement to the traditional technical-scientific used for this purpose. The case study was carried out in four Ejidos in Tepeaca, state of Puebla, (Mexico) with the collection of historical information about the incorporation of land to cultivation and irrigation. In workshops and surveys with the ejidatarios (the Ejido peasant producers), the following quality variables were defined: types of soils, changes of use in the last half century, past and present cultivation patterns, and management of current horticultural and floricultural production systems. The soils of the area have been managed since before the colony and, in the middle of the last century, only with the cultivation of "milpa". The production of vegetables and cut flowers has been intense in the last 50 years. The cultivation history of soils in these ejidos is a unique historical record in the country, depicting the influence of anthropic activity on their characteristics. Producers identify three classes of lands: Dark, Nextlales, and Strong-sands. The most frequent land use patterns are: 1) cut flowers, 2) vegetables on continue rotation, and 3) vegetables with land rest in the dry season. The integration of the knowledge of the farmers with the technicians, allowed to obtain an expanded vision of the impact of anthropic activities in the region. Documentation of changes in production systems, and soils will serve as the basis for formulating the appropriate soil quality indicators for those conditions.

AB  - The subject of the study is the theoretical and methodological aspects of the development strategy of warehouse logistics as a component of transport and logistics systems in the focus of economic transformation. Methodology. General scientific methods used in the study, in particular: theoretical generalization; methods of positive and normative analysis, statistical analysis. The purpose of the work is to substantiate the strategy of development of warehouse logistics as a component of transport and logistics systems in the focus of economic transformation. Results. The article substantiates the development strategy of warehouse logistics as a component of transport and logistics systems in the focus of economic transformation. The main components of the development strategy of logistics management at the macro-, meso- and micro-levels are revealed. The main directions of development of transport and logistics system of Ukraine in the context of European integration. It is emphasized that the multiplier effect of investment in transport and logistics does not work by itself, but requires effective management of the regional economy, a high level of business activity in the leading sectors of the regional economy and successful spatial planning. The identified multiplier indicators and their trends in the regions show that investment in the development of transport and, in particular, infrastructure is one of the important incentives for regional economic development. At the same time, the investment acceleration indicators in the dynamics show a downward trend in all regions, which indicates the insufficient level of funding for transport and logistics support against the background of the gradual growth of the regional economy. The article substantiates a system model for assessing the level of development of the transport and logistics system in the region. The structural model of the development strategy of regional warehousing logistics has been proposed. To clarify the nature, main tasks and role in the development of transport and logistics structures in the region, a structural model of the development strategy of warehouse logistics, which systematizes: the conditions necessary to build a warehouse infrastructure and organize logistics activities in the region; identified alternatives for the necessary scale, technology placement and communications of warehouse systems, as well as the types and forms of organizational links between market participants, which are directly or indirectly related to this activity.

AB  - Coping style is defined as a set of individual physiological and behavioural characteristics that are consistent across time and context. In the zebrafish Danio rerio, as well as in many other animals, several covariations have been established among behavioural, physiological and molecular responses. Nonetheless, not many studies have addressed the consistency in behavioural responses over time starting at the larval stage. Therefore, this study aimed to improve the understanding of behavioural consistency across contexts and over time in zebrafish from the larval to juvenile stages. Two distinct experiments were conducted: a larval stage experiment (from 8 to 21 days post fertilization, dpf) and a juvenile stage experiment (from 21 to 60 dpf). On one hand, the larval experiment allows to focus on the transition between 8 and 21 dpf, marked by significant morphological changes related to the end of larval stage and initiation of metamorphosis. On the other hand, the juvenile experiment allows to properly cover the period extending from the end of larval stage to the juvenile stage (60 dpf), including metamorphosis which is itself completed around 45 dpf. Within each experiment, boldness was determined using a group risk-taking test to identify bold and shy individuals. A novel environment test was then performed at the same age to evaluate consistency across contexts. Groups of fish (either bold or shy) were bathed in an alizarin red S solution for later identification of their initially determined coping style to evaluate behavioural consistency over time. Fish were then reared under common garden conditions and challenged again with the same behavioural tests at a later age (21 and 60 dpf in the larval and juvenile experiments, respectively). Behavioural consistency was observed across contexts, with bold fish being more active and expressing higher thigmotaxis regardless of age. There was, however, little behavioural consistency over age, suggesting behavioural plasticity during development. Moreover, the use of alizarin red S to conduct this experiment provides new perspectives for the further study of the longitudinal evolution of various traits, including behaviour, over life stages in fish.

AB  - Garlic is widely cultivated around the globe. Particularly in semi-arid regions, where limited water reservoirs are getting more valuable due to climate change and increasing demand. In this context, implementation of irrigation management techniques such as the optimized regulated deficit irrigation (ORDI) are beginning to be explored. ORDI distributes the total available water, based on the needs at each growing stage (in the case of garlic: establishment = Ky(i'), crop development = Ky(i''), bulbification = Ky(ii) and ripening = Ky(iii)). To evaluate and improve deficit irrigation strategies, leaf functional traits such as stomatal conductance (g(s)); net CO2 assimilation rate (A(n)) and the ratio of A(n) and g(s), known as the intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) can be reliable indicators of the functional response of the plant and its acclimation to deficit irrigation. In this study, five irrigation treatments were analyzed during 2016 and 2017: one without water limitation (Full(IG)), and the other four with different irrigation water supplies, corresponding to 100 %, 90%, 80% and 70% of net irrigation needs of purple garlic for intermediate weather conditions of a typical meteorological year (TMY). In 2015, the same treatments except T100 were analyzed. Thus, FullIG and T100 were the same treatment up to the amount of water assigned to T100 was depleted. In the case of T90, T80 and T70, the allocation of the amount of available irrigation water was optimized by using ORDI. Garlic displayed acclimation to water deficits imposed by ORDI. ORDI allowed the recovery of optimal physiological performance of garlic after water stressed and increased irrigation supply at the most drought sensitive stages. However, other environmental factors besides water deficit, affected biomass increment and finally bulb yield throughout the studied years. Overall, this study confirmed that ORDI optimized irrigation water supply throughout the crop cycle, minimizing yield losses in the most water limited treatments and supported the use of selected functional traits as early proxies of crop yield to assist and improve irrigation management of garlic in areas with restricted water availability.

AB  - Long-term cadmium intake can be very dangerous to human health due to its toxic effects. Although people can be contaminated with this element from different sources, contaminated food is probably the most important one. Foods such as vegetables and fruits can become contaminated with cadmium existing in soils, irrigation water, or chemical fertilizers. Some plants produce an excess of cysteine-rich peptides (CRp) when affected by high concentrations of heavy metals such as cadmium, thus indicating the presence of this type of contamination. Among these plants is tamarillo (Solanum betaceum), which is locally known as tree tomato. This is a native plant widely consumed in the Ecuadorian Andes because of its abundance, low cost, and high content of vitamin C and fiber. The fact that Solanum betaceum produces CRp upon contamination with heavy metals means that this plant may be able to accumulate heavy metals. If this is the case, the plant can possibly be used as an indicator of metal pollution. The main goals of the present work were to evaluate the possibility of using Solanum betaceum as an indicator of metal contamination in plants and to examine its capability to accumulate metals. Both goals were met by determination of the amounts of CRp produced by Solanum betaceum cells cultivated in vitro in the laboratory under controlled conditions in the presence of different concentrations of cadmium. The CRp determination was carried out by means of electrogeneration of iodine in an iodide solution containing reduced glutathione as a biological thiol model. Solanum betaceum cells were grown in a Murashige and Skoog solution enriched with a 30 g L-1 sugar aqueous solution and 1 mg L-1 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. The results of these experiments confirmed the following: (1) CRp production is a function of the amount of cadmium present as a contaminant up to a limiting value after which cell apoptosis occurs; (2) Solanum betaceum accumulates cadmium; (3) the analytical method used is appropriate for CRp determination; and (4) CRp determination is a valid alternative to detect contamination by heavy metals in plants.

AB  - Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) are the most widespread commonly used broad-spectrum herbicides that contaminate soils and waters, are toxic to bacteria, plants and animals, and have been classified as 'probably carcinogenic to humans' by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 2015. Particular soil bacteria and fungi can degrade GBHs, hence, search for new GBH-degrading strains or microbial consortia, effective under specific growth conditions and local environment, seems to be a promising solution for bio-remediation of glyphosate-contaminated environment. Consequently, there is a need for rapid and informative methods to evaluate the GBH-induced changes of the metabolic pathways in cells, that may serve as indicators of GBH degrading potential.
   Three new GBH-degrading bacterial strains, Pseudomonas sp., Actinobacteria and Serratia sp. were isolated from sludge of municipal waste water treatment plant (Daugavgriva, Riga, Latvia), agricultural soil and plant tissue, respectively. This study examined the response of these isolates to elevated concentrations of glyphosate (GLP) (100 and 500 mg/L) in GBH Klinik (R) 360 SL. The GBH -induced shift of metabolic activity in cells of Pseudomonas sp. was shown by tests on EcoPlates (TM). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analyses were used to evaluate the metabolomic response of bacteria to elevated concentrations of GBH in the growth environment. The spectra of Pseudomonas sp. and Serratia sp., incubated with and without GBH, were similar, thus indicating their GBH -resistance. The absorption at 1736 cm(-1), assigned to ester carbonyl stretch vibrations, was detected in spectra of all three bacteria. The highest ester content was detected in Actinobacteria grown in medium with 1.0% molasses and 100 or 500 mg/L GLP in GBH Klinik (R). An increase of cellular amounts of esters, either those of phospholipids or poly-beta-hydroxybutyrates, indicates degradation of GLP. Therefore, monitoring the ester carbonyl stretch vibration band in FTIR spectra of bacterial biomass may speed up the search GBH degrading strains. Microbiological tests and cell metabolic response studies by FTIR spectroscopy showed that the three new isolates of Pseudomonas sp Actinobacteria and Serratia sp. were resistant to elevated concentrations of GBH Klinik (R) in growth environment and exhibited the potential for GBH degradation.

AB  - During the Early Cretaceous (Berriasian; Wealden 3-4), Northwestern Germany was covered by an east-west elongated tentatively brackish lake in which locally more than 700 m-thick black shales were deposited. While the distribution of organofacies' in the basin is relatively well documented, the paleoenvironmental conditions in the basin center (e.g., occurrence and spread of water column stratification) and the spatial record of biomarkers in Wealden 3-4 shales (and coals) are rarely known. We here present respective data from the entire basin. In large areas, total organic carbon (TOC) contents are above 5 wt% and HI values above 700 mg hydrocarbons (HC)/g TOC, supporting the high potential of shales in the central basin as petroleum source rocks. Furthermore, bulk geochemical data as well as biomarkers clearly mirror the Wealden 3-4 facies distribution with the differentiation of a predominantly terrestrial setting east of the Weser River and an aquatic and brackish lake setting in the west. Certain biomarkers such as isorenieratane, specific for green sulfur bacteria, indicate that the basin consisted of a permanently stratified water column with a brackish/marine deep water body and an oxic-anoxic transition zone in the photic zone. In the southwestern gate of the lake (including the Isterberg area) and towards the east, no water column stratification developed. Characteristic of Wealden 3-4 black shale organic matter are: high relative abundances of saturated versus aromatic hydrocarbons (most likely due to high Botryococcus algal input), highly negative delta C-13 values in the extract fractions, low isotopic "canonical variables" (sensu Sofer in AAPG Bull 68:31-49, 1984), and high gammacerane, dinosterane, and C-35-homohopane relative abundances. Interpreting those data, the different sub-facies of the environmental setting can be excellently documented. Particularly, in the western part of the basin, Wealden 3-4 shales are important petroleum source rocks. However, an overlap of biomarker signatures with those from Jurassic Posidonienschiefer Formation ("Posidonia") shales from the same area shows that oil-source rock correlations in this area remain challenging.

AB  - The breath methane concentration method uses the methane concentrations in the cow's breath during feed bin visits as a proxy for the methane production rate. The objective of this study was to assess the uncertainty of a breath methane concentration method in a feeder and its capability to measure and rank cows' methane production. A range of controlled methane fluxes from a so-called artificial reference cow were dosed in a feed bin, and its exhaled air was sampled by a tube inside the feeder and analyzed. The artificial reference cow simulates the lungs, respiratory tract, and rumen of a cow and releases a variable methane flux to generate a concentration pattern in the exhaled breath that closely resembles a real cow's pattern. The strength of the relation between the controlled methane release rates of the artificial reference cow and the measured methane concentrations was analyzed by linear regression, using the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the residual standard error as performance indicators. The effect of error sources (source-sampling distance, air turbulence, and cow's head movement) on this relation was experimentally investigated, both under laboratory and barn conditions. From the laboratory to the dairy barn at the 30-cm sampling distance, the R-2-value decreased from 0.97 to 0.37 and the residual standard error increased from 75 to 86 ppm as a result of barn air turbulence, the latter increasing to a theoretical 94 ppm if modeled variability due to cow's head movement was accounted for as well. In practice, the effect of these random errors can be compensated by sampling strategies including repeated measurements on each cow over time, thus increasing the distinctive power between cows. However, systematic errors that may disturb the relation between concentration and production rate, such as cow variation in air exhalation rate and air flow patterns around sampling locations that differ between barns, cannot be compensated by repeated measurements. As a result, the methane concentrations of breath air will vary between cows with the same methane production. We conclude that the capability of the breath concentration measurement method to adequately measure and rank methane production rates among cows is highly uncertain and requires further investigation into variation sources with a systematic nature.

AB  - HPTLC silica gel plates without and with fluorescence indicator F-254 in combination with n-hexane-ethyl acetate-formic acid (20:19:1, v/v/v) as a developing solvent were explored for the HPTLC-densitometric and HPTLC-MS/(MSn) analyses of flavonoids. Pre-development of the plates with chloroform-methanol (1:1, v/v) was needed for reliable HPTLC-densitometric analyses of flavonoid aglycones in the whole R-F range, while 2-step pre-development (1(st) methanol-formic acid (10:1, v/v), 2(nd) methanol), that decreased background signals of formic acid adducts, was required for HPTLC-MS analyses. Optimization with conditioning of the adsorbent layer with water before development and saturation of the twin trough chamber resulted in required decrease of the R-F values of studied flavonoids (flavone, apigenin, luteolin, chrysin, quercetin dihydrate, myricetin, kaempferide, kaempferol, naringenin, pinocembrin).Detection was performed based on fluorescence quenching (on the plates with F-254), natural fluorescence and after post-chromatographic derivatization with natural product reagent without or with further enhancement and stabilization of fluorescent zones with polyethylene glycol (PEG 400 or PEG 4000) or paraffin-n-hexane reagents. For all three reagents, drying temperature and time passed after drying influenced the intensity, which was increasing the first 20min, and the stability (less than 2h for PEGs and at least 24h for paraffin-n-hexane) of the standards' zones.Optimal wavelengths for densitometric evaluation were selected based on in-situ absorption spectra scanned before and after derivatization and after stabilization. The developed method was tested via analyses of propolis, roasted coffee, rose hip, hibiscus, rosemary and sage crude extracts. To further increase the reliability of the obtained densitometric results HPTLC-MS/(MSn) analyses of all crude extracts were performed. Several phenolic and non-phenolic compounds were tentatively identified.Some possible interferences with phenolic acids (chlorogenic acid, rosmarinic acid, protocatechuic acid, gallic acid, syringic acid, ellagic acid, trans-cinnamic acid, o-coumaric acid, m-coumaric acid, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, sinapic acid) that are often present in the extracts together with flavonoids were also examined.

AB  - By present, many models of bankruptcy forecasting have been developed, but this area remains a field of research activity; little is known about the practical application of existing models. In our opinion, this is because the use of existing models is limited by the conditions in which they are developed. Another question concerns the factors that can be significant for forecasting. Many authors suggest that indicators of the external environment, corporate governance as well as firm size contain important information; on the other hand, the large number of factors does not necessary increase predictive ability of a model. In this paper, we suggest the genetic algorithm based two-step classification method (TSCM) that allows both selecting the relevant factors and adapting the model itself to application. Classifiers of various models are trained at the first step and combined into the voting ensemble at the second step. The combination of random sampling and feature selection techniques were used to ensure the necessary diversity level of classifiers at the first step. The genetic algorithms are applied at the step of features selection and then at the step of weights determination in ensemble. The characteristics of the proposed method have been tested on the balanced set of data. It included 912 observations of Russian companies (456 bankrupts and 456 successful) and 55 features (financial ratios and macro/micro business environment factors). The proposed method has shown the best accuracy (0.934) value among tested models. It has also shown the most balanced precision-recall ratio. It found bankrupts (recall=0.953) and not bankrupts (precision=0.910) rather accurately than other tested models. The ability of method to select the task relevant features has been also tested. Excluding the features that are significant for less than 50% of the classifiers in the ensemble improved the all performance metrics (accuracy = 0.951, precision=0.932, recall = 0.965). So, the proposed method allows to improve the advantages and alleviate the weaknesses inherent in ordinary classifiers, enabling the business decisions support with a higher reliability.

AB  - Photovoltaic solar panels represent one of the most promising renewable energy sources, but are strong reflectors of horizontally polarized light. Polarized light pollution (PLP) associated with solar panels causes aquatic insects to prefer to oviposit on panels over natural water bodies, with potential to negatively impact their global populations as solar energy expands. We evaluate the hypothesis that anti-reflective coatings (ARCs) used to increase the energy efficiency of solar panels will reduce the amount of PLP they reflect, and their attractiveness to aquatic insects. We created artificial test surfaces that mimicked the optical properties of coated and uncoated solar panels and exposed them to wild populations of polarotactic mayflies (Ephemeroptera), horseflies (Tabanidae) and non-biting midges (Chironomidae) used as indicators of PLP. We evaluated the reflection-polarization properties of test surfaces from four different angles of view and under sunny and overcast skies in the visible and ultraviolet parts of the spectrum. Matte (i.e. ARC-coated) sunlit solar panels were strong sources of horizontally polarized light only when the sun was afront and behind, in contrast to uncoated panels which exceeded common polarization-sensitivity thresholds for aquatic insects from all four viewing directions. As predicted by these polarization patterns, horsefly numbers and water-seeking behaviors were significantly reduced by ARCs. Under overcast skies, both matte and shiny (i.e. uncoated) panels were insect-detectible sources of PLP. Matteness modestly reduced the degree of polarization of reflected light, but not sufficiently such that fewer chironomids were attracted to them. Mayflies actually preferred matte panels under overcast skies. ARCs are most likely to reduce PLP and benefit aquatic insects under sunny skies and when used in conjunction with white non-polarizing gridding, but may actually exacerbate the severity of their negative effects under overcast conditions. Consequently, even current ARC technology has a role to play in aquatic insect conservation, but strategic deployment of solar panels away from water bodies and temperate regions may trump these benefits.

AB  - The discrimination and characterization of the depositional systems registered in the formal lithostratigraphic units of our country, is practically a pending task of Mexican Geology, notwithstanding their academical and applied importance in the investigation of placer mineral deposits and of aquifers. As a contribution to fill this gap, the depositional systems of the Late Miocene San Nicolas Formation, the major sedimentary fill of the Peotillos-Tolentino Graben, are described and characterized.
   The study area lies in San Luis Potosi State, within the Sierra Madre Oriental Morphotectonic Province [SMO], between 22 degrees 11'-22 degrees 19' N Lat. and 100 degrees 30'-100 degrees 39' W Long. and an altitude of 1295 - 2025 masl. Such unit is an similar to 1100 m thick, fluvio-lacustrine, largely calcilithitic, 15 degrees-20 degrees NE dipping, peneplained sequence, unconformably overlain by a Quaternary, similar to 40 m thick, calcilithitic-volcarenitic blanket, locally covered by mafic lavic/pyroclastic rocks.
   San Nicolas Formation includes these systems: Fluvial, lacustrine, debries flow and pyroclastic [the latter two are volumetrically negligible]. The first consists of these lithofacies: (1) Gm, Gh, Gp: Channel lag deposits. (2) Gm, Gp, Sp, St: Bars of various types. (3) Sr, Sl, Fl; Floodplain deposits; it bears the Late Miocene Paso del Aguila local fauna and palynoflora, which discloses the presence of pine-oak forest with a well developed understory component, and savanna, as well as a much more humid climate regime then than that prevailing at present. (4) Gh, Sp: Thin channel conglomerates and/or sandstone deposits. (5) Sl, Fl: levee deposits. (6) Sp, Sr, F1: Crevasse splay deposits. Paleosols [associated to floodplain deposits]: Fluvisol, Calcisol, Gleysol and Luvisol. The lake system includes these lithofacies: (1) Lacustrine-carbonate, (2) -fine clastics, (3) -shore, and (4) -mud flats. The debries flow includes lithofacies Gms and Sm.
   The great thickness of this continental unit largely records the cyclic superposition of fluvial systems that took place in a basin subsiding pari passu with sedimentary accumulation, under humid to subhumid conditions interrupted by others of [? seasonal] dryness. Finally, the use of plant taxa as paleoaltitude indicators, and the discovery of pre-Pleistocene paleosols are discussed.

AB  - Wood biomass is considered a renewable raw product, but the supply chain of wood biomass involves non-renewable energy inputs, and thus possibly entailing environmental impacts. The objective of this study was to analyze different environmental impacts (GHG emissions, without biogenic CO2; primary energy consumption, non-renewable; particulate matter) caused by the provision of forest biomass for the four main tree species in Bavaria using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) techniques.
   Based on forest growth simulations, a set of realistic forest biomass supply chains for Bavarian forestry conditions were modeled for the raw wood product system from site preparation to forest road and to plant/farm gate, respectively, analyzing the four different process groups: [A1] site preparation, [A2] site tending, [A3] biomass harvesting and [T] transport of biomass to plant/farm gate.
   Total GHG emissions of about 383,000 t CO2-eq * year(-1) (18.95 kg CO2-eq * m(-3)) are estimated for the Bavarian forestry sector (from site preparation to plant/farm gate) in the reference year 2013 indicating a share of 0.41% in the total GHG emissions of Bavaria. 0.035 MJ of non-renewable energy has to be invested in order to provide 1 MJ of woody biomass to plant/farm gate (267 MJ * m(-3)). One hundred and sixty six tons of particulate matter emissions per year are calculated for the Bavarian forestry sector in 2013 (0.008 kg PM2.5-eq * m(-3)).
   Our LCA results reveal that there is no single GHG emission value for raw wood but a broad range of possible GHG emissions for the Bavarian forestry. Most decisive parameters are forest road maintenance, biomass harvesting, forwarding and biomass transport, and GHG emissions are also notably influenced by tree species, age class, wood assortment and site quality. We recommend that environmental impact calculations should be implemented, for example in wood certification procedures as they are important key indicators for sustainable forest management.

AB  - Urban tunnels located in the city center areas, can alleviate traffic pressure and provide more convenient traffic for people. Vehicles emit pollutants that are significant contributors to air pollution inside and at the outlet of tunnels. Ventilation is the most widely used method to dilute pollutants in tunnels. To calculate the design required air volume flow accurately, vehicle emissions should be exactly determined. Emission factors are important parameters to estimate vehicle emissions. To characterize carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission factors for a mixed vehicle fleet under real-world driving conditions of urban China, we measured CO and NOx concentrations in Shanghai East Yan'an Road tunnel and Changsha Yingpan Road tunnel in 2012 and 2013. In-use fleet average CO and NOx emission factors were calculated according to tunnel pollutants mass balance models.
   The results showed that the maximum CO concentration in August was 86 ppm, while in October it was 45 ppm in Shanghai East Yan'an Road tunnel. The maximum concentrations of CO and NOx were 33 ppm and 2 ppm in Changsha Yingpan Road tunnel, respectively. In-use fleet average CO emission factors of East Yan'an Road tunnel, with gradient of -3% similar to 3%, were 1.266 (+/-0.889) similar to 3.974 (+/-2.189) g km(-1) vehicle(-1). In-use fleet average CO and NOx emission factors of Yingpan Road tunnel with gradient of -6% similar to 6% amounted to 0.754 (+/-0.561) similar to 6.050 (+/-5.940) g km(-1) vehicle(-1) and 0.121 (+/-0.022) similar to 0.818 (+/-0.755) g km(-1) vehicle(-1), respectively. The dependences of CO and NOx emission on roadway gradient and vehicle speed were found. The average CO and NOx emission factors increased with the ascending of roadway gradient as well as reverse with vehicle speed. These findings provide meaningful reference for ventilation design and environmental assessment of urban tunnels, and further help provide basic data to formulate relevant standards and norms.

AB  - The influence of different coal lithotypes on grindability has been investigated using lignite from two of the most important Upper Miocene lignite basins in Serbia (Kolubara and Kostolac). Yellow xylite-rich types demonstrated the most negative impact on Hardgrove Grindability Index (HGI). All different types of xylite-rich coal, as well as total xylite-rich coal from the Kolubara basin have a negative influence on the grindability properties, while only the yellow type of xylite-rich coal from the Kostolac showed a negative impact on HGI. Matrix coal does not show a clear effect on HGI.
   A negative correlation between textinite content and HGI is observed in both basins, whereas contents of other macerals do not show influence on grindability properties.
   Content of total organic carbon demonstrated the negative impact on HGI. Correlation analysis indicates that the negative impact of the yellow type of xylite-rich coal and the sum of total xylite-rich coal on the grindability properties partly can be related to content of total organic carbon and high amount of soluble organic matter. Matrix lithotype does not show any significant correlation with bulk geochemical parameters in both basins. The peat-forming vegetation of all samples from both basins were dominated by decay-resistant gymnosperm (coniferous) plants, belonging to one or several of the families Taxodiaceae, Podocarpaceae, Cupressaceae, Araucariaceae, Phyllocladaceae and Pinaceae. Lignite from the Kolubara basin is characterized by a higher contribution of angiosperm vegetation than coal from the Kostolac basin. Peatification of the Kolubara coal occurred under more oxic conditions than the Kostolac one.
   Analysis of biomarkers indicated that the negative impact of all types of xylite-rich coal from the Kolubara on HGI can be related to the higher proportion of angiosperms, abundance of mid-chain n-alkanes and sesquiterpenoids, aromatization of non-hopanoid triterpenoids and hopanoids, and intense degradation of wood tissues in a more oxic environment. The positive impact of matrix coal on HGI in the Kolubara samples can be attributed to elevated content of non-aromatic hopanoids and low amounts of aromatic non-hopanoid triterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids, which seems to hinder the grindability properties.

AB  - Ca-45, Sm-151 and Pd-107 are three radionuclides present in low to intermediate in activity radioactive wastes for which no soil-to-plant Transfer Factors (TF) values are available to be used in biosphere models for Ecological Risk Assessment. In the absence of specific radioecological studies, this work reviews and analyzes the existing literature for stable isotopes of Pd, Sm and Ca in order to derive best estimates for TF values that could be used as Transfer Factors. Alternative methods of extrapolation are also critically assessed. The values have been classified according to climatic zone, plant class and soil type for each element. The overall geometric mean TF values (for all plants and conditions) was calculated as 8.4E-02 for Pd, for which the value of radioRu in TRS-472 is also available. The mean TF for Sm was 4.2E-04. This value was lower than the IF values for radioactive Ce that are proposed as alternative values for Sm in TRS-472. The former may be relevant for long term assessments and the latter could possibly used to describe the short term Sm-151 post-release behaviour. The mean value for Ca is 2.3E-01 but varies considerably among plants of a given class due to the variety of plant Ca uptake behaviors. Alternatively, to limit this variability, Ca data content for dry plant matter, as analyzed using the phylogenetic method, could be used to derive TF values if the conservation of isotopic ratio of Ca-45 to stable Ca in soils and in plants hypothesis is taken into account. The TF for Ca in sub-tropical zones is 10-fold lower than in temperate zones. There is a lot of data available about exchangeable Ca in soil, which mean that we could calculate an available TF. The analysis shows that Ca bioavailability is also a key factor within transfer. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Strontium (Sr) concentrations and isotopic ratios have been measured in a series of water and rock samples from most of the major tributaries of the Lake Qinghai basin on the north-eastern Tibetan Plateau. Dissolved Sr and (87)Sr/(86)Sr show ranges of 488-12240 nmol/l and 0.710497-0.716977, respectively. These data, together with measurements of major cations and anions in rivers and their tributaries and various lithologies of the catchment, were used to determine the contributions of Sr and its isotopic expense to rivers and lakes. Our results demonstrate that the chemical components and (87)Sr/(86)Sr ratios of the alkaline waters are derived from mixing of carbonate and silicate sources, with the former contributing 72 +/- 18% dissolved Sr to rivers. The difference in tributary compositions stems from the lithology of different river systems and low weathering intensity under a semi-arid condition. Variation in (87)Sr/(86)Sr ratios places constraint on the Sr-isotopic compositions of the main tributaries surrounding Lake Qinghai. The water chemistry of the Buha River, the largest river within the catchment underlain by the late Paleozoic marine limestone and sandstones, dominates Sr isotopic composition of the lake water, being buffered by the waters from the other rivers and probably by groundwater. However, the characteristic chemical composition of the lake itself differs remarkably from the rivers, which can be attributed to precipitation of authigenic carbonates (low-magnesium calcite, aragonite, and dolomite), though this does not impact the Sr isotope signature, which may remain a faithful indicator in paleo-records. Regarding the potential role of groundwater input within the Lake Qinghai systems in the water budget and water chemistry, we have also determined the Sr concentration and (87)Sr/(86)Sr ratio of groundwater from diverse environments. This has allowed us to further constrain the Sr isotope systematic of this source. A steady-state calculation gives an estimate for the groundwater flux of 0.19 +/- 0.03 x 10(8) m(3)/yr, accounting for about 8% of contemporary lake Sr budget.

AB  - Background: Exposure to energy restriction during childhood and adolescence is associated with a lower risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Epigenetic dysregulation during this critical period of growth and development may be a mechanism to explain such observations. Within the Netherlands Cohort Study on diet and cancer, we investigated the association between early life energy restriction and risk of subsequent CRC characterized by the (promoter) CpG island methylation phenotype (CIMP).
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Information on diet and risk factors was collected by baseline questionnaire (n = 120,856). Three indicators of exposure were assessed: place of residence during the Hunger Winter (1944-45) and World War II years (1940-44), and father's employment status during the Economic Depression (1932-40). Methylation specific PCR (MSP) on DNA from paraffin embedded tumor tissue was performed to determine CIMP status according to the Weisenberger markers. After 7.3 years of follow-up, 603 cases and 4631 sub-cohort members were available for analysis. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals for CIMP+ (27.7%) and CIMP- (72.3%) tumors according to the three time periods of energy restriction, adjusted for age and gender. Individuals exposed to severe famine during the Hunger Winter had a decreased risk of developing a tumor characterized by CIMP compared to those not exposed (HR 0.65, 95%CI: 0.45-0.92). Further categorizing individuals by an index of '0-1' '2-3' or '4-7' genes methylated in the promoter region suggested that exposure to the Hunger Winter was associated with the degree of promoter hypermethylation ('0-1 genes methylated' HR = 1.01, 95%CI:0.74-1.37; '2-3 genes methylated' HR = 0.83, 95% CI:0.61-1.15; '4-7 genes methylated' HR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.49-1.04). No associations were observed with respect to the Economic Depression and WWII years.
   Conclusions: This is the first study indicating that exposure to a severe, transient environmental condition during adolescence and young adulthood may result in persistent epigenetic changes that later influence CRC development.

AB  - Four sets of C and N stable isotope analyses carried out on mammoth hairs of different radiocarbon age from four different sites in northern Siberia are reported here. Another set of analyses from the same region, published elsewhere, is reported for comparison. The analyses were performed on small increments along the length of the hairs providing information about short(seasonal) and long-term (before and after the Last Glacial maximum) diet variation and, hence, about the environment in which the mammoths lived. The mean 613 C and 615 N values for the four sites range between -24.1 parts per thousand and -20.9 parts per thousand and between 5.8 parts per thousand and 9.6 parts per thousand, respectively. Both the delta C-13 and 615 N signals increment towards east when samples from the same age are considered. Hair delta N-15 correlates well with the current amount of precipitation independently of the radiocarbon age of the sample. This could mean that during the periods considered this environmental parameter did not change significantly in the studied sites. Hair delta C-13 appears to be affected by a different environmental factor that, in this case, varies in function of the radiocarbon age of the samples. This factor could be the CO2 atmospheric content that, as is well know, varies across a glacial cycle depending on temperature. The isotope patterns obtained from each set of samples exhibit roughly sinusoidal oscillations of the delta C-13 and delta N-15 values. These oscillations have been attributed to seasonal changes in the isotope values of the mammoth's diet due to plant adaptation to the different seasonal environmental conditions or to the different seasonal plant type availability. A direct physiological effect on the hair delta N-15 values can also be considered. This study strongly supports the possibility of using hair delta C-13 and delta N-15 signals as indicators of geographical and temporal variation in plant isotope composition and, ultimately, as indicators of palacoclimate changes.

AB  - A coupled column liquid chromatographic (LC-LC) method for the direct analysis in human urine of the ring opened benzene metabolite, trans.trans-muconic acid (t,t-MA) is described. The method was tested using urine samples collected from five refinery workers exposed to low concentrations of airborne benzene (0.2-0.5 ppm), and from non-exposed volunteers. The analytical columns used were of 50X4.6 mm I.D. packed with 3 mum p.s. Microspher C-18 material as the first column (C-1), and a 100X4.6 mm I.D. column packed with 3 mum p.s. Hypersil ODS material as the second one (C-2). The mobile phases applied consisted, respectively, of methanol-0.074% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water (4:96, v/v) on C-1, and of methanol-0.074% TFA in water (10:90, v/v) on C-2. Under these conditions t.t-MA eluted 15 min after injection. The present method, coupling the LC-LC technique with UV detection at 264 nm, permits the quantitation of t,t-MA directly in urine at levels as low as 0.05 mg/l. The determination is performed with a sample throughput of 2 h(-1) requiring only pH adjustment and centrifugation of the sample. Calibration plots of standard additions of t,t-MA to pooled urine taken from five non-exposed subjects were linear (r >0.9991 over a wide concentration range (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 mg/l). The precision of the method (RSD) was in the range of 0.5 to 3.8%, and the within-session repeatability on workers urine samples (levels 0.06, 0.1, 0.2. 1.0 mg/l) was in the range of 3 to 8%. The present method improves the applicability of routine t,t-MA analysis, where it is most desirable that a large number of biological samples can be processed automatically or with minimal human labour, at low cost, and with a convenient turn-around time.

AB  - The kinetics of L-intermediate decay and M-intermediate formation in the wild-type bacteriorhodopsin photocycle (pH 7.0, 20 degrees C) are well fitted by a sum of two components with tau(1) = 60 mu sec and tau(2) = 250 mu sec. The fast M formation is associated with L-decay having a difference maximum at 550 nm, while the slow formation is associated with L-decay having a difference maximum at 530 nm, which points to the existence of two parallel pathways in M-intermediate formation. An additional component (tau(3) = 1 msec; cf. 2.5 msec in glycerol) evolves during M-formation in the presence of Lu3(+) or in 80% glycerol. The K-intermediate decay is significantly retarded in this case, while M-formation is accelerated in glycerol (the time constants are 7 and 65 mu sec, respectively). The L-intermediate is hardly detectable under these conditions. The 1 msec component is present in the photocycle as a lag phase in the relaxation of the photoresponse at 400 and 520 nm and as an additional component in the optical density increase at 335 nm in the presence 100 mM NaCl (pH 7.0). A model of M-formation for 3(+) or in 80% glycerol (2) is proposed:
   [GRAPHICS]
   The appearance of the 1 msec component in the M-formation is well explained by the quasi-stationary equilibrium L reversible arrow M in the presence of Lu3+ or in glycerol. The appearance of the proton in the bulk water solution measured with the pH indicator pyranine in the absence of buffers matches the third phase of M-formation. In the presence of the buffer the rate of pyranine protonation coincides with the rate of M-formation. This suggests that the proton release from the protein into the membrane-water interface is associated with the L --> M transition, while that proton transfer into the bulk solution os associated with the M --> M step in the absence of buffers. The M --> M step is suggested to reflect a conformational rearrangement of the protein.

AB  - Among the innovative technologies utilized for the treatment of contaminated soils, the use of green surfactants appears to be a biocompatible, efficient, and attractive alternative, since the cleaning processes that normally use synthetic surfactants as additives cause other problems due to toxicity and the accumulation of by-products. Three green surfactants, i.e., two biobased (biobased 1 and biobased 2) surfactants produced by chemical synthesis and a microbial surfactant produced from the yeast Starmerella bombicola ATCC 22214, were used as soil remediation agents and compared to a synthetic surfactant (Tween 80). The three surfactants were tested for their ability to emulsify, disperse, and remove different hydrophobic contaminants. The biosurfactant, which was able to reduce the water surface tension to 32.30 mN/m at a critical micelle concentration of 0.65 g/L, was then used to prepare a commercial formulation that showed lower toxicity to the tested environmental bioindicators and lower dispersion capacity than the biobased surfactants. All the green surfactants showed great emulsification capacity, especially against motor oil and petroleum. Therefore, their potential to remove motor oil adsorbed on different types of soils (sandy, silty, and clay soil and beach sand) was investigated either in kinetic (flasks) or static (packed columns) experiments. The commercial biosurfactant formulation showed excellent effectiveness in removing motor oil, especially from contaminated sandy soil (80.0 +/- 0.46%) and beach sand (65.0 +/- 0.14%) under static conditions, while, in the kinetic experiments, the commercial biosurfactant and the biobased 2 surfactant were able to remove motor oil from all the contaminated soils tested more effectively than the biobased 1 surfactant. Finally, the S. bombicola commercial biosurfactant was evaluated as a soil bioremediation agent. In degradation experiments carried out on motor oil-contaminated soils enriched with sugarcane molasses, oil degradation yield in the sandy soil reached almost 90% after 60 days in the presence of the commercial biosurfactant, while it did not exceed 20% in the presence of only S. bombicola cells. These results promise to contribute to the development of green technologies for the treatment of hydrophobic pollutants with economic gains for the oil industries.

AB  - Fasciola hepatica is the causative agent of fasciolosis, a parasitic zoonosis of global distribution causing significant economic losses in animal production and a human public health problem in low-income countries. Hosts are infected by ingestion of aquatic plants carrying metacercariae. Once ingested, the juvenile parasites excyst in the small intestine and, after crossing it, they follow a complex migratory route that lead the parasites to their definitive location in the bile ducts. Despite being a critical event in the progression of the infection, the available data on the cross-talk relationships between the parasite and the host at an early stage of the infection are scarce. The objective of the present work is to characterize the proteomic changes occurring in both the parasite and the host, through the development of a novel in vitro model, to shed light on the molecular pathways of communication between the newly excysted juveniles (NEJ) from F. hepatica and the host's intestinal epithelium. For this, in vitro excystation of F. hepatica metacercariae was carried out and NEJ were obtained. Additionally, optimal conditions of growth and expansion of mouse primary small intestinal epithelial cells (MPSIEC) in culture were fine-tuned. Tegumentary and somatic parasite antigens (NEJ-Teg and NEJ-Som), as well as host cell protein lysate (MPSIEC-Lys) were obtained before and after 24 h co-culture of NEJ with MPSIEC. We used an isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based strategy to detect 191 and 62 up-regulated, and 112 and 57 down-regulated proteins in the NEJ-Teg and NEJ-Som extracts, respectively. Similarly, 87 up-regulated and 73 down-regulated proteins in the MPSIEC-Lys extract were identified. Taking into account the biological processes in which these proteins were involved, interesting mechanisms related to parasite development, invasion and evasion, as well as manipulation of the host intestinal epithelial cell adhesion, immunity and apoptosis pathways, among others, could be inferred, taking place at the host-parasite interface. The further understanding of these processes could constitute promising therapeutic targets in the future against fasciolosis.

AB  - Oil-oil and oil-source rock correlations for nineteen crude oils and eight mudstone extracts from four sub-basins in the Muglad Basin were achieved by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Based on the characteristics of biomarker compositions and hierarchical cluster analysis, an outlier crude oil has been discovered in the Muglad Basin. The majority of discovered oils have similar geochemical characteristics and belong to an established oil family. This oil family has relatively higher (C-19+ C-20)/C23TT and C24TeT/C26TT ratios, small amounts of long-chain tricyclic terpanes with a dominance of C2ITT among C-29-C23TT homologues, a lower abundance of C-28 regular steranes with abundant C-30 4 alpha-methylsteranes, an unusually higher content of diasteranes and diahopanes. These biomarker ratios indicate the mixed inputs of aquatic plankton and terrigenous organic matter deposited under oxic to sub-oxic, and fresh to brackish water sedimentary environments. This oil family belongs to source rocks of the Abu Gabra Formation as proven by oil source rock correlation. In contrast, the distribution characteristics of tricyclic and tetracyclic terpanes, C-28 regular steranes, C-30 4 alpha-methylsteranes, diasteranes and diahopanes are all significantly different than those of the established oil family in the well Kela-1 oil (2563 m) within the Darfur Group reservoir. The geochemical signatures indicate that their related source rock is an algal dominated organic matter input, deposited in suboxic condition, and brackish to saline sedimentary environment. Moreover, the composition and characteristics of molecular markers of the well Kela-1 oil are highly consistent with those of the two mudstone samples from the Darfur Group. This clearly demonstrates that the Darfur Group mudstones are the potential source rocks for the outlier crude oil. Identification of the outlier crude oil shows that the Darfur Group mudstones have a certain potential regarding hydrocarbons resources that could provide petroleum companies an impetus to enhance their exploration efforts.

AB  - Sediment runoff from dense highland field areas greatly affects the quality of downstream lakes and drinking water sources. In this study, multiple linear regression (MLR) models were built to predict diffuse pollutant discharge using the environmental parameters of a basin. Explanatory variables that influence the sediment and pollutant discharge can be identified with the model, and such research could play an important role in limiting sediment erosion in the dense highland field area. Pollutant load per event, event mean concentration (EMC), and pollutant load per area were estimated from stormwater survey data from the Lake Soyang basin. During the wet season, heavy rains cause large amounts of suspended sediment and the occurrence of such rains is increasing due to climate change. The explanatory variables used in the MLR models are the percentage of fields, subbasin area, and mean slope of subbasin as topographic parameters, and the number of preceding dry days, rainfall intensity, rainfall depth, and rainfall duration as rainfall parameters. In the MLR modeling process, four types of regression equations with and without log transformation of the explanatory and response variables were examined to identify the best performing regression model. The performance of the MLR models was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of variation of the root mean square error (CV(RMSE)), the ratio of the RMSE to the standard deviation of the observed data (RSR) and the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE). The performance of the MLR models of pollutant load except total nitrogen (TN) was good under the condition of RSR, and satisfactory for the NSE and R-2. In the EMC and load/area models, the performance for suspended solids (SS) and total phosphorus (TP) was good for the RSR, and satisfactory for the NSE and R-2. The standardized coefficients for the models were analyzed to identify the influential explanatory variables in the models. In the final performance evaluation, the results of jackknife validation indicate that the MLR models are robust.

AB  - Antarctica, with its almost pristine conditions and relatively simple vegetation, offers excellent opportunities to investigate the influence of environmental factors on species performance, such information being crucial if the effects of possible climate change are to be understood. Antarctic vegetation is mainly cryptogamic. Cryptogams are poikilohydric and are only metabolically and photosynthetically active when hydrated. Activity patterns of the main life forms present, bryophytes (10 species, ecto- and endohydric), lichens (5 species) and phanerogams (2 species), were monitored for 21 days using chlorophyll a fluorescence as an indicator of metabolic activity and, therefore, of water regime at a mesic (hydration by meltwater) and a xeric (hydration by precipitation) site on L,onie Island/West Antarctic Peninsula (67A degrees 36'S). Length of activity depended mainly on site and form of hydration. Plants at the mesic site that were hydrated by meltwater were active for long periods, up to 100 % of the measurement period, whilst activity was much shorter at the xeric site where hydration was entirely by precipitation. There were also differences due to life form, with phanerogams and mesic bryophytes being most active and lichens generally much less so. The length of the active period for lichens was longer than in continental Antarctica but shorter than in the more northern Antarctic Peninsula. Light intensity when hydrated was positively related to the length of the active period. High activity species were strongly coupled to the incident light whilst low activity species were active under lower light levels and essentially uncoupled from incident light. Temperatures were little different between sites and also almost identical to temperatures, when active, for lichens in continental and peninsular Antarctica. Gradients in vegetation cover and growth rates across Antarctica are, therefore, not likely to be due to differences in temperature but more likely to the length of the hydrated (active) period. The strong effect on activity of the mode of hydration and the life form, plus the uncoupling from incident light for less active species, all make modelling of vegetation change with climate a more difficult exercise.

AB  - In the previously performed field study from 2007 to 2009, it became evident that foot pad alterations were already commonly found in turkeys at the age of 6 wk. At this early age, 45% of the clinically examined birds were diagnosed with epithelial necrosis. Therefore, it became important to specifically analyze the situation during the early rearing phase. The present study reflects the prevalence and severity of foot pad alterations of turkey poults up to the age of 35 d (5 wk), starting as early as the age of 3 d. From 24 turkey farms throughout Germany, in general 5,531 turkeys [ 3,131 male and 2,400 female] of the British United Turkeys 6 strain from 46 flocks, were examined to that effect. Prevalence and severity increased within the duration of stay in the stable, and the prevalence was higher (P < 0.001) during the second visit between d 22 to 35 (factor: 0.94). Therefore, 27.3% (d 3 to 5; male/female: 39.1/25.0%) and 63.3% (d 22 to 35: 61.3/65.7%) of the examined poults had alterations of the foot pads, such as hyperkeratosis (d 3 to 5: 20.4/14.2%; d 22 to 35: 17.6/17.1%), high-grade hyperkeratosis with adhesive dirt (d 3 to 5: 8.7/10.7%; d 22 to 35: 29.2/39.3%), and epithelial necrosis (d 3 to 5: 0.1/0.1%; d 22 to 35: 14.6/9.3%). Female poults showed a higher risk (P < 0.001) of developing food pad alterations (factor: 0.76) than male poults. Male poults developed a higher percentage of epithelial necrosis than hens shortly before relocation. A higher stocking density during the very early rearing phase (d 3 to 5) led to a worse foot pad health status (P < 0.001). Because even mild alterations in the foot pad condition can be indicators for suboptimal design of the rearing environment and are to be seen as a pre-state for severe cases of foot pad dermatitis, it is important to set the main focus on the early rearing phase.

AB  - A novel approach of studying dust, black crust and host limestones by using various techniques is presented in this paper. Samples were collected from limestone monuments located in rural, urban and industrial areas in Germany and Hungary. The paper focuses on differences in the mineralogical composition, major and trace element distribution of materials and their total polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) concentration having different exposure to air pollutants. High concentration of gypsum was found in laminar and dendritic black crusts and even in the dust of both urban and rural areas, despite the low concentration of SO2 in rural atmospheric environments. The black crusts show a typical microfabric with distinct layers of various gypsum-calcite mineral associations, silt-sized mineral fragments and black particle content. In dust, newly formed gypsum crystals were found along with mineral fragments, and siliceous and, less frequently, carbonaceous fly ash particles. High concentration of lead was found both in the samples of urban and rural areas of Germany and Hungary. Lead mostly accumulates in dust and also in the black crust. Highest lead concentrations were found not on the surface of the black crust, but close to the crust/limestone boundary according to LA-ICPMS analyses. It indicates that despite the ban of leaded petrol, lead is still present in the dust and the in the soiled zones of the built environment. Similarly to lead, no significant difference in the total PAH content of dust and crust samples were found in the two countries. Dusts are equally enriched in PAH in both countries, whereas black crusts contain fewer amounts. Most of the aqueous extracts of the samples were saturated with respect to sulphate, which also indicate the presence of gypsum, whilst in some German samples unsaturated conditions were detected. In summary, by using a combination of these analytical techniques, it was possible to distinguish rural and urban samples and to outline the role of dust in bringing pollutants to the stone surface. It is suggested that the analysed dust and stone samples indicate not only present, but also the past, pollution fluxes and as a consequence stones similar to sediments or surface waters can be used as environment indicators.

AB  - The use of enterococci as the primary fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) for the determination of recreational water safety has been questioned, particularly in sub/tropical marine waters without known point sources of sewage. Alternative FIB (such as the Bacteroidales group) and alternative measurement methods (such as rapid molecular testing) have been proposed to supplement or replace current marine water quality testing methods which require culturing enterococci. Moreover, environmental parameters have also been proposed to supplement current monitoring programs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the health risks to humans from exposure to subtropical recreational marine waters with no known point source. The study reported symptoms between one set of human subjects randomly assigned to marine water exposure with intensive environmental monitoring compared with other subjects who did not have exposure. In addition, illness outcomes among the exposed bathers were compared to levels of traditional and alternative FIB (as measured by culture-based and molecular-based methods), and compared to easily measured environmental parameters. Results demonstrated an increase in self-reported gastrointestinal, respiratory and skin illnesses among bathers vs. non-bathers. Among the bathers, a dose response relationship by logistic regression modeling was observed for skin illness, where illness was positively related to enterococci enumeration by membrane filtration (odds ratio = 1.46 [95% confidence interval = 0.97-2.21] per increasing log10 unit of enterococci exposure) and positively related to 24 h antecedent rain fall (1.04 [1.01-1.07] per increasing millimeters of rain). Acute febrile respiratory illness was inversely related to water temperature (0.74 [0.56-0.98] per increasing degree of water temperature). There were no significant dose response relationships between report of human illness and any of the other FIB or environmental measures. Therefore, for non-point source subtropical recreational marine waters, this study suggests that humans may be at increased risk of reported illness, and that the currently recommended and investigational FIB may not track gastrointestinal illness under these conditions; the relationship between other human illness and environmental measures is less clear.

AB  - Background and aims Forest edges created by fragmentation strongly affect the abiotic and biotic environment. A rarely studied consequence is the resulting impact on non-vascular plants such as poikilohydric lichens, known to be highly sensitive to changes in the microenvironment. We evaluated the impact of forest edge and forest interior on the distribution of two groups of crustose lichens characterized by the presence or absence of a cortex and sought explanations of the outcome in terms of photosynthetic response and water relations.
   Methodology Microclimate, distribution patterns and physiology of cortical and non-cortical lichens were compared at the edge and in the interior of an Atlantic rainforest fragment in Alagoas, Brazil. Ecophysiological aspects of photosynthesis and water relations were studied using chlorophyll a fluorescence analysis, and hydration and rehydration characteristics.
   Principal results Cortical and non-cortical functional groups showed a clear preference for interior and edge habitats, respectively. The cortical lichens retained liquid water more efficiently and tolerated low light. This explains their predominance in the forest interior, where total area cover on host tree trunks reached ca. 40 % (versus ca. 5 % for non-cortical lichens). Although non-cortical lichens exchanged water vapour efficiently, they required high light intensities. Consequently, they were able to exploit well-lit edge conditions where they achieved an area cover of ca. 19 % (versus ca. 7 % for cortical lichens). We provide some of the first data for lichens giving the relative quantity of incident light absorbed by the photosystem (absorptivity). The cortical group achieved higher absorptivity and quantum efficiencies, but at the expense of physiological plasticity; non-cortical lichens showed much decreased values of F-v/F-m and electron transport rates in the forest interior.
   Conclusions Morphological and physiological features largely determine the ecophysiological interaction of lichen functional groups with their abiotic environment and, as a consequence, determine their habitat preference across forest habitats. In view of the distinctiveness of their distribution patterns and ecophysiological strategies, the occurrence of cortical versus non-cortical lichens can be a useful indicator of undisturbed forest interiors in tropical forest fragments.

AB  - The assessment of gas origin in mud volcanoes and related petroleum systems must consider post-genetic processes which may alter the original molecular and isotopic composition of reservoir gas. Beyond eventual molecular and isotopic fractionation due to gas migration and microbial oxidation, investigated in previous studies, we now demonstrate that mud volcanoes can show signals of anaerobic biodegradation of natural gas and oil in the subsurface. A large set of gas geochemical data from more than 150 terrestrial mud volcanoes worldwide has been examined. Due to the very low amount of C2+ in mud volcanoes, isotopic ratios of ethane, propane and butane (generally the best tracers of anaerobic biodegradation) are only available in a few cases. However, it is observed that C-13-enriched propane is always associated with positive delta C-13(CO2) values, which are known indicators of secondary methanogenesis following anaerobic biodegradation of petroleum. Data from carbon isotopic ratio Of CO2 are available for 134 onshore mud volcanoes from 9 countries (Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ukraine, Russia, Turkmenistan, Trinidad, Italy, Japan and Taiwan). Exactly 50% of mud volcanoes, all releasing thermogenic or mixed methane, show at least one sample with delta C-13(CO2) > +5 parts per thousand (PDB). Thermogenic CH4 associated with positive carbon isotopic ratio Of CO2 generally maintains its delta C-13-enriched signature, which is therefore not perturbed by the lighter secondary microbial gas. There is, however, high variability in the delta C-13(CO2) values within the same mud volcanoes, so that positive delta C-13(CO2) values can be found in some vents and not in others, or not continuously in the same vent. This can be due to high sensitivity of delta C-13(CO2) to gas-water-rock interactions or to the presence of differently biodegraded seepage systems in the same mud volcano. However, finding a positive delta C-13(CO2) value should be considered highly indicative of anaerobic biodegradation and further analyses should be made, especially if mud volcanoes are to be used as pathfinders of the conditions indicative of subsurface hydrocarbon accumulations in unexplored areas.

AB  - 1. Previous studies on the combined effects of light and nutrient supply on the growth rates of plants have involved adding nutrients to soils to levels rarely (or never) met by the plants in nature. As a better test of the likely response of plants to root competition for nutrients. we grew for 1 year seedlings of six species of Australian rainforest tree on forest topsoil undiluted and on soil diluted 50/50, 25/75 and 5/95 with coarse sand. Seedlings were grown in tall tubes in 6 and 9% daylight, equivalent to gap-edge and gap-centre conditions.
   2. The six species varied in their light requirements for establishment and onward growth.
   3. One species grew significantly and markedly more quickly on soil diluted 50/50 with sand (Elaeocarpus grandis). Improved aeration is the most likely explanation.
   4. The extent of inhibition by soil dilution correlated positively with the absolute amount of new dry mass accreted in one year, whether the larger accretion resulted from a combination of high relative growth rate (RGR) and small embryo size, or moderate RGR and larger embryo size.
   5. Soil dilution generally reduced leaf mass fraction and leaf area ratio, but had no significant effect on specific leaf area.
   6. In all species the overall concentration of nitrogen in the whole plant declined with soil dilution, in the four species tested, N concentration in leaves declined, and it is likely that the reduction in growth arose partly from a reduced unit leaf rate. Most species showed increases in the concentrations of P, K, Ca and Mg with soil dilution, or no change, but in Diploglottis bracteata the concentrations of Ca and Mg, especially in the older leaves, declined markedly with soil dilution, and one of these cations could have been limiting growth.
   7. Extrapolation of the results to the field suggests that in single-treefall gaps the fastest growing species will the most inhibited by root competition.
   8. The soil-dilution technique is likely to be more appropriate than nutrient addition as an indicator of sensitivity to root competition on a given soil.

AB  - Japanese Blacks (a beef breed) develop frequent tongue-playing under intensive husbandry systems. The following were investigated in 16 artificially reared calves kept in two different farms: (1) the development of tongue-playing behaviour with age; (2) whether or not a dummy-teat could stimulate sucking and suppress behavioural and physiological stress and tongue-playing; (3) whether or not feeding of short cut hay could promote behavioural and physiological stress and tongue-playing; and (4) whether or not individual-housing could promote behavioural and physiological stress and tongue-playing than group-housing. Grooming as common displacement behaviour (indicator of behavioural stress) and physiological stress indicators such as plasma ACTH and cortisol concentration were measured to evaluate stressfulness of these treatments. The correlation between these indicators and tongue-playing was investigated, Four blocks (two individuals per block) were established on each of the two farms, resulting in an experimental design with a three-way classification (dummy-teat: offered or not; hay: short cut or long cut; and housing: individual or group-housed after weaning). Short cut hay was approximately 5 cm in length, whereas long hay was approximately 50 cm in length. Each of eight calves under 2 months old was provided with a dry rubber teat fitted to the wall. Tongue-playing was performed after forced weaning at 42 days of age. A little sucking was directed towards the dummy tear, Offering a dummy-tear neither influenced the stress state of the calves nor suppressed inclusive tongue-playing (consisting of tongue-playing and para-tongue-playing). Feeding of short cut hay elevated the plasma level of ACTH and cortisol at 150 days of age in calves. However, feeding of short cut hay did not lead to inclusive tongue-playing. inclusive tongue-playing appeared more in individual-housed than group-housed calc es. Calves spent less time suckling, feeding, exploring and moving in individual-housing than group-housing in this study condition. Calves could perform inclusive tongue-playing under long-term frustration by suppressed suckling, feeding and boring environment. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

KW  - nutrient cycling
KW  - PERSPECTIVES
AB  - Forest health is a central issue across North America. Most definitions imply that forest health is a condition of the forest ecosystem which sustains complexity or diversity while still providing for human needs. Imbedded in this definition is the need to maintain the productive capacity of managed sites. Although site productivity is largely a function of climate, soil properties, and the biotic potential of the vegetation occupying the site, forest management can also play an influential role in altering site productivity.
   In terms of site productivity, different concerns exist when managing different ecosites. Based on a recently-conducted expert opinion survey, the major concerns when harvesting black spruce from shallow-soil, upland sites were: 1) harvest-related nutrient removals, and 2) loss of organic matter. In contrast to these ecosites, the major concerns for organic sites (including wet, mineral soils) were: I)altered hydrology, and 2) rutting. The water table on these sites is typically near the surface for a significant portion of the frost-free season, minimizing organic matter decomposition and associated nutrient release. Any forest management practice which exacerbates this situation would have a negative impact on site productivity. Tree nutrient cycling studies conducted on shallow-soil sites in northwestern Ontario were presented to show that calculated nutrient replacement times, with the exception of K, did not exceed current rotation periods. However, the forest floor nutrient pool represented a major component of the soil reserves. Based on the importance of this nutrient pool, best practices designed to protect and allow for the rebuilding of this active soil pool are essential if long-term site productivity is to be maintained.
   This paper outlines a series of steps to evaluate and correct management-induced changes in long-term site productivity. These steps included: I) the development of "best practice" guidelines, 2) the development of a set of "criteria and indicators", and 3) the establishment of long-term experimental field trials. The results of this third step should, in turn, be used to refine the "best practice" guidelines and suggest alternative "criteria and indicators" that should be incorporated into a monitoring program of forest sustainability.

AB  - An important ecological issue is developing an understanding of how patterns and processes vary with scale. We designed a field experiment to test how differences in the aerial extent of disturbance affected macrofaunal recolonization on a sandflat. Three different plot sizes (0.203 m(2), 0.81 m(2), and 3.24 m(2)) were defaunated, and samples were collected to assess recovery over a 9-mo period. As the sandflat used for the experiment was prone to disturbance by wind-driven waves, we also measured changes in sediment bed height (an indicator of sediment stability) over the course of the experiment. Most common species revealed significant relationships between density and disturbance plot size. Scale-dependent recovery was also demonstrated by differences in species assemblage structure over the course of the experiment. Relative rates of colonization varied by approximate to 50% between large and small experimental plots. However, these differences were not related to specific species, particular functional groups, or potential modes or colonization. The results revealed an unusually slow rate of faunal recovery following defaunation. Both increasing numbers of colonists and density changes in ambient sediments made an important contribution to recovery. The relationship found between changes in sediment bed height and wind velocity indicated that wind-driven wave disturbance was an important factor influencing sediment instability. Sediment instability was higher in all experimental plots than in the ambient sediments, due to the initial removal of a dense spionid polychaete tube mat characteristically found at the study site. Sediment instability also increased with increasing plot size. Thus in this dynamic sandflat habitat, faunal emigration from recovering disturbed patches of sediment may significantly slow rates of recolonization. These results demonstrate that incorporating patch size, emigration, recovery time, and interactions between hydrodynamic conditions and habitat ability (particularly where colonists influence sediment stability) are crucial to generating a general understanding of recovery processes in soft-sediment habitats. While our results demonstrate the need for caution in scaling-up from small-scale studies, they do indicate that larger scale disturbances that destroy organisms with a role in maintaining habitat stability are likely to result in very slow recovery dynamics, particularly in wave-disturbed sofi-sediment habitats.

AB  - In order to be able to forecast the weather and estimate future climate changes in the ocean, it is crucial to understand the past and the mechanisms responsible for the ocean variability. This is particularly true in a complex area such as the Mediterranean Sea with diverse dynamics like deep convection and overturning circulation. To this end, effective tools are ocean reanalyses or reconstructions of the past ocean state. Here we present a new physical reanalysis of the Mediterranean Sea at high resolution, developed in the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) framework. The hydrodynamic model is based on the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) combined with a variational data assimilation scheme (OceanVar). The model has a horizontal resolution of 1/24 degrees and 141 unevenly distributed vertical z* levels. It provides daily and monthly temperature, salinity, current, sea level and mixed layer depth as well as hourly fields for surface velocities and sea level. ECMWF ERA-5 atmospheric fields force the model and daily boundary conditions in the Atlantic are taken from a global reanalysis. The reanalysis covers the 33 years from 1987 to 2019. Initialized from SeaDataNet climatology in January 1985, it reaches a nominal state after a 2-years spin-up. In-situ data from CTD, ARGO floats and XBT are assimilated into the model in combination with satellite altimetry observations. This reanalysis has been validated and assessed through comparison to in-situ and satellite observations as well as literature climatologies. The results show an overall improvement of the comparison with observations and a better representation of the main dynamics of the region compared to a previous, lower resolution (1/16 degrees), reanalysis. Temperature and salinity RMSD are decreased by respectively 14 and 18%. The salinity biases at depth of the previous version are corrected. Climate signals show continuous increase of the temperature and salinity, confirming estimates from observations and other reanalysis. The new reanalysis will allow the study of physical processes at multi-scales, from the large scale to the transient small mesoscale structures and the selection of climate indicators for the basin.

AB  - Purpose The study's main objective is to identify business sustainability performance indicators and analyze the mutual relationship between different business sustainability components in Iran. Design/methodology/approach To achieve research objectives, the 125 indicators of Business Sustainability Performance in Arianpoor and Salehi (2020) were used. For data collection, a questionnaire is designed and developed. Moreover, the Delphi method is used to determine the indicators related to business sustainability performance. Accordingly, we attempted to send the questionnaire to 346 experts and qualified opinion-leaders in the study area to utilize their opinions in our project. Finally, 108 questionnaires were analyzed statistically. Findings In this study, the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), binomial test, one sample t-test, one sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Kruskal-Wallis test are used. The results of statistical tests show that among 125 proposed indicators, 11 indicators were eliminated. Hence, to assess business sustainability performance in the listed firm on the Tehran Stock Exchange, 114 indicators were analyzed. To achieve the study's objective, the relationship between financial and non-financial sustainability performance and their effect is analyzed using the Smart PLS Software. Findings indicate that there is a mutual relationship between financial and non-financial sustainability performance in Iran. There is also a relationship between the operational component and research component and non-financial sustainability performance. In contrast, as for the growth component and non-financial sustainability performance, there is no significant relationship. Also, root means squared error (RMSE) values suggest a reasonable model-data fit. Originality/value The type and characteristics of different regions have a significant role in the reporting and differ according to different economic conditions. The discussion of business sustainability and its reporting is important; therefore, essential indicators were identified in this study. In addition, all aspects of sustainability performance are considered cohesively to analyze the mutual relationship between different components of sustainability performance and to be able to make more appropriate decisions in future studies about performance evaluation and reporting using the results of this paper.

AB  - Bioenergy crops are a promising energy alternative to fossil fuels. During bioenergy feedstock production, crop inputs shape the composition of soil microbial communities, which in turn influences nutrient cycling and plant productivity. In addition to cropping inputs, site characteristics (e.g., soil texture, climate) influence bacterial and fungal communities. We explored the response of soil microorganisms to bioenergy cropping system (switchgrass vs. maize) and site (sandy loam vs. silty loam) within two long-term experimental research stations. The live and total microbial community membership was investigated using 16S and ITS amplicon sequencing of soil RNA and DNA. For both nucleic acid types, we expected fungi and prokaryotes to be differentially impacted by crop and site due their dissimilar life strategies. We also expected live communities to be more strongly affected by site and crop than the total communities due to a sensitivity to recent stimuli. Instead, we found that prokaryotic and fungal community composition was primarily driven by site with a secondary crop effect, highlighting the importance of soil texture and fertility in shaping both communities. Specific highly abundant prokaryotic and fungal taxa within live communities were indicative of site and cropping systems, providing insight into treatment-specific, agriculturally relevant microbial taxa that were obscured within total community profiles. Within live prokaryote communities, predatory Myxobacteria spp. were largely indicative of silty and switchgrass communities. Within live fungal communities, Glomeromycota spp. were solely indicative of switchgrass soils, while a few very abundant Mortierellomycota spp. were indicative of silty soils. Site and cropping system had distinct effects on the live and total communities reflecting selection forces of plant inputs and environmental conditions over time. Comparisons between RNA and DNA communities uncovered live members obscured within the total community as well as members of the relic DNA pool. The associations between live communities and relic DNA are a product of the intimate relationship between the ephemeral responses of the live community and the accumulation of DNA within necromass that contributes to soil organic matter, and in turn shapes soil microbial dynamics.</p>

AB  - Edible insects are a novel food in most countries; their popularity is growing because of their high-protein and low-fat content, ease of cultivation, and small environmental impact. To our knowledge, this is the first report that addresses both microbiological and chemical hazards in edible insects. Samples were collected from retail stores or purchase through e commerce. A total of 51 samples of dried whole insects or insect powder were tested for Escherichia coli, which serves as an indicator of the overall sanitation conditions throughout the food production chain, and the bacterial pathogen Salmonella spp. Neither Salmonella spp. nor E. coli (>100 CFU/g) was found in the samples analyzed. A total of 43 samples of crickets (protein bars, powders, flour, and whole insects) and 4 samples of silkworm (whole insects) were analyzed for up to 511 pesticides. Of these, 39 samples contained up to four pesticides; 34 samples were compliant and 5 samples were noncompliant with Canadian regulations. Seven pesticide residues were detected, with glyphosate and its metabolite, aminomethylphosphonic acid, as the predominant residues. Nineteen of the samples tested for pesticides were also analyzed for arsenic, cadmium, mercury, and lead; there was insufficient material remaining to allow testing of pesticides and metals. The positive rates for arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury were 100, 79, 58, and 74%, respectively. The detected concentrations ranged from 0.030 to 0.34 mg/kg for arsenic, from 0.031 to 0.23 mg/kg for cadmium, 0.019 to 0.059 mg/kg for lead, and from 0.94 to 28 mu g/kg for mercury. Based on the lack of detection of microbiological contamination, and the positive rates and levels of pesticides and metals observed in the products, Health Canada determined that all insect products analyzed were safe for human consumption. This is a limited study; the Canadian Food Inspection Agency will continue to monitor this novel food.
   HIGHLIGHTS
   Edible insects were tested for potential microbiological and chemical health hazards.
   No Salmonella spp. or E. coli (.100 CFU/g) was detected.
   89% compliance was found with Canadian pesticide regulations.
   Glyphosate and its metabolite, AMPA, were the most commonly detected pesticides.
   All insect products tested were deemed safe for human consumption.

AB  - Crop water use can be a useful indicator of in-season crop conditions including health and greenness on sodic soils. However, in-field manual measurements of crop water use can be tedious, time and labour-intensive and may also exhibit large spatial variability, and inefficient for surveying large areas. Here we propose a novel approach to estimate in-field crop water use of wheat using spatial interpolation techniques at critical crop development stages (tillering and close to flowering) on a moderately sodic and a highly sodic site in southern Queensland, Australia. The six spatial interpolation techniques; ordinary kriging, empirical Bayes kriging, inverse distance weighting, spline, local polynomial interpolation, and radial basis function were employed on ground-measured crop water use data and compared to accurately estimate the spatial distribution of crop water use. Initially, the comparison was made using root mean square error, mean absolute error, and coefficient of determination values using cross-validation. For a more clear comparison and to account for complexities of sitespecific crop water use distribution, the standardized, multi-component model performance efficiency metrics, i. e. Kling-Gupta efficiency and spatial efficiency were adopted and tested over cross-validation techniques. Results showed that Kling-Gupta efficiency was slightly better at selecting the optimum interpolation models for crop water use estimation at a field scale than the spatial efficiency metric. Spline and local polynomial interpolation were relatively better estimators of crop water use for both the sites at tillering, while the radial basis function and spline were superior close to flowering. The estimated crop water use was positively and closely associated with seasonal GreenSeeker (R) normalized difference vegetation index data (R2 = 0.49 and 0.39 at tillering; and R2 = 0.71 and 0.62 at close to flowering, for the moderately sodic and highly sodic sites, respectively). The research improves our understanding of selecting appropriate spatial interpolation methods for in-season crop water use estimation that could help detect changes in crop health due to in-field and seasonal variations of crop water use in a sodic soil environment.

AB  - Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a hopeful indicator, which along with remote sensing, is used to measure the photosynthetic efficiency and gross primary production (GPP) of vegetation in regional terrestrial ecosystems. Studies have found a significant linear correlation between SIF and GPP in a variety of ecosystems. However, this relationship has mainly been established using SIF and GPP data derived from satellite remote sensing and continuous ground-based observations, respectively, which are difficult to accurately match. To overcome this, some studies have begun to use tower-based automatic observation instruments to study the changes of near-surface SIF and GPP. This study conducts continuous simultaneous observation of SIF, carbon flux, and meteorological factors on the forest canopy of a cork oak plantation during the growing season to explore how meteorological factors impact on canopy SIF and its relationship with GPP. This research found that the canopy SIF has obvious diurnal and day-to-day variations during the growing season but overall is relatively stable. Furthermore, SIF is greatly affected by incident radiation in different weather conditions and can change daily. Meteorological factors have a major role in the relationship between SIF and GPP; overall, the relationship shows a significant linear regression on the 30 min scale, but weakens when aggregating to the diurnal scale. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) drives SIF on a daily basis and changes the relationship between SIF and GPP on a seasonal timescale. As PAR increases, the daily slopes of the linear regressions between SIF and GPP decrease. On the 30 min timescale, both SIF and GPP increase with PAR until it reaches 1250 mu mol center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1); subsequently, SIF continues to increase while GPP decreases and they show opposite trends. Soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit influence SIF and GPP, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that meteorological factors affect the relationship between SIF and GPP, thereby enhancing the understanding of the mechanistic link between chlorophyll fluorescence and photosynthesis.

AB  - Many toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) such as chlorine and ammonia are very reactive with commonly encountered materials in the environment. The amount of TIC material reacted in the environment is an important factor in determining the impact of a release. Typically characterized with a dry deposition rate in atmospheric dispersion models, the reaction rate has predominately been studied in field scale experiments at concentration levels typical for air pollution (ppm levels). When considering the removal of chlorine by (dry) deposition in an episodic release, gas phase concentrations will be much higher than those associated with air pollution, and near-field reaction of chlorine with local vegetation will be strongly influenced by the response of leaves and other elements of the surface "canopy" to those high concentrations. In this work, standard engineering methods characterizing the rate of mass transfer from a fluid to a surface in conjunction with reaction at that surface are applied. Previous experimental programs that studied the removal of chlorine under conditions relevant to this study show that deposition of chlorine to plant material can reach a limiting maximum so that the plant material can no longer react with gaseous chlorine despite continued exposure. In the analysis presented here, it is shown that the effect of the maximum deposition can be treated using the same approach as has been used to model catalyst poisoning. This study developed a model to account for boundary layer resistance and the impact of maximum deposition in a framework that could be incorporated in atmospheric dispersion models. To test the efficacy of this model, the Controlled Environment Reactivity Test (CERT) apparatus was designed to expose selected environmental materials (substrates including soil, rye grass, white clover, maple leaves, and spruce branches) to chlorine with initial concentration of (nominally) 1000 ppm where the gas phase chlorine concentration can be measured as a function of time to determine relevant modeling parameters. The apparatus was built to control the flow velocity of the chlorine/air mixture over the experimental substrates with turbulence levels that are comparable to the atmosphere. Model parameters were found for the environmental materials tested.

   In the dairy industry, heat stress and its induced heat strain result in huge economic loss every year. To better manage heat strain in dairy cows, it is more sensible to advance the detection by using more sensitive indicators so that cooling measures can be implemented in time. With the development of sensor technologies and wireless transmission technologies, body surface temperature and respiration rate can be measured automatically through wearable devices. Lots of efforts have been made recently to develop meaningful thresholds on both physiological and environmental sides. However, the existing thresholds should be used carefully considering the differences in experimental conditions and animal information. Further studies are required to evaluate and customize thresholds based on different influencing factors. A comprehensive early detection system for heat strain based on both animal- and environment-based indicators is expected.
   In pursuit of precision livestock farming, the real-time measurement for heat strain-related data has been more and more valued. Efforts have been made recently to use more sensitive physiological indicators with the hope to better inform decision-making in heat abatement in dairy farms. To get an insight into the early detection of heat strain in dairy cows, the present review focuses on the recent efforts developing early detection methods of heat strain in dairy cows based on body temperatures and respiratory dynamics. For every candidate animal-based indicator, state-of-the-art measurement methods and existing thresholds were summarized. Body surface temperature and respiration rate were concluded to be the best early indicators of heat strain due to their high feasibility of measurement and sensitivity to heat stress. Future studies should customize heat strain thresholds according to different internal and external factors that have an impact on the sensitivity to heat stress. Wearable devices are most promising to achieve real-time measurement in practical dairy farms. Combined with internet of things technologies, a comprehensive strategy based on both animal- and environment-based indicators is expected to increase the precision of early detection of heat strain in dairy cows.

AB  - Fire exclusion has dramatically altered historically fire adapted forests across western North America. In response, forest managers reduce forest fuels with mechanical thinning and/or prescribed burning to alter fire behavior, with additional objectives of restoring forest composition, structure, and ecosystem processes. There has been extensive research on the effects of fuel reduction and restoration treatments on trees, fuels, regeneration, and fire behavior; but less is known about how these treatments influence understory vegetation, which contains the majority of vascular plant diversity in many dry conifer forests. Of particular interest is how understory vegetation may respond to the season and interval of prescribed burning. The season and interval of prescribed burning is often determined by operational constraints rather than historical fire regimes, potentially resulting in fire conditions and burn intervals to which native plants are poorly adapted. In this study, we examined how understory vegetation has responded to season and interval of prescribed burning in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in the Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon, USA. Using over a decade (2002-2015) of understory vegetation data collected in stands with different intervals (5 versus 15 year) and seasons (spring versus fall) of prescribed burning, we quantified how season and interval of prescribed burning has influenced understory vegetation compositional trajectories and indicator species over time. Season of prescribed burning resulted in different understory communities and distinct trajectories of understory composition over time, but interval of burning did not. Indicator species analysis suggests fall burning is facilitating early seral species, with native annual forbs displaying ephemeral responses to frequent burning, while invasive cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) increased in abundance and frequency across all treatments over time. These findings indicate that understory vegetation in these ecosystems are sensitive to seasonality of burning, but the responses are subtle. Our findings suggest season and interval of prescribed burning used in this study do not result in large changes in understory vegetation community composition, a key consideration as land managers increase the pace and scale of prescribed fire in these forests.

AB  - Unheated and heat-treated bovine bone material with differing heating times and heat-treated in increments from 100 degrees C to 1000 degrees C were analysed to study the crystallographic change of fresh biological bone mineral occuring during incineration. We combine several complementary analytical methods applied to the same unheated and heat treated material to ensure data consistency in order to establish a comprehensive study on heat-induced changes in bone. We applied quantitative powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and Infrared-coupled Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA-FTIR), and we correlated the analytical results with empirical indicators such as crystallinity indices (CI and IRSF) and bone colour changes after burning. At temperatures from 700 degrees C onwards after 30 min of heating, a considerable recrystallization reaction from bioapatite to hydroxyapatite occurred. FTIR revealed that there are no or only minor amounts of hydroxyl-ions in original bone mineral which in consequence should be referred to "carbonate-hydro-apatite" rather than hydroxyapatite. Thermal treatment induced a pronounced increase of crystallite size and an increase of hydroxyl groups in the apatite lattice accompanied by a depletion of water and reduction of carbonate contents during incineration. Thus, the heat treatment at temperatures >= 700 degrees C leads to the recrystallization of bioapatite to hydroxyapatite. Above 800 degrees C buchwaldite is formed from the Na component within the bone mineral. Moreover, we found that the transformation reaction involving crystallite growth mainly sets in after organic matrix compounds and their residues have been combusted and the apatite grains get into direct contact. The information in this work, obtained by a combination of analytical methods which are typically applied and approved to determine bone cremation temperatures, can help to better understand changes in complex biomaterials during heating. In particular, the knowledge from this study can be applied to assess the cremation conditions of archaeological bone finds. As changes in the bone mineral state are not only dependent on temperature but also on time, care must be taken to deduce a defined temperature which cremated bone finds were exposed to.

AB  - In dairy cattle, resistance, tolerance and resilience refer to the adaptation ability to a broad range of environmental conditions, implying stable performances (e.g. production level, fertility status) independent from disease or infection pressure. All three mechanisms resistance, tolerance and resilience contribute to overall robustness, implying the evaluation of phenotyping and breeding strategies for improved robustness in dairy cattle populations. Classically, breeding approaches on improved robustness rely on simple production traits, in combination with detailed environmental descriptors and enhanced statistical modelling to infer possible genotype by environment interactions. In this regard, innovative environmental descriptors were heat stress indicators, and statistical modelling focussed on random regression or reaction norm methodology. A robust animal has high breeding values over a broad spectra of environmental levels. During the last years, direct health traits were included into selection indices, implying advances in genetic evaluations for traits being linked to resistance or tolerance against infectious and non-infectious diseases. Up to now, genetic evaluation for health traits is primarily based on subjectively measured producer-recorded data, with disease trait heritabilities in a low-to-moderate range. Thus, it is imperative to identify objectively measurable phenotypes as suitable biomarkers. New technologies (e.g. mid-infrared spectrometry) offer possibilities to determine potential biomarkers via laboratory analyses. Novel biomarkers include measurable physiological traits (e.g. serum metabolites, hormone levels) as indicators for a current infection, or the host's reaction to environmental stressors. The rumen microbiome composition is proposed as a biomarker to detect interactions between host genotype and environmental effects. The understanding of host genetic variation in disease resistance and individual expression of robustness encourages analyses on the underlying immune response (IR) system. Recent advances have been made in order to infer the genetic background of IR traits and cows immunological competence in relation to functional and production traits. Thus, a last aspect of this review addresses the genetic background and current state of genetic control for resistance to economically relevant infectious and non-infectious dairy cattle diseases by considering immune-related factors.

AB  - Birds are commonly used as bio-indicators of the quality of environments and the changes to them. Therefore, ecologists put a lot of effort into the monitoring of their population trends. One of the methods used for bird population monitoring is autonomous sound recording. Current studies provide inconsistent results when the number of detected species by autonomous sound recorders was compared with that delivered by an observer. In our study, observers counted birds using a point-count method at 64 random points in forest and farmland. At the same points, autonomous sound recorders recorded the soundscape four separate times (including counting by observer period) and the species present in the recordings were later identified by observers in the lab. We compared the number of species detected by simultaneous observations and recordings, as well as the number of species detected by recorders during four different surveys. Additionally, we calculated the Sorensen index to compare the species composition during different surveys at the same point. We found that observers detected more species than autonomous sound recorders. However, differences in the number of detected species were habitat dependent-observers detected more species than recorders in farmland, but not in the forest. When the time for recording was doubled, recorders were more effective than observers during a single survey. The average Sorensen index between the four repeated surveys performed by autonomous sound recorders ranged from 0.58 to 0.67, however we did not find significant differences in the number of species detected during different surveys conducted at the same point. Our study showed that 10-minutes sampling from the same point gives various species composition estimates but not species richness estimates between different surveys. Therefore, even when recorders detect less species than observers during the simultaneous surveys, increasing the survey duration of recorders may alter this difference. The use of autonomous sound recording for monitoring bird populations should be promoted, especially in forest habitats, as this technique is easier to standardise, eliminates many errors observed in the traditional point-count approach, enables conducting survey during adverse field conditions and delivers more reliable results for the majority of the species.

AB  - Human activities are increasing the size, frequency, and severity of disturbance across earth's ecosystems induding deserts. Ants are important drivers of ecosystem function and are good bioindicators of ecosystem sensitivity to disturbance and change. Rodents also play an important role in ecosystem response to disturbance and often compete with ants for resources. The purpose of our study was to test the main and interactive effects of fire, rodent activity, and time on ant forager abundance, species richness, and diversity, as well as changes in ant mound density and disk area in the Great Basin Desert. We experimentally applied burn and rodent exclusion treatments and used pitfall traps to collect ants each month from April through October from 2014 to 2016. Over the three-year period, burned areas had lower richness and diversity than unburned areas. Rodent exclusion had minimal effects on the ant community, and there was not a significant rodent exclusion interaction with fire. Treatment effects varied by month and year. The western harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex occidental is, was the most abundant ant species, comprising about 70% of the total ants captured. Shifts in ant diversity following fire were driven by positive responses of harvester ants to burned habitat conditions. In contrast, all other ant species when analyzed together had lower forager abundance in burned plots, which drove lower ant diversity in burned plots. Ant forager abundance, richness, and diversity increased each year of the study in all plots; however, richness and diversity remained lower in burned areas than in unburned areas each year. Structural equation modeling shows that the effects of fire on ant community diversity are partially mediated through the plant community. While rodents affected the plant community, those effects do not seem to transfer over to the ant community. Pogonomyrmex occidentalis mound density was higher in burned areas, but disk area was smaller. Our results suggest that fire has adverse effects on ant community diversity. This could have long-lasting effects on ecosystem function in the face of a changing fire regime in deserts of North America caused by invasive annual plants.

AB  - The aerodynamic environment in the test section of a hypersonic shock tunnel is very hostile as the high enthalpy flows prevail over the test model for a very short test time (similar to 1 ms). It calls for the requirement of the high-speed thermal sensors to survive in this harsh environment. Coaxial surface junction thermocouples (CSJTs) have the characteristics features of very high response times that can be used to capture highly transient temperature data during short duration hypersonic flows in the shock tunnel. The present study aims at the comparative performance assessment studies of three different surface junction probes (E, J and T-type) in a hypersonic shock tunnel at a flow Mach number of 8.2. All of them are mounted simultaneously in a rake along with a pitot-probe, in the test section of the tunnel where they experience a step heat load through a slug of test gas prevailing for 1 ms flow duration. Subsequently, the transient temperature histories are recorded at stagnation point of the junction probe and surface heat fluxes are predicted through one-dimensional heat conduction modeling. Side by side, stagnation heat flux is calculated independently through numerical simulations and analytical methods under same experimental flow conditions. The surface heat flux is recovered within a reasonable accuracy for E and T-type probes when experimental results are compared with numerical simulation and analytical solutions. In contrast, substantial deviations in surface heat flux value are observed for a J-type probe, which is mainly due to inconsistency in "thermal product (TP)" value of CSJT. However, they are quite sensitive in acquiring transient data during short time scale of measurements prevailing in the shock tunnel. The performance indicators such as "sensitivity and response time" for E-type CSJTs are found to be 58.96 mu V/degrees C and 21 mu s, respectively as compared to 43.82 mu V/degrees C and 29 us for J-type and 28.47 mu V/degrees C and 24 mu s for T-type, respectively.

AB  - Reduced visibility is an indicator of poor air quality. Moreover, degradation in visibility can be hazardous to human safety; for example, low visibility can lead to road, rail, sea and air accidents. In this paper, we explore the combined influence of atmospheric aerosol particle and gas characteristics, and meteorology, on long-term visibility. We use visibility data from eight meteorological stations, situated in the UK, which have been running since the 1950s. The site locations include urban, rural and marine environments.
   Most stations show a long-term trend of increasing visibility, which is indicative of reductions in air pollution, especially in urban areas. Additionally, the visibility at all sites shows a very clear dependence on relative humidity, indicating the importance of aerosol hygroscopicity on the ability of aerosol particles to scatter radiation. The dependence of visibility on other meteorological parameters, such as wind speed and wind direction, is also investigated. Most stations show long-term increases in temperature which can be ascribed to climate change, land-use changes (e.g. urban heat island effects) or a combination of both; the observed effect is greatest in urban areas. The impact of this temperature change upon local relative humidity is discussed.
   To explain the long-term visibility trends and their dependence on meteorological conditions, the measured data were fitted to a newly developed light-extinction model to generate predictions of historic aerosol and gas scattering and absorbing properties. In general, an excellent fit was achieved between measured and modelled visibility for all eight sites. The model incorporates parameterizations of aerosol hygroscopicity, particle concentration, particle scattering, and particle and gas absorption. This new model should be applicable and is easily transferrable to other data sets worldwide. Hence, historical visibility data can be used to assess trends in aerosol particle properties. This approach may help constrain global model simulations which attempt to generate aerosol fields for time periods when observational data are scarce or non-existent. Both the measured visibility and the modelled aerosol properties reported in this paper highlight the success of the UK's Clean Air Act, which was passed in 1956, in cleaning the atmosphere of visibility-reducing pollutants.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to contribute to adaptation research by devising a systematic method for examining the challenges in mainstreaming climate change adaptation (CCA) into local land use planning. It argues that mainstreaming operationalization necessitates a methodology that focuses on the challenges in applying the approach and an analytical framework that can examine the mainstreaming process from an institutional perspective.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper applied triangulation by data method (i.e. document review, interview, survey and key informant consultations) and incorporated the scorecard approach in developing the four-stage mixed methodology. It used a modified Institutional Analysis and Development framework as primary analytical guide and applied the case study methodology for structure and focus in relation to data collection activities.
   Findings - This paper devised the four-stage mixed methodology and successfully applied it in examining the challenges in mainstreaming CCA into local land use planning in Albay, Philippines. Using the methodology, this paper developed 20 quantitative "mainstreaming indicators" and generated qualitative analyses to assess the state of play of the challenges in local mainstreaming of CCA. Results suggest that mainstreaming challenges exist within a certain spectrum, with one end composed of barriers to, and the other, opportunities for CCA. Furthermore, the challenges occur at varying degrees of severity depending on the conditions that surround them.
   Research limitations/implications - This paper is limited to illustrating the process involved in developing the four-stage mixed methodology and presents only a brief discussion of the quantitative and qualitative results.
   Practical implications - Although the methodology is at its initial stages of development, it generated results that can help analysts, planners and decision-makers: determine the nature of the challenges in mainstreaming CCA, thereby understand the mainstreaming process; prioritize the mainstreaming challenges to address; and design strategies that will maximize the use of limited resources (i.e. utilizing the opportunities to overcome the existing barriers), among others.
   Originality/value - The four-stage mixed methodology was developed to aid analysts, planners and decision-makers determine the state-of-play of the challenges in mainstreaming CCA and make informed decisions in overcoming these challenges. Thus, the mixed method can be a useful tool in advancing the operationalization of the mainstreaming approach.

AB  - Studies of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic sequence crossed by the Barreiro-4 borehole provide an improved understanding of the organic matter deposited in the Lower Tagus sub-basin (Lusitanian Basin, Portugal) and the implications for the potential source rock and depositional environment. This study focused on 43 samples (Middle Jurassic to Neogene) that were subjected to palynofacies and organic geochemistry analyses (Total Organic Carbon, Rock-Eval pyrolysis and molecular biomarker analysis). The palynofacies data indicate that the sequence contains mainly phytoclasts (non-opaque phytoclasts). However, the Middle Jurassic samples are dominated by Amorphous Organic Matter (AOM). Continental and/or marine palynomorphs are present in all the samples. The Cretaceous samples are characterized by small amounts of kerogen that have high contents of solid bitumen. The Total Organic Carbon (TOC) content is generally less than 1 wt.%. The Rock-Eval S1 and S2 parameters vary from 0.01 to 3.50 mgHC/g rock and 0.15 to 34.03 mgHC/g rock, respectively, with the highest values corresponding to the Cretaceous samples. The hydrogen index (HI) and oxygen index (OI) values range from 35 to 552 mgHC/g TOC and 4 to 180 mgHC/g TOC, respectively. The T-max values range from 416 to 437 degrees C. The biomarker analysis showed that n-alkanes with 15-30 carbon atoms are present and usually have a unimodal distribution with a predominance of low to medium molecular weight compounds. The CPI values range between 0.63 and 3.65, and the pristane/phytane ratios vary between 0.48 and 1.64, indicating alternation of oxic-anoxic conditions along the sequence. The distribution of terpanes shows small amounts of tricyclic and tetracyclic terpanes in most of the samples (except for some Cretaceous samples) and a predominance of pentacyclic terpanes. The amount of 17 alpha (H),22,29,30-trisnorhopane (Tm) usually exceeds the amount of 18 alpha (H),22,29,30-trinorneohopane (Ts). The 20S/(20S + 20R) and alpha beta beta/(alpha alpha alpha + alpha beta beta) ratios of the C29 steranes generally have values below the range of equilibrium, indicating an immature stage of the OM.

AB  - In Australia water stress is estimated to cost the sugar industry an average of $260 million (AUD) per annum in lost production. With the predicted increased frequency of drought events the industry is now considering breeding for drought adaptation after water stress inflicted yield losses of more than $400 million in the years 2002-2004, in one region alone. Defining drought adaptation broadly, including both short and long periods of water stress, we took the first step in improving sugarcane for such conditions by assessing the potential benefits of a number of traits in a simulation study. The APSIM-Sugarcane model was used to simulate the biomass yield response to traits that may confer adaptation to drought in a range of climates, some extremely dry at times, and in a shallow and a deep soil. Among the traits studied, increased rooting depth resulted in 0-21% increase in mean dry biomass yield depending on the climate and soil type. This trait was more beneficial in the shallow than the deep soil which had a smaller fraction of additional stored water to offer the more vigorous root system. The simulations showed that breeding for reduced stomatal or root conductance (conductance) would increase biomass yield by about 5% only in the driest climates and better soils. Other traits which conserved water such as leaf and stalk senescence were generally unsuccessful in conferring adaptation to the water-limited production environments considered. Simulations indicated that increased transpiration efficiency (TE) at the leaf level would nearly always help to improve sugarcane biomass yields in water-limited environments if the increased TE arose from up-regulation of intrinsic water use efficiency. However if increased TE was increased through reduced conductance, which effectively reduces VPD during transpiration, yields could be reduced in high rainfall climates and shallow soils and they could increase in moderate rainfall climates and deeper soils. Thus increased rooting depth, increased intrinsic water use efficiency and to a lesser extent, reduced conductance leading to increased TE, are suggested as the best traits to consider for selection of sugarcane clones in water-limited environments in the tropics and sub-tropics.

AB  - The components of the land surface energy balance respond to periodic incoming radiation forcing with different amplitude and phase characteristics. Evaporative fraction (EF), the ratio of latent heat to available energy at the land surface, supposedly isolates surface control (soil moisture and vegetation) from radiation and turbulent factors. EF is thus supposed to be a diagnostic of the surface energy balance that is constant or self-preserved during daytime. If this holds, EF can be an effective way to estimate surface characteristics from temperature and energy flux measurements. Evidence for EF diurnal self-preservation is based on limited-duration field measurements. The daytime EF self-preservation using both long-term measurements and a model of the soil vegetation atmosphere continuum is reexamined here. It is demonstrated that EF is rarely constant and that its temporal power spectrum is wide; thus emphasizing the role of all diurnal frequencies associated with reduced predictability in its daylight response. Oppositely, surface turbulent heat fluxes are characterized by a strong response to the principal daily frequencies (daily and semi-daily) of the solar radiative forcing. It is shown that the phase lag and bias between the turbulent flux components of the surface energy balance are key to the shape of the daytime EF. Therefore, an understanding of the physical factors that affect the phase lag and bias in the response of the components of the surface energy balance to periodic radiative forcing is needed. A linearized model of the soil vegetation atmosphere continuum is used that can be solved in terms of harmonics to explore the physical factors that determine the phase characteristics. The dependency of these phase and offsets on environmental parameters friction velocity, water availability, solar radiation intensity, relative humidity, and boundary layer entrainment is then analyzed using the model that solves the dynamics of subsurface and atmospheric boundary layer temperatures and heat fluxes in a continuum. Additionally, the asymptotical diurnal lower limit of EF is derived as a function of these surface parameters and shown to be an important indicator of the self-preservation value when the conditions (also identified) for such behavior are present.

AB  - A difficult calving affects the welfare of the cow and has economic implications for the farm. The degree of calving difficulty can vary from no assistance needed through a slight pull required to surgery being needed. With respect to milk production, it is not clear at which degree of calving difficulty adverse effects occur or for how long they last. Studies usually only consider the milk produced by animals who completed full lactations but the saleable milk production of the whole herd, regardless of each cow having achieved a full lactation, might be a better indicator of the productivity of the cows and the underlying stresses they experience, as well as being more representative of the real losses that producers incur. The objective of this study was to investigate how various degrees of calving difficulty would alter both the cow's milk production and their production of saleable milk over different stages of their subsequent lactation. The calving difficulty scores and the subsequent milk production were retrieved from an experimental dairy farm (in the United Kingdom) for 2 herds that contained 2,430 and 1,413 lactations. To account for milk saleable by the farmer, individual cumulative saleable milk yields, referred to as saleable milk yields (SMY), were calculated at 30, 60, 90, and 300 d in milk unconditional on the animal having achieved the lactation stage of interest. Lactation SMY were obtained based on the real lactation length achieved by the animal. Mean daily milk yields were also calculated for the same lactation stages as an estimate of the cow's milk production (CMP). Calving difficulty impaired milk production of dairy cows in terms of CMP and SMY in both herds, highlighting impaired income for dairy producers as well as detrimental effects to the productivity of the cows and potentially impaired health and survival. The management of the herd affected the presence of an effect of each degree of difficulty on SMY and CMP as well as its magnitude and duration. The analysis of SMY, independently of each animal having achieved a full lactation, could be a more sensitive indicator of the subsequent long-lasting biological stresses than CMP alone.

AB  - The least limiting water range (LLWR) is considered a modern indicator of soil physical quality for plant growth. The aim of this study was to determine the LLWR for assessing the soil physical quality of a dystroferric Red Latosol (Oxisol) under no-tillage in a crop-livestock integration system. In the crop-livestock integration system of the study area, soybean was planted in the summer and oat (Avena strigosa Schreb) plus ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam) in the winter with different pasture heights during grazing: 7, 14, 21, and 28 cm, and an ungrazed control. Undisturbed soils samples were taken from the layers 0-7.5 and 7.5-15 cm, in which the soil bulk density (Bd), soil water retention and soil resistance to penetration curves were determined, to then calculate the LLWR. The critical soil bulk density (Bdc) was determined for LLWR=0. Regardless of the treatments, it was found that an increase of the soil bulk density requires an increase of soil water contents to maintain soil penetration resistance below 2.5 MPa and a decrease in soil water to ensure adequate soil aeration, mainly in the 0-7.5 cm layer. In the treatments with grazing heights of 21 and 28 cm, the magnitude of LLWR was greater than in the control, suggesting that crop-livestock integration creates a positive soil physical environment, provided that an appropriate stocking is maintained to prevent overgrazing. In the 7 cm treatment, the soil physical degradation was very high in the 0-7.5 cm layer, and certainly predisposes the crops to stress resistance to soil drying and to reduced aeration under prolonged conditions of high soil moisture. A progressive reduction in the proportion of samples with greater bulk density values than the critical density of the 7 cm treatment toward the control was verified, indicating that the treatment effect of excessive animal trampling resulted in a loss of soil physical quality in the 0-7.5 cm soil layer. The grazing height of oat and ryegrass pasture should be maintained above 21 cm to ensure adequate physical soil quality in the 0-7.5 cm soil layer.

AB  - The in vitro biological response to fluoro-edenite (FE) fibres, an asbestos-like amphibole, was evaluated in lung alveolar epithelial A549, mesothelial MeT-5A and monocyte-macrophage J774 cell lines. The mineral has been found in the vicinity of the town of Biancavilla (Catania, Sicily), where an abnormal incidence of mesothelioma has been documented. Cell motility, distribution of polymerized actin, and synthesis of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and of beta-catenin, critical parameters for tumour development, progression and survival, were investigated in A549 and MeT-5A cells exposed to 50 m g/ml FE fibres for 24 hr and 48 hr. The levels of cyclooxygenase (COX-2) and prostaglandin (PGE(2)), two molecules involved in cancer pathogenesis by affecting mitogenesis, cell adhesion, immune surveillance and apoptosis, were measured in J774 cells treated with FE fibres under the same experimental conditions. Finally, FE fibres were studied by SEM and EDS analysis to investigate their chemical composition. Exposure of A549 and MeT-5A cells to FE fibres affected differentially phalloidin-stained cytoplasmic F-actin networks, cell motility and VEGF and beta-catenin expression according to the different sensitivity of the two cell lines. In J774 cells it induced a significant increase in COX-2 expression, as assessed by Western blot analysis, and in the concentration of PGE2, measured in culture media by ELISA. SEM-EDS investigations demonstrated two types of FE fibres, edenite and fluoro-edenite, differing in chemical composition and both recognizable as calcic amphiboles. Fibre width ranged from less than 1 mu m (prevalently 0.5 mu m) to 2-3 mu m (edenite) up to several m m (fluoro-edenite); length ranged from about 6 to 80 mu m (edenite) up to some hundred mu m (fluoro-edenite). Results provide convincing evidence that FE fibres are capable of inducing in vitro functional modifications in a number of parameters with crucial roles in cancer development and progression. Inhaled FE fibres have the potential to induce mesothelioma, even though their ability to penetrate lung alveoli depends on their aerodynamic diameter.

AB  - There has been an interest in the application of Sr/Ca ratios in pelagic carbonates to reconstruct paleoceanographic conditions such as changes in the oceanic Ca and Sr budgets or calcareous nannoplankton productivity, but the effect of burial diagenesis on primary Sr/Ca records has not been sufficiently understood. In order to clearly document Sr/Ca records of pelagic carbonates relative to original paleoceanography or secondary diagenetic processes, Sr/Ca analyses were performed on bulk sediments from an 822.5m-thick ooze-chalk-limestone sequence at the Mid-Pacific Mountains, Deep Sea Drilling Project Site 463. The Sr/Ca ratios exponentially decrease from similar to 2.3 to similar to 1.1 mmol/mol with increasing burial depth in the ooze-chalk interval (0-452.0 m below seafloor (mbsf)). The Sr/Ca ratios further decline to as low as similar to 0.4 mmol/mol in the limestone interval (> 452.0mbsf), with relatively high values of > 1.1 mmol/mol at carbonate-poor lithology around 620mbsf. The stratigraphic Sr/Ca trends appear to be consistent with porosity profile, and similar Sr/Ca-porosity covariation in association with diagnetic changes in lithologies is also common in Ontong Java Plateau sections. By adopting a recent diagenetic model from backscattered electron image analysis of Ontong Java Plateau sections, it is postulated for Site 463 that exponential Sr/Ca decrease in the ooze-chalk interval is due to the release of Sr into interstitial water via recrystallization (i.e., purification effect), and that further decrease in Sr/Ca ratios in the limestone interval is most likely due to acquisition of Sr-depleted calcite cement at the 'chalk-limestone transition' (newly proposed as the dilution effect). Specifically, Sr/Ca ratios of deeply buried pelagic limestones are sensitive to the amount of calcite cement that is acquired in proportion to CaCO3 Content; i.e., carbonate-rich lithology facilitates precipitation of secondary calcite at the chalk-limestone transition. Therefore, paleoceanographic interpretation by means of Sr/Ca ratios in pelagic carbonates will become valid only when these diagenetic effects are appropriately constrained. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper describes the determination of sheet erosion rates by using dendrogeomorphological methods on exposed tree roots. Two sites on the northern slope of the Guadarrama Mountains, Central Spain, were studied: a popular trail in a Scots pine forest (Senda Schmidt, Valsain) growing on granites and gneisses, and an open holm-oak forest on granitic slopes (Monterrubio). These sites were selected because they showed high denudation morphologies due to accelerated soil-erosion processes caused by human influence (trampling by continuous trekking and overgrazing), resulting in exposed roots. The method applied is based on the morphological pattern of roots, defined by the growth-ring series of the sampled roots. In order to confirm the validity of the criteria used and to make the estimations of erosion more accurate, several anatomical indicators of exposed and non-exposed Pinus sylvestris roots were characterized.
   The study entailed a statistical analysis of exposure time and erosion depth. The influence of environmental factors affecting the variation in velocity of the erosion processes was also examined.
   With a significance level of 95%, the mean erosion rates were in the range of 1.7-2.6 mm/year (2944 t/ha/year) on Senda Schmidt over the last 101 years, and 1.1-1.8 mm/year (19-31 t/ha/year) in Monterrubio over the last 42 years. Using a multifactor analysis of variance, we observed a change in the erosion rates as a function of position on the path along Senda Schmidt. In Monterrubio, however, we reached no significant conclusions, apart from an inverse relationship between erosion and slope gradient that was difficult to interpret.
   Climate conditions in Senda Schmidt and the accuracy of dating Scots pine indicate that the evaluation on P sylvestris roots is fairly reliable, which is not the case for oak roots. Although this paper is based on the application of an existing method, its novelty lies in being the first attempt in Spain to estimate 'accelerated' sheet erosion rates (due to recreational activities and overgrazing) using dendrogeomorphological techniques, supplemented by anatomical indicators for P sylvestris.

AB  - An experimental set-up is presented for tracking the trajectory of a supersonic object using minimal resources. The proposed set-up, based on the use of low-cost pressure transducers, a general-purpose conditioning system and off-the-shelf instrumentation, is capable of determining the bullet trajectory, speed and hit point in open air use. The methodology is based on the post-processing of shock wave information gathered by means of three spaced sensor clusters, each one comprising three pressure transducers. The pressure sensors are used to detect the times of arrival of the shock wave generated by the bullet; on the basis of geometrical considerations, from the six time delays measured by means of the nine pressure sensors, the bullet direction and its speed are calculated. The novel contribution of the methodology described here, with respect to similar method's described in the literature, is the post-processing method used. The metrological performance of the realized experimental set-up was calculated by means of a priori analysis to theoretically determine the uncertainty maps as a function of bullet direction, after the geometry of the clusters, their relative positions and the time resolution were chosen. The theoretical analysis was then verified with field tests in a marksmanship training range with series of straight shots hitting the target plane from different positions at a distance of about 100 m, with both perpendicular and inclined shots. The results obtained with the shots perpendicular to target plate are: the error in hit points is always less than 65 mm while the error associated in angle values lies in the range from -0.017 to 0.010 rad (from -1.0degrees to 0.6degrees). The worst results obtained with inclined shots, i.e. those not perpendicular to the target plane, are: hit point error always less than 196 mm and range of variation of error angle of -0.017 and 0.038 rad (-1.0degrees and 6.8degrees). Overall examination of the theoretical and experimental results indicates the critical strengths of the method, namely accounting for environmental parameter fluctuations and accuracy in the evaluation of relative positions among the clusters.

AB  - The responses of small mammal communities to forest disturbance by logging were evaluated. The study area was located in the Imataca Forest Reserve (Venezuelan Guayana Region), where vegetation was predominantly lowland rain forest. Field analyses were based on a comparative inventory of species inhabiting primary forests and areas disturbed by selective logging. The taxonomic groups used as indicators of the ecological impact of logging belonged to thr orders Didelphimorphia, Chiroptera, and Rodentia (familia Sciuridae, Muridae, and Echimyidae). The following sampling methods were used: ii) mist nets; (2) traps in 2.4 ha grids teach with 120 stations: 60 at ground level and 60 in trees); and (3) diurnal and nocturnal sighs surveys. Total sampling effort consisted of 1904 net-hours, 10,320 trap-nights, and 567 h of direct observations. At least 83 mammalian species inhabited the evaluated forests (74.7 percent corresponding to Chiroptera), of which 15.3 percent: were restricted to primary forest. In logged areas, small mammal communities were characterized by: (1) higher abundances of individuals; (2) lower proportions of carnivorous and gleaning insectivorous bats; (3) increases in the relative abundance of frugivorous bat species that eat the fruits of colonizing plants; (4) higher proportions of aerial insectivores (Molossidae) at the lowest levels of the forest; (5) simplification in trophic structure of non-volant species, with semiarboreal predator-omnivores being the dominant guild (followed by terrestrial frugivore-omnivores); and (6) reduction in the relative abundance of mainly canopy-associated species. These results are explained by: ( 1) lower availability of key resources associated with primary forest (e.g., roosts in hollow trunks of mature trees, canopy fruits, and tree-crown continuity); (2) higher relative abundance of some food resources, such as terrestrial invertebrates and saprophytic plants, principally in areas where primary production is limited by low-fertility soils; (3) increase of roosting sites under fallen trunks: (4) modification of microclimatic conditions at the;understory level as a consequence of a greater incident sunlight after canopy opening; and (5) increase in density of early successional plants. The implications of these results to die conservation of biodiversity in forests managed for timber extraction in the Venezuelan Guayana Region are discussed.

AB  - Twin lamellae are a widespread feature in calcites of any type and origin. Twinning in calcite is an important intracrystalline deformation mechanism with low critical resolved shear stress and virtually no temperature dependence. In contrast to most slip systems in rock-forming minerals, twinning therefore permits intracrystalline deformation at very low temperature and very little confining pressure. Twinning alone, however, cannot lead to large strains because only one independent slip system is effectively available. Twins lead to discontinuous shearing on the grain scale which gives rise to considerable strain incompatibilities at grain boundaries. Twinning consequently leads to strain hardening. Detailed observations of the geometry of twin lamellae show that incompatibilities at grain boundaries are eliminated by pressure solution on the grain scale at low temperature and dynamic recovery processes at higher temperatures.
   Twins are found in various tectonic environments and record very small strains in rocks deformed under very little cover. Different twinning strain and twinning stress methods and palaeopiezometers are critically reviewed. All methods are limited to strains of less than 15% shortening (or extension) by twinning. Twinning nevertheless is an important, although not directly measurable, contribution to the total strain in highly strained calcite rocks at least up to middle greenschist facies, under which conditions it is the most effective contributor to the formation of strong lattice preferred orientations in calcite tectonites.
   The appearance of calcite twin lamellae changes systematically as a function of deformation temperature. Micro-twins and straight narrow (< 1 mum) lamellae are characteristic of very low temperatures where no other slip system competes and where the absence of effective recovery mechanisms prohibits large strains by twinning. Above ca 150-degrees-C, thicker (> 1-5 mum) but fewer twins are developed. Above approximately 200-degrees-C, curved twins, twinned twins and completely twinned grains indicate the progressive importance of other slip systems, and larger intracrystalline strains are possible. At ca 250-degrees-C and above ancient straight twin lamellae are modified into irregular geometries by recrystallization and grain-boundary migration. The appearance of calcite twins is proposed as an approximate but rapid and easy-to-use geothermometer in low-temperature environments.

AB  - Precipitation is one of the many important natural factors impacting agriculture and natural resource management. Although statistics have been applied to investigate the non-stationary trend and the unpredictable variances of precipitation under climate change, existing methods usually lack a sound physical basis that can be generally applied in any location and at any time for future extrapolation, especially in tropical areas. Physically, the formation of precipitation is a result of ascending air which reduces air pressure and condenses moisture into drops, either by irregular terrain or atmospheric phenomena (e.g., via frontal lifting). Thus, in this paper, pressure change events (PCEs) will be used as a physical indicator of the stability of atmospheric systems to reveal the impact of temperature on precipitation in the tropical areas of Florida. By using data from both national and regional weather observation networks, this study segments the continuous observation series into PCE sequences for further analysis divided by dry and wet seasons. The results reveal that the frequency and intensity of PCE are highly associated with the occurrences of weather events. Decreasing pressure favors precipitation, and may turn extreme when the temperature and air moisture are sufficient to fuel the process. With similar intensity, decreasing pressure change events (DePCEs) generally bear a higher probability of precipitation (POP) and precipitation depth (PD) than increasing pressure change events (InPCEs). The frequency of alternating between InPCEs and DePCEs is subject to the temperature of the season and climate. Due to the seasonal fluctuations of weather characteristics, such as temperature and relative humidity, the dependence of extreme precipitation on these characteristics can be interpreted via PCE. A 7% increase rate of precipitation vs. temperature rise, determined by the Clausius-Clapeyron (C-C) relationship, can be observed from extreme precipitation with variances in the season and PCE types. Although indicated by other research, active vertical movement of air caused by a phase change in water at the frozen point is not pronounced in Florida. The response patterns of humidity to precipitation also vary by season and PCE types in extreme conditions. In summary, PCEs demonstrate reliable physical evidence of precipitation formation and can better associate the occurrence and intensity of extreme weather with other characteristics. In turn, such associations embody the underlying physical concepts present at any location in the world.

AB  - The current radioecological situation of the territory in Bryansk oblast that was polluted as a result of the Chernobyl accident is analyzed based on calculating the radiation dose rate for reference organisms of the terrestrial biota. The initial data for the assessment were observation data (May-December in 1986-2020) on the density of soil contamination in the areas of Bryansk oblast located within different zones of radioactive contamination. Elk (Alces alces), the bank vole (Myodes glareolus), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), and the earthworm (Lumbricus terrestris) were selected as reference organisms of the terrestrial biota. The total radiation dose rate for the biota objects was determined in accordance with the recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and Roshydromet R 52.18.820-2015. Cs-137 was considered as the main dose-forming radionuclide. The contribution of Sr-90 to the radiation dose rate was insignificant (0.1-4.9%). Analysis of the radiation safety of biota objects consisted in checking the condition that the integral indicator of soil pollution (IISP) in the areas of Bryansk oblast did not exceed the environmentally safe level. According to the current monitoring data on the state of the territory of the Chernobyl radioactive trace, the IISP is significantly lower than the environmentally safe level for all areas of this region except for the exclusion zones. The maximum radiation doses were recorded for elk living in the vicinity of the village of Zaborye, Krasnogorsk raion, in 2020. According to a conservative estimate, a high dose load on biota exceeding the safe radiation level (SRL) for elk and the bank vole was observed in 1986 in Novozybkovsk raion. The dose rate for vertebrate animals in the contaminated areas of the region is one order of magnitude lower than the safe radiation level. In the future, it is recommended to continue radioecological studies of the territories and monitoring of the radiation situation in the most polluted areas of Bryansk oblast. It is also necessary to organize a radioecological reserve in the exclusion zones to carry out regular observations and improve the system of radiation protection of the environment.

AB  - Accurately identifying black point disease in wheat kernels from random samples within digital images is a fundamental and challenging task in disease identification. The performance of traditional methods is satisfactory in homogeneous environments, but their performance decreases when they are applied to images acquired in dynamic ones. In this paper, a multifeature-based machine learning method is proposed to identify and evaluate the incidence of black point disease. Ten wheat cultivars with different resistances to disease were selected to verify the accuracy of the method. First, a marker-based watershed algorithm was used to separate wheat kernels from the background to accomplish the coarse segmentation. After patches were generated from the coarse segmentation results, the patches were labeled manually and divided into two categories: black point areas and healthy areas. Gabor and Canny operators were used for texture and shape features respectively to build a feature matrix. Then, a classification model based on a naive Bayes classifier was trained to recognize the differences between the two types of patches by their features. The proposed model finally achieved the correct classification of each pixel from the testing sample and output the results in the form of a binary image, thus accomplishing the segmentation of the image. Finally, the severity of the disease was calculated according to the proportion of minimum circumscribed areas of the disease and the total area of the wheat kernel. Through the above operations, the incidence of black point disease in random samples can be determined. Five indicators, Q(seg), S-r, Precision, Recall, and F-measure, were used to evaluate the segmentation effects. The average accuracy of segmentation results for the testing samples were 0.85, 0.89, 0.87, 0.86, and 83% respectively. Compared with other segmentation approaches, including the excess green method, the excess green minus excess red method, the color index of vegetation extraction, and two traditional threshold segmentation methods known as Otsu and maximum entropy threshold, the proposed algorithm had greater segmentation accuracy. Moreover, this method was demonstrated to be robust enough to be used for different illumination conditions, shooting angles, and image resolutions.

AB  - Stable oxygen isotope ratios of mollusc shells (delta O-18(shell)) offer the possibility to reconstruct coastal resource exploitation patterns and changes in the oceanographic conditions of direct relevance to past human populations. This method relies on the fact that shell carbonate is deposited by molluscs in equilibrium with their surrounding environment and actualistic investigation of modern specimens is needed to ensure that selected species can be used as accurate palaeoclimate indicators. The limpet Patella depressa Pennant, 1777 is one of the most common mollusc species found in Holocene archaeological assemblages along the Atlantic coast of Europe. However, this taxon has not, to date, been tested as a seawater palaeothermometer. Here, we explore the ability of P. depressa to be used as an environmental recorder in this littoral region, specifically in northern Iberia where we obtained live-collected specimens throughout the year. We undertook sclerochronological investigations combining observations of incremental shell growth patterns with delta O-18(shell) values. Carbonate samples were taken on (i) the ventral margins of shells collected alive year-round in order to test for isotopic equilibrium and (ii) along the axis of maximum shell growth of four modern specimens to decipher the shell growth pattern of this species. Isotopic data showed that calcium carbonate is precipitated in predictable isotopic disequilibrium with the ambient seawater (R-2 = 0.95; p < 0.0001), reporting a consistent offset of +1.08 parts per thousand. Some periods of growth cessation were observed in the shells when thermal tolerances were exceeded in winter and occasionally in summer. Nevertheless, estimated seawater temperatures from modern shell delta O-18(shell) values agreed closely with instrumentally measured temperatures (R-2 = 0.88-0.93; p < 0.0001) and correctly reflected seasonal temperature patterns. As a result, multi-proxy analysis of P. depressa shells can provide a high-resolution palaeothermometer with significant implications for future palaeoclimate and archaeological studies along the Atlantic coast of Europe.

AB  - Purpose: The specific conditions of patients with acute craniocerebral injury, the extent, location, nature of the injury, and the association of the occurrence of mental disorders were analyzed. The specific changes of IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-a and cortisol in the serum of patients with early mental symptoms caused by acute craniocerebral injury were monitored.
   Method: 275 patients with acute craniocerebral injury were selected from 'Tangshan Gongren Hospital. The patient's relevant information was sorted out. The effects of multiple factors on early mental symptoms in patients with acute craniocerebral injury were analyzed. Peripheral venous blood samples were collected on the first day, the third day, the seventh day, the 15th day, the 21st day, and the 30th day of the hospitalization. Serum levels of IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-a and cortisol were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and their specific trends were compared.
   Result: The degree of education, age and specific nature, location and extent of traumatic brain injury were correlated with the occurrence of early psychiatric symptoms (P<0.01). Compared with patients in the non-mental disorder group, there was no change in the serum IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF-a levels on the first day after the injury in the mental disorder group. However, on the 3rd, 7th, 15th, 21st, and 30th days after the injury, the relevant index of the mental disorder group was higher than that of the non-mental disorder group (P<0.05). The indicators of the mental disorder group reached a peak on the 7th day after the injury and then gradually decreased.
   Conclusion: During clinical treatment of patients with craniocerebral injury, high-risk patients should be evaluated in a targeted manner. At the same time, the patient's mental symptoms should be observed and some targeted interventions and treatments should be carried out. The serum levels of 1L-1 beta,1L-6, TNF-a and cortisol were monitored dynamically. This provides guidance for clinical evaluation of the occurrence, development and observation of early mental symptoms of acute craniocerebral injury and has very high clinical value.

AB  - A reduction in dissolved oxygen availability in marine habitats is among the predicted consequences of increasing global temperatures. An understanding of past oxygenation is critical for predictions of future changes in the extent and distribution of oxygen minimum zones (OMZs). Benthic foraminifera have been used to assess changes in paleo-oxygenation, and according to prevailing thought, oxygen-poor marine benthic habitats are dominated by sediment-dwelling infaunal foraminifera, while more oxygenated environments are populated with more epifaunal taxa. However, in this study we found elevated densities of epifaunal taxa in oxygen-poor habitats. A series of 16 multicores were taken on depth transects (360-3000 m) across an OMZ in the Southern California Bight to investigate the ecology of living (rose bengal stained) benthic foraminifera. Dissolved oxygen concentrations in bottom water at sampling sites varied from 21 to 162 KmoVI. Sampling focused on bathymetric highs in an effort to collect seafloor surface materials with coarse sediments in areas not typically targeted for sampling. Mean grain size varied from about 131 (gravelly semi) to about 830 Km (coarse sand with fine gravel). Vertical distribution patterns (0-2 cm) were consistent with those of conspecifics reported elsewhere, and reconfirm that Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi and Hanzawaia nipponica have a living preference at or near the sediment-water interface. As expected, assemblages were dominated by infaunal taxa, such as Uvigerina and Bolivina, traditionally associated with the supersaturated, unconsolidated mud, characteristic of OMZ habitats, suggesting that these taxa are not sensitive to substrate type. However, despite dysoxic conditions (21-28 mu mol/l), epifaunal taxa comprised as much as 36% of the stained population at the five sites with the coarsest mean grain size, while other measured environmental parameters remained relatively constant. We suggest that these epifaunal taxa, including C. wuellerstorfi, prefer habitats with coarse grains that allow them to remain at or above the sediment-water interface. These results suggest that seafloor habitat heterogeneity contributes to the distribution of benthic foraminifera, including in low-oxygen environments. We submit that paleooxygenation methods that use epifaunal indicator taxa need to reconsider the dissolved oxygen requirements of epifaunal taxa.

AB  - The Orkney Islands and surrounding waters (known as the Pentland Firth and Orkney Waters Strategic Area, PFOW) contain a significant portion of Scotland's tidal and wave energy resource. This paper forms part of a wider study modelling tidal and wave processes, and planned renewable energy extraction, in PFOW using 3D hydrodynamic and spectral wave numerical models. Such hydrodynamic models require a number of spatial data, i.e. high resolution bathymetry, model boundary conditions and measurements for model validation, which are hard to obtain in extreme environments such as PFOW. This paper examines the characteristics and selection criteria of the data used for the development of the models. Most of these data are freely available, and could form part of an open source marine renewable energy hydrodynamic modelling toolbox.
   In order to include the planned tidal and wave energy developments in the hydrodynamic models of the wider study, realistic tidal and wave device array scenarios are required. However, there is still considerable uncertainty regarding the type of devices that will be deployed and device array layouts. Here, we describe the process undertaken, in consultation with industry, to develop a small number of generic device types and array scenarios for the PFOW, based on insight provided by documentation submitted by developers as part of the Scottish marine licensing process. For tidal developments, an algorithm was developed to determine the site specific array configuration, taking into account the number of turbines, water depth, tidal current direction and the spatial distribution of mean kinetic energy. The wave development sites did not require such detailed site specific placement of devices, and the generic layouts could simply be constructed in most cases without the need for detailed site specific resource characterisation.
   It is anticipated that the renewable energy industry will be able to adopt our data selection criteria to ensure models developed for environmental impact assessments satisfy the quality requirements of the regulator. Similarly, the methodologies developed for characterising generic device types and array layouts will be useful to academia and government researchers, who do not necessarily have access to detailed device and site specific information.

AB  - A multi-criteria framework combining safety, hygiene and sensorial quality was developed to investigate the possibility of extending the shelf-life and/or removing lactate by applying High Hydrostatic Pressure (HHP) in a ready-to-cook (RTC) poultry product. For this purpose, Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes were considered as safety indicators and Escherichia coli as hygienic indicator. Predictive modeling was used to determine the influence of HHP and lactate concentration on microbial growth and survival of these indicators. To that end, probabilistic assessment exposure models developed in a previous study (Lerasle, M., Guillou, S., Simonin, H., Anthoine, V., Cheret, It, Federighi, M., Membre, J.M. 2014. Assessment of Salmonella and L. monocytogenes level in ready-to-cook poultry meat: Effect of various high pressure treatments and potassium lactate concentrations. International Journal of Food Microbiology 186, 74-83) were used for L. monocytogenes and Salmonella. Besides, for E. coli; an exposure assessment model was built by modeling data from challenge-test experiments. Finally, sensory tests and color measurements were performed to evaluate the effect of HHP on the organoleptic quality of an RTC product. Quantitative rules of derision based on safety, hygienic and organoleptic criteria were set. Hygienic and safety criteria were associated with probability to exceed maximum contamination levels of L. monocytogenes, Salmonella and E. coli at the end of the shelf-life whereas organoleptic criteria corresponded to absence of statistical difference between pressurized and unpressurized products. A tradeoff between safety and hygienic risk, color and taste, was then applied to define process and formulation enabling shelf-life extension. In the resulting operating window, one condition was experimentally assayed on naturally contaminated RTC products to validate the multi-criteria approach. As a conclusion, the framework was validated; it was possible to extend the shelf-life of an RTC poultry product containing 1.8% (w/w) lactate by one week, despite slight color alteration. This approach could be profitably implemented by food processors as a decision support tool for shelf-life determination. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The stable isotope composition of molybdenum (Mo) and zinc (Zn) in mine wastes al the Antamina Copper-Zn-Mo mine, Peru, was characterized to investigate whether isotopic variation of these elements indicated metal attenuation processes in mine drainage. Waste rock and ore minerals were analyzed W identify the isotopic composition of Mo and Zn sources, namely molybdeniles (MoS2) and sphaleriles (ZnS). Molybdenum and Zn slable isotope ratios are reported relative W the NIST-SRM-3134 and PCIGR-1 Zn standards, respectively. delta Mo-98 among molybdeniles ranged from -0.6 to +0.6 parts per thousand (n = 9) while sphaleriles showed no delta Zn-98 variations (0.11 +/- 0.01 parts per thousand, 2 SD, n = 5). Mine drainage samples from field waste rock weathering experiments were also analyzed to examine the extent of isotopic variability in the dissolved phase. Variations spanned 2.2 parts per thousand. in delta Mo-98 (-0.1 to +2.1 parts per thousand) and 0.7 circle plus. in delta Zn-66 (-0.4 to -0.3 parts per thousand) in mine drainage over a wide pH range (pH 2.2-8.6). Lighter 666Zn signatures were observed in alkaline pH conditions, which was consistent with Zn adsorption and/or hydrozincite (Zn-5(OH)(6)(CO3)(2)) formation. However, in acidic mine drainage Zn isotopic compositions reflected the value of sphalerites. In addition, molybdenum isotope compositions in mine drainage were shifted towards heavier values (0.89 +/- 1.25 parts per thousand, 2 SD, n 16), with some overlap, in comparison to molybdeniles and waste rock (0.13 +/- 0.82 parts per thousand, 2 SD, n = 9). The cause of heavy Mo isotopic signatures in mine drainage was more difficult to resolve due to isotopic heterogeneity among ore minerals and a variety of possible overlapping processes including dissolution, adsorption and secondary mineral precipitation. This study shows that variation in metal isotope ratios are promising indicators of metal attenuation. Future characterization of isotopic fractionation associated to key environmental reactions will improve the power of Mo and Zn isotope ratios to track the fate of these elements in mine drainage.

AB  - Background: Subsurface ice preserved as ice lenses and within rock glaciers as well as glacial and lake ice provides sensitive indicators of climate change and serve as a late-season source of meltwater.
   Aims: We synthesise the results of geomorphological, geophysical and geochemical studies during the period of 1995-2014, building on a long history of earlier work focused on ice and permafrost studies on Niwot Ridge and the adjacent Green Lakes Valley (GLV), which is part of the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research Site.
   Methods: These studies are discussed in the context of how bodies of ice and rock glaciers reflect changing local climate. We review recent results from geophysical investigations (resistivity, seismic refraction and ground-penetrating radar) of the shallow subsurface, ongoing monitoring of the Arikaree Glacier, three rock glaciers and lake ice in the GLV, and interpretations of how subsurface ice melt regulates the flow and chemistry of alpine surface water after seasonal snowfields melt.
   Results and conclusions: Permafrost conditions reported from Niwot Ridge in the 1970s are generally absent today, but ice lenses form and melt seasonally. Ice is present permanently within the Green Lakes 5 rock glacier and at nearby favourable sites. The Arikaree Glacier has shown a marked decline in cumulative mass balance during the past 12years after a 30-year period when net mass balance was ca. 0. Duration of seasonal lake ice increases with elevation in GLV, but duration has decreased at all seven lakes that have been monitored during the last three decades. This decrease has been most marked at the lowest elevation where it amounted to a reduction of about 1dyear(-1) and least at Green Lake 5 where the loss has been at a rate of 0.5dyear(-1). Surface temperature measurements from rock glaciers have not shown strong trends during the past 15years. It has been suggested that almost all of the 2.5-mmyear(-1) increase in stream discharge from the upper GLV in September and October has been derived from melting of subsurface ice.

AB  - In years 1970-2002, in Poland forest damage zones were distinguished within the framework of forest management works. Since 2003 degrees of stand damage have been determined. This study presents basic characteristics of the methods employed for these purposes concerning the necessity to elaborate a new method of determination of degrees of stand damage.
   The establishment of forest damage zones and degrees of stand damage cannot be treated as one of the forms of monitoring because in order to determine their range, no observations on the permanent plots and - within their confines - on the same sample trees were and are carried out. Over the time, evaluation criteria or/and ways of establishment of the extent of damages have been undergoing considerable and significant methodological changes and modifications. In terms of dynamically altering quantitative and qualitative impact of different factors affecting forest environment, 10 years period of observation repeatability is far too long to use this information as an indicator of occurring changes. In practice, it was and it still is impossible to determine objectively trends and directions of changes taking place in a given object, which is one of the objectives of forest monitoring.
   The concept of damage zone should be understood not only as an area of grouping the stands of the same or similar damage, but, equally importantly, as those which happen to be under the influence of the same factor exerting its influence at the same level. Therefore, when determining the range of zones, the following three actions should be taken into consideration simultaneously: complex crown evaluation, dendrometric measurements and monitoring of the effect of the causative agent. In order to trace the trends of the changes on the study plots, the same sample trees must be subjected to evaluations and measurements. From the point of view of the time perspective, examinations should be carried out every 5 years (assessment of the crown condition and dendrometric measurements) or on a continuous basis (monitoring of the effect of the causative agent) irrespective of the forest taxation. It is also advisable to consider possible use of contemporary remote sensing techniques to determine the range of zones and degrees of damage, which preliminary can be used to establish the range, intensity and kind of the damages.

AB  - Climate change is expected to affect agricultural production in the coming decades, to which agriculture must adapt in order to maintain productivity and profitability. The effect of such changes on environmental impacts must be assessed, if the environmental goals of agriculture are also to be achieved in the future. We therefore assess the environmental impacts of adaptation scenarios previously developed with a purely economic perspective, for two case study regions in Switzerland. We use life cycle assessment at the whole-farm level, which enables the consideration of multiple environmental impact indicators, allowing us to identify potential trade-offs. We assess a simulated mixed livestock and arable crop farm representative of average farms in the two case study regions. The simulated farm is economically optimized for a reference scenario (current situation) and four future scenarios combining a climate change scenario representing a "worst case" change signal, and various price and policy scenarios. Results show that environmental impacts tend to increase in the future climate. Farms tend to extensify production, leading to a decrease in eco-efficiency, even more so if a decrease in agricultural product prices is assumed: socio-economic conditions may have even more influence than climate change, suggesting that there is a high potential for policy-makers to influence and mitigate the effects of climate change on agricultural productivity and the associated environmental impacts. The impacts of irrigation water use on aquatic biodiversity are revealed to be an important trade-off with farm economic optimization in the future. It is therefore recommended that aquatic biodiversity impacts be considered in assessments of agricultural adaptation to climate change. Policies directly targeting restriction of water use do not resolve this trade-off, although they do reduce impacts on aquatic biodiversity. Broader and more integrative policies are therefore required to support agricultural adaptation to the future climate while mitigating environmental impacts. In addition, different regions are found to react in a different way, suggesting that differentiated policies may be required for specific regions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We developed an advisory tool addressing 10 critical areas of calf and heifer management, including calving management, care to newborn calves and painful procedures, colostrum management, cow-calf separation, calf feeding, weaning, calf housing, heifer feeding, heifer housing, and general monitoring. Targets and indicators for each critical area were validated by a panel of experts and maximum scores were assigned based on experts' opinions and reviews of scientific literature. The tool was tested on 28 Quebec dairy farms for feasibility and repeatability between 2 observers. Farmers were asked to test colostrum quality, measure blood IgG concentrations, and record health events. The on-farm evaluation included an interview on management practices and an evaluation of conditions in the barn. Scorings and recommendations were discussed with producers. The usefulness of our on-farm welfare tool was evaluated by the producers themselves during a final debriefing. We reached the main goals of a successful advisory tool of calf and heifer management to improve welfare on dairy farms. We respected the targeted time limit of a 3-h visit covering all aspects of our tool including data collection on management and environment, scoring, practical demonstration with producers, and debriefing. We had no problems collecting management-and environment-based data and had high repeatability of qualitative environment-based measures (kappa value > 0.6). Our tool helped to detect problems and to discuss these problems with the producers; producers scored below 50% for some targets in calving management, care to newborn calves and painful procedures, colostrum management, and calf feeding. The targets were realistic so producers were not discouraged. All producers were convinced of the usefulness of our tool for identifying areas of calf and heifer management in need of improvement. They were also convinced of the usefulness of our tool as an advisory tool for technical advisors and veterinarians. Six months after the on-farm visit, recommended practices were implemented in many of these areas. Voluntary improvements in animal welfare can be facilitated by using appropriate tools to educate producers and help them change their attitudes toward calf management and animal welfare.

AB  - In Sahelian ago-ecosystems, sandy microdunes often provide a privileged habitat for primary production and can also be potential initial points for the regeneration of eroded surfaces. The aim of this study is to understand the role of sandy aeolian deposits in the retention of rain and runoff water on overgrazed Sahelian hillslopes. It focuses on the interactions between wind and water processes. Water is beneficial to the development of vegetation if it (i) infiltrates through soil surfaces; (ii) reaches a sufficient depth so that it does not rapidly evaporate; and (iii) is accessible to plant roots. In this study, the wetting-front depth (WFD) proved to be a relevant indicator of these three criteria. Investigations were conducted within three plots with surface area of 14,000, 376 and 36 m(2) and grids of observations of 4, 0.5 and 0.2 m, respectively. The largest plot was a micro-catchment patched with sandy aeolian deposits. The two other plots were isolated microdunes with a typical asymmetric shape. A cone penetrometer was used to estimate the WFD and survey its spatial variability. Soil surface conditions (micro-relief, plant cover, crusted areas) were also estimated following the typology of Casenave and Valentin (Casenave, A., Valentine, C., 1992. A runoff capability classification system based on surface features criteria in semi-arid areas of West Africa. Journal of Hydrology 130, 231-249). At the catchment scale, WFD values ranged from 0-0.82 m. The deepest infiltration occurred within sandy deposits which supported an herbaceous cover of > 50% (drying surface type) and along rills filled with coarse sands (runoff surface type). Minimum WED values were observed on bare crusted surfaces with gentle slopes (erosion surface type). At the microdune scale, the important penetration depths coincided with bare windward surfaces with steep slopes. This unexpected result seems to be due to the combined effect of wind deflation and splash erosion, which would hamper the development of impervious crusts. These results could have significant impacts for better understanding of rangeland sandy soil in semi-arid areas. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Viruses, including human pathogenic viruses, can persist in water. For producing drinking water from surface water via bank filtration, natural attenuation capacities and the fate of viruses during the passage of aquatic sediments are of particular interest. Moreover, the increasing frequency of extreme hydrological events necessitate re-evaluation of the sustainability and efficacy of processes removing viruses. For this purpose, we performed bank sediment filtration experiments using a mesocosm in a technical-scale experimental facility that simulates a field situation under more tightly controlled conditions. We used the bacteriophage MS2 as a surrogate for enteric viruses to study the transport of different viral loads through the bank sediment. Additionally, we simulated a heavy rain event to investigate the re-mobilization of initially attached virus particles. We quantified the abundance of infectious MS2 phages by plaque assay and the total number of MS2 particles by qPCR. Also, we differentiated pore water concentrations by depths of the sediment column and investigated attachment to the sediment matrix at the end of the individual experimental phases. Bank filtration over a vertical distance of 80 cm through sandy sediment revealed a virus removal efficiency of 0.8 log(10) for total MS2 particles and 1.7 log(10) for infectious MS2 particles, with an initial phage concentration of 1.84 x 10(8) gene copies mL(-1). A low load of infectious MS2 (1.9 x 10(6) plaque forming units mL(-1)) resulted in a greater removal efficiency (3.0 log(10)). The proportion of infectious MS2 phages of the total MS2 particle mass steadily decreased over time, i.e., in the course of individual breakthrough curves and with sediment depth. The simulated pulse of rainwater caused a front of low ionic strength water which resulted in pronounced phage remobilization. The high proportion of infectious MS2 among the detached phages indicated that attachment to the sediment matrix may substantially conserve virus infectivity. Therefore, the re-mobilization of previously attached viruses owing to hydrological extremes should be considered in water quality assessment and monitoring schemes.

AB  - This study aimed to analyze a heavy-duty tractor diesel engine operating on diesel-biodies-bioethanol blends using exergetic, economic, and environmental life cycle assessment analyses. Diesel was mixed with biodiesel and bioethanol with volumetric ratios of 5-15% and 2-6%, respectively. Nine diesel-biodiesel-bioethanol blends and one baseline fuel were tested at different PTO shaft speeds ranging from 800 to 1000 rpm under full load operating conditions. Various exergetic, economic, and environmental indicators were computed to facilitate decision-making on fuel composition and PTO shaft speed. In general, increasing biodiesel concentration in the fuel blend could improve the exergetic, economic, and environmental indicators of the system. However, there was no clear pattern of the effects of bioethanol on the investigated indicators. Interestingly, most of the prepared fuel blends were exergetically, economically, and environmentally superior to diesel. The lowest weighted environmental impact (52.1 mPts/GJ) and PTO shaft power generation cost (0.18 USD/kWh) were found for the fuel blend containing 10 vol% biodiesel and 4 vol% bioethanol at the PTO shaft speed of 1000 rpm. This fuel blend also showed the highest resource utilization efficiency (29.3%) and environmental sustainability (26.1%) at the PTO shaft speed of 1000 rpm. The weighted environmental impact and PTO shaft power generation cost of the selected fuel blend were 44.3% and 46.2% lower than those of diesel, respectively. The resource utilization efficiency and environmental sustainability of the selected fuel blend were 97.3% and 99.8% higher than those of diesel, respectively. Overall, substituting a portion of diesel with biodiesel and bioethanol was proved to be an attractive strategy from the exergetic, economic, and environmental perspectives. The results obtained can be valuable in practical applications to enhance the sustainability and viability of power production in agricultural activities. The applied exergetic, economic, and environmental methodologies appear to be reliable and comprehensive tools for assessing the whole-life sustainability and viability of mineral-biofuel blends.

AB  - The biogeomorphology of nebkha dunes, was investigated in the Fahraj Plain, which is located in southern part of the Lut Plain in southeastern Iran. Field investigations were performed to determine nature of nebkha dunes, whose genesis and growth involves the trapping of aeolian sand within the body of a plant. This study demonstrated that Tamarix, a shrub/tree in the Tamaricaceae family, has played a major role in reducing dust and sand storms in the region by trapping aeolian sediments and accumulating them in the form of nebkhas. In contrast, another tree/shrub that grows in the area, Prosopis cineraria (a variety of mesquite in the Fabaceae family), due to its structure seems not to have played an important role in aeolian sediment accumulation or in shaping any nebkha dunes in the area. Whereas previous investigations indicated that the highest nebkhas, which are located at the western margin of the Lut basin on the Takab plain, were no more than 12 m in height, our field investigations and measurements revealed that on the Fahraj plain there are nebkhas greater than 20 m in height. This would suggest that some of these nebkhas are among the largest and highest that have been reported in the world. Some were connected by rows of Tamarix and formed very long ridges more than 200 m in length. It seems that their form may be due to human activity.
   During our survey of nebkhas in the region we observed ongoing and increasing degradation in the nebkha field that we were examining. This seemed to be due to current climate variability and human impact. Investigation of the past climate of this region reveals that the Indian monsoon is and has been a major factor. Examination of this history also reveals the relationship between climate and sand movement in the region, and the inferred past history of nebkha dunes. Past analogue conditions from that history can provide a scenario of future nebkha evolution, and reveal if their current, ongoing degradation is a long-term trend or simply a short-term cycle.

AB  - Lipomatous myopathy is a degenerative muscle disease reported in Piedmontese cattle, characterized by the substitution of muscle cells with adipose tissue. The pathogenesis of this myopathy is still poorly understood, most likely its origin is multifactorial, with genetic and nutritional factors contributing to its development. In this work Authors performed histological and biochemical analyzes on samples taken from four different muscle types (vastus lateralis, biceps brachii, cutaneous trunci and cutaneous colli) from Piedmontese cattle, seven healthy animals and seven with lipomatous myopathy, aged fourteen to nineteen months. The animals were reared under the same environmental condition and fed at the same energy and protein level without vitamin E supplementation. None of the animals showed clinical signs of muscular disease and all were in an excellent state of nutrition. The seven affected animals were identified by macroscopic examination for the presence of infiltration of adipose tissue in multiple or individual muscles. Histological analysis of the tissue with lipomatous myopathy revealed infiltration of adipose tissue of various distribution and severity. Necrosis and non suppurative inflammatory cells were also seen. Furthermore, proliferation of connective tissue and non-specific myopathic changes, were present too. Biochemical analyzes of pathological tissue showed an increase in fatty acid content, in particular for monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and a marked decrease in vitamin E content compared to healthy tissue. As the activity of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), a rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids, has recently been shown to be a critical control point in the regulation of skeletal muscle lipid metabolism, and the desaturation indices for 18:0 and 16:0 fatty acids are considered indirect indicators of SCD, Authors calculated the mathematical indices for Delta (9)-desaturase C16 activity and for Delta (9)-desaturase C18 activity in total lipid extracts. As compared with the controls, in pathological samples the desaturation index was significantly higher. Currently, it is not possible to predict to what extent these changes can influence the organoleptic, technological, and nutritional characteristics of meat from cattle with lipomatous myopathy. Further study is needed to understand how these changes relate to meat quality and the pathogenesis of lipomatous myopathy.

AB  - Available literature indicates that fish are able to recognize familiar conspecifics and that familiarity may offer important benefits (e.g. more stable social environment, improved foraging behavior, growth, survival). In the practice of intensive rearing of European seabass Dicentrarchus labrax mixing of familiar and unfamiliar con specifics is very common following grading and fish with no previous contact with each other are forced to coexist. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether living with familiar or unfamiliar conspecifics is advantageous for European seabass. To mimic a grading procedure, two size classes were tested (small: 70.2 g and large fish: 96.2 g). Seventy two fish from mixed groups with prior nine-months familiarity were distributed, in groups of six, in twelve tanks to form familiar groups of small (FS) and large (FL) fish (fish selected from the same tank), and unfamiliar groups of small (US) and large (UL) fish (fish selected from six different tanks). All fish were individually marked and individual food consumption was used to rank individuals in the feeding hierarchy. Each treatment was triplicated and the experiment lasted for 75 days. Familiarity had no effect on fish growth performance. In all treatments a feeding hierarchy was established; fish of the highest feeding ranks had the higher mass and specific growth rate, consumed the majority of food offered with little daily variation and made more efforts to catch their food. This hierarchy was weaker in US compared to FS fish (lower correlation coefficients). Correlation coefficients between mean share of meal and coefficient of daily food consumption variation, which have been used as indicators of the strength of the social hierarchy, indicate US groups as the ones with the milder social environment. Familiarity effects on large fish social environment were minor The results of the present study suggest that, within the range of body mass examined, the mixing of unfamiliar conspecifics after performing a grading procedure is not indicated to be neither beneficial nor detrimental for European seabass productive traits. Moreover, milder social conditions seem to be established, at least in the smaller size class, which is of importance form the fish welfare point of view.

AB  - Manure and slurry may contain a range of bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens and land application of these organic fertilizers typically occurs without prior treatment. In-situ treatment through farm-based anaerobic digestion (AD) of such organic fertilizers co-digested with food-production wastes is multi-beneficial due to energy recovery, increased farm incomes and noxious gas reduction. Before risk assessment can be carried out at field scale an investigation of the fate of relevant target pathogens during the actual AD process must be undertaken, requiring the development of practical test systems for evaluation of pathogen survival. The present study examines miniature (50 mL) and laboratory (10 L) scale AD systems. Treatments included slurry co-digested with fats, oils, and grease (FOG) under typical operating and pasteurization conditions used in farm-based AD, in batch-fed miniature and laboratory mesophilic (37 degrees C) continuously stirred tank reactors. Biogas production, pH, chemical oxygen demand, volatile solids, and ammonia concentration were measured throughout the trial, as were fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) i.e., total coliforms, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus species. The miniature and laboratory bioreactors performed similarly in terms of physicochemical parameters and FIB die-off. In the absence of pasteurization, after 28 days, enterococci numbers were below the <1,000 cfu g(-1) threshold required for land application, while E. coli was no longer detectable in the digestate. For comparison, FIB survival in slurry was examined and after 60 days of storage, none of the FIB tested was <1,000 cfu g(-1), suggesting that slurry would not be considered safe for land application if FIB thresholds required for AD digestate were to be applied. Taken together we demonstrate that (i) miniature-scale bioreactors are valid proxies of farm-based AD to carry out targeted pathogen survival studies and (ii) in situ AD treatment of slurry prior to land application reduces the level of FIB, independently of pasteurization, which in turn might be indicative of a decreased potential pathogen load to the environment and associated public health risks.

AB  - Over the last few years a considerable spread of ethnic foods was observed in Italy. Among them is the Doner kebab. During 2014-2015, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of traditional cooking process, raw product (defrosted), sliced cooked portions cut through electric knife and assembled sandwich were officially sampled in kebab houses and in a local industrial kebab producer in Reggio Emilia (a province in Italy). Microbiological researches for safety and hygienic microbiological indicators were carried out (research of Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli; enumeration mesophilic aerobic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria, sulfite-reducing bacteria growing under anaerobic conditions, yeasts and molds). Between the raw and the cooked product an average of 3 log reduction in mesophilic aerobic bacteria counts was observed. In two out of three kebab houses sampled, which were supplied by the same local industrial producer, the presence of L. monocytogenes was detected. During the official inspection carried out at the production plant a contamination of L. monocytogenes was assessed in both ambient and instruments. Furthermore, 3 lots of products were analyzed and all were found to be contaminated by L. monocytogenes (always above 100 CFU/g). In order to verify the capability of the traditional cooking process to reduce the risk of contamination at an acceptable level, a batch of naturally contaminated kebab (4.5 log CFU/g) was cooked and sliced simulating a day work activity in a kebab shop. The product was then sampled during preparation and enumeration of L. monocytogenes was obtained. After an hour of cooking, the residual contamination was 1.8 log CFU/g, after two hours and a half L. monocytogenes was no longer detectable in the product, but half an hour later it was again detectable in 25g. At the end of the experiment, the contamination grown up to the same level enumerated after an hour of cooking (1.8 log CFU/g). Considering the microbiological results, traditional cooking obtained a rate of -2.40 log CFU/gh(-1), a D=26 min that corresponds to a temperature of maximum 60 degrees C (z=6). In conclusion, our experiment demonstrates the traditional kebab cooking process could not always guarantee a complete product decontamination.

AB  - The assessment of natural background levels (NBLs) is crucial in the management of groundwater resources and the definition of the status of groundwater bodies according to the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC. This work presents a new MATLAB code to assess NBLs by the component separation method, which concerns the identification and separation of a natural and an anthropogenic component within geochemical data. To increase the validity of the estimated NBL, the code calculates a set of possible solutions that should then be evaluated by the user. The following evaluation criteria are proposed: (i) stability of solution, (ii) hydrogeochemical reliability, (iii) agreement with the conceptual model and (iv) goodness of fit.
   The code is tested on groundwater Mn, Fe, As, Ni, Cr(VI) and NH4 concentrations observed in two study areas with different hydrogeological and geochemical features in northern Italy: the multi-layer aquifer of Cremona (lower Po Plain) and the alluvial aquifer of the Aosta Plain (western Alpine sector). The pre-selection method is also applied to estimate NBLs and threshold values are assessed.
   The NBLs calculated through the component separation method (4292, 27 and 1220 mu g/L for Fe, As and NH4 in Cremona and 56,261, 9 and 23 mu g/L for Mn, Fe, Ni and Cr(VI) in Aosta, respectively) approach those estimated by the pre-selection (2798, 25 and 1820 mu g/L for Fe, As and NH4 in Cremona and 52, 264, 10 and 1.8 mu g/L for Mn, Fe, Ni and Cr(VI) in Aosta, respectively). This outcome increases the validity of the estimated NBLs. The code showed versatile applicability in different contexts and conditions (e.g., different numbers of samples and monitoring points, different sampling networks). This work highlights the strength of the component separation method although some criticisms are pointed out, mainly related to the superimposition of a log-normal function for modeling the natural component.

AB  - The rearing environment of farmed animals can affect their behaviour when handled, and therefore needs to be taken into account when selecting for traits such as docility. Therefore, 126 German Landrace and Pietrain x German Landrace pigs were reared in two different production environments (barren (n = 47) or slightly enriched (n = 79)), both corresponding to commercial conditions. The marginal enrichment included the provision of more toys, an additional feeder type, and a larger number of conspecifics, while space allowance per pig remained equal. Pigs' responses to (a) a novel arena test (NAT), (b) a novel object test (NOT), and (c) weighing, were compared, together with the number of skin lesions (an indicator of aggressiveness). While the differences in behaviour in the NAT were not significant (p > 0.1), the differences in the other tests were significant. In the NOT enriched housed pigs contacted the novel object more frequently (p = 0.0124) and showed a tendency for a greater total duration of manipulating the novel object (p = 0.0641). Furthermore, the pigs housed in enriched environment were calmer at loading onto the scale (p = 0.0008), but more agitated on the scale (p < 0.0001). Barren housed pigs had more severe skin lesions (p = 0.0074). Correlations between scores from the behaviour tests and the daily weight gain were not significant. However, correlations between the behaviour patterns measured in the tests revealed that pigs which showed more activity in the NAT and NOT were also more active in the other tests. Results indicate that marginal changes in the housing environment affect the behaviour of the pigs. Overall, the activity of barren housed animals seemed to be reduced, as revealed by the behaviour tests. Therefore, the housing environment must be taken into consideration carefully when evaluating the behaviour or indicator traits such as skin lesions for selection purposes in pigs. In addition, results of the present study have implications for animal welfare, showing that marginal enrichment of rearing environment leads to changes in behaviour that may partially be related to improved cognitive and/or physical development of the pigs.

AB  - As the requirements of the Water Framework Directive ( WFD) and the US Clean Water Act ( USCWA) for the maintenance of microbiological water quality in 'protected areas' highlight, there is a growing recognition that integrated management of point and diffuse sources of microbial pollution is essential. New information on catchment microbial dynamics and, in particular, the sources of faecal indicator bacteria found in bathing and shellfish harvesting waters is a pre-requisite for the design of any 'programme of measures' at the drainage basin scale to secure and maintain compliance with existing and new health-based microbiological standards. This paper reports on a catchment-scale microbial source tracking ( MST) study in the Leven Estuary drainage basin, northwest England, an area for which quantitative faecal indicator source apportionment empirical data and land use information were also collected. Since previous MST studies have been based on laboratory trials using 'manufactured' samples or analyses of spot environmental samples without the contextual microbial flux data ( under high and low flow conditions) and source information, such background data are needed to evaluate the utility of MST in USCWA total maximum daily load ( TMDL) assessments or WFD 'Programmes of Measures'. Thus, the operational utility of MST remains in some doubt. The results of this investigation, using genotyping of Bacteroidetes using polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) and male-specific ribonucleic acid coliphage ( F + RNA coliphage) using hybridisation, suggest some discrimination is possible between livestock- and human-derived faecal indicator concentrations but, in inter-grade areas, the degree to which the tracer picture reflected the land use pattern and probable faecal indicator loading were less distinct. Interestingly, the MST data was more reliable on high flow samples when much of the faecal indicator flux from catchment systems occurs. Whilst a useful supplementary tool, the MST information did not provide quantitative source apportionment for the study catchment. Thus, it could not replace detailed empirical measurement of microbial flux at key catchment outlets to underpin faecal indicator source apportionment. Therefore, the MST techniques reported herein currently may not meet the standards required to be a useful forensic tool, although continued development of the methods and further catchment scale studies could increase confidence in such methods for future application.

AB  - We studied the impact of organic loads due to the biodeposition of a fish farm in a non-impacted coastal area of the Tyrrhenian Sea (Western Mediterranean). Sediment chemistry and benthic microbial community were investigated from July 1997 to February 1998 on monthly basis at two stations: one was located under the fish farm, while the second was about 1 km away, and served as a reference site. The presence of the cage induced rapid changes in the benthic conditions: the sediments were rapidly (after 6 weeks) reduced. A significant accumulation of biopolymeric carbon was observed beneath the cage both 2 weeks after the initial cage deployment, on non-impacted sediments, and 5-7 months after, and appeared to be related to the fish farm production cycle. The density of microbial communities beneath the fish farm increased only during the first month of farming activity (July) and partially 7 months after cage disposal (i.e. in January), when there was a significant sediment organic enrichment. Additional evidence of rapid impact of the fish farm on the benthic bacterial communities is provided by the increase in the numbers of autofluorescent microbial cells. The photosynthetic eukaryotic cells displayed a highly reduced contribution to total autofluorescent microbial density, indicating that their decrease is related with biopolymeric carbon accumulation, and probably was due also to "shadow effect" induced by suspended material, coming from the fish farm, on the environment below. We propose here, to apply the ratio of culturable heterotrophic bacteria to microbial direct counts (CFU/MDC) to detect fish farm impact. In cage sediments, organic enrichment and the consequent modification of the characteristics of the benthic environment, determined an increase in aerobic heterotrophic bacteria and vibrio density indicating, that they are efficient colonizers of organic-rich sediments. Densities of Escherichia coli and Enterococci were not significantly higher than in the reference site, and are likely of terrestrial origin. Thus they cannot be used as specific indicators of fish farm impact. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The experiments were carried our in the experimental nursery of the Crop Production Department of Pannon University of Agricultural Sciences, as part of the International Organic and Mineral Fertilisation Trials (Internationale Oganische Stickstoff Dauerversuch). The experiment was a cereal crop rotation planted in strips in three replications, with maize, winter wheat and winter barley as the indicator plants. The soil on the experimental area was a Ramann's brown forest soil poorly supplied with humus, but with moderate supplies of phosphorus and potassium.
   Studies were made on the effect of mineral fertilisation and of various combinations of organic and mineral fertilisers on the yields achieved by cereals grown in a crop rotation after several cycles. The results were evaluated using two-factor variance analysis.
   It was found that, averaged over 11 years, increasing rates of N fertiliser without organic manure led to maize yields of 5.53-7.39 t/ha, wheat yields of 2.10-4.71 t/ha and winter barley yields ranging from 2.98-4.90 t/ha under the given conditions.
   On control plots with no N fertiliser the yield of winter barley averaged 2.98 t/ha, which was 0.88 t/ha more than the yield of winter wheat. This indicates that winter barley is better able to utilise the natural nitrogen-supplying capacity of the soil than winter wheat.
   The yield of maize was greatest at a N rate of 70 kg/ha when stable manure was applied, while the maximum yield was obtained at 140 kg/ha N without stable manure.
   When only mineral fertilisers were applied, the yields of winter barley and winter wheat increased up to a rate of 120-150 kg/ha. The same yield level could be achieved with a N rate of 80-100 kg/ha if stable manure was also applied.
   The yield-increasing effect of stable manure was also felt in the second and third years, especially when lower N rates were applied.
   The results indicate that if stable manure is applied, the same yield levels can be achieved with 25-30% less mineral N fertiliser.
   It can be concluded from the experimental data that the application of stable manure and the ploughing in of plant residues (cereal straw, maize stalks) combined with mineral fertilisers represents an efficient form of fertilisation.

AB  - The Red-billed Chough, a species of conservation priority in Europe, is threatened by habitat encroachment, decline of pastoralism, heavy use of pesticides and disturbance by recreational activities. Its future greatly depends on the quality of its remaining habitat, particularly in mountains where no previous study has explored the effects of climate and snow condition on its populations. In the Gavarnie special protection area (9,300ha, Pyrenees National Park), a highly mountainous open landscape mainly covered by grassland, alpine moorland, screes and rocks, we compared the reproductive success of Red-billed Choughs during two very contrasted years, 2013 and 2014, in terms of snow phenology in spring. we also evaluated foraging habitat selection during the young rearing period. Habitat selection was estimated by modelling the probability, for 50 x 50m(2) spatial units sampled in the study area, of being observed to be used by choughs for foraging. Breeding success was much lower during the year with prolonged spring snow cover, especially at higher elevation: 11 breeding pairs were present, compared to 22 pairs during the following year when snow cover phenology was more typical. Nesting phenology was delayed by ten days in the year with prolonged snow cover. Variables that positively influenced the probability for choughs to use spatial units as feeding areas were mostly linked with the presence of low vegetation (herbaceous or mixed scrub and grassland areas, grazed areas), and the absence of snow (time of snow cover during study period, exposure to solar radiation, presence of wetlands). we suggest that snow cover at the end of the cold season can create a spatial mismatch between customary chough nest locations at high elevations and areas suitable for foraging. The consequence is a scarcity of nesting attempts and low breeding success in the mountainous areas during years with prolonged and high altitude snow cover in spring. we also use these results to suggest the potential for this species to be used as an indicator for the effects of changes in climate and pasture grazing practices.

AB  - China has embarked on a new round of power market reforms since 2015. Traditional power generation groups (TPGGs), as important practitioners of the electricity market, have taken various actions to adapt to the new market environment during recent years. Trading performance, the most manifestation of enterprise operation is evaluated in this paper, to help TPGGs explore transition strategies to improve business and achieve a sustainable development. Considering multiple factors influencing TPGG trading performance, a hybrid framework based on Multiple-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) under fuzzy rules is proposed. Meanwhile, to deal with the ambiguous language in the evaluation process, the fuzzy Delphi method is combined with triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs). Thus, twelve key indicators are selected, and the integrated evaluation index system is established. Then, a novel method combining Analytic Network Process (ANP) and Matter-Element Extension Cloud model (MEECM) is applied to evaluate the performance, which cover both fuzziness and randomness of the problem. In addition, an optimized cloud entropy algorithm considering the "3En"and "50% relevance"is implemented in MEECM. At further, through empirical analysis of five power generation companies in China, the proposed evaluation framework is verified. The results show that company A is the best, and more attention should be paid to the criteria related to market and support technology research (Z1), as well as trading capability and behavior (Z2). Finally, a series of sensitivity analyses have been conducted to examine the validity and effectiveness of the established evaluation framework and results. Meanwhile, some suggestions are put forward to improve trading performance for TPGGs. The study improves traditional cloud model and MCDM techniques. Therefore, it can help TPGGs track their course of actions during market reforms, and then take steps to enhance their management capabilities. On the other hand, it provides an effective means for market management agencies to evaluate market conditions through physical performance, to achieve a sustainable development of the power industry.

AB  - Introduction
   Maternal near-miss and maternal mortality cases have common characters, especially in terms of risk factors. Both of them are indicators of the quality of health care services provided to pregnant women. Our center is a tertiary care center in a rural area of western Uttar Pradesh (U.P.) so we get a large number of referred cases from most of the rural areas of western U.P. and the adjoining areas of other states too, which sometimes end up in mortality. Thus this study was planned to find out the incidence of maternal near-miss events and compare the nature of near-miss events with maternal mortality.
   Goal and objectives
   The main objectives of the study were to determine the frequency of maternal near-miss events, observe the trend of near-miss events, and compare the nature of near-miss events with maternal mortality.
   Materials and methods
   It was a retrospective study conducted in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Uttar Pradesh University of Medical Sciences (UPUMS), Saifai, Etawah, from July 2018 - June 2019, over a period of one year. Potentially life-threatening conditions and maternal mortalities were noted from the records of the hospital after taking ethical clearance from the institute. Near-miss cases were noted based on the Health and Family Welfare Government of India guidelines 2014. Data were collected and statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package of the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).
   Results
   The maternal near-miss incidence ratio was 16.6/1000 live births, the maternal near-miss to mortality ratio was 1.9:1, and the mortality index was 0.34%. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were the most common causes of near-miss events (45.8%) followed by hemorrhage (23.6%) in this study.
   Conclusions
   Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy and hemorrhage were the two leading causes of near-miss events and mortality followed by sepsis. As the near-miss analysis indicates, the quality of health care and causes are almost similar to maternal mortality, so its registry should be done along with maternal mortality.

AB  - The Dynamical-microphysical-electrical Processes in Severe Thunderstorms and Lightning Hazards (STORM973) project conducted coordinated comprehensive field observations of thunderstorms in the Beijing metropolitan region (BMR) during the warm season from 2014 to 2018. The aim of the project was to understand how dynamical, microphysical and electrical processes interact in severe thunderstorms in the BMR, and how to assimilate lightning data in numerical weather prediction models to improve severe thunderstorm forecasts. The platforms used in the field campaign included the Beijing Lightning Network (BLNET, consisting of 16 stations), 2 X-band dual linear polarimetric Doppler radars, and 4 laser raindrop spectrometers. The collaboration also made use of the China Meteorological Administration's mesoscale meteorological observation network in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Although diverse thunderstorm types were documented, it was found that squall lines and multicell storms were the two major categories of severe thunderstorms with frequent lightning activity and extreme rainfall or unexpected local short-duration heavy rainfall resulting in inundations in the central urban area, influenced by the terrain and environmental conditions. The flash density maximums were found in eastern Changping District, central and eastern Shunyi District, and the central urban area of Beijing, suggesting that the urban heat island effect has a crucial role in the intensification of thunderstorms over Beijing. In addition, the flash rate associated with super thunderstorms can reach hundreds of flashes per minute in the central city regions. The super (5% of the total), strong (35%), and weak (60%) thunderstorms contributed about 37%, 56%, and 7% to the total flashes in the BMR, respectively. Owing to the close connection between lightning activity and the thermodynamic and microphysical characteristics of the thunderstorms, the lightning flash rate can be used as an indicator of severe weather events, such as hail and short-duration heavy rainfall. Lightning data can also be assimilated into numerical weather prediction models to help improve the forecasting of severe convection and precipitation at the cloud-resolved scale, through adjusting or correcting the thermodynamic and microphysical parameters of the model.

AB  - A landscape stability assessment is made for the major islands of the Empress Eugenie Archipelago. The landscapes are ranked according to groups of stability on the basis of an integrated numerical score for 17 indicators. It was found that the islands are dominated by landscapes of moderate stability, and by unstable landscapes. The islands are characterized by a significant differentiation with respect to the areas of landscapes belonging in different groups of stability. This is due to the individual features in the landscape organization of the insular geosystems, and to the degree of their economic transformation. Results of cartographic and correlation analyses showed that a considerable contribution to the integrated indicator of landscape stability is made by the geomorphological structure of the territory, and by vegetation cover. However, correlation analysis did not reveal any unambiguous relationship with the other landscape components. This is accounted for by the natural factor (low-mountain relief) and a severe anthropogenic transformation of vegetation, leading to an attenuation of the relationship of the structure of vegetation cover with the other landscape components. A statistical investigation using principal component analysis (PCA) showed the role of the landscape components in the formation of the integrated indicator of stability of insular geosystems. The largest load is experienced by the geomorphological structure, followed by soil and vegetation cover. An individual analysis of island landscape stability by PCA revealed a variation in the loads on the indicators of landscape stability in principal components, which is due to the rate and direction of response of the insular geosystems on homogeneous factors. It is concluded that each insular geosystem has individual characteristics of the formation of an integral landscape matter-energy system, with an inherent set of self-regulation and selforganization mechanisms which arise in accordance with the area of land, physical-geographical conditions and the degree of anthropogenic pressure. Planning of a further development of the insular territories should take into consideration the individual characteristics of the functioning of landscapes and the role of their components in the formation of the integrated stability indicator.

AB  - Today, transportation is one of the most important and effective infrastructures and at the same time is the basis for development and adaptive development, and this has caused the attention of managers and planners to the category of transportation. But with regard to the focus of transport planners on accesses and other dynamic aspects of urban transport, its environmental impact has been severely neglected. The city of Petaling Jaya, as an important and religious-tourist metropolis, requires the use of an efficient way of organizing and managing transport, which is not in conflict with other sectors of development, especially the environment. The present research aims to achieve this goal for the first time in the field of study. In this research, after studying the sources, environmental indicators related to transportation were identified, and five important indicators were determined. Then, these indicators were located locally and using GIS maps of transportation network and utilities of Qom and with Bachelor's opinions are rated. In this way, the map of the Petaling Jaya network is networked, and the indicators in each cell are separately reviewed and rated from 1 to 9 for each indicator. To determine the final status of each cell, the results of the GIS are entered into the MATLAB software, and the results are derived using the genetic algorithm. In order to be able to achieve an optimal environmental situation, we need to make changes in the road network or change the locations that are more sensitive to transport pollution, the results of which are presented in the pictures featured in this paper. The results of this study showed that 40% of the network cells were in an inappropriate state, 35% in the state of appropriate, and 25% in an environmentally sound condition. The results from the optimal map of the transport network show that by transferring some of the uses, especially residential areas to areas around the city and with less pollution, there is a significant change in the status of cellular networks, in which cells with a score of 3 (inappropriate) and points 2 and 1 (relatively appropriate and appropriate) will change. Therefore, transferring parts of the city from the city to the surrounding area is a good way to reduce the impact of pollution.

AB  - The article focuses on the organization and methodology of the educational process of students with disabilities on the basis of an improved professional applied physical training. In Russia's higher education system, there is a clear trend towards the deterioration of students' health with a continuous increase in the number of students with disabilities, and among girls the incidence rate is 1.2 times higher. In higher education institutions, students with disabilities of temporary or permanent nature require a significant reduction in physical activity taking into account their performance and functionality; many are not fully ready to perform standard educational applied physical training. To improve the situation, applied physical education (APE) is crucial. APE is a pedagogical process of professional and applied physical training, during which students with disabilities sufficiently increase the range of adaptive body capabilities, form professionally important qualities and, as a result, professional adaptation. The method of stabilometry was used as APE criteria. This method studies the balance of the human body by tracking the quality of the equilibrium function, that is, the dynamics of applied motor skills development in people. Stabilometric indicators of students with disabilities were compared before and after the professional applied preparation phase. 39 students of the South Ural State University and 31 of the South Ural State Institute of Arts were tested. Following the experimental method, the stages of the educational process organization were implemented during classes twice a week to reduce the period of adaptation to physical loads and to increase motor preparedness. The first stage was educating and training of a person during general physical training via lectures, conversations, problem-based presentation of material, etc. The second stage was actualizing of students' body capabilities and individual features via professional and applied physical training. The third stage was independent performance of activity in the selected type of physical exercises which can be corrected, specified, modified. The results of the study indicate that stabilometric control in APE of in students with disabilities allows to timely and quickly identify the level of adaptive body capacity to physical activity, regardless of the factors and conditions of the selected professional activity.

AB  - Eolian deposition in China is intimately related to Asian desertification. The fine-grained sediments in the Cenozoic basins along the northeastern Tibetan Plateau are increasingly reported as eolian deposits due to their loess-like characteristics, thus extending the onset time of Asian desertification from the late Miocene to the early Miocene. However, the basin-scale stratigraphic correlation and geographic origin of these fine-grained sediments remain poorly investigated, limiting any interpretation of the transportation and paleoclimatic conditions responsible for their emplacement. This study combines analyses of detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology and heavy-mineral assemblages to present the first comprehensive stratigraphic and provenance study of Miocene sediments in the Tianshui Basin in northeastern Tibet. Comparison of results from 64 sand-sized and silt-sized samples from various sedimentary beds across the basin reveals that the main stratigraphic packages can be correlated basin-wide, confirming that the silt-sized sediments were a natural part of the basin fill. Statistical visualizations of the large data set from northern and western China clearly shows that the West Qinling Mountains are the main source of the Tianshui Basin silts. Contribution estimates corroborate this conclusion and eliminate the likelihood of substantial contributions from other mountains and drylands. Moreover, the significant differences between the Tianshui Basin silts and the Chinese Loess Plateau/Red Clay are reflected by their heavy-mineral compositions and euhedral zircon U-Pb ages. These provenance analyses strongly contradict the previous assumption of desert origin for the Tianshui Basin silts. Moreover, the northward transport of the Tianshui Basin silts conflicts with the prevailing dust pathway driven by the Asian westerlies and winter monsoons, which do not support the eolian interpretation for their formation. Consequently, we suggest that the Miocene Tianshui Basin silts cannot be used as an indicator of extensive desertification, in contrast with the suggestions of previous studies. This proposal undermines the corresponding hypothesis of an early Miocene onset of Asian interior desertification, and further raises questions about the validity of prevalent paleoclimatic interpretations drawn from fine-grained basin sediments.

AB  - Today, development of a Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) management system which can protect human resources and the environment, while remaining accountable for demands of the companies involved in the large and national projects, seems to be essential. Certificates issued for developing such management systems are an evidence for the claim on existence of HSE management systems. However, the question which still remains is whether the established systems have any real effect on the organization's performance in HSE management. Do the instruments designed to measure the performance of an HSE management system properly reflect the performance realities? This study seeks to measure the field performance of companies based on indicators of anomalies (reporting all cases of potential damage) and compare it with scores of HSE management system performance obtained by MCAT, in order to find out whether the companies having more robust management systems, especially those with a management certificate, gain better results in practice. A total of 24 contractor companies involved in construction of Phase 19 of South Pars were randomly selected from the statistical population and studied for 6months in terms of operating results and management system performance. The obtained results were analyzed using a statistical software. Comparisons between the two groups of companies (with and without a certificate) in terms of management system score indicated the superiority of the group with a certificate. The superiority, however, was negligible with a difference score of 3.69 compared to the total score of 200. Considering the incident indicator, the average severity rate of incidents in the companies with a certificate was lower than in the ones without a certificate. However, the abundance indicator and its level revealed a better condition in the companies without a certificate. Considering the number of the anomalies reported per one million total man-hours worked, the companies without a certificate (with 821.5 anomalies) superperformed the companies with a certificate (with 937.8 anomalies). The number of lost working days to close each anomaly per one million total man-hours worked was calculated to be 283.9 lost working days for the companies with a certificate and 317.1 working days for the companies without a certificate, showing the better performance of the companies with a certificate.

AB  - Grain size proxies of aeolian dust deposits have widely been applied in environmental and sedimentary studies. However, large body of research papers are not taking into consideration that a complex grain size distribution curve cannot be an indicator of a single one environmental factor (e.g. wind speed/strength, transportation distance, aridity).
   The aim of the present paper is to discuss the main differences of frequently used statistical methods and to provide possible interpretations of the results by applying these various approaches on the high-resolution loess-paleosol profile of Dunaszekcso, South Hungary (Central Europe). Beside single statistical descriptors (mean, median, mode) of grain size and simple indices of size-fraction ratios (U-ratio, Grain Size Index), some more complex algorithms were also used in our paper. The applied parametric curve-fitting, end-member modelling and hierarchical cluster analysis techniques are using the whole spectrum of the measured grain size distributions and provide a more reliable and more representative results even in case of small scale variations.
   According to our findings, approaches which provide direct linkage among simple statistical descriptors and single atmospheric or other environmental elements are rather oversimplified as properties aeolian dust deposits are influenced by the integrated effects of several concurrent processes. Differences of more complex decomposition methods arise from the different approach and scope. End-members are determined from the unmixing based on the covariance structure of the whole grain size data-series of the section, while the parametric curve-fitting is based on the one-by-one deconvolution of the grain size distribution curves. End-members of loess-paleosol samples are regarded as representation of the average dust grain size distribution of various temporal sediment clusters of seasonal or other short-term intervals, while (sub) populations by parametric curve-fitting are proposed to illustrate process-related elements of background and dust storm depositional components for each sample. Results of cluster analysis represent similar grouping conditions as end-member modelling with a reduced sedimentary and genetically meaning. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

AB  - The author analyses materials of the youth periodicals in Latvian "Jaunais komunists", "Jauni celi", "Mazais kolektivists", "Darba berni" published in 1920s-1930s. These periodicals are very interesting as sources on the history of the Latvian Diaspora in the USSR between two world wars, being an indicator of ideological education and of the specific fetchers of school education of young Latvians. These periodicals were intended for young people of different ages and were published in different years. "Jaunais komunists", published in 1919-1921, was the periodical for Latvian members of the Young communist league, who took part in the Civil war, they intended to continue the world proletarian revolution and to establish Soviet power in Latvia. Periodical "Jauni celi" was published in 1925-1928, its readers were mainly schoolchildren - young communists and pioneers. Its content included materials that formed young people's public and political views within the framework of Marxist-Leninist ideology and urged teenagers to participate in the construction of socialism as helping communists to sovietize different layers of the Latvian population in the USSR. Besides, this periodical aimed young people to preserve their national identity, although focusing mainly on the proletarian culture. "Darba berni" and "Mazais kolektivists" were published in 1930s. These periodicals were firstly intended as educational literature for Latvian schools and contained materials on various school subjects. Still, at the forefront was put Communist education of the schoolchildren, who had to be ready to participate in the "struggle" for building socialism. Besides, Soviet Latvian children had to be sure in the indispensable victory of the proletarian revolution in Latvia. The publication of youth periodicals in Latvian in the conditions of the natural process of assimilation of a part of Latvians living among Russian people, was carried out in the context of the Soviet national policy of preservation Latvians as a nation in the USSR, as they were considered by Communist leaders as the advance party of builders of socialism in Latvia after the victory of the proletarian revolution there. The beginning of Stalin's repressions and the change of national policy in the country were accompanied by the closure of all periodicals in Latvian in the USSR, including Latvian youth periodicals.

AB  - Antimony (Sb) usually occurs associated with arsenic, lead, and other metal elements in sulfide deposits, and most is currently being extracted from the Karst areas, southwest China. In these areas, the acid generated from the oxidative dissolution of sulfide minerals is neutralized by the abundant carbonates but little is known about the effect of this process on the geochemical behavior of Sb and other contaminants. In this study, physicochemical properties (pH, EC) and the trace elements (Sb, As, Cu, Pb, Zn, Sr, etc.) concentrations in waters from mining-impacted Karstic environments were determined in order to determine their distribution and migration potential. It was found that pH values ranged from 6.51 to 9.82, and EC values varied from 369 to 1705scm(-1) in river water samples. Waters of various types such as adit waters, flotation drainage, leaching waters, and river waters all contained high concentrations of dissolved trace elements, reaching up to 5475gL(-1)Sb, 1877gL(-1)As, 10,371gL(-1)Zn, 1309gL(-1) Pb, 46gL(-1) Cu, and 1757gL(-1) Sr. The elevated concentrations of dissolved Sr indicated that Sr could be considered as an indicator of oxidative dissolution of sulfide minerals in the Karst rivers. A proportion of the trace elements were removed in the streams in the vicinity of the mine due to adsorption onto particulate matter, whereas migration of trace elements in the downstream of mine area was attributed to dispersion in dissolved forms. Strontium and Sb have a strong hydrophilicity compared to the other elements analyzed; in contrast, Pb had a high affinity for suspended particulate matter (SPM). It was also found that downstream sediments had elevated concentrations of mining-derived trace elements, but there was a significant decrease in concentration of contaminants in aqueous phase, suggesting that contaminant behavior was conservative in the water-sediment systems under the oxic conditions prevailing in these waters. There was a good correlation between Sb and As in water-SPM-sediment system, indicating that Sb and As are homologous in water environment of the study area.

AB  - Donor milk is the best alternative for the feeding of preterm newborns when mother's own milk is unavailable. For safety reasons, it is usually pasteurized by the Holder method (62.5 degrees C for 30 min). Holder pasteurization results in a microbiological safe product but impairs the activity of many biologically active compounds such as immunoglobulins, enzymes, cytokines, growth factors, hormones or oxidative stress markers. High-temperature short-time (HTST) pasteurization has been proposed as an alternative for a better preservation of some of the biological components of human milk although, at present, there is no equipment available to perform this treatment under the current conditions of a human milk bank. In this work, the specific needs of a human milk bank setting were considered to design an HTST equipment for the continuous and adaptable (time-temperature combination) processing of donor milk. Microbiological quality, activity of indicator enzymes and indices for thermal damage of milk were evaluated before and after HTST treatment of 14 batches of donor milk using different temperature and time combinations and compared to the results obtained after Holder pasteurization. The HTST system has accurate and simple operation, allows the pasteurization of variable amounts of donor milk and reduces processing time and labor force. HTST processing at 72 degrees C for, at least, 10 s efficiently destroyed all vegetative forms of microorganisms present initially in raw donor milk although sporulated Bacillus sp. survived this treatment. Alkaline phosphatase was completely destroyed after HTST processing at 72 and 75 degrees C, but gamma-glutamil transpeptidase showed higher thermoresistance. Furosine concentrations in HTST-treated donor milk were lower than after Holder pasteurization and lactulose content for HTST-treated donor milk was below the detection limit of analytical method (10 mg/L). In conclusion, processing of donor milk at 72 degrees C for at least 10 s in this HTST system allows to achieve the microbiological safety objectives established in the milk bank while having a lower impact regarding the heat damage of the milk.

AB  - The historical record of the spatial distribution, source, occurrence, and ecotoxicology of organic matter deposited in the past 100 years was investigated in a sediment core from an urban lake, in central China by analyzing different organic targets. These targets included total organic carbon (TOC), n-alkanes, representative petroleum biomarkers of terpanes and steranes, non-alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and their alkylated congeners (APAHs).
   Three sediment cores were collected from East Lake (Wuhan, China) in September 2013. The freeze-dried samples were Soxhlet extracted and cleaned up/fractionated into saturated and aromatic fractions. Gas chromatography equipped with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to analyze the specific target groups. The TOC content of sediment was determined by an elemental analyzer after the freeze-dried sediments were pre-treated with 1 mol L-1 HCl to remove carbonate.
   The impact of human activities has become more serious since the 1960s as determined by analyzing the historical records of the measured parameters, due to the isolation of the study water body from the Yangtze River and the development of the local social economy. Higher plant wax was the major source of the identified n-alkanes; non-alkylated PAHs were more abundant than their alkylated congeners over the past 100 years. The source identification of n-alkanes, petroleum biomarkers, and PAHs suggested that the mixed sources, including biogenic and petrogenic input, and the incomplete combustion of biomass/solid fossil fuel have contributed to the organic matter in the study lake. The toxicity assessment suggested the presence of PAHs would not cause potential toxicity to the benthic organisms.
   The historical record of organic matter with different molecular compositions reflects the hydrodynamic condition of the study lake and the development of the local social economy. The mixed biogenic, pyrogenic, and petrogenic sources have contributed to the lake sediments. The detected PAHs did not have negative impacts to benthic organics. This study will provide valuable information to control organic contamination and guide potential remediation technologies in the future.

AB  - This study deals with the spatiotemporal dynamics of CO2 and its isotopic composition (delta C-13-CO2) in the atmosphere of Altamira Cave (northern Spain) over two annual cycles. In general terms, the cavity shows two distinct ventilation modes, acting as a CO2 reservoir from October to May (recharge stage), while actively exchanging gases with the outside atmosphere between July and September (discharge stage). In recharge mode, the in-cave air shows higher and relatively homogeneous CO2 values (3332 +/- 521 ppm) with lower and relatively more variable (1383 +/- 435 ppm) and accompanied by higher delta C-13-CO2 (up to delta C-13-CO2 (-23.2 +/- 0.4 parts per thousand). In contrast, during the discharge stage, the CO2 concentrations are -12 parts per thousand). This seasonal pattern is controlled by the distinct rates of exchange of air masses with the external atmosphere through the annual cycle, as well as by changes in the production of CO2 in the soil and natural fluctuations in the concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon transported by drip water into the cave. In contrast to the interpretations of previous studies in Altamira Cave, no local air intakes into the deepest cave sections were flagged by our delta C-13 measurements. This finding is also supported by analyses of CO2 and Rn-222 in air, density of airborne particles and air temperature. In addition, preliminary experiments examining the visitor-produced disturbances on delta C-13-CO2 were conducted during the various cave ventilation stages to explore the potential use of this parameter as an indicator of anthropic pressure in caves. Our data show that visits (overall stay of 60-85 min; i.e., 4 people for 20 min) significantly affected delta C-13-CO2 (up to Delta delta C-13 similar to -2 parts per thousand) in the Polychrome Hall of Altamira Cave under conditions of low natural CO2 (discharge stage), whereas it remained almost unaltered under circumstances of high CO2 concentration (recharge stage). This demonstrates that delta C-13-CO2 is sensitive to perturbations produced by visitors during certain periods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Assessing unconsciousness is important to safeguard animal welfare shortly after stunning at the slaughter plant. Indicators that can be visually evaluated are most often used when assessing unconsciousness, as they can be easily applied in slaughter plants. These indicators include reflexes originating from the brain stem (e.g. eye reflexes) or from the spinal cord (e.g. pedal reflex) and behavioural indicators such as loss of posture, vocalisations and rhythmic breathing. When physically stunning an animal, for example, captive bolt, most important indicators looked at are posture, righting reflex, rhythmic breathing and the corneal or palpebral reflex that should all be absent if the animal is unconscious. Spinal reflexes are difficult as a measure of unconsciousness with this type of stunning, as they may occur more vigorous. For stunning methods that do not physically destroy the brain, for example, electrical and gas stunning, most important indicators looked at are posture, righting reflex, natural blinking response, rhythmic breathing, vocalisations and focused eye movement that should all be absent if the animal is unconscious. Brain stem reflexes such as the cornea reflex are difficult as measures of unconsciousness in electrically stunned animals, as they may reflect residual brain stem activity and not necessarily consciousness. Under commercial conditions, none of the indicators mentioned above should be used as a single indicator to determine unconsciousness after stunning. Multiple indicators should be used to determine unconsciousness and sufficient time should be left for the animal to die following exsanguination before starting invasive dressing procedures such as scalding or skinning. The recording and subsequent assessment of brain activity, as presented in an electroencephalogram (EEG), is considered the most objective way to assess unconsciousness compared with reflexes and behavioural indicators, but is only applied in experimental set- ups. Studies performed in an experimental set-up have often looked at either the EEG or reflexes and behavioural indicators and there is a scarcity of studies that correlate these different readout parameters. It is recommended to study these correlations in more detail to investigate the validity of reflexes and behavioural indicators and to accurately determine the point in time at which the animal loses consciousness.

AB  - The Cascade Range in the northwestern U.S. acts as an orographic barrier to the easterly movement of humid air masses from the Pacific Ocean, producing a massive rain shadow with arid to semi-arid climate conditions on the leeward side of the range. Pedogenic carbonates formed in the C-3-dominated landscapes east of the range have delta C-13(carbonate) that is enriched by approximately 4 parts per thousand relative to carbonates formed in sub-tropical C-3-dominated ecosystems. We measured stable isotopic compositions of pedogenic carbonates preserved in the Quaternary and Neogene sedimentary rock units in the inland Pacific Northwest, and examined the impact of long-term aridification and paleohydrology on their isotopic compositions. The determined delta C-13(carbonate) record shows a gradual increase of 5 parts per thousand from approximately -10 parts per thousand in older pedogenic carbonates to -5 parts per thousand in younger ones whereas delta O-18(carbonate) record indicates a decrease of approximately 4 parts per thousand in the late Neogene. In addition, the Quaternary delta C-13(carbonate) and delta O-18(carbonate) records indicate the highest delta C-13 and delta O-18 among the samples during the Pleistocene and significant fluctuation over the time period. The gradual increase in the delta C-13(carbonate) ate and the decrease in the delta O-18(carbonate) in the late Neogene are interpreted by the development of the rain shadow as a result of topographic development of the Cascade Range. Changes in the Quaternary isotope records suggest a decrease in regional precipitation and isotopically depleted winter precipitation, resulting from changes in large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns due to advance and retreat of northern hemisphere continental ice sheet. The isotope record from pedogenic carbonates provides a direct record of climatic change, suggesting that long-term carbon isotope data can provide useful constraints on timing and intensity of regional desertification, and its associated climate and topographic interaction.

AB  - In this study 635 lactic acid bacteria of food origin were evaluated for their potential application as protective cultures in foods. A stepwise selection method was used to obtain the most appropriate strains for application as protective cultures in chicken meat. Specifically, all strains were examined for antimicrobial activity against various Gram positive and Gram negative pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. Strains exhibiting anti-bacterial activity were subsequently examined for survival in simulated food processing and gastrointestinal tract conditions, such as high temperatures, low pH, starvation and the presence of NaCl and bile salts. Selected strains where then examined for basic safety properties such as antibiotic resistance and haemolytic potential, while their antimicrobial activity was further investigated by PCR screening for possession of known bacteriocin genes. Two chosen strains were then applied on raw chicken meat to evaluate their protective ability against two common food pathogens, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enteritidis, but also to identify potential spoilage effects by the application of the protective cultures on the food matrix. Antimicrobial activity in vitro was evident against Gram positive indicators, mainly Listena and Brochothrix spp., while no antibacterial activity was obtained against any of the Gram negative bacteria tested. The antimicrobial activity was of a proteinaceous nature while strains with anti-listerial activity were found to possess one or more bacteriocin genes, mainly enterocins. Strains generally exhibited sensitivity to pH 2.0, but good survival at 45 C, in the presence of bile salts and NaCl as well as during starvation, while variable survival rates were obtained at 55 C. None of the strains was found to be haemolytic while variable antibiotic resistance profiles were obtained. Finally, when the selected strains Enterococcus faecium PCD71 and Lactobacillus fermentum ACA-DC179 were applied as protective cultures in chicken meat against L monocytogenes and S. enteritidis respectively, a significantly reduced growth of these pathogenic bacteria was observed. In addition, these two strains did not appear to have any detrimental effect on biochemical parameters related to spoilage of the chicken meat. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The influence of three different environmental temperatures (ET) was assessed during the rearing of broiler chickens from two commercial stocks (A and B), as well as their influence on the mortality per ascitic syndrome (AS) and productive indices. The work was developed during the summer (June-July) in a poultry farm in Mexico, at 1980 m a.s.l. Three thousand chicks (females and males) of one day of age were used (1500 of stock A and 1500 of stock B), being kept in production until 46 d of age. They were distributed according to complete random design in a factorial arrangement (2 stocks x 3 different ET), with five repetitions of 100 chicks each. There were differences (P < 0.01) between the environments in the average of ET 27.31, 28.77, and 25.13 degrees C for the enviroments 1, 2 and 3 respectively. There was no effect of interaction (P < 0.05) between the environments and the stocks, in respect to the productive indices and the mortality. At the end of the production time, the birds subject to enviroment 2 with a lower time in cold environment (234), higher time in comfort conditions (198), and higher time in hot environment (240) had (P < 0.01) lower incidence of the AS (4.0, 6.75 and 10.6 %) and lower general mortality (9.60, 15.87 and 21.4 %). There were differences (P < 0.01) in feed intake (4429,4283, and 4343 g) and feed conversion (1.85, 1.74, and 1.75 g/g) between the microclimates, the best averages corresponded to the treatments with more comfort hours and more time at cold. The mortality due to the acitic syndrome (3.85 vs 10.42 %), as well as the general mortality (13.14 vs 18.07 %) differed between stocks (P < 0.01), but with similar productive indicators. According to the results, it was concluded that the genetic factor was determinant. The obtainment of lines with lower trend to have AS and keeping the birds in the rearing with comfort temperatures is and easy and profitable tool to decrease the incidence of the AS, besides the advantage of having better productive indices.

AB  - Composting is a popular means of treating organic wastes, and properly controlled composting can destroy the pathogenic microorganisms present in wastes for a human- and environment-friendly end product. Therefore, optimization of windrow composting of food waste, manure, and bulking agents was evaluated for maximum pathogen inactivation (Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7). Seasonal effects on reductions of Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7 according to the compost temperatures were studied (90 to 150 days). Fecal coliforms and fecal streptococcus were also monitored during composting. The most probable number (MPN) method was used for enumerating both indicator and pathogenic microorganisms. The results of this study indicated that seasonal differences caused significant effects on the peak temperatures and the duration of high thermophilic temperatures (>= 55 degrees C) of windrows. Winter conditions resulted in inconsistent inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms including regrowth to high values during several time intervals. The reduction levels of Salmonella spp. and E. coli O157:H7 ranged from initial ranges of 377-483 MPN/g to final ranges of 6-150 MPN/g in whiter and to <= 0.3 MPN/g in summer It was also observed that summer composting resulted in a better correlation (r(2) > 0.90) between the number of fecal coliforms and the pathogenic microorganisms (Salmonella spp. and E. coli O157:H7). Fecal streptococcus was only slightly reduced in the majority of the trials from 377-483 MPN/g to 221-514 MPN/g in winter and from 365-460 MPN/g to a range of 11-265 MPN/g in summer Extreme Vertices Mixture Design (EVMD) analysis suggested an optimum mixture as: 43.3% food waste, 28.3% manure, and 28.3% bulking agents. The performance of the optimum mixture has been validated, achieving a high level of inactivation of pathogens similar to that with previous trials, with good correlations of fecal coliforms to the pathogens of interest, but with a high resistance of fecal streptococcus to inactivation. It was concluded that the EVMD design was successful in optimizing mixture components for windrow composting in order to achieve maximum pathogen reduction.

AB  - 1 Local plant communities can only function within a metacommunity context if they are connected by appropriate dispersal vectors, accommodating the transport of propagules between sites. The capacity for long-distance dispersal may be a key factor in the survival of local populations, especially in fragmented landscapes, and hence may have a large impact on local species composition. Dispersal vectors with a large efficiency for long-distance dispersal included in this study are: water, wind, large mammals and birds.
   2 We tested the hypothesis that variation in dispersal traits across plant communities is related to the position of the communities along major environmental gradients. This hypothesis was tested for (i) separate long-distance dispersal vectors and (ii) multiple dispersal vectors (the number of potential long-distance dispersal vectors per species).
   3 To quantify linkages between dispersal traits and environmental gradients, we coupled a data base containing dispersal attributes with another data base, containing 40 000 local vegetation descriptions aggregated into 123 plant communities. For each dispersal vector, the proportions of species that have access to this vector per community (weighted trait scores) were projected along three major environmental gradients: soil moisture, nutrient availability and light availability.
   4 The potential importance of individual dispersal vectors showed clear differences along the three environmental gradients, with the greatest differences along the light availability gradient. The differences in dispersal traits probably reflect environmental constraints on the availability or efficiency of individual dispersal vectors.
   5 The ability to be dispersed by multiple dispersal vectors is a common phenomenon in most plant communities (an average of 2.15 vectors per species). The mean number of potential long-distance dispersal vectors per species increases with light availability. This probably implies that plant communities differ in their response to both habitat fragmentation and habitat restoration.
   6 Despite differences in trait spectra among communities, all dispersal syndromes are represented in nearly all communities. An important consequence of this complementarity in dispersal traits is that species within the same community may experience different connectivity.
   7 The results emphasize the need for dispersal models based upon multiple dispersal vectors that explicitly include parameters for habitat characteristics.

AB  - The fatty acid composition of 6 Arctic and 14 Antarctic macroalgae species (Rhodophyta, Phaeophyta and Chlorophyta) from Kongsfjorden (west Spitsbergen, Arctic) and King George Island (Antarctic Peninsula) was investigated. The macroalgae were cultivated in nutrient-enriched seawater at low temperatures (0 to 5degreesC) and light conditions similar to natural irradiance. The most abundant fatty acids in the Arctic and Antarctic Rhodophyta were generally 20:5(n-3) and 16:0. The Arctic Palmaria palmata and the Antarctic Audouinella purpurea were characterised by very high proportions of 20:5(n-3) (67.3 and 60.3%, respectively). Other important fatty acids were 16:1(n-7) and 20:4 (n-6). Two species were dominated by 20:4 (n-6) (Phycodrys rubens, 35.3 % and Delesseria lancifolia, 31.1 %). In Ptilota gunneri and Rhodymenia subantarctica, 16:1 (n-7) accounted for 39.9 and 32.7 %, respectively. In the Phaeophyta, the major polyunsaturated fatty acids were 18:4(n-3), 20:5(n-3) and 20:4(n-6) followed by 18:3(n-3) and 18:2(n-6). The principal saturated fatty acid was 16:0. A high percentage of the uncommon monounsaturated fatty acid 16:1(n-5) (11.1 %) was found in Desmarestia muelleri sporophytes. Their gametophytes exhibited only traces of this component, but instead had double the amount of 18:2(n-6) and 18:3(n-3). The Arctic chlorophyte Prasiola crispa and the Antarctic Lambia antarctica had fatty acid compositions dominated by the polyunsaturated fatty acids 18:3(n-3) and 18:2(n-6). In L. antarctica, 18:1 (n-7) was present at higher levels than 18:2(n-6). The clear differences in fatty acid compositions of these 3 taxa are probably due to their different evolutionary position. The high proportions of 20:5(n-3) in the Rhodophyta reflect a 'marine'-like character and hence the phylogenetically oldest lineage. The Chlorophyta comprise the most 'modern' group and this is supported by primarily C-18 unsaturated fatty acids typical of the vegetative tissue of higher plants. The fatty acid composition of the Phaeophyta support their intermediate position. The clear differences between the macroalgal taxa, and also variations between species, make fatty acids a potential tracer for studies of food-web interactions.

KW  - STEAM STERILIZATION
AB  - The EG-GMP Guideline requires validation for all sterilisation processes; particular attention should be given when the adopted sterilisation method is not described In the current edition of the European Pharmacopoeia. Furthermore it is required that for any sterilisation process its suitability for the product and its efficacy In achieving the desired sterilisation conditions in all parts of the load should be demonstrated by physical measurement and by biological Indicators where appropriate. Biological indicators which are described in the pharmacopeia for monitoring moist heat sterilisation processes are spores of Bacillus stearothermophilits with a certain spore population and resistance against the sterilising agent. When the F-0 concept of the Pharmacopoeia comes into operation it should be demonstrated that the spores of the biological indicator mentioned above are inactivated in the same magnitude as they would be inactivated with the standard sterilisation cycle mentioned in the Pharmacopoeia (121 degreesC/15 min). This demonstration can only be proven successfully, when, beside the certified spore population and the resistance (D-value at a temperature of 121 degreesC), the germ-specific z-value (in degreesC) is known. The latter value has to be determined experimentally in most cases, as it is not certified by the supplier. With the known z-value equivalent lethalities according to the equation L = 10((T-T0)/z) Can be determined and the necessary sterilisation time for sterilisation temperatures lower than 121 degreesC can be adopted accordingly (for sterilisation temperatures higher than 121 degreesC the germ-specific z-value is approximately 10 degreesC so that the F-0 concept as described in the pharmacopoeia can be directly employed in these cases). When it can be demonstrated experimentally that Bacillus stearothermophilits spores are inactivated in the same manner as they are inactivated with sterilisation temperatures of 121 degreesC (and shorter sterilisation times) the efficiency of the F-0 concept is demonstrated and the respective requirements of the EG-GMP Guideline are fulfilled.
   This fulfillment could be proven experimentally. Examples of this experimental proof are mentioned in this paper and thus it is demonstrated that the pharmacopoeial F-0 concept with temperatures lower than 121 degreesC can be successfully validated using spores of Bacillus stearothermophilus.

AB  - Training studies extend developmental research beyond single-session lab tasks by evaluating how particular experiences influence developmental changes over time. This methodology is highly interactive and typically requires experimenters to have easy, in-person access to large groups of children. When constraints were placed on in-person data collection due to the COVID-19 pandemic, administering this study format in the conventional manner became unfeasible. To implement this type of research under these new circumstances, we devised an alternative approach that enabled us to conduct a live, multi-session training study using a diverse array of activities through an online interface, a task necessitating creative problem solving, since most existing remote methodologies either rely on unsupervised methods or have been limited to single sessions and restricted to a limited number of tasks. The current paper describes the technological and practical adaptations implemented in our online training study of 118 4- and 5-year-old children from a geographically diverse sample. An experimenter interacted with the children once a week for 5 weeks over Zoom. The first and final sessions were dedicated to collecting baseline and post-test measures, while the intermediate 3 weeks were structured as a training designed to teach children specific spatial-cognitive and visuo-motor integration skills. The assessments and training contained image-filled spatial tasks that experimenters shared on their screen, a series of hands-on activities that children completed on their own device and on paper while following experimenters' on-screen demonstrations, and tasks requiring verbal indicators from the parent about their child's response. The remote nature of the study presented a unique set of benefits and limitations that has the potential to inform future virtual child research, as our study used remote behavioral methods to test spatial and visuo-motor integration skills that have typically only been assessed in lab settings. Results are discussed in relation to in-lab studies to establish the viability of testing these skills virtually. As our design entailed continual management of communication issues among researchers, parents, and child participants, strategies for streamlined researcher training, diverse online recruitment, and stimuli creation are also discussed.

AB  - Correlation and regression dependences between the main chemical indicators of dry biomass of Lotus corniculatus L. (cv. ,Leo') and Festuca rubra L. (cv. ,Ryder'), treated with Lumbrical and Lumbrex biofertilizers. The survey was conducted in the experimental field of the Research Institute of Mountain Stockbreeding and Agriculture - Troyan to assess the quality and nutritional value of legume and grass species, under no irrigated conditions and vegetative introduction of biological products. They are a result of the processing of organic waste through the red earthworm (Lumbricus rubellis) and the application of modern biotechnology. High correlation dependence was found between the height of treated grasslands and the crude protein content, hemicellulose and cellulose. The correlation coefficients between the indicators are: r = 0.91, r = 0.64 and r = 0.69 (in bird's-foot-trefoil) and r = 0.74, r = 0.96 and r = 0.73 (in red fescue). The imported biological products increased dry matter digestibility for both forage crops. The regression dependence is statistically proven both for the percentage share of leaves (R-2 = 0.354) and the mineral content (R-2 = 0.777) for bird's-foot-trefoil, and the height of the grassland (R-2 = 0.897), crude protein (R-2 = 0.820), crude fats (R-2 = 0.696) and hemicellulose (R-2 = 0.955) in the dry forage matter of red fescue. Analyzed data indicates a positive correlation between the percentage share of Festuca rubra L. in the grassland and the values of phosphorus (r = 0.98), mineral substances (r = 0.79) and cellulose (r = 0.59). Regression equations were developed to predict the calcium and phosphorus content by the amount of stem fraction of Lotus corniculatus L. at a high determination coefficient: R-2 = 0.939 (Ca) and R-2 = 0.907 (P). The correlations between empirically calculated values of nitrogen-free extractable substances were statistically proven with a concentration of: neutral detergent fibers (r = 0.74), acid detergent fibers (r = 0.74), acid detergent lignin (r = 0.59) and partially digestible polyoside cellulose (r = 0.82) in the dry matter composition of bird's-foot-trefoil.

AB  - The successful use of ozonation for water disinfection and purification requires the determination of optimal treatment conditions, which is associated with a large amount of experiments. At the same time, traditional methods for controlling the process of inactivation of microorganisms, being quite laborious and time consuming, allow one to obtain data on the degree of water disinfection only after 18-48 h after the experiment and sampling. Given that ozone is an oxidizing reagent and its presence in the treated water causes a change in the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) of the solution, this study is aimed at changing the ORP during ozone disinfection of water and at investigating the possibility of express control of this process. As objects of study, we have used model solutions containing 10(4)-10(7) CFU/cm(3) of Escherichia coli and various concentrations (0-20 mg/dm(3)) of humic acids (HA) in a 0.05 M phosphate buffer at pH 6.8, as well as real natural waters of the Dnieper and Desna Rivers. The ozone concentration in the ozone-air mixture varies in the range of 0.5-2.0 mg/dm(3), depending on the particular object of study. It is shown that changes in the ORP of a solution reflect changes in the microbiological and chemical composition of water during ozonation, owing to which measurements of this indicator can serve as a preliminary control method for the process of disinfection, as well as water decoloration. The inflection point on the curve of dependence of ORP on ozonation time practically coincides with the inflection point on the curve of dependence of the degree of water disinfection on the treatment time. In the case of treatment of model waters that are free of organic impurities, a sufficient level of disinfection of the solution is evidenced by an increase in the ORP of the solution to about 440-550 mV. In case of treating natural surface waters (with a high content of natural organic impurities), a sufficient level of disinfection and decoloration of the solution is detected by a decrease in the ORP of the solution by about 30-40 mV.

AB  - The Yarlung Zangbo River (YZR) basin occupies a crucial position in the formation and development of atmospheric circulation and climate change in the Tibetan Plateau, where is the potential trigger and amplifier in global climate fluctuations. Previous studies mainly focused on meteorological drought induced by variations of precipitation and temperature. In this study, a multi-index evaluation of drought characteristics from the perspective of meteorology and agriculture was implemented. GLDAS (Global Land Data Assimilation System) precipitation, surface air temperature and soil moisture data from 1982 to 2015 were used to calculate the meteorological drought index (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index) and agricultural drought index (Soil Water Deficit Index), respectively. Meanwhile, the scPDSI (self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index) dataset provided by CRU (Climate Research Unit) was also utilized to represent the meteorological drought, with the aim of comprehensively investigating the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of drought in the YZR basin. Results indicated that although there was a slightly wetting tendency of the whole basin from 1982 to 2015, drought condition from the perspective of meteorology and agriculture at both annual and growing seasonal scales showed a transition from alleviation to aggravation during 1982-2015, with an abrupt change from wetting to drying occurring at the year of 2000 detected by multiple statistical tests including Mann-Kendall test, Movingt-test and Yamamoto test. Specifically, since the twenty-first century, the meteorological drought in the YZR basin has changed from moderate wet to moderate dry, while the agricultural drought relieved to moderate dry from severe dry with a much more complicated fluctuation. From the perspective of spatial pattern, the annual and growing season variation trends of all three drought indices were identically consistent during 1982-2015. Areas with extremely significant decreasing trend (2.24 similar to 21.09%) were mostly distributed in the west upstream and southwest downstream dominating the overall wetting trend of the YZR basin during the period of 1982-2015, while the transition from wet to dry after 2000 was attributed to the aggravating drought of the western upstream and southeastern downstream. Results of this study have important implications for drought monitoring and eco-environmental sustainability in alpine regions.

AB  - The purpose of the paper is to determine the relationship between different types of tourism safety and security, and components of the tourism entrepreneurship potential, to conduct a quantitative analysis of these indicators in the regions of Ukraine and to identify areas for ensuring the safety and security of the tourism entrepreneurship potential realization. Methodology. Analysis of tourism safety and security in Ukraine is based on the assessment of security potential indicator and the security threats indicator for 25 regions. These indicators take into account the following types of safety and security: security of tourist services, safety of tourist facilities and equipment, social security, political security, financial security, medical safety, information security, and ecological security. The impact of tourism safety and security on the tourism entrepreneurship potential realization is determined on the basis of correlation and regression analysis, where the indicator of the tourism entrepreneurship potential realization is the volume of domestic and inbound tourist flows in the region. The empirical basis of the study is the data of the State Statistics Service of Ukraine for 2019. The reliability of the regression model was tested on the basis of the approximation coefficient and Fisher's F-test. Results of the correlation analysis indicate a significant relationship between ensuring the safety and security of tourism in the region and the volume of domestic and inbound tourist flows. As a result of regression analysis, a model of a high level of reliability was obtained, which indicates how the volume of domestic and inbound tourist flows to the region increases with increasing the level of tourist safety and security by unit. Practical implications. Since the process of safety and security ensuring for the tourism entrepreneurship potential realization cannot be implemented exclusively at the regional level, it is justified the feasibility of a targeted public policy in eight areas. Value/originality. The identified relationship between the types of safety and security of tourism and components of the tourism entrepreneurship potential, as well as establishing the level of impact of safety and security of tourism on the tourism entrepreneurship potential realization in the region provide for a better understanding of ways for efficient governance in this area.

AB  - Recently, there has been renewed interest in Schneider's first-rank symptoms (FRS) of schizophrenia, thanks in part to a meta-analysis of their diagnostic accuracy, which deserves much credit for its methodological rigor. Conceptualising FRS as a diagnostic test whose performance can be measured in terms of sensitivity and specificity involves some issues that require reflection. First, the full adequacy of sensitivity as a measure of diagnostic accuracy for FRS might be questioned. However, it is conceptually acceptable, though FRS are at a disadvantage as compared with many other psychiatric "diagnostic tests" that should have perfect sensitivity under ideal conditions. Also, from a psychopathological perspective it may well be argued that FRS cannot be conceptualised as a simple, inexpensive diagnostic test suitable for screening purposes; however, the history of the concept reveals some reasons why it may be legitimate to view them this way. While no other relevant study has appeared after the publication of the meta-analysis, data on a further 166 patients from a study that could not be included due to incompletely reported data were located. This brought the total to 4,236 patients from 17 studies on the ability of FRS to differentiate schizophrenia from other psychoses. The resulting summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative likelihood ratios are 60.2%, 75.9%, 2.50, and 0.52, respectively. FRS have a kind of double nature, as they can be legitimately considered as belonging to both a sophisticated framework grounded in phenomenological psychopathology and an eminently pragmatic framework grounded in clinical epidemiology. When FRS are conceptualised as simple clinical indicators that require low levels of inference, the available estimates of their diagnostic accuracy are a fairly valid appraisal of their performance and usefulness, and suggest that FRS have some value in differential diagnosis. However, when FRS are conceptualised as profoundly anomalous experiences that can be properly identified and evaluated only by using a phenomenological approach, these estimates can hardly be seen as a valid evaluation of their diagnostic significance. Phenomenologically informed studies are needed to address this research gap.

AB  - Stripe rust (also known as yellow rust), caused by the pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is a common and serious fungal disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. To identify effective stripe rust resistance loci, a genome-wide association study was performed using 152 wheat landraces from the Yellow and Huai River Valleys in China based on Diversity Arrays Technology and simple sequence repeat markers. Phenotypic evaluation of the degree of resistance to stripe rust at the adult-plant stage under field conditions was carried out in five environments. In total, 19 accessions displayed stable, high degrees of resistance to stripe rust development when exposed to mixed races of Pst at the adult-plant stage in multi-environment field assessments. A marker-trait association analysis indicated that 51 loci were significantly associated with adult-plant resistance to stripe rust. These loci included 40 quantitative trait loci (QTL) regions for adult-plant resistance. Twenty identified resistance QTL were linked closely to previously reported yellow rust resistance genes or QTL regions, which were distributed across chromosomes 1B, 1D, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 5B, 6B, 7A, 7B, and 7D. Six multi-trait QTL were detected on chromosomes 1B, 1D, 2B, 3A, 3B, and 7D. Twenty QTL were mapped to chromosomes 1D, 2A, 2D, 4B, 5B, 6A, 6B, 6D, 7A, 7B, and 7D, distant from previously identified yellow rust resistance genes. Consequently, these QTL are potentially novel loci for stripe rust resistance. Among the 20 potentially novel QTL, five (QDS.sicau-2A, QIT.sicau-4B, QDS.sicau-4B.2, QDS.sicau-6A.3, and QYr.sicau-7D) were associated with field responses at the adult-plant stage in at least two environments, and may have large effects on stripe rust resistance. The novel effective QTL for adult-plant resistance to stripe rust will improve understanding of the genetic mechanisms that control the spread of stripe rust, and will aid in the molecular marker-assisted selection-based breeding of wheat for stripe rust resistance.

AB  - The heterogeneity of soil organic matter (SOM) and the small changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) compared to large total SOC stocks hinder a robust estimation of SOC turnover, in particular for more stable SOC. We developed a simple fractionation protocol for agricultural topsoils and tested it extensively on a range of soils in southern Belgium, including farmed soils, soils from long-term field trials, and paired sites after recent conversion to conservation farming. Our simple fractionation involves shaking the soil, wet sieving over 20 mu m and analysing the SOC concentration in the soil as well as in the fine fraction (< 20 mu m). Eight biological indicators measured in an earlier study across the same monitoring network for the 0-10 cm topsoil were analysed in a conditional inference forest model in order to investigate the factors influencing the SOC fractions. Soil microbial biomass N explained the largest proportion of variation in both fractions. The fine fraction was also associated with factors explaining the regional trend in SOC distribution such as farmyard manure input, precipitation, land use and flow length. The variation in SOC content between treatments both in long-term trials and in farmers' fields converted to conservation management was mainly attributed to changes within the coarse fraction. Thus, this fraction proves to be sensitive to management changes, although care should be taken to sample deep enough to represent the former plough layer inherited from the conventional tillage practice. Furthermore, the ratio between the coarse and the fine fraction showed a linear relationship (r(2) = 0.66) with the relative changes in SOC concentration over the last ten years. These fractions derived from a simple analytical approach are thus useful as an indicator for changes in SOC concentration. In analogy to biological indicators such as the soil microbial biomass C, the relationship between the fractions and relative changes in SOC concentration are likely to depend on climate conditions. Our methodology provides an indicator for use in routine analysis of agricultural topsoils, which is capable of predicting the effects of management practices on SOC concentrations in the short to mid-term (5-10 years).

AB  - The low molecular weight carbohydrate (LMWC) profile of cocoa beans has recently been studied using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (HILIC-ESI-TOF MS) and HILIC-ESI-tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-ESI-MSn). However, different LMWC could not be unambiguously identified. Thus, as a first approach in this paper, gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used as a complementary analytical technique to characterize LMWC of cocoa beans. Different mono-, di-, tri- and tetrasaccharides, as well as myo-inositol, galactinol and a diglycosil glycerol were detected. scyllo-Inositol, 1-kestose and 6-kestose were identified in unfermented cocoa beans for the first time. Moreover, other minor LMWC were tentatively assigned as fructosyl-fructose, fructosyl-glucose and glucosyl-sucrose. As a second step, in order to evaluate new possible indicators of cocoa bean origin or fermentation status, scyllo-inositol, 1-kestose and galactinol were selected as target compounds and a HILIC-ESI-TOF MS method was optimized for their analysis. The optimized conditions, using an acetonitrile:water gradient with 0.05% ammonium hydroxide at 40 degrees C showed narrow peaks (w(h): 0.3-0.5 min) with good resolution values (R-s: 0.83-2.83). The validated HILIC-ESI-TOF MS method was applied to the analysis of 35 cocoa bean samples from different origins and fermentation status. The content of scyllo-inositol, 1-kestose and galactinol in unfermented beans (n = 21) was in the range of traces-504.9, 36.1-133.5 and traces-1970.4 mu g g(-1 )cocoa DM respectively. In fermented beans (n =14), the content of scyllo-inositol and 1-kestose was in the range of 15.5-491.9 and traces-115.5 mu g g(-1) cocoa DM respectively. Galactinol was absent in fermented beans, indicating that it could be a potential indicator of fermentation status. The methodology proposed could be used for quality control of natural products and other food ingredients containing inositols and oligosaccharides. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of the study was to propose a modification to the classical open-field test (OFT) to make even more reliable and informative assessment of behavioural reactions. Birds' quick locomotion assessed with OFT does not necessarily indicate a high level of fear and an attempt to escape, but it can involve a considerable level of sociability and willingness to return to the flock Those two motivations, fear and sociability, are not distinguishable with the classical OFT; the test does not provide unambiguous assessment of the motivation of birds' behaviour and emotions. Given this shortcoming of the open-field test, a question arose whether the use of environment-enrichment objects in the open-field test would ensure greater objectivity in assessment of hens' behaviour.
   The study involved 150 laying hens - 50 Green-legged Partridge chickens (GLP), 50 Polbars (Pb), and 50 Leghorns (L), reared in a single commercial farm. All the birds were 30 weeks old at the time of assessment. The hens were subjected to a modified open-field test (MOFT). The modification involved introduction of environment enriching objects, which were novel for the birds. The box comprised containers with water, commercial feed, feed supplemented with finely fragmented cereal spikes, finely cut cereal straw and insect larvae as well as a sandpit, a mirror, and an imitation of a nest. The test lasted 600 seconds. Six different behavioural indicator traits were recorded (MOFT1-MOFT6). Spearman's rank correlations between the traits were estimated. The MOFT results enabled to distinguish such hens' traits as curiosity, inquisitiveness/exploratory behaviour, and excitability. The most important indictors include the duration of exploration of the area, the number of explored objects, time spent on exploration of the objects, and the number of squares covered. It appeared that a single behavioural indicator - the latency of undertaking physical activity - can be used for selection and breeding practice. This indicator is correlated highly with the others and is simultaneously easy and quick to assess in farm conditions. Hence, the latency of undertaking activity can potentially be used in assessment of hens' behaviour to evaluate curiosity/ fearfulness and emotional excitability as correlated behaviours.

AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the interaction of extreme growth years in teak (Tectona grandis) with climatic conditions of current, antecedent and subsequent years, in order to explain the nature and the effects of climatic variability on teak growth in northeastern Thailand. A 33-year treering index was constructed and extreme growth years during the period 19762008 were identified. A superposed epoch analysis (SEA) was used to study the interaction of climatic data and extreme growth years. Extreme growth years were derived from eight wider and seven narrower annual rings identified using the Cropper's method. Seventeen false rings were detected using the threshold value >= 80% of false ring occurrence for all samples in each growth year. False ring occurrence was associated with narrow ring width formation and triggered by increasing maximum and mean temperatures at the beginning of the rainy season (May to August). In the third year after false ring formation, we observed a pattern of wet year occurrence when annual rainfall and relative humidity in September to December were higher than in adjacent years. Moreover, in the sixth year before false ring formation, a wet year was observed when relative humidity in September to December was higher than in adjacent years. Wider ring width index occurring in a particular year was found to be triggered by a decrease in maximum and mean temperatures in May to August of the current year, suggesting that wet years promote teak growth. The third year after the formation of wider rings was characterized by a low annual rainfall. Our results showed that drought years trigger false ring and narrow ring formation, while wet years trigger wide ring formation in teak. A cycle of wet years between the sixth year prior to, and the third year after, the formation of false rings was also observed, as well as the occurrence of drought in the third year since the formation of wide rings. False ring, narrow ring and wide ring occurrences appear to be good indicators of a 3-6 year climate fluctuation pattern, similar to that of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle in this region.

AB  - A small-parcel experiment was established in Velke Ripnany. Six varieties (Ambition, Cambria, Delano, Modex, Mandarin and Ventura) of Danish company Maribo Seed were seeded using the Oyord sowing machine on 31 March in the monitored year 2011. Right after the sowing there was a big rainfall deficit, which made the seedling emergence more complicated. Germination improved after the subsequent rainfall, the cover was completed, but the growth was uneven. Ample rainfall was monitored in the early summer months: June and July. The cover was fungicidally treated and health conditions were thus very good in comparison with the untreated cover. Harvest was carried out from 18 to 20 October 2011 in two phases: by machine and by hand.
   During the experiment, the influence of environment on differences of sugar beet cultivars was monitored. Root yield represents a production proces indicator that is sharply influenced by weather during crop emergence and by genetic qualities of the varieties. The Ventura variety (92.3 tha(-1)) reached the highest level of root yield of the evaluated varieties; this variety also reached the highest yield index (99.29%) in the given period within the whole experiment. The average root yield of the monitored varieties was 86.07 tha(-1). The best sugar content was monitored in Modex variety (19.54%); on second place there were two varieties: Cambria (19.17%) and Mandarin (19.11%). The average sugar content of all varieties reached 19.03%, which was also to a certain extent influenced by the high temperatures with low rainfall totals. Ventura and Cambria varieties (15.80 and 15.42 tha(-1)) had the highest white sugar yield of the monitored varieties. The lowest levels were monitored in Modex and Mandarin varieties (13.93 and 14.92 tha(-1)).
   The given data proves that Ventura variety reached the highest harvest index in the experiment year and shows the best average values of the monitored parameters (root yield, polarized and white sugar yield). Results of the analysis thus suggest that it is important to continue monitoring the impact of climate changes on sugar beet in the future with respect to choice of proper genotypes for the particular growing areas.

AB  - Eukaryotic microalgae serve as indicators of environmental change when exposed to severe seasonal fluctuations. Several environmental stress conditions are known to produce reactive oxygen species in cellular compartments, resulting in oxidative damage and apoptosis. The study of cell death in higher plants and animals has revealed the existence of an active 'programmed cell death' (PCD) process and similarities between such processes suggest an evolutionary origin. A study was undertaken to examine the morphological, biochemical and molecular responses of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii after exposure to oxidative (10 mM H2O2) and osmotic (200 mM NaCl and 360 mM sorbitol) stress. Concentrations of H2O2 (2-50 mM), NaCl and sorbitol (100-800 mM) were negatively correlated with growth. Biochemical analyses showed an increase in intracellular H2O2 production (2.2-fold with H2O2 and similar to 1.2-1.4-fold with NaCl and sorbitol) and activities of some antioxidant enzymes [super oxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX)]. Alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was observed upon treatment with H2O2 and NaCl, but not with sorbitol, indicating that the ionic stress component of NaCl altered the MMP. In addition, H2O2 led to the activation of a caspase-3-like protein, increase in the cleavage of a poly(ADP) ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1)-like enzyme and formation of DNA nicks and laddering. With NaCl and sorbitol, no caspase activation, nor oligonucleosomal DNA laddering was observed, indicating non-apoptotic death. However, genomic DNA of NaCl (800 mM)-stressed cells, but not those of sorbitol-treated cells showed complete shearing. We conclude that the ionic rather than the osmotic component of NaCl leads to necrosis. These results unequivocally suggest that the vegetative cells of C. reinhardtii respond differentially to various stress agents, leading to different death types in the same organism. Moreover, unlike most other organisms, when exposed to NaCl this alga does not undergo PCD.

AB  - A method was developed and tested to estimate challenge load due to disease outbreaks and other challenges in sows using reproduction records. The method was based on reproduction records from a farm with known disease outbreaks. It was assumed that the reduction in weekly reproductive output within a farm is proportional to the magnitude of the challenge. As the challenge increases beyond certain threshold, it is manifested as an outbreak. The reproduction records were divided into 3 datasets. The first dataset called the Training dataset consisted of 57,135 reproduction records from 10,901 sows from 1 farm in Canada with several outbreaks of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). The known disease status of sows was regressed on the traits number born alive, number of losses as a combination of still birth and mummified piglets, and number of weaned piglets. The regression coefficients from this analysis were then used as weighting factors for derivation of an index measure called challenge load indicator. These weighting factors were derived with i) a two-step approach using residuals or year-week solutions estimated from a previous step, and ii) a single-step approach using the trait values directly. Two types of models were used for each approach: a logistic regression model and a general additive model. The estimates of challenge load indicator were then compared based on their ability to detect PRRS outbreaks in a Test dataset consisting of records from 65,826 sows from 15 farms in the Netherlands. These farms differed from the Canadian farm with respect to PRRS virus strains, severity and frequency of outbreaks. The single-step approach using a general additive model was best and detected 14 out of the 15 outbreaks. This approach was then further validated using the third dataset consisting of reproduction records of 831,855 sows in 431 farms located in different countries in Europe and America. A total of 41 out of 48 outbreaks detected using data analysis were confirmed based on diagnostic information received from the farms. Among these, 30 outbreaks were due to PRRS while 11 were due to other diseases and challenging conditions. The results suggest that proposed method could be useful for estimation of challenge load and detection of challenge phases such as disease outbreaks.

AB  - Production environments for meat poultry are generally bi-dimensional open areas where birds tend to cluster along the walls. We investigated the impact of increasing environmental complexity (EC) on slow-growing free-range chickens raised under commercial conditions. The study was conducted in four farms, each with three independent houses and outdoor ranges that were outfitted with panels, perches or remained under standard management (control). Forty birds per house were individually tagged and their locations (in XY coordinates) recorded from weeks of age 6 to 12. Total and net distance travelled, use of the central areas indoors, and core areas were calculated from the indoor and outdoor locations. Core areas define the areas of activity according to assigned probability levels, (50, 75 and 100% in this study). Production and welfare indicators were collected at slaughter; incidence of footpad dermatitis, fluctuating asymmetry and growth rate. Results showed an EC treatment effects (P < 0.05) with more birds using the central indoor area in the panel and perch treatment than controls (P < 0.05). The interaction between treatment and temperature affected total distance travelled indoors (P < 0.05), while net distance was affected by weeks of age and treatment interaction (P < 0.05). No treatment or age period effects (P > 0.05) were found for core areas indoors. The use of the outdoor area was affected by the birdsweeks of age and the temperature (P < 0.05), although the use of the outdoor area remained low, with an average of 63.08 +/- 5.37% of the tagged birds never observed outside. The size of the core areas outside at 50 and 100% increased with age period (P < 0.05). No treatment effect was found for production and welfare indicators. Although the benefits of the EC treatments may have been restricted by the small number of devices introduced, these results suggest that EC facilitates a more homogeneous use of the space inside the houses and that the use of the outdoor area increased with the experience provided by age.

AB  - Malting quality is composed of numerous interacting traits with a high complexity concerning their biochemical and genetic basis. Malt extract is key indicator of barley malting quality and it is a mega-trait since it is influenced by a number of independent component traits. Understanding genetic and non-genetic factors that effects grain quality and grain yield is crucial in developing new cultivars, seed and mercantile production. Path analysis is one of the reliable statistical techniques which allow separation of the direct effect of each component trait on malt quality from the indirect effects caused by the interdependence component trait. The aim of this study was to investigate spring two-row barley quality as mega-trait depending on the component traits in the conditions of the Pannonian environments. Regression analysis with extract (EXT) as dependant and other traits (yield-YIL, test weight-TW, grain weight-GW, grading-GRA, grain protein concentration-GPC, viscosity-VIS, Kolbach index-KOL, Hartong number-HAR) as independent traits was performed out. Simple coefficient of correlations were calculated between independent traits and EXT in all pair combination and then used as inputs for path coefficient analysis. The quadratic curve fitted the best relationship between EXT and the independent traits. EXT was in positive (P<0.01) relationship with GW, GRA, KOL, and HAR with simple correlation coefficient of 0.47, 0.42, 0.39 and 0.50, respectively and in negative (P<0.01) relationship with GPC and VIS with simple correlation coefficient of -0.72 and -0.51, respectively. Path analysis explained more than 70% of the variation in EXT of which 34.3% was determined by direct negative path coefficient (P<0.01) of GPC without significant any indirect path effect. VIS negatively directly, (P<0.01) and negatively indirectly via GPC effected EXT. KOL did not have significant direct effect on EXT, but had rather prominent indirect effect via GPC, VIS and HAR. HAR positively directly (P<0.01) and positively indirectly via GPC effected EXT. The direct effect of VIS and HAR determined 13.0% and 14.1% of the variation, respectively.

AB  - The study was carried out from April 30 until July 13 of 1997 in Adventfjorden (Spitsbergen). Formation of less saline and warmer surface water (similar to 1 m thick) caused by melting of the fast ice was observed in the fjord during the first days of May. In summer a less saline surface layer was about 3 m thick. Euphotic depth measured under ice sheet reached 12 m, whereas load of mineral matter brought with riverine discharge in summer (the content of total particulate matter in the fjord reached 1.66 kg m(-2)) dramatically reduced euphotic zone depth to 0.35 m. By pigment measurement three phases of phytoplankton development in Adventfjorden were distinguished: (1) spring bloom that has started under fast ice and reached maximum in the mid of May, (2) stagnation period in June, (3) increase of pigment concentration in July, what could indicate a start of the next algae bloom. Analyses of chlorophylls and carotenoids revealed that diatoms (chl c, fucoxanthin), and green algae (chl b, lutein) dominated phytoplankton community in the fjord. Moreover, the presence of peridinin indicates the presence of Dinophyta and alloxanthin-the occurence of Cryptophyta. In May and June 1997 phytoplankton appeared mainly in the surface of water, while in July, as a result of inflow of turbulent riverine waters into Adventfjorden, algae cells were pushed down and the highest numbers were observed at the depth similar to 20 m. Great phaeopigments to chl a ratio (= 0.54) found in the fjord seston in June and July probably shows strong impact of zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton development. High contribution of chlorophyllide a in porphyrin a poll in samples collected under fast ice (chlorophyllide a/chl a ratio = 0.18) reflects the final stage of algal communitie succession in ice, just before spring ice melt and release of biota to oceanic water. Chloropyllide a content during summer was minor or not detectable, demonstrating that diatom cells were in good physiological condition. High chl a allomer/chl a ratio (average = 0.11 for the period investigated) confirms high oxygen concentration in environment of Adventfjorden.

AB  - An in vitro method for estimating availability of calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and phosphorus (P) from five protein diets was investigated. Mixtures of the diets were homogenized and exposed to pepsin digestion at pH 1.5 for one hour. After pepsin digestion the pH of the mixtures were adjusted to pH 6.8 and digestion was continued for another one hour after the addition of pancreatin. The effect of pH on mineral solubility was also studied. The percentage of soluble Ca, Mg and P in diets determined in vitro after peptic and pancreatic digestion were correlated with the percentages of Ca, Mg and P absorbed as measured by portoaortic differences in Sprague-Dawley male rats fed with those diets. The acidic environment (pH 1.5) significantly increased the Ca, Mg and P solubility for all diets studied. Casein diet showed the lowest solubility of minerals (P < 0.05) when compared to the other diets. Raising the pH from 1.5 to pH 6.8 significantly impaired the solubility of Ca and P in soy, thus differing from milk proteins. Magnesium was less affected by pH conditions mainly with diets containing whey, alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin. Digestion significantly (P < 0.0005) increased the percentage of soluble Ca, Mg and P. Incubation time seemed to influence significantly (P < 0.003) the solubility of the three minerals. Significant interaction effects (P < 0.02) were found between digestion and incubation lime on mineral solubility, except for Mg in pancreatin digestion. The most significant effects (P < 0.0001) of pepsin and pancreatin digestion were observed for P. The percentage of soluble Ca and Mg at pH 1.5 and pH 6.8 for diets were highly correlated with the percentage of absorption of these minerals estimated in rals. Thus, solubility which was a major indicator for the potential absorption of minerals in vivo, could be used to evaluate the bioavailability of Ca and Mg in different diets. In contrast, the percentage solubility of P evaluated in vitro for alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin showed the lowest correlation with the results obtained in the rat and, therefore, does not constitute a good indicator of P absorption

AB  - Rill erosion is one of the most important causes of land degradation, and it is caused by the flow concentration on the surface of the hillslopes. It, therefore, results in several times increase in the amount of soil loss and sediment yield. However, the biological control of the rill erosion using soil microorganisms has not been adequately endeavored. In this respect, soil microorganisms have been used and accepted as one of the latest methods for managing surface erosion. Following that, we evaluated the efficacy of soil cyanobacteria inoculation in controlling rill erosion components in the current study. To this end, inoculation of cyanobacteria in mid-sized plots with dimensions of 6 x 1 x 0.5 m, at a slope of 30%, was performed on marl soil and prone to rill erosion from Marzanabad Region, northern Iran. An artificial rainfall of 50 +/- 7 mm h(-1) was simulated after 40 days of cyanobacteria inoculation, along with a supplementary runoff of 2 +/- 0.32 L min(-1). Many different outflows and soil loss and runoff hydraulic and hydrodynamic properties were then measured to assess the effects of soil cyanobacteria inoculation compared to untreated conditions. The results showed that inoculation of cyanobacteria reduced runoff volume, runoff coefficient, soil loss, and sediment concentration by 42, 64, 82, and 62%, respectively. It also increased infiltration volume by 74% showing high water retention capacity of the treated soil. Also, the hydraulic and hydrodynamic components of the flow, including velocity, depth, Froude number, and Reynolds number, were significantly reduced (P < 0.05), in contrast, the shear stress and friction coefficient did not change significantly in treated plots. The statistical analyses further showed that soil surface cyanobacterisation considerably affected morphological factors of rill depth, rill mean width, rill maximum length, and rill density by 44.34, 54.25, 40.75, and 38.21%, respectively. Overall, the findings revealed that using cyanobacteria to mitigate rill erosion is a practical and effective method for the bio-conservation of soil and water resources in most arid and semiarid areas.

AB  - Purpose Coffee cut-stems (CCS) are typically left in the field after coffee harvesting as fertilizer or used partially for cooking and drying of coffee grains. However, the energy contained in this residue is not completely exploited. For this reason, different applications for CCS have been considered to obtain innovative products. This work aims to evaluate the environmental impact of energy generation through two biorefinery systems using CCS as feedstock. Methods The life cycle assessment (LCA) considers a cradle-to-gate approach, beginning at the seed germination and ending at the production of ethanol, electricity, and low-pressure steam. Inventory data of the coffee production are collected from national reports. Mass and energy balances are calculated using an integrated methodological approach comprising the conceptual design and optimization of the CCS biorefineries. Results and discussion CCS production is one of the hotspots in both evaluated biorefineries due to the use of high amounts of fertilizers, contributing to most of the environmental impact categories. From the two assessed biorefinery configurations, the system with the lowest environmental benefits was the one that considered the generation of electricity and steam. Factors such as the high emissions of exhaust gases (mainly composed of CO2) and the use of water for steam generation were the main contributors. The alternative solution I (AS-I) has the lowest environmental impact in comparison with the base case. From the sensitivity analyses, the use of energy allocation approach provided better performance than the system expansion approach. However, the selection of one approach over the other highly depends on the evaluated impact category based on the uncertainty analysis. Conclusions The production of CCS has the highest contribution to the overall environmental impact of the evaluated biorefineries, and thus, we need available information of the coffee crop production including the production of co-products, such as CCS. We present a detailed inventory of the production of CCS in Colombia as an important contribution for further research in the area of coffee-based biorefineries. Based on our inventory, the production of bioenergy (electricity and steam) for a coffee-based biorefinery seems to provide the best environmental performance in comparison to the production of biofuels (ethanol).

AB  - Chestnut plantations are worldwide distributed and they are often subjected to intensive management practices such as the removal of the organic residues from the soil surface. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of such practices on soil properties at different depths and on nutrient contents in chestnut leaves. To reach our goal, 6 pits down to 30 cm soil depth were dug in European chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) stands where the organic residues such as burrs, leaves and pruned materials are yearly removed (REM), and 9 pits in stands where the organic residues are chopped and left on soil surface (CONS). Both practices began about 30 years ago. The nutrient contents in leaves were assessed on chestnut trees close to each pit. Our findings showed a more intense soil development in CONS than in REM. At soil surface, CONS had thicker mineral horizon than in REM probably due to the protection acted by the organic residues against erosion. In subsoil, organic residues conservation promoted the organic C (soil organic C, water-extractable organic C, fulvic-like C and soil organic C stock) accumulation which further promoted horizon development. Since the role of soil organic matter (SOM) as source of nutrients, the subsoil of CONS study sites had a greater stock of Ca, P and S and a higher exchangeable Ca content than REM. Furthermore, the higher SOM and nutrient contents in CONS subsoil compared to REM promoted the microbial respiration. The organic residues conservation effects on the surface soil horizon properties were, instead, negligible. Despite the generally better soil conditions in CONS than in REM, no differences were observed for the leaf nutrient contents likely due to the chestnut trees adaptability also to the scarcely fertile soils. Overall, our findings highlighted the importance of organic residues conservation for the improvement in deeper soil horizons of the chemical and biological fertility in chestnut plantations. Furthermore, this research pointed out to pay more attention on subsoil since it is a good indicator of the changes caused by external factors.

AB  - Long-term record of leaf phenology of woody plants that have high longevity and that have been growing on the same site for a longer time could be one of the good indicators for assessing the effects of climate change on forest ecosystem functioning. Since climatic conditions could be different among locations, we need to record the phenology of forest plants growing under various climate types. Here, we report seasonal changes in leaf abundance of deciduous trees during a 13-year period in the Sambe Forest of Shimane University located in northern Chugoku mountain range, western Japan (35 degrees 9 ' N, 132 degrees 37 '-40 ' E, 300-628 m above sea level [asl]). Northern Chugoku mountain range is situated in the west end of Japan Sea side climate. Our study would provide the first record of tree phenology in this region. We examined eight species belonging to eight genera common in a secondary deciduous broad-leaved forest in western Japan. Habitats of native trees ranged from canopy to understory in the forest and pioneers in an open site. Some of trees were exceptionally planted in an arboretum in the Sambe Forest. Leaf types included single leaf (i.e.,Carpinus tschonoskii,Swida macrophylla, etc.) and pinnate leaves (i.e.,Aesculus turbinataandPhellodendron amurense). We observed changes in the relative leaf abundance caused by budburst, leaf expansion and leaf shedding of the fixed shoots of targeted trees during 3-day to 3-week intervals from March to December each year from 2004 to 2016. Over the 13-year period, we used a digital camera to take photographs of the shoots that were processed to estimate the leaf abundance. Our data was obtained from common tree species that have a wide habitat range and are distributed nationwide. Therefore, comparison of our data with those data in other climate types may significantly contribute to understand the effect of climate change across Japan on forest plants. The complete data set for this abstract published in the Data Paper section of the journal is available in electronic format in MetaCat in JaLTER at .

AB  - Citizen science, scientific work and data collection conducted by or with non-experts, is rapidly growing. Although the potential of citizen science activities to generate enormous amounts of data otherwise not feasible is widely recognized, the obtained data are often treated with caution and scepticism. Their quality and reliability is not fully trusted since they are obtained by non-experts using low-cost instruments or scientifically non-verified methods. In this study, we evaluate the performance of Parrot's Flower Power soil moisture sensor used within the European citizen science project the GROW Observatory (GROW; https://growobservatory.org, last access: 30 March 2020). The aim of GROW is to enable scientists to validate satellite-based soil moisture products at an unprecedented high spatial resolution through crowdsourced data. To this end, it has mobilized thousands of citizens across Europe in science and climate actions, including hundreds who have been empowered to monitor soil moisture and other environmental variables within 24 high-density clusters around Europe covering different climate and soil conditions. Clearly, to serve as reference dataset, the quality of ground observations is crucial, especially if obtained from low-cost sensors. To investigate the accuracy of such measurements, the Flower Power sensors were evaluated in the lab and field. For the field trials, they were installed alongside professional soil moisture probes in the Hydrological Open Air Laboratory (HOAL) in Petzenkirchen, Austria. We assessed the skill of the low-cost sensors against the professional probes using various methods. Apart from common statistical metrics like correlation, bias, and root-mean-square difference, we investigated and compared the temporal stability, soil moisture memory, and the flagging statistics based on the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) quality indicators. We found a low intersensor variation in the lab and a high temporal agreement with the professional sensors in the field. The results of soil moisture memory and the ISMN quality flags analysis are in a comparable range for the low-cost and professional probes; only the temporal stability analysis shows a contrasting outcome. We demonstrate that low-cost sensors can be used to generate a dataset valuable for environmental monitoring and satellite validation and thus provide the basis for citizen-based soil moisture science.

AB  - The assessment of road infrastructure exposure to extreme weather events is of major importance for scientists and practitioners alike. In this study, we compare the different extreme value approaches and fitting methods with respect to their value for assessing the exposure of transport networks to extreme precipitation and temperature impacts. Based on an Austrian data set from 25 meteorological stations representing diverse meteorological conditions, we assess the added value of partial duration series (PDS) over the standardly used annual maxima series (AMS) in order to give recommendations for performing extreme value statistics of meteorological hazards. Results show the merits of the robust L-moment estimation, which yielded better results than maximum likelihood estimation in 62% of all cases. At the same time, results question the general assumption of the threshold excess approach (employing PDS) being superior to the block maxima approach (employing AMS) due to information gain. For low return periods (non-extreme events) the PDS approach tends to overestimate return levels as compared to the AMS approach, whereas an opposite behavior was found for high return levels (extreme events). In extreme cases, an inappropriate threshold was shown to lead to considerable biases that may outperform the possible gain of information from including additional extreme events by far. This effect was visible from neither the square-root criterion nor standardly used graphical diagnosis (mean residual life plot) but rather from a direct comparison of AMS and PDS in combined quantile plots. We therefore recommend performing AMS and PDS approaches simultaneously in order to se-lect the best-suited approach. This will make the analyses more robust, not only in cases where threshold selection and dependency introduces biases to the PDS approach but also in cases where the AMS contains non-extreme events that may introduce similar biases. For assessing the performance of extreme events we recommend the use of conditional performance measures that focus on rare events only in addition to standardly used unconditional indicators. The findings of the study directly address road and traffic management but can be transferred to a range of other environmental variables including meteorological and hydrological quantities.

AB  - Trace metal enrichments in sedimentary deposits are of prime interest because they are governed by processes that also control the production and preservation of organic matter. Consequently, trace metals have been used in reconstructions of the (palaeo) depositional environment of organic-rich deposits, but most of these studies have primarily focused on hydrographically restricted basins and the response of trace metals to changing redox conditions whereas the role of trace metals in the nutrient cycle and primary productivity in upwelling settings remains relatively unexplored.
   In this study we present a comprehensive database of published trace metal concentration data in modern organicrich deposits from a variety of marine settings. Scrutiny of the compiled dataset has resulted in the development of novel trace metal based proxies that allow the distinction between two marine end-member depositional settings that are associated with enhanced organic carbon burial: open marine settings on the continental margin associated with upwelling (e.g. Namibian Margin) and hydrographically restricted marginal marine basins (e.g. Black Sea).
   It is shown that high Cd/Movalues are typical for sediments from continental margin upwelling settings whereas Co and Mn concentrations (expressed as Co * Mn values) are high in samples from hydrographically restricted marine basins. The Cd/Mo ratios are thought to track the relative importance of productivity versus preservation with high values in productivity driven systems attributed to the transfer of Cd to the sediments from remineralised plankton biomass. Co * Mn values, on the other hand, are believed to reflect the supply and reactive behaviour of Co and Mn and can be used to assess circulation patterns in the water column and the relative contribution of deep versus surface/river water influx to the basin. It is demonstrated that the combined use of the Cd/Mo and Co * Mn proxies provides a highly effective way to distinguish modern/recent marine sedimentary environments, which holds promise for its use in palaeo-environmental reconstructions.

AB  - Human-altered landscapes are thought to reduce habitat quality for many forest-dependent species, but some omnivorous, opportunist species take advantage of human-related food sources, such as garbage and crops. It is unknown, however, whether anthropogenic foods can sustain populations in areas with relatively little natural habitat. We studied (2007-2012) a population of American black bears (Ursus americanus) at the western periphery of their range in Minnesota, in a landscape that was heavily impacted by agriculture (similar to 50%). We estimated the dietary contributions of corn and sunflowers (2-4% of the landscape) versus seasonally available natural foods (spring vegetation, ants, deer, fruit, and nuts) with stable isotope analyses (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of 110 hair samples from 51 bears. We identified associations between diet and sex, age, body size and condition, reproductive status, space use, habitat connectivity, and natural food abundance. At the population level, adult males and adult females without cubs consumed considerable crops in fall (95% credible intervals: males = 19-46% of diet, females = 10-40%), but females with cubs and juvenile bears rarely consumed crops. Individual estimates of crop consumption were positively correlated with the proportion of GPS-collar locations in crop fields. Females, but not males, decreased crop consumption in years with high availability of natural fall foods. Further, the degree of crop consumption was more closely tied to local crop availability and landscape composition in females than in males. Weight and fat were positively correlated with crop use for both sexes, and males' use of crops also increased with their physical stature, suggesting that crops provided substantial caloric benefits to bears and that social dominance may have influenced foraging decisions. However, a large segment of this bear population (44% of sampled bear-years) made little use of crops, and crops accounted for more than half the fall diet for only 14% of the population. Whereas some bears clearly benefited from consumption of crops, we conclude that a population of bears could be sustained in this largely agricultural region even without crops as a food source.

AB  - Environmental pollutants polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), especially dioxin-like PCBs, cause oxidative stress and associated toxic effects, including cancer and possibly atherosclerosis. We previously reported that PCB 126, the most potent dioxin-like PCB congener, not only decreases antioxidants such as hepatic selenium (Se), Se-dependent glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione (GSH) but also increases levels of the antiatherosclerosis enzyme paraoxonase 1 (PON1) in liver and serum. To probe the interconnection of these three antioxidant systems, Se, GSH, and PON1, we examined the influence of varying levels of dietary Se and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and precursor for GSH synthesis, on PON1 in the absence and presence of PCB 126 exposure. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, fed diets with differing Se levels (0.02, 0.2, or 2 ppm) or NAC (1 %), were treated with a single intraperitoneal injection of corn oil or various doses of PCB 126 and euthanized 2 weeks later. PCB 126 significantly increased liver PON1 mRNA, protein level and activity, and serum PON1 activity in all dietary groups but did not consistently increase thiobarbituric acid levels (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, TBARS), an indicator of lipid oxidation and oxidative stress, in liver or serum. Inadequate (high or low) dietary Se decreased baseline and PCB 126-induced aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) expression but further increased PCB 126-induced cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) expression, the enzyme believed to be the cause for PCB 126-induced oxidative stress. In addition, a significant inverse relationship was observed not only between dietary Se levels and PON1 mRNA and PON1 activity but also with TBARS levels in the liver, suggesting significant antioxidant protection from dietary Se. NAC lowered serum baseline TBARS levels in controls and increased serum PON1 activity but lowered liver PON1 activities in animals treated with 1 mu mol/kg PCB 126, suggesting antioxidant activity by NAC primarily in serum. These results also show an unexpected predominantly inverse relationship between Se or NAC and PON1 during control and PCB 126 exposure conditions. These interactions should be further explored in the development of dietary protection regimens.

AB  - Spring fens are isolated treeless wetlands of a high conservation value. Their environmental conditions are strongly related to their groundwater chemistry, which controls species distribution within various groups of organisms. Clitellates, a dominant group of non-insect aquatic fauna, however, have never been studied in these habitats. It is unclear from previous studies to what extent the distribution of aquatic non-insect taxa reflects water chemistry rather than the substrate structure. We studied 34 spring fens sampled in 17 isolated sites in the Western Carpathian Mountains to determine mainly the effects of water chemistry and substrate structure on variation in species richness and composition of clitellate assemblages as examples of the non-insect fauna. A total of 34 taxa were found, with 3-15 taxa collected per sample. Species richness was negatively correlated with water mineral concentration measured as water electric conductivity (r = -0.57, P < 0.001) and positively with TOC (r = 0.60, P < 0.001). Surprisingly, the lowest number of taxa was found in calcareous fens and richness increased towards Sphagnum-fens. There was a species turnover related to changes in mineral richness and substrate characters. The main change of species composition was promoted by changes in substrate structure. The second gradient of species composition was linked with the amount of nutrients, moisture, and dominance of sphagna, and was associated with an increase of eurytopic species in fens with high nutrient availability. It was difficult to separate the effects of water chemistry and substrate on clitellate species distributions owing to the fact that variation in tufa precipitation and vegetation was driven by water chemistry changes. This study presented the first quantitative data on fen clitellate assemblages, which appear to have an unusual pattern of species richness. In contrast to plants and molluscs, calcareous fens appeared to be a harsh environment for clitellate species. Only few specialized species, mainly Trichodrilus strandi, were able to establish viable populations. The significant effect of water chemistry on clitellate distribution patterns raises questions about the direct influence of water chemistry on non-insect aquatic taxa, which have previously been considered to be mostly determined by substrate characteristics.

AB  - The physical and chemical properties of soils, as well as climatic conditions, influence the behavior of herbicides applied in pre-emergence. This work aimed to evaluate the residual effect of sulfentrazone, isoxaflutole and oxyfluorfen in three soils. The trial was conducted in a protected environment in a randomized block experimental design, with four replications. The treatments for each soil were arranged in a 3 x 5 factorial, being three herbicides and five sowing periods after herbicide application. Sulfentrazone, isoxaflutole and oxyfluorfen were applied at 0.5 kg ha(-1), 0.72 kg ha(-1) and 0.113 kg ha(-1), respectively, on plastic pots with 250 mL volume, previously filled with the two clay texture soils and the sandy loam texture soil. Subsequently, the bioindicator species Sorghum bicolor was sown at 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 days after application (DAA). A control with no herbicide treatment was sown at different times for each soil and used as a comparison in the evaluations. At 21 days after sowing in each season, intoxication and plant growth were evaluated by means of shoot dry mass. Sorghum plants in the clay soil with 9.0 dag kg(-1) of organic matter (O.M.), submitted to the application of isoxaflutole, sulfentrazone and oxyfluorfen, produced shoot dry mass over the control to 34, 20 and 40%, respectively, at 60 DAA. In the sandy loam soil, it was observed a high residual effect of sulfentrazone and oxyfluorfen, and a decrease in the residual effect of isoxaflutole over time, with 80, 90 and 40% control at 60 DAA, respectively. In the clay soil with 4.4 dag kg(-1) of O.M., the herbicide isoxaflutole was found to lose control efficacy over time, unlike oxyfluorfen, which showed practically constant control in all the evaluated periods, and sulfentrazone, which showed high residual effect during the study period. The inherent characteristics of each herbicide, as well as the differences in organic matter content and texture between the soils influence the persistence of sulfentrazone, isoxaflutole and oxyfluorfen in the soil. Greater residual effect of oxyfluorfen was observed in sandy loam soil, and isoxaflutole in clay soil with high content of organic matter, while sulfentrazone presented high residual effect in the three soils.

AB  - Qualitative and quantitative analysis of recent organic-walled dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts) was performed on surface sediment samples and a core from the continental shelf of the Gulf of Tehuantepec, Mexico, in order to document the spatial distribution of dinocyst assemblages in relation to upwelling and primary productivity, and to assess the environmental history of the last century. The analyses of surface sediment samples show a close relation between dinocyst assemblages and productivity on a regional scale. Polysphaeridium zoharyi and heterotrophic taxa (notably Brigantedinium spp.) dominate in the high productivity zone, whereas Spiniferites delicatus and other phototrophic taxa are more abundant in the lower productivity zone. Sediment in an eighteen cm long gravity core (dated using Pb-210 and Cs-137) provided a record of the last century at annual to decadal resolution, thus yielding a unique opportunity to examine variations in dinocyst assemblages associated with environmental changes. Cyst concentrations in the core range between 477 and 2300 cysts g(-1), giving cyst fluxes between 68 and 494 Cysts cm(-2) yr(-1). Twenty-three phototrophic and heterotrophic cyst taxa were identified. Brigantedinium spp., P zoharyi and Bitectatodinium spongium are dominant, and are associated with the seasonal upwelling that characterizes the area. Cysts of potentially toxic species such as P. zoharyi (the cyst of Pyrodinium bahamense var. compressum and/or bahamense) occur throughout the core. Despite slight variations in relative abundances of the taxa in the assemblages, there is no evidence for eutrophication following industrial development of the adjacent coastal zone. Core samples were also analyzed for benthic foraminiferal content in order to determine possible effects of high, upwelling-induced productivity on bottom water oxygenation. The benthic foraminiferal assemblages are dominated by Hanzawaia concentrica (over 50%), with less abundant Uvigerina excellens, Cancris spp, Planulina ornata, Quinqueloculina lamarckiana, Epistominella sandiegoensis, Nonionella basispinata, Cassidulina modeloensis and Textularia foliacea. The benthic foraminiferal assemblages are characteristic of oxygen concentrations above 1 ml l(-1), indicating that possible changes in productivity did not significantly affect bottom water oxygen concentrations over the last 100 years.

AB  - Benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) is contained in cruciferous plants which are part of the human diet. Numerous reports indicate that BITC prevents chemically induced cancer in laboratory animals and it has been postulated that BITC might also be chemoprotective in humans. On the other hand, evidence is accumulating that this compound is a potent genotoxin in mammalian cells by itself. To further elucidate the potential hazards of BITC, we investigated its genotoxic effects in different in vitro genotoxicity tests and in animal models. In in-vitro experiments [differential DNA repair assay with Escherichia coli, micronucleus assay with human HepG2 cells and single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay with hepatocytes and gastrointestinal tract cells] pronounced dose-dependent genotoxic effects were found at low dose levels (less than or equal to 5 mu g/ml). In contrast, substantially weaker effects were obtained in in vivo experiments with laboratory rodents: in the differential DNA repair assay with E. coli cells, only moderate genotoxic effects were seen in indicator cells recovered from various organs of mice after treatment with high doses (between 90 and 270 mg/kg), while in SCGE assay with rats a change in the DNA migration pattern was seen at a dose level of 220 mg/ kg body wt. These findings indicate that BITC is detoxified under in vivo test conditions. This assumption was supported by the results of in vitro experiments which showed that the genotoxic effects of BITC are markedly reduced by bovine serum albumin and human body fluids such as saliva and gastric juice. Additional experiments carried out on the mechanistic aspects of the genotoxicity of BITC showed that this compound causes formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances in HepG2 cells and that its DNA damaging properties are diminished by alpha-tocopherol, vitamin C, sodium benzoate and beta-carotene, indicating the possible involvement of free radicals in the genotoxicity of BITC. The doses of BITC required to cause measurable DNA damage in laboratory rodents exceeded by far the dietary exposure levels of humans, but are similar to those which were required to inhibit chemically induced cancer in earlier animal experiments.

AB  - Holocene biotic and abiotic marine calcite have a similar range of Mg contents (0 to 22 and 4 to 21 mol% MgCO3, respectively), yet biotic calcite has Sr2+ concentrations that are consistently 1250 ppm higher than those of abiotic calcite. As in laboratory experiments, a positive linear relation is observed between D(Sr) and calcite Mg content. This produces two distinct linear trends on a plot of Sr2+ vs. Mg2+ concentrations. Principal axes of variation for both trends have similar slopes, yet distinctly different Sr2+ concentration intercepts. (Biotic: y = 0.024x + 1298, r2 = 0.70; Abiotic: y = 0.027x + 47, r2 = 0.77). The similar slopes of these trends reflect the constancy of Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios of modern seawater. Equations describing the dependence of D(sr) on calcite Mg content are derived from both trends (Biotic: D(sr) = 3.16 X 10(-6) (ppm Mg) + 0.169; Abiotic: D(sr) = 3.52 X 10(-6) (ppm Mg) + 0.0062). Characterization of Sr-Mg trends for Holocene materials allows comparison with analogous trends from ancient samples to estimate relative changes in seawater Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios.
   The relatively high Sr contents of biotic calcite result from rapid precipitation rates associated with shell accretion in marine organisms. Calcites precipitated from seawater in laboratory experiments have D(sr) values that are similar to those of biotic marine calcite, suggesting that both precipitate at approximately the same rate. Our estimates of surface area-normalized precipitation rates in planktonic and benthonic foraminifera are comparable to those of seeded, pH-stat experiments. We conclude that the D(sr) values for biotic and experimental marine calcite are kinetically controlled, whereas the lower precipitation rates of abiotic marine calcite yield D(sr) values that approximate equilibrium conditions.
   Experimentally derived equations describing the relation between D(sr) and calcite precipitation rate indicate that the offset in Sr content between biotic and abiotic calcite is the result of abiotic precipitation rates that are two to five orders of magnitude lower than those of biotic precipitates. However, observations of naturally occurring marine cements suggest that the five-order-of-magnitude offset best represents natural system processes.

AB  - The evaluation of a chemical substance's persistence is key to understanding its environmental fate, exposure concentration, and, ultimately, environmental risk. Traditional biodegradation test methods were developed many years ago for soluble, nonvolatile, single-constituent test substances, which do not represent the wide range of manufactured chemical substances. In addition, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) screening and simulation test methods do not fully reflect the environmental conditions into which substances are released and, therefore, estimates of chemical degradation half-lives can be very uncertain and may misrepresent real environmental processes. In this paper, we address the challenges and limitations facing current test methods and the scientific advances that are helping to both understand and provide solutions to them. Some of these advancements include the following: (1) robust methods that provide a deeper understanding of microbial composition, diversity, and abundance to ensure consistency and/or interpret variability between tests; (2) benchmarking tools and reference substances that aid in persistence evaluations through comparison against substances with well-quantified degradation profiles; (3) analytical methods that allow quantification for parent and metabolites at environmentally relevant concentrations, and inform on test substance bioavailability, biochemical pathways, rates of primary versus overall degradation, and rates of metabolite formation and decay; (4) modeling tools that predict the likelihood of microbial biotransformation, as well as biochemical pathways; and (5) modeling approaches that allow for derivation of more generally applicable biotransformation rate constants, by accounting for physical and/or chemical processes and test system design when evaluating test data. We also identify that, while such advancements could improve the certainty and accuracy of persistence assessments, the mechanisms and processes by which they are translated into regulatory practice and development of new OECD test guidelines need improving and accelerating. Where uncertainty remains, holistic weight of evidence approaches may be required to accurately assess the persistence of chemicals. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2022;1-34. (c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - An individual merino sheep's output of wool production is influenced by synergistic interactions of sheep genetics, climate, farm management, and nutrition available to the whole flock. The price paid to the producer for this wool commodity is determined via numerous tested parameters and/or subjective appraisal of the raw greasy wool. This research investigated the level of variation in wool cortisol (a physiological stress biomarker) and wool micron (MIC) in Merino ewes (Ovis aries), pre-partum and post-lambing (lactation/lambs at foot), using maiden ewe (n = 38) managed in an outdoor paddock in a commercial farm. The key findings of this study are; (1) wool quality indicators showed a significant variation between pre- and post-parturition including significant reduction in MIC and (2) there was a negative correlation between wool cortisol levels and wool micron pre-parturition (rs = -0.179, p < 0.05). This relationship between wool cortisol and wool micron was positive (rs = +0.29, p < 0.05) during post-parturition suggesting that ewes with lambs at foot ended up with finer wool (reduction in fibre diameter) but they also maintained high levels of wool cortisol. Furthermore, the comfort factor, curvature, standard deviation and spin fineness of the wool were also significantly reduced post-parturition. The results of this study show that metabolic resources partitioning in ewe associated with pregnancy and lambing can result in a reduction in wool quality indices. The activity of the HPA-axis is attenuated during late gestation and parturition as a maternal adaptation; however, the results of our study show that wool cortisol remained similar between pre- and post-lambing. This result indicates that environmental stressors that may have been operating on farm (e.g., cold winter period) could influence on maternal physiological stress response however the exact level of influence of environment conditions on ewe stress levels and productivity traits (e.g., lambing success and wool quality) warrants further investigation. In conclusion, the use of top-knot wool sampling in combination with wool cortisol analysis provides researchers with a convenient method to quantify wool quality and physiological stress simultaneously under commercial sheep production.

AB  - Lakes cover large parts of the climatically sensitive Arctic landscape and respond rapidly to environmental change. Arctic lakes have different origins and include the predominant thermokarst lakes, which are small, young and highly dynamic, as well as large, old and stable glacial lakes. Freshwater diatoms dominate the primary producer community in these lakes and can be used to detect biotic responses to climate and environmental change. We used specific diatom metabarcoding on sedimentary DNA, combined with next-generation sequencing and diatom morphology, to assess diatom diversity in five glacial and 15 thermokarst lakes within the easternmost expanse of the Siberian treeline ecotone in Chukotka, Russia. We obtained 163 verified diatom sequence types and identified 176 diatom species morphologically. Although there were large differences in taxonomic assignment using the two approaches, they showed similar high abundances and diversity of Fragilariceae and Aulacoseiraceae. In particular, the genetic approach detected hidden within-lake variations of fragilarioids in glacial lakes and dominance of centric Aulacoseira species, whereas Lindavia ocellata was predominant using morphology. In thermokarst lakes, sequence types and valve counts also detected high diversity of Fragilariaceae, which followed the vegetation gradient along the treeline. Ordination analyses of the genetic data from glacial and thermokarst lakes suggest that concentrations of sulfate (SO42-), an indicator of the activity of sulfate-reducing microbes under anoxic conditions, and bicarbonate (HCO3-), which relates to surrounding vegetation, have a significant influence on diatom community composition. For thermokarst lakes, we also identified lake depth as an important variable, but SO42- best explains diatom diversity derived from genetic data, whereas HCO3- best explains the data from valve counts. Higher diatom diversity was detected in glacial lakes, most likely related to greater lake age and different edaphic settings, which gave rise to diversification and endemism. In contrast, small, dynamic thermokarst lakes are inhabited by stress-tolerant fragilarioids and are related to different vegetation types along the treeline ecotone. Our study demonstrated that genetic investigations of lake sediments can be used to interpret climate and environmental responses of diatoms. It also showed how lake type affects diatom diversity, and that such genetic analyses can be used to track diatom community changes under ongoing warming in the Arctic.

AB  - The predawn leaf water potential (psi(pd)) is an eco-physiological indicator widely used for assessing vines water status and thus supporting irrigation management in several wine regions worldwide. However, the.pd is measured in a short time period before sunrise and the collection of a large sample of points is necessary to adequately represent a vineyard, which constitute operational constraints. In the present study, an alternative method based on hyperspectral data derived from a handheld spectroradiometer and machine learning algorithms was tested and validated for assessing grapevine water status. Two test sites in Douro wine region, integrating three grapevine cultivars, were studied for the years of 2014, 2015, and 2017. Four machine learning regression algorithms were tested for predicting the psi(pd) as a continuous variable, namely Random Forest (RF), Bagging Trees (BT), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Variational Heteroscedastic Gaussian Process Regression (VH-GPR). Three predicting variables, including two vegetation indices (NRI554,561 and WI900,970) and a time-dynamic variable based on the psi(pd) (psi(pd_0)), were applied for modelling the response variable (psi(pd)). Additionally, the predicted values of psi(pd) were aggregated into three classes representing different levels of water deficit (low, moderate, and high) and compared with the corresponding classes of.pd observed values. A root mean square error (RMSE) and a mean absolute error (MAE) lower or equal than 0.15 MPa and 0.12 MPa, respectively, were obtained with an external validation data set (n= 71 observations) for the various algorithms. When the modelling results were assessed through classes of values, a high overall accuracy was obtained for all the algorithms (82-83%), with prediction accuracy by class ranging between 79% and 100%. These results show a good performance of the predictive models, which considered a large variability of climatic, environmental, and agronomic conditions, and included various grape cultivars. By predicting both continuous values of.pd and classes of psi(pd), the approach presented in this study allowed obtaining 2-levels of accurate information about vines water status, which can be used to feed management decisions of different types of stakeholders.

AB  - The advance experienced by information technologies, and specifically the development of Internet technologies has had its maximum exponent in the progressive deployment of new services and applications for companies, which is leading SMEs to react to the digital transformation of business to adapt to new demands. Within this group of companies are cooperatives that face markets that require more personalized and flexible conceptions of the product or service. In response to these demands, cooperatives have to connect with the environment to capture the needs of customers and partners, and obtain information that helps to meet their needs. For this, it is essential that they are equipped with corporate Web sites that help to generate information and knowledge useful as a support to make decisions and anticipate changes. The objective of this work is to know which are the indicators that explain the quality of the information that small and medium-sized cooperatives in the Canary Islands disclose through the corporate website. To achieve this, it is based on the Delone and McLean model (2002 and 2003) adapted to the websites of 24 cooperatives that are identified using the SABI database and whose data are analyzed by applying the Rasch Model (1980). The results correspond to the total active cooperative Web site and reveal that the quality of information shared by cooperatives through the Web site is based more on information about products and useful information than on information for partners and customers, with some indicatos being conditioned by the province where they are located and the period in which they are created. Therefore, cooperatives should not only value maintaining a corporate website to share complete, up-to-date, relevant and accurate information, but also should communicate and carry out transactions with partners and customers that meet their needs and expectations. The conclusions obtained show that, in general, selected small and medium cooperatives use static and structured Web sites without having evolved towards business portals, and that they miss out on the information they can collect from the site to predict and interpret behaviors of partners and clients, as well as to offer products and services tailored to their preferences.

AB  - Reproductive potential is the most important conditional indicator reflecting the ability of individuals in a population to reproduce, survive and develop under optimal environmental conditions. As for humans, the concept of reproductive potential can include the level of the individual's mental and physical state, which allows them to reproduce healthy offspring when they reach social and physical maturity. Female reproductive potential has been investigated in great detail, whereas the male reproductive potential (MRP) has not received the equal amount of attention as yet. Therefore, here we focused on the human Y chromosome and found candidate single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers of MRP. With our development named Web-service SNP_TATA_Z-tester, we examined in silico all 35 unannotated SNPs within 70-bp proximal promoters of the three Y-linked genes, CDY2A, SHOX and ZFY, which represent all types of human Y-chromosome genes, namely: unique, pseudo-autosomal, and human X-chromosome gene paralogs, respectively. As a result, we found 11 candidate SNP markers for MRP, which can significantly alter the TATA-binding protein ( TBP) binding affinity for promoters of these genes. First of all, we selectively verified in vitro the values of the TBP-promoter affinity under this study, Pearson's linear correlation between predicted and measured values of which were r = 0.94 (significance p < 0.005). Next, as a discussion, using keyword search tools of the PubMed database, we found clinically proven physiological markers of human pathologies, which correspond to a change in the expression of the genes carrying the candidate SNP markers predicted here. These were markers for spermatogenesis disorders (ZFY: rs1388535808 and rs996955491), for male maturation arrest (CDY2A: rs200670724) as well as for disproportionate short stature at Madelung deformity (e. g., SHOX: rs1452787381) and even for embryogenesis disorders (e. g., SHOX: rs28378830). This indicates a wide range of MRI indicators, alterations in which should be expected in the case of SNPs in the promoters of the human Y-chromosome genes and which can go far beyond changes in male fertility.

AB  - The survival of the sugar industry in South Africa is under threat due to an unstable and low sugar price, high production cost and old infrastructure. At present, coal and sugarcane bagasse are used as fuels in an inefficient boiler to generate the heat and electricity required by the plant. Moreover, the residues produced during the sugarcane agriculture stage are burnt in the field causing serious concerns in the nearby rural areas. The progress in the conversion of lignocellulosic residues to valuable chemicals in the South African sugar mills would bring benefits in sustainability and both rural and industrial economic development. Sugarcane bagasse and green harvesting residues are the largest lignocellulosic wastes in the production of sugar from sugar cane. They are seen as promising feedstock to improve the long-term sustainability of the local sugar mill. Integrated biorefinery-sugar mill scenarios using sugarcane harvesting residues, bagasse and molasses as feedstock to co-produce chemicals and electricity are evaluated in this work for the first time. The integration of plants was designed in a way to provide both economic and environmental benefits. The following lignocellulOse biorefineries were simulated in Aspen Plus V8.8: (SM LE) Co-production of sugar and lactic acid, and (SM LF) co-production of sugar, lactic acid, and furfural. Surplus power was produced in both scenarios for export. Both scenarios were simulated based on literature and experiment data presented in this work. Experiments were conducted on the bagasse pretreatment using dilute acid, and the conversion of hemicellulose into furfural product. The results of techno-economic assessment showed that both scenarios are economically feasible under the considered conditions and provide strong economic benefits in comparison with an existing sugar mill. Among the biorefinery scenarios, the SM LF scenario has better economic performance than SM LE. In terms of environmental assessment, both scenarios demonstrate a significant reduction in climate change, fossil fuel depletion, freshwater ecotoxicity and eutrophication and human toxicity impacts in the South African context. In a nutshell, biorefineries demonstrate potential to be a feasible and more sustainable alternative to the existing sugar mills in the South African context.

AB  - The authors analyse the causes, manifestations and possible ways of overcoming and reducing the scale of absenteeism as a phenomenon in the context of modern socio-political processes and transformations. The dominant characteristic of current elections is the widespread repudiation of the electoral system, political campaigns, parties and candidates. The authors reveal the essence of absenteeism, illustrate the forms of its manifestation, identify the reasons for political absenteeism as a personal position of a citizen, a political phenomenon and an integral part of the electoral and political processes. They also give a detailed typology of factors of absenteeism. The nature of absenteeism is revealed in the article in a multifaceted way: as an individual's political position (the aspect of individual choice), as a social phenomenon (an indicator of the level of involvement in politics of population groups) and as an inevitable element of the electoral process (reasons preventing the expression of the will of citizens). There is a methodology for analysing the indices and the voter confidence factor for candidates and political parties. The effects and consequences of the expansion of models of consumer and mass societies in hybrid and transitional regimes are considered. It is argued that in modern conditions it is necessary to link the solution of the problem of absenteeism with a broader cultural and identity problem, with a more complete description of the changes in the nature and status of various electoral groups. It is noted that it is necessary to link all kinds of decisions with a qualitatively new understanding of democracy (electronic, network, etc.). It is also promising to link the solution of the problem of absenteeism with the idea of a multi-level identity (the Swiss philosopher Denis de Rougemont) - local, regional, national, global-confessional -which, in the authors' opinion, is able to effectively solve the problem of political participation in multi-component societies, giving democracy (including in its electoral form) a new stimulus to development. To solve the problem of absenteeism, a new model of the political market is obviously proposed, its demonopolised model assuming that it is not dominated by the "seller" (the community of professional politicians) but by the "buyer" of such services - voters and all citizens acting on the basis of a developed feedback from the institutions of power and government. The article is a theoretical and methodological one.

AB  - Binaural sensitivity is an important contributor to the ability to understand speech in adverse acoustical environments such as restaurants and other social gatherings. The ability to accurately report on binaural percepts is not commonly measured, however, as extensive training is required before reliable measures can be obtained. Here, we investigated the use of auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) as a rapid physiological indicator of detection of interaural phase differences (IPDs) by assessing cortical responses to 180. IPDs embedded in amplitude-modulated carrier tones. We predicted that decrements in encoding of IPDs would be evident inmiddle age, with further declines found with advancing age and hearing loss. Thus, participants in experiment # 1 were young to middle-aged adults with relatively good hearing thresholds while participants in experiment # 2 were older individuals with typical age-related hearing loss. Results revealed that while many of the participants in experiment # 1 could encode IPDs in stimuli up to 1,000 Hz, few of the participants in experiment # 2 had discernable responses to stimuli above 750Hz. These results are consistent with previous studies that have found that aging and hearing loss impose frequency limits on the ability to encode interaural phase information present in the fine structure of auditory stimuli. We further hypothesized that AEP measures of binaural sensitivity would be predictive of participants' ability to benefit from spatial separation between sound sources, a phenomenon known as spatial release from masking (SRM) which depends upon binaural cues. Results indicate that not only were objective IPD measures well correlated with and predictive of behavioral SRM measures in both experiments, but that they provided much stronger predictive value than age or hearing loss. Overall, the present work shows that objective measures of the encoding of interaural phase information can be readily obtained using commonly available AEP equipment, allowing accurate determination of the degree to which binaural sensitivity has been reduced in individual listeners due to aging and/or hearing loss. In fact, objective AEP measures of interaural phase encoding are actually better predictors of SRM in speech-in-speech conditions than are age, hearing loss, or the combination of age and hearing loss.

AB  - Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a long-chain perfluorinated chemical that has been shown to be non-degradable and persistent in the environment. Laboratory studies on bioconcentration and compound-specific tissue distribution in fish can be valuable for prediction of the persistence and environmental effects of the chemicals. In the present study male and female zebrafish (Danio redo) were continuously exposed to 10 mu g/L of radiolabeled perfluorooctanoic acid (C-14-PFOA) for 40 days, after which the exposed fish were transferred to fresh clean water for another 80 days wash-out period. At defined periodic intervals during the uptake and wash-out, fish were sampled for liquid scintillation counting and whole body autoradiography to profile the bioconcentration and tissue distribution of PFOA. The steady-state concentration of C-14-PFOA in the zebrafish was reached within 20-30 days of exposure. The concentration-time course of C-14-PFOA displayed a bi-exponential decline during washout, with a terminal half-life of approximately 13-14 days. At steady-state the bioconcentration of C-14-PFOA into whole-body fish was approximately 20-30 times greater than that of the exposure concentration, with no differences between females and males. The bioconcentration factors for liver and intestine were approximately 100-fold of the exposure medium, while in brain, ovary and gall bladder the accumulation factors were in the range 15-20. Whole-body autoradiograms confirmed the highest labeling of PFOA in bile and intestines, which implies enterohepatic circulation of PFOA. The C-14-PFOA was also observed in maturing vitellogenic oocytes, suggesting chemical accumulation via yolk proteins into oocytes with plausible risk for adverse effects on early embryonic development and offspring health. The bioconcentration at several C-14-PFOA exposure concentrations were also investigated (0.3-30 mu g/L). This showed that bioconcentration increased linearly with tank exposure in the present in vivo model under steady-state conditions. From this model tissue concentrations of PFOA can be predicted when the external exposure level is known. The present study has generated experimental data on PFOA kinetics in zebrafish that can be valuable for aquatic environmental risk assessment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Thousands of tons of animal and human wastes are produced every day across the globe. Their continuous use as fertilizers or soil amendments on agricultural lands has raised severe health and environmental concerns. Incorporating bio-wastes into the soil is one of the best management strategies to control the run-off of nutrients from the soil surface and, in turn, protect freshwater. However, exposing bio-waste to sunlight in the field is considered to be one of the most cost-effective methods to control pathogens. Considering the differences among different bio-waste management strategies, there is a need for a review of the current knowledge on the practice of spreading bio-wastes onto the soil surface. Specifically, this information would help us to better understand the fate of pathogens upon their exposure to the open environment, how the presence of bio-waste on the soil surface can threaten humans and the environment, and the costs and benefits of surface-applied bio-wastes. Current review of the literature revealed a lack of understanding of the factors responsible for killing pathogens on the soil surface. More than 150 pathogens (including different viruses, bacteria, protozoan and helminth) have been reported to be present in different bio-wastes, but the majority of studies have focused on a few common pathogens. Similarly, over the last decade, each year at least 1 new pathogen is being reported which can threat public health but there is a paucity of knowledge concerning the fate of pathogens under field conditions. Similarly, the techniques used for the detection of pathogens were found to be variable and inconclusive, making it difficult to compare the results of different studies. Therefore, given that the tools for the evaluation of pathogens have serious limitations and the survival characteristics of many (old and emerging) pathogens are yet to be discovered, the spreading of bio-wastes (treated or untreated) onto the soil surface (i.e., unincorporated) may not only further increase the threat for human health but also further aggravate the environment.

AB  - Small pelagic fishes off southern California exhibit interannual variations in the regions they occupy. An enhanced understanding of these fluctuations could improve fisheries management and predictions of fish's responses to climate change. We investigated dynamic height as a variable for identifying the spawning habitat of northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), and jack mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus). During cruises between 1998 and 2004, dynamic height was calculated from temperature and salinity profiles, while fish egg concentration was measured with obliquely towed bongo nets and the Continuous, Underway Fish Egg Sampler. Dynamic height ranged between 68 and 108 cm, with values increasing offshore. The greatest probability of encountering anchovy, sardine, and jack mackerel eggs occurred at dynamic heights of 79-83 cm, 84-89 cm, and 89-99 cm, respectively. Four mechanisms were proposed to explain how dynamic height affects egg distribution: (1) dynamic height is a proxy for upper water column temperature and salinity, which are known to influence spawning habitat. (2) Low dynamic heights are indicative of coastal upwelling, which increases primary and secondary productivity. (3) Egg concentration is greater at dynamic heights coincident with geostrophic currents that transport larvae to favorable habitats. (4) Eddies delineated by dynamic height contours retain eggs in productive habitats. To evaluate these mechanisms, a generalized linear model was constructed using dynamic height, temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, zooplankton volume, geostrophic currents, and eddies as independent variables. Dynamic height explained more variance than any other variable in models of sardine and anchovy spawning habitat. Together temperature, salinity, and chlorophyll accounted for 80-95% of the dynamic height effect, emphasizing the importance of the first two mechanisms. However, dynamic height remained statistically significant in the models of anchovy and jack mackerel spawning habitat after considering the effects of all other variables. Dynamic height shows promise as an ecological indicator of spawning habitat, because it integrates the effects of multiple oceanic variables, can be remotely sensed, and is predicted by ocean circulation models.

AB  - Pontoscolex corethrurus (Annelidae: Oligochaeta) soil quality indicator in Eucalyptus grandis (Myrtacea) sites with slash and burn management. Soil burning has been used in agricultural and forestry systems as a fundamental technique to clean the land and add some nutrients to the soil. In addition, earthworms are known to promote various soil functions since they contribute to aeration and organic matter and nutrients availability to other soil organisms. This study evaluated the effects of tropical forest crops management with presence-absence of Eucalyptus grandis on earthworm population in Huimanquillo, Tabasco, Mexico. Three sites (average area of 1-1.5ha each) with different management conditions were considered for soil and earthworm sampling (two depths and six replicates): without vegetation (SV) and recent slash-burned (38 days), forest crops of five years of production of E. grandis (Euc), and secondary vegetation of 15 years (Acah). Soil physico-chemical properties (apparent density, humidity, texture, pH, Ntot, OM, P, K, cationic capacity) were also evaluated, and earthworms were collected at the end of the rainy season (august-october 2007). We found that the sites soil is an acrisol acid, with pH 3.0-4.5 in the first 30cm depth. Organic matter content (OM) and total nitrogen (Ntot) in the recently burned sites were significantly lower (6-8% y 0.19-0.22%, respectively) than in sites with vegetation (OM=9-11%; el Ntot=0.27-0.33%). Only one species (P corethrurus) was found in all the sampled areas, where most of the individuals were at juvenile stage (80%). The highest densities and biomass were found in Euc. treatment (166.4ind/m(2) y 36.8g/m(2)) followed by Acah (138.7ind/m(2) y 19.1g/m(2) respectively), while the SV treatment showed of about an 80% reduced earthworm populations when compared to other treatments. Even though 15 years have passed over the secondary vegetation (Acah) still some perturbations were observed as the low abundance of the oligochaeta group. We concluded that the management used to culture E. grandis produces negative effects over the abundance and diversity of earthworms and soil nutrient availability. Rev. Biol. Trop. 60 (4): 1543-1552. Epub 2012 December 01.

AB  - 1. Birds of marine environments have specialized glands to excrete salt, the saltglands. Located on the skull between the eyes, the size of these organs is expected to reflect their demand, which will vary with water turnover rates as a function of environmental (heat load, salinity of prey and drinking water) and organismal (energy demand, physiological state) factors. On the basis of inter- and intraspecific comparisons of saltgland mass (msg) in 29 species of shorebird (suborder Charadrii) from saline, fresh and mixed water habitats, we assessed the relative roles of organism and environment in determining measured msg species. 2. The allometric exponent, scaling dry msg to shorebird total body mass (mb), was significantly higher for coastal marine species (0 88, N = 19) than for nonmarine species (0 43, N = 14). Within the marine species, those ingesting bivalves intact had significantly higher msg than species eating soft-bodied invertebrates, indicating that seawater contained within the shells added to the salt load. 3. In red knots (Calidris canutus), dry msg varied with monthly averaged ambient temperature in a U-shaped way, with the lowest mass at 12 5 degrees C. This probably reflects increased energy demand for thermoregulation at low temperatures and elevated respiratory water loss at high temperatures. In fuelling bar-tailed godwits (Limosa lapponica), dry msg was positively correlated with intestine mass, an indicator of relative food intake rates. These findings suggest once more that saltgland masses vary within species (and presumably individuals) in relation to salt load, that is a function of energy turnover (thermoregulation and fuelling) and evaporative water needs. 4. Our results support the notion that msg is strongly influenced by habitat salinity, and also by factors influencing salt load and demand for osmotically free water including ambient temperature, prey type and energy intake rates. Saltglands are evidently highly flexible organs. The small size of saltglands when demands are low suggests that any time costs of adjustment are lower than the costs of maintaining a larger size in this small but essential piece of metabolic machinery.

AB  - The Sab'atayn Basin is a major hydrocarbon province in Yemen. Important source rocks occur in Upper Jurassic units (Lam Member of the Madbi Formation, Sab'atayn Formation). Depositional environment, source potential and maturity of the source rocks were investigated using 60 cuttings samples from the Tagina South-1 Well. All samples were analysed for bulk parameters (total organic carbon (TOC), carbonate, sulphur, RockEval). A subset of samples was selected for biomarker analysis, pyrolysis-gas chromatography and isotope investigations.
   A carbonate-rich, euhaline, dysoxic to anoxic environment prevailed during deposition of the Lam Member. Bituminous shales within the overlying Sab'atayn Formation formed in a hypersaline, strictly anoxic depositional setting. Changes in the phytoplankton communities coincide with the outlined changes in the water body. Upward decreasing delta C-13 values suggest changes in carbon cycling due to changing redox conditions.
   The Lam Member, at least 500 m thick, is a good to very good source rock with an average TOC of 2.2%. The hydrogen index is controlled by maturity, but reaches 300 mg HC/g TOC in samples with low maturity (type II-III kerogen). The Lam Member produces sulphur-poor, paraffinic-naphthenic-aromatic low-wax oil. Bituminous shales in the Sab'atayn Formation contain up to 11% TOC and a type II (to III) kerogen (HI: up to 427 mg HC/g TOC). These shales are excellent sources for oil (and gas), but their source potential is limited by their relatively low thickness. Both, bituminous shales in the Sab'atayn Formation and the Lam Member are mature. The maturity of the deepest drilled part of the Lam Member is close to the zone of main oil generation. Numeric models show that Cenozoic heat flow is about 50 mW/m(2). An increase in heat flow during Jurassic rifting is likely, but cannot be quantified. Major hydrocarbon generation occurred during Eocene-Oligocene times (assuming a Late Cretaceous heat flow of 50 mW/m(2)) or during both, Late Cretaceous and Eocene-Oligocene times (assuming a Late Cretaceous heat flow of 68 mW/m(2)).

AB  - Long-term field experiments are the conventional means for developing; evaluating and demonstrating site-specific land/water use plans. However, it has been often observed that at times they are unable to propose sustainable practices, when planned for shorter time durations (say 2-3 years) or become cost-ineffective and obsolete, when planned for longer time durations (say more than 15 years or so). Hence, what should be the ideal length of such long-term experiments has always been a debatable issue. The present study attempts to demonstrate application of one indigenously developed decision support system (DSS) for planning appropriate length of long term conjunctive water use experiments on a test salt affected farmer's field. Before application the proposed DSS was extensively validated on several farmers and controlled experimental fields in Haryana (India). Validation of DSS showed its potential to give realistic estimates of root zone soil salinity; sodicity and salt stress induced relative crop yield reductions under local resource management conditions. Long term impact assessment of varied conjunctive water use strategies, on the test farmer's field, with the so validated DSS showed that the time required for achieving stable crop yields could be treated as a good measure of the minimum length of such experiments. For the test (rice-wheat growing) farmer's field, this time ranged between 5.5-6.0 years. It was observed that at shorter time scale (i.e. 2 years), though application of 50% canal waters (CW) blended with 50% tube well waters (TW), was as productive and superior as cyclic applications of (2CW, 1TW, 1CW); (1CW, 1TW, 2CW) and (CW: TW) during wheat cropping season yet it could not maintain its superior performance at DSS proposed time duration of 6 years or more. Similarly irrigation practice of (4CW, 5TW) during rice cropping season, though beneficial at shorter time scale, was much inferior to the cyclic application of canal and tube well waters (i.e. CW: TW) at longer time scales (i.e. at 3 6 years). Hence, limiting the proposed long-term conjunctive water use experiment to the DSS proposed minimum time duration of 6 years lead to the selection of the most stable and sustainable irrigation practice(s) for the test farm.

AB  - Tidal marshes are valued, protected and restored in recognition of their ecosystem services: (1) high productivity and habitat provision supporting the food web leading to fish and wildlife, (2) buffer against storm wave damage, (3) shoreline stabilization, (4) flood water storage, (5) water quality maintenance, (6) biodiversity preservation, (7) carbon storage and (8) socio-economic benefits. Under US law, federal and state governments have joint responsibility for facilitating restoration to compensate quantitatively for ecosystem services lost because of oil spills and other contaminant releases on tidal marshes. This responsibility is now met by choosing and employing metrics (proxies) for the suite of ecosystem services to quantify injury and scale restoration accordingly. Most injury assessments in tidal marshes are triggered by oil spills and are limited to: (1) documenting areas covered by heavy, moderate and light oiling; (2) estimating immediate above-ground production toss (based on stem density and height) of the dominant vascular plants within each oiling intensity category and (3) sampling sediments for chemical analyses and depth of contamination, followed by sediment toxicity assays if sediment contamination is high and likely to persist. The percentage of immediate loss of ecosystem services is then estimated along with the recovery trajectory. Here, we review potential metrics that might refine or replace present metrics for marsh injury assessment. Stratifying plant sampling by the more productive marsh edge versus the less accessible interior would improve resolution of injury and provide greater confidence that restoration is truly compensatory. Using microphytobenthos abundance, cotton-strip decomposition bioassays and other biogeochemical indicators, or sum of production across consumer trophic levels faits as a stand-alone substitute metric. Below-ground plant biomass holds promise as a potential proxy for resiliency but requires further testing. Under some conditions, like chronic contamination by organic pollutants that affect animals but not vascular plants, benthic infaunal density, toxicity testing, and tissue contamination, growth, reproduction and mortality of marsh vertebrates deserve inclusion in the assessment protocol. Additional metrics are sometimes justified to assay microphytobenthos, use by nekton, food and habitat for reptiles, birds and mammals, or support of plant diversity. Empirical research on recovery trajectories in previously injured marshes could reduce the largest source of uncertainty in quantifying cumulative service losses.

AB  - In this study, the molecular composition and biomarker distribution of lacustrine sediments from Val-1 drillhole in the central zone of the western part of the Valjevo-Mionica basin were investigated at depth interval of 0-400 m. Former investigations have shown that the core material can be separated into six depth intervals based on bulk geochemical, mineralogical and sedimentological characteristics. Concerning the quality of organic matter, presence of specific minerals, and high salinity and anoxicity, or alkalinity, three zones are of highest interest, defined at depth intervals or 15-75 m (A), 75-200 m (B) and 360-400 m (F). The first aim of the study was to identify which biomarkers characterize these specific intervals. The second aim, addressing the transitions zones of these intervals, was to extend the changes in the characteristics of the organic substance, to reflect the changes of conditions in the depositional environment as well as to define biomarker parameters which are the most sensitive sedimentological indicators.
   The sediments from the hypersaline anoxic and alkaline environment show high contribution of algal precursor biomass, what is in accordance with the good quality of organic substances in the sediments from these zones. High squalane content and low content of regular isoprenoid C-25 are typical for hypersaline anoxic environment, whereas sediments from alkaline environment have high regular isoprenoid C-25 content.
   Transition to specific sedimentation zones is characterized by change in total organic matter content, and of both free and pyrolysis-derived, and change in hydrogen index value. In the biomarker distributions, more significant changes were detected in distributions of n-alkanes and isoprenoids, compared to polycyclic alkanes. The most intensive changes in alkane distribution are reflected in changes in n-C-17 content compared to n-C-17, and phytane compared to n-C-18. In addition, significant sensitivity was seen in ratios between squalane and n-alkane C-26 (hypersaline depositional environment), or isoprenoid C-25 and n-alkane C-22 for high alkalinity environment.
   This study showed that Sq/n-C-26 ratio can be used to assess the quality of organic substance in immature lacustrine sediments. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - The criterion for judging the successful revegetation largely focuses on the aboveground indicators, whereas the information for soil ecosystem during the revegetation is often ignored. To better understand the effects of the revegetation on the development of the soil ecosystem near Shaoguan Pb/Zn Smelter, Guangdong Province of Southern China, we compared the difference of the microbial and physico-chemical parameters between the four revegetated sites and two control sites (bare ground and native forest area). The soil organic C, total N, total P, NH4-N, NO3-N, available P, WHC and porosity significantly increased and bulk density decreased in the four revegetated sites compared with those in bare ground, indicating the processive effects of the revegetation on the reestablishment of the soil nutrient pools. The heavy metal contents were higher in the four revegetated sites than in the bare ground, thus the revegetation resulted in the accumulation of heavy metals released from smelter in surface soil. The soil microbial composition and activities, except that the oligotrophic bacterial number decreased over revegetation time, significantly increased in the revegetated sites compared with those in the bare ground, and predominantly correlated with soil organic C, total N, NH4-N, NO3-N and WHC. The soil oligotrophic bacteria was negatively related to all individual heavy metal contents, thus was the most sensitive indicator in reflecting heavy metal stress, while other microbial parameters, despite not showing negative relationships to the individual heavy metal contents, were sensitive to the potential availability of Pb and Cu (ratio of available to total heavy metal contents), but less sensitive to those of Zn and Cd. Both the principal component analysis (PCA) and the discriminant analysis (DA) resulted from microbial and physico-chemical datasets not only revealed the shifts of the soil physico-chemical and microbial patterns from the unrevegetated to non-polluted conditions, but also implied the possible loss of effects of revegetation on soil remediation in the sites revegetated for four (RIV) and five (RV) years, respectively.

AB  - The biomass, phylogenetic composition, and photoautotrophic metabolism of green sulfur bacteria in the Black Sea was assessed in situ and in laboratory enrichments. In the center of the western basin, bacteriochlorophyll e (BChl e) was detected between depths of 90 and 120 m and reached maxima of 54 and 68 ng liter(-1). High-pressure liquid chromatography analysis revealed a dominance of farnesyl esters and the presence of four unusual geranyl ester homologs of BChl e. Only traces of BChl e (8 ng liter(-1)) were found at the northwestern slope of the Black Sea basin, where the chemocline was positioned at a significantly greater depth of 140 m. Stable carbon isotope fractionation values of farnesol indicated an autotrophic growth mode of the green sulfur bacteria. For the first time, light intensities in the Black Sea chemocline were determined employing an integrating quantum meter, which yielded maximum values between 0.0022 and 0.00075 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1) at the top of the green sulfur bacterial layer around solar noon in December. These values represent by far the lowest values reported for any habitat of photosynthetic organisms. Only one 16S rRNA gene sequence type was detected in the chemocline using PCR primers specific for green sulfur bacteria. This previously unknown phylotype groups with the marine cluster of the Chlorobiaceae and was successfully enriched in a mineral medium containing sulfide, dithionite, and freshly prepared yeast extract. Under precisely controlled laboratory conditions, the enriched green sulfur bacterium proved to be capable of exploiting light intensities as low as 0.015 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1) for photosynthetic (CO2)-C-14 fixation. Calculated in situ doubling times of the green sulfur bacterium range between 3.1 and 26 years depending on the season, and anoxygenic photosynthesis contributes only 0.002 to 0.01% to total sulfide oxidation in the chemocline. The stable population of green sulfur bacteria in the Black Sea chemocline thus represents the most extremely low-light-adapted and slowest-growing type of phototroph known to date.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to use both parametric and probabilistic approaches to analyze water column concentrations of both salinity (24,845 measurements) and boron (13,028 measurements) from numerous investigations conducted in the San Joaquin River watershed from 1985 to 2002 to assess spatial and temporal trends and determine the probability of exceeding regulatory targets during both the irrigation and non-irrigation season. Salinity and boron concentrations from 26 mainstem and tributary sites were highly correlated based on this 17 yr data set. Generally, salinity and boron concentrations were higher in winter/spring and lower in summer/fall; higher concentrations of both constituents were reported in tributary sites when compared with the mainstem San Joaquin River. Approximately half the sites showed showed a negative correlation between flow and both constituents. Concentrations of both salinity and boron were somewhat variable with flow conditions for the other sites. Both linear and curvilinear trends were inconsistent over time. The salinity 90th centiles for the 26 sites ranged from 143 to 7,559 mus cm(-1) with the highest 90th centiles in tributary sites. Probabilistic analysis of salinity 90th centiles by year for five sites with extensive data showed a significant decrease over time at two sites and no significant trend for the other three sites. The probability of exceeding the salinity targets during either the irrigation (700 mum cm(-1)) or non-irrigation (1,000 Its cm(-1)) season was greater than 19% for all but three sites. The boron 90th centiles for the 26 sites ranged from 0.41 to 13.6 mg L-1 with the highest 90th centiles from tributary sites. Probabilistic analysis of the boron 90th centile values by year for the five sites with the most extensive data showed a significant decrease over time at two sites and no significant trend for the other three sites. The probability of exceeding the boron target during the irrigation season (0.80 mg L-1) and non-irrigation (1.0 mg L-1) season was greater that 18% for all but three sites. Results from this analysis have important regulatory implications as targets for both salinity and boron are frequently exceeded at various sites in the San Joaquin River watershed.

AB  - The number of initiatives aimed at the evaluation of Sustainable Forest Management has risen considerably since the UNCED Conference in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. In a large number of countries and regions standards with Principles, Criteria and Indicators of Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) have been developed. In many cases, this development took place within the framework of an intergovernmental or international initiative. Sometimes the initiative was taken by national or local organisations. Standards were often developed for the purpose of forest certification. In this research, 164 standards for SFM were collected worldwide and compared using multivariate statistics. The comparison was carried out using a reference standard specially designed for this purpose. It is a generic tool that can be used for any comparative study between the contents of standards. Although a number of typical sustainability elements are present in most standards, differences between standards are substantial. The main cause of variation between standards is the difference between levels of application. Standards developed for the National level are less detailed and contain many elements concerning monitoring aspects to be evaluated at sub-national scale. The more detailed standards for assessment at the Forest Management Unit (FMU) level combine monitoring aspects with a large number of management aspects. These different conditions between FMU and National/Sub-National Level and, therefore, the need for level-specific Criteria and Indicators are well known and accepted by the forestry profession.
   A second and less known cause of variation between standards is the difference in geographical origin. The observed geographical differences between standards can be explained by biophysical and socio-economic differences between countries and regions. Standards from developing countries in the South most often emphasise the social and economic aspects of sustainability, while they give little attention to the need for research-based information. Standards from industrialised countries in the North on the other hand, strongly emphasise the ecological forest functions and the need for research-based information. Harmonisation among standards is only recommended as far as differences are caused by a lack of capacity or by socio-economic inequity. These deficiencies should be eliminated through international cooperation in order to obtain a more harmonised standard of SFM throughout the world.

AB  - 1. Following an intracellular alkali load (imposed by acetate prepulsing in CO2/HCO3- buffer), intracellular pH (pH(1)) of the guinea-pig ventricular myocyte (recorded from intracellular SNARF fluorescence) recovers to control levels. Recovery has two phases. An initial rapid phase (lasting up to 2 min) is followed by a later slow phase (several minutes). Inhibition of sarcolemmal acid-loading carriers (by removal of extracellular Cl-) inhibits the later, slow phase but the initial rapid recovery phase persists. It also persists in the absence of extracellular Na+ and in the presence of the HCO3- transport inhibitor DIDS (4,4-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2-disulphonic acid).
   2. The rapid recovery phase is not evident if the alkali load has been induced by reducing P-CO2, (from 10 to 5%), and it is inhibited in the absence of CO2/HCO3- buffer (i.e. Hepes buffer). It is also slowed by the carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor acetazolamide (ATZ). We conclude that it is caused by buffering of the alkali load through the hydration of intracellular CO2 (CO2-dependent buffering).
   3. The time course of rapid recovery is consistent with an intracellular CO2 hydration rate constant (k(1)) of 0.36 s(-1) in the presence of CA activity, and 0.14 s(-1) in the absence of CA activity. This latter k(1) value matches the literature value for uncatalysed CO2 hydration in free solution. Natural CO2 hydration is accelerated 2.6-fold in the ventricular myocyte by endogenous CA.
   4. The rapid recovery phase represents a period when the intracellular CO2/HCO3- buffer is out of equilibrium (OOE). Modelling of the recovery phase using our k(1) value, indicates that OOE conditions will normally extend for at least 2 min following a step rise in pH(i) (at constant P-CO2). If CA is inactive, this period can be as long as 5 min. During normal pH, regulation, the recovery rate during these periods cannot be used as a measure of sarcolemmal acid loading since it is a mixture of slow CO2-dependent buffering and transmembrane acid loading. The implication of this finding for quantification of pH, regulation during alkalosis is discussed.

AB  - Biomineralization is a generic term used to indicate biological-mediated mineral formation. In carbonate mineralization, nucleation of crystals can be: (1) controlled directly by the organisms, like in the skeletal formation of most metazoans; (2) induced by microbial communities, by indirect precipitation mediated by their metabolic activities; or (3) influenced by organic matter decay, with mineral precipitation on specific non-living organic cell surfaces. Recognition of these products is a direct marker of biological activity in time and space and is a key element in the study of the biological evolution and of its interactions with the geological processes. In this paper, primary carbonate cements from the Anisian microbial build-up of the 'Monte Facito' Formation (Basilicata region, Southern Italy) have been studied from a geobiological point of view. Optical microscopy, UV-epifluorescence and micro-Raman spectroscopy have been applied to investigate the organic mediation on their precipitation. The cements formed in microcavities or on grain substrates, and often show a microstromatolite-like pattern of growth. They are composed of alternations of cloudy organic and whitish inorganic bands that point to a double phase of mineralization. In the first phase, a biologically induced/influenced biomineralization is confirmed by the presence of organic matter strictly connected with the cloudy bands. This phase is followed by a pure abiotic mineralization that leads to the formation of whitish bands. This process repeated cyclically, ending at the complete filling of the microcavities or because of changes in the chemical conditions of the microsystem, for example, due to burial processes. This model of mineralization is similar to that proposed for primary cements forming in recent beach rocks. The Monte Facito Formation cements could be considered as the product of unconventional biomineralization, and the understanding of their growth process could provide an innovative tool in the research of biological signatures in the fossil record. The term unconventional is here utilized to discriminate this type of biomineralizations from those related to well-known biotic mineralization processes, like those involved in skeletons and microbialites growth, which can be considered as conventional biomineralizations.

AB  - Seawater intrusion is a kind of geological hazard that has strong potential, of highly harmful and is hard to be eliminated in a short period of time. It has seriously threatened the survival and development of human beings, especially those living in the coastal areas. The change of seawater intrusion in Dalian is taken as an example, continuous sampling and chemical experiments are performed on shallow groundwater in three different areas around Dalian City, and the change trend of characteristic of soluble SiO2. The results show that the groundwater in this area is mostly of Na-Cl type and alkaline, and is a transitional type of weathered leaching and evaporation. The soluble SiO2 content in groundwater is 57.56-75.41 mg / L, and the content of SiO2 fluctuates slightly depending on the surrounding environmental conditions. The fluctuation is caused by mineral dissolution, seawater intrusion and water-rock interactions on its path. The content of soluble SiO2 in the water of a single test point at the same time fluctuates as well, and the change in different periods of time is also more obvious. The soluble SiO2 dominates in the form of monomolecular orthosilicic acid, and all kinds of silicates present dissolved, saturated and equilibrium states, and the states transform into each other. The single factor analysis is used to evaluate the content of soluble SiO2 and metal ions in groundwater. The groundwater affected by seawater intrusion in Dalian is analyzed, and the comprehensive evaluation of recent shallow groundwater quality in Dalian is carried out. The total dissolved solids, total hardness, chlorides, sulfates and other indicators are selected as the evaluation criteria, and the comprehensive evaluation and analysis of the characteristics of soluble SiO2 and quality of groundwater in Dalian are performed using fuzzy set which is based on entropy weight and analysis and evaluation method. According to the overall research results, the proportion of saturated mineral species in groundwater in Dalian is relatively high. Therefore, groundwater in the coastal area, as an open system of transition between land and sea, can promote the dissolution of different minerals and the saturated decomposition of water bodies.

AB  - The Ghadames Basin of NW Libya contains more than 10 B brls oil-equivalent in Palaeozoic siliciclastic reservoirs which are charged by organic-rich "hot shales" in the Lower Silurian (Rhuddanian) Tanezzuft Formation. Geochemical analysis of 85 shale samples and ten oils from three fields (NC2, NC4 and NC7) in the central and northern part of the basin provides a robust description of the Tanezzuft - Mamuniyat/Acacus petroleum system in this region, and of the associated source facies and oil families. The shale samples underwent total organic carbon (TOC) analysis and Rock-Eval pyrolysis, and the ten crude oil samples were analysed by gas chromatography - flame ionization detection (GC-FID) and GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of the saturated and aromatic hydrocarbon fractions, accompanied by stable carbon isotopic analysis. Organic matter ranges from Type II to mixed Type II/III kerogen with varying oil and gas generation potential in the early to main stages of the oil generation window.
   The analysed oils are characterised by low sulphur, nickel and vanadium contents, and relatively high API gravity (34.9-46.8 degrees API). Biomarkers suggest that they were generated from marine shales containing abundant Type II to mixed Type II/III kerogen deposited in mildly anoxic - suboxic conditions with a dominance of C-29 over C-27 or C-28 steranes, indicative of a source rich in brown algae and cyanobacteria. Their close stratigraphic association and biomarker characteristics support a Tanezzuft "hot shales" source for the Mamuniyat and Acacus oils in the three fields. Maturity-related parameters based on terpanes, steranes, aromatic hydrocarbons and low molecular-weight hydrocarbons, suggest generation from marine shales in the early to peak oil-generation window. The ZE3-NC7, A19-NC7 and A20 NC7 oils from the NC7 oil field are significantly more mature than those from the NC2 and NC4 fields. This indicates a difference in expulsion timing and may be related to the presence of two "hot shales" or to fault-triggered vertical migration preceding and during the Neogene.

AB  - We offer here an extension of our previous work [Apostolidis and Beris, J. Rheol. 58, 607-633 (2014)] of modeling blood flow rheology in simple shear steady state flows to time-dependent conditions. The basis of our model is a scalar, structural, parameter thixotropic model. More specifically, we show that a modified version of the "Delaware model" [A. Mujumdar et al., J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 102, 157-178 (2002)] is capable of predicting the time-dependent shear flow rheology of blood at low and moderate values of shear rate. At steady state, the model reduces to the Casson constitutive model for low and moderate shear rate values consistent to the findings of our previously mentioned work. At high shear rates it reduces to a Newtonian model, correcting our previous model and consistent to data from the literature [Merrill and Pelletier, J. Appl. Physiol. 23, 178-182 (1967)]. Exploiting the existing parameterization developed before for the steady state Casson model and the Merrill and Pelletier steady state data, the transient thixotropic model introduces only three additional parameters. Each one of these parameters has a specific physical meaning: A zero-shear rate maximum strain, and two kinematic parameters governing the relaxation of the structural parameter and the elastic modulus, respectively. The model is able to naturally account for the additional yield strengthening effect attributable to the red blood cell rouleaux structures developed within blood. The proposed model can fit excellently the experimental data of Bureau et al. [Biorheology 17, 191-203 (1980)], on simple triangular steps in shear flow at low shear rates. The predictions of the present model are then validated comparing them against additional experimental data, collected on the same samples, either on triangular steps in shear flow but at higher shear rates or on rectangular step-up and step-down experiments. The model is further validated by comparing its predictions against recent large amplitude oscillatory shear data [P. C. Sousa et al., Biorheology 50, 269-282 (2013)]. In all these comparisons there is good, at least semi-quantitative, agreement, with the observed discrepancies only appearing at the higher shear rates, where the isotropic description resulting from the use of a single scalar internal parameter to describe the blood microstructure naturally breaks down.

AB  - In this study, large-scale flume systems simulating an oligotrophic river were used to explore the fate and transport of the fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) Escherichia coli and enterococci following a combined sewer overflow (CSO). Specifically, the removal pattern of FIB from the water column was examined as well as deposition onto the flume bed. Finally, the impact that a sudden increase in bed shear stress has on FIB in the water column was investigated. The large-scale flumes utilized in this study proved extremely useful for our investigations as they very closely approximated conditions within the Isar River (Munich, Germany). By using both natural substratum and fresh river water, as well as a flow velocity of nearly 1 m s(-1) at a water depth of roughly 0.5 m, shear stresses typical of the Isar River (9 N m(-2)) were achieved. As a result, scaling effects were appreciably reduced. In our flume system, UV inactivation played only a minimal role in overall FIB removal. Therefore, we were able to more precisely investigate other mechanisms which result in FIB removal from the water column. From the two standard FIB removal experiments following a CSO, the removal rate coefficient (k) of 0.2 h(-1) was identified for both E. coli and enterococci in the water column. An increase in the bed shear stress led to more than a 150% rise in total suspended solid (TSS) levels in the water column. These elevated TSS levels (approximate to 50 mg l(-1)) increased the persistence of suspended FIB in the water column by 20 h (k = 0.05 h(-1)). This indicates that higher TSS loads resulting from resuspended bed sediments can significantly expand the area that is impacted by a CSO event. At lower TSS loads (<20 mg l(-1)) deposition onto the flume bed did not contribute significantly to FIB removal from the water column. Any deposition which did occur did not result in a net accumulation of culturable FIB in the benthic biofilm. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to 1) identify determinants of poor welfare in commercial broiler chicken flocks by studying the associations between selected resource-based measures (RBM, potential risk factors), such as litter quality and dark period, and animal-based welfare indicators (ABM), such as foot pad dermatitis and lameness, and 2) establish the breadth of effect of a risk factor by determining the range of animal welfare indicators associated with each of the risk factors (i.e., the number of ABM related to a specific RBM). Eighty-nine broiler flocks were inspected in 4 European countries (France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands) in a cross-sectional study. The ABM were contact dermatitis (measured using scores of foot-pad dermatitis and hock burn, respectively), lameness (measured as gait score), fear of humans (measured by the avoidance distance test and the touch test), and negative emotional state (measured using qualitative behavior assessment, QBA). In a first step, risk factors were identified by building a multiple linear regression model for each ABM. Litter quality was identified as a risk factor for contact dermatitis. Length of dark period at 3 wk old (DARK3) was a risk factor for the touch test result. DARK3 and flock age were risk factors for lameness, and the number of different stockmen and DARK3 were risk factors for QBA results. Next, the ABM were grouped according to risk factor and counted. Then, in a second step, associations between the ABM were investigated using common factor analysis. The breadth of a risk factor's effect was judged by combining the number (count) of ABM related to this factor and the strength of association between these ABM. Flock age and DARK3 appeared to affect several weakly correlated ABM, thus indicating a broad range of effects. Our findings suggest that manipulation of the predominant risk factors identified in this study (DARK3, litter quality, and slaughter age) could generate improvements in the related ABM and thereby enhance the birds' overall welfare status.

AB  - Exposure to benzene, toluene and xylene in the human population may pose a health risk. We tested a working hypothesis that these test chemicals cause cellular toxicity to a non-target organism, Drosophila melanogaster. Third instar larvae of D. melanogaster transgenic for hsp70, hsp83 and hsp26 and Oregon R+ strain were exposed to 1.0-100.0 mM benzene, toluene and xylene for 2-48 h to examine the heat shock Proteins (hsps), ROS generation, anti-oxidant stress markers and developmental end points. The test chemicals elicited a concentration- and time-dependent significant (p<0.01) induction of the hsps in the exposed organism in the order of hsp70>hsp83 >= hsp26 as evident by beta-galactosidase activity after 24 h. RT-PCR amplification studies in Oregon R+ larvae revealed a similar induction pattern of these genes along with hsp60 in the order of hsp70>hsp60>hsp26 >= hsp83. Under similar experimental conditions, a significant induction of ROS generation and oxidative stress Markets viz. superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione S-transferase, thioredoxin reductase, glutathione, malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl content was observed. Sub-organismal response was propagated towards organismal response i.e., a delay in the emergence of flies and their reproductive performance. While hsp70 was predominantly induced in the organism till 24 h Of treatment with the test chemicals, a significant or insignificant regression of Hsp70 after 48 h was Concurrent with a significant induction (p<0.01) of hsp60>hsp83 >= hsp26 in comparison to the former. A significant positive Correlation was observed between ROS generation and these hsps in the exposed organism till 24 h and a negative Correlation between ROS generation and hsp70 in them after 48 h indicating a modulatory role of ROS in the induction of hsps. The study Suggests that among the tested hsps, hsp70 may be used as an early bioindicator of cellular toxicity against benzene, toluene and xylene and D. melanogaster as an alternative animal model for screening the Fisk posed by environmental chemicals.

AB  - The relatively high levels of mercury found in fish feeds might form a fish health and food safety risk. The present study aims to establish sublethal toxic threshold levels in fish and assess feed-fillet transfer of dietary mercury. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) parr were fed for 4 months on fish meal-based diets supplemented with mercuric chloride (0, 0.1, 1, 10 or 100 mg Hg kg(-1) dry weight (DW)) or methylmercuric chloride (0, 0.1, 0.5, 5 or 10 mg MeHg kg(-1) DW). At the end of the experiment, dietary inorganic mercury mainly accumulated in intestine (80% of body burden) and assimilation was low (6%). In contrast, methylmercury readily accumulated in internal organs and muscle (80% of body burden) and had a relatively high assimilation (23%). Highest accumulation of dietary inorganic mercury was observed in the gut and kidney. Fish fed 10 mg Hg kg(-1) had an early (after 2 months) significant increase in renal metallothionein (MT) level and intestinal cell proliferation, followed by intestinal pathological conditions after 4 months of exposure. At 100 mg Hg kg(-1), intestinal and renal function were reduced as seen from the significantly reduced protein and glycogen digestibility and increased plasma creatinine levels. For dietary methylmercury (MeHg), highest accumulation was found in blood and muscle. Intestinal cell proliferation and liver MT significantly increased at 5 mg MeHg kg(-1) after 2 months of exposure. At the end of the experiment, blood haematology was significantly affected in fish fed 5 mg MeHg kg(-1) and these fish exceeded the current food safety limit for mercury. Tissue MT induction and intestinal cell proliferation appeared to be useful and quantifiable early indicators of toxic mercury exposures. Based on the absence of induction of these early biological markers such as MT and cell proliferation, nonobserved effect levels (NOELs) could be set to 0.5 mg Hg kg(-1) for dietary methylmercury and 1 mg Hg kg(-1) for inorganic mercury. Lowest observed effect levels (LOELs) levels could be set to 5 mg kg(-1) for methylmercury and 10 mg Hg kg(-1) for inorganic mercury.

AB  - A source of coal tar creosote was emplaced below the water table at CFB Borden to investigate natural attenuation processes for complex biodegradable mixtures. A mass balance indicated that ongoing transformation occurred for seven study compounds. Phenol migrated as a discrete slug plume and almost completely disappeared after 2 years, after being completely leached from the source early in the study. The m-xylene plume migrated outward to a maximum distance at approximately 2 years, and then receded back towards the source as the rate of mass flux out of the source decreased to below the overall rate of plume transformation. Carbazole showed similar behaviour, although the reversal in plume development occurred more slowly. The dibenzofuran plume remained relatively constant in extent and mass over the last 2 years of monitoring, despite constant source input over this period, providing evidence that the dibenzofuran plume was at steady state. Meanwhile, the naphthalene and 1-methylnaphthalene plumes continued to advance and increase in mass over the observation period, although at a decreasing rate. The phenanthrene plume was also subject to transformation, although measurement of the rate was less conclusive due to the higher proportion of sorbed mass for this compound. Three lines of evidence are presented to evaluate whether the observed plume mass loss was due to microbial biodegradation. Measurement of redox-sensitive parameters in the vicinity of the plume showed the types of changes that would be expected to occur due to plume biodegradation: dissolved oxygen and SO42- decreased in groundwater within the plume while significant increases were noted for Fe2+, Mn2+ and methane. Further evidence that plume mass loss was microbially-mediated was provided by the accumulation of aromatic acids within the plume. Measurements of phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) in aquifer material indicated that microbial biomass and turnover rate were greater within the plume than outside: also consistent with biodegradation. Study results highlight the potential for utilizing natural attenuation as a site cleanup approach for dissolved phase plumes from complex organic mixture like coal tar creosote.

AB  - Near-surface, non-invasive field geophysics was used to investigate the land-use history of a 60-acre former industrial site in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. A proton-precession magnetometer and a Geonics EM31 non-contacting electromagnetic conductivity meter were used to measure eleven profiles across the site. Based on all the available data, four major land-use areas are distinguished: building foundation areas, excavated areas (clay mining), landfills and background areas. The geophysical data show distinct signatures for these land-use classifications, The conductivity readings can be characterized by their median values and standard deviations within each of these classifications: a) sports fields (background), 7.5 +/-2.8 millisiemens per meter (mS/m); b) excavated areas, 4.6 +/-3.4 mS/m; c) building foundations, 7.7 +/-4.0 mS/m; and d) landfill areas: 34.0 +/-30.8 mS/m, For magnetics, the median (with background subtracted) and standard deviation within each classifications are: 1) sports fields (background), -0.9 +/-8.7 nanoteslas (nT); 2) excavated areas, -0.8 +/-10.8 nT; 3) building foundations, -96.2 +/-291.0 nT; 4) landfill areas, 37.7 +/-473.9 nT. Both conductivity and magnetics show similar patterns, although conductivity provides clearer visual discrimination between land-use types. The in-phase conductivity data are consistent with the land-use patterns determined from the aerial photographs and the other geophysical data. Zero (negative) readings occur over areas with high metal content such as the buildings foundations area and the landfill area. Clay pit areas show uniformily low readings consistent with the lack of metallic objects in these areas.
   All the data, including historical aerial photographs, historical land-cover information, geophysical data, topography, hydrology, and existing buildings and infrastructure were integrated into a digital database. Data such as historical aerial photographs provided temporal (past) information about the land-use history of the site, while the geophysical data provided current information about the type and spatial distribution of land use. The integration of the geophysical data with other data in a digital database is an effective tool for interpreting landuse history and understanding present environmental conditions.

AB  - Stable carbon and oxygen isotope data from over 80 samples of Recent freshwater microbial carbonates from western Europe, confirm that these deposits record environmental and climatic information. Our sample area tested whether recent microbial carbonates record environmental signals over large regions with differing delta(18)O compositions for rainfall (delta w), particularly in the Alps where delta w is influenced by lower condensation temperatures caused by the orographic effect. Microbial crusts in Alpine areas are clearly distinguished, i.e., have isotopically lower delta(18)O values by up to 4 parts per thousand, from those forming in lowland areas on the east side of the mountains. Bavarian lakes and rivers which receive runoff from the Alps also have delta(18)O compositions that reflect the Alpine meteoric water input. Microbial crusts in the higher Alpine sites have delta(13)C values around -4 parts per thousand, which are between 2 and 6 parts per thousand higher than values from lowland sites. This difference probably reflects a smaller soil-zone carbon component in the mountain sites where soils are thin, poorly vegetated, or absent.
   Oxygen and carbon isotope values do not vary significantly between different types of microbial precipitate (e.g., undifferentiated crusts, Rivularia colonies, moss tufa, etc.) at a site. The oxygen isotope compositions of freshwater lacustrine mussel shell aragonite and associated (sometimes shell encrusting) microbial carbonates differ by <1 parts per thousand, and both are probably close to equilibrium isotopic values. However, delta(13)C values in mussel shell aragonite are consistently lower, typically by 5 parts per thousand, than the associated microbial carbonate value. This suggests that the delta(13)C Of the microbial carbonate is affected by the microenvironmental photosynthetic processes of the microbes. These microenvironmental effects are only evident at lake shore sites where water flushing rates are low.
   These data suggest that selected ancient microbial carbonates may contain clear records of palaeoclimate (particularly relative changes in temperature) and environmental change. Pools behind fluvial barrage tufas are probably the best targets for reasonably continuous, long, dateable records with isotopic conditions least affected by microenvironmental processes.

AB  - Organochlorine pesticides are still widely used in many regions of the world, despite their toxic properties to many organisms, including humans, and their high environmental persistence in waters and sediments. In order to properly assess contaminant effects across trophic levels in aquatic communities, the responses of different model organisms should be investigated. Particularly for marine benthic environments, relatively few model organisms for the assessment under controlled laboratory conditions of both lethal and sublethal effects are available. Here we investigate the use of a cryptic species of the free-living nematode Litoditis marina as a model organism for short-term tests of the impacts of contaminants, using the case of the herbicide atrazine. Its ease of culturing, short generation time and high fecundity render L. marina PmIII a good candidate to assess contaminant effects for both a rapid assessment of impacts and more detailed investigations of the mechanisms behind those effects. The LC50 of atrazine to adult L. marina PmIII was 3.3 ? 0.5 mg/L after a 5-day exposure, suggesting a comparatively higher sensitivity of this species compared to other aquatic invertebrate model species, mainly crustaceans. This LC50 was less than half the value after a 4-day exposure and was 22-fold lower than the 48 h LC50, demonstrating the importance of performing lethality tests for as long an exposure time as possible. Sublethal effects were observed at much lower atrazine concentrations and encompassed, from 0.8 mg/L onwards, impairment of life-history traits (reduced fecundity and extended egg deposition and development times) and population parameters (abundances of juveniles and adults, adult sex ratio). These sublethal effects were broadly consistent among different life-history traits and population parameters, but fecundity and the maximum abundances of juveniles, adults and total nematodes were the most sensitive response variables. We therefore suggest that an adequate assessment of sublethal contaminant effects on L. marina requires a combination of different life-history traits and population-level parameters. We conclude that L. marina PmIII is a suitable model species for ecotoxicological research encompassing both lethal and sublethal effects, and can as such contribute to environmental risk assessment in marine and estuarine systems.

AB  - Animal fecal contamination in aquatic environments is a major source of zoonotic diseases in humans. While concerns are focused on livestock, companion animals such as dogs can also be a source of a wide range of zoonotic pathogens. Therefore, detection of dog or canine fecal contamination in aquatic environments is important for mitigating risks. In this study, host-sensitivity and specificity of four canine fecal-associated marker genes were evaluated by analyzing 30 canine and 240 non-canine fecal samples. The application of these matters was also tested in water from an urban river under dry weather conditions. The host sensitivity values of the Bacteivides BacCan-UCD, DogBact, DF113 and DF418 were 1.00, 0.90, 0.83, and 0.90, respectively. The host specificity value of the BacCan-UCD, DogBact, DF113 and DF418 were 0.87, 0.98, 0.83, and 0.41, respectively. The mean concentrations of DF418 were highest (7.82 +/- 1.13 log lo gene copies (GC)/g of feces) followed by BacCan-UCD (7.61 +/- 1.06 log(10) GC/g) and DogBact (7.15 +/- 0.92 log(10) GC/g). The mean concentration of DF113 (5.80 +/- 125 log(10) GC/g) was 15 to 2.5 orders of magnitude lower than the other marker genes. The DogBact marker gene was not detected in any other animal feces other than a small number of untreated sewage samples. The BacCan-UCD marker gene cross-reacted with cat, chicken, and pig fecal samples, while the DF113 marker gene cross-reacted with cat, chicken, cattle fecal and untreated sewage samples. The DF418 marker gene was detected in all sewage and animal farsancl deemed not suitable for canine fecal contamination tracking in sub-tropical Australia. Canine fecal contamination was infrequently detected in environmental water samples. Based on the results obtained in this study, we recommend that at least two canine feces-associated marker genes should be used in field studies. Crown Copyright (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Key message This paper shows the intraspecific plant responses in leaf morphology, herbivory and FA between mature and successional tropical dry forests, as well as the difficulty associated with understanding the relationship between FA and herbivory Understanding the processes that affect biotic interactions during secondary succession has implications for the maintenance of species diversity in the tropics. We studied the changes in leaf morphology, fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and herbivory in three dominant tropical dry forest plant species that occur in mature and secondary forests. We selected eight study sites: four in mature and four in successional forests. At each site, a plot of 20 x 50 m was established to characterize the vegetation structure and soil fertility. Subsequently, leaf morphology, FA and herbivory were measured in all individuals of Cordia elaeagnoides, C. alliodora and Achatocarpus gracilis with DBH >= 2.5 cm found in the plots. Plant abundance and plant height decreased in secondary forest, while the content of nitrates and phosphates increased in soil of secondary forests. Differences in leaf morphology between forest conditions were found for the three species. Total leaf area was higher in mature than in secondary forests for C. elaeagnoides and A. gracilis. An opposite pattern was found for C. alliodora. In both Cordia species, herbivory was higher in secondary than in mature forests. The opposite pattern was found for A. gracilis in secondary forests. For all the cases, FA was higher in mature forests than in secondary forests. Herbivory was positively correlated with FA in secondary forests in C. elaeganoides and in A. gracilis, whereas in C. alliodora herbivory was positively related with FA in mature forests. Overall, we detected changes in foliar morphology, fluctuating asymmetry and herbivory between mature and secondary forests, with a general pattern of higher FA levels in mature forests. Our findings illustrate the difficulty associated with understanding the relationship between FA and herbivory throughout the regeneration process in tropical dry forests due to the complexity of abiotic and biotic factors that can affect plant-herbivore interactions.

AB  - Background: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative condition with limited therapeutic options at present. Survival from symptom onset ranges from 3 to 5 years depending on genetic, demographic, and phenotypic factors. Despite tireless research efforts, the core etiology of the disease remains elusive and drug development efforts are confounded by the lack of accurate monitoring markers. Disease heterogeneity, late-stage recruitment into pharmaceutical trials, and inclusion of phenotypically admixed patient cohorts are some of the key barriers to successful clinical trials. Machine Learning (ML) models and large international data sets offer unprecedented opportunities to appraise candidate diagnostic, monitoring, and prognostic markers. Accurate patient stratification into well-defined prognostic categories is another aspiration of emerging classification and staging systems.
   Methods: The objective of this paper is the comprehensive, systematic, and critical review of ML initiatives in ALS to date and their potential in research, clinical, and pharmacological applications. The focus of this review is to provide a dual, clinical-mathematical perspective on recent advances and future directions of the field. Another objective of the paper is the frank discussion of the pitfalls and drawbacks of specific models, highlighting the shortcomings of existing studies and to provide methodological recommendations for future study designs.
   Results: Despite considerable sample size limitations, ML techniques have already been successfully applied to ALS data sets and a number of promising diagnosis models have been proposed. Prognostic models have been tested using core clinical variables, biological, and neuroimaging data. These models also offer patient stratification opportunities for future clinical trials. Despite the enormous potential of ML in ALS research, statistical assumptions are often violated, the choice of specific statistical models is seldom justified, and the constraints of ML models are rarely enunciated.
   Conclusions: From a mathematical perspective, the main barrier to the development of validated diagnostic, prognostic, and monitoring indicators stem from limited sample sizes. The combination of multiple clinical, biofluid, and imaging biomarkers is likely to increase the accuracy of mathematical modeling and contribute to optimized clinical trial designs.

AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in aquatic environment significantly influences the behavior and fate of heavy metals via binding, complexation and thus changes the metal speciation; however detailed interfacial processes and mechanisms are still unclear. Here, differential absorbance and fluorescence spectra and two dimensional UV-FTIR heterospectral correlation analysis were applied to probe into the Pb(II)-DOM interaction at a wide range of pH and ionic strength (IS). The absorbance of DOM molecules under all conditions increased with metal addition, while the different extents of absorbance variations along the wavelength range in the differential zero-order and log-transformed absorbance spectra indicated the site heterogeneity within the DOM pool for metal binding. Spectral parameters, namely differential fluorescent components 1 and 2 (DFC1 and DFC2) and differential slopes of log-transformed absorbance in the range of wavelength 350-400 nm (DSlope(350-400)) were found to be highly correlated with the total amounts of DOM-bound Pb(II) predicted by the NICA-Donnan model, while the differential absorbance spectra at 235 nm (DA(235)) was related to the extent of Pb(II) bound by carboxylic groups. Thus, these parameters are an indicator or proxy for the in situ Pb(II)-DOM interaction extent. Aryl C-H gave the fastest response to Pb(II) binding at lower pH and IS (e.g., pH 4.7 and IS = 0.01 M), followed by carboxyl C=O and polysaccharide C-OH and then chromophoric groups at 265 nm (CDOM265). However, the CDOM265 bound to Pb(II) prior to aryl C-H and polysaccharide C-OH groups at higher pH and IS (6.0 and 0.1 M, respectively), showing that the binding sequences were highly dependent on solution chemistry. Differential spectra combined with two dimensional UV-FTIR heterospectral correlation analysis can be used as a promising approach to elucidate metal-DOM interaction processes, including site heterogeneity, binding sensitivity and sequence at the functional group level.

AB  - Background: Over the past years, the malaria elimination program has considerably decreased the malaria indigenous cases and confined their incidence to the southeastern areas of Iran encompassing 28 less developed counties with favorable transmission conditions. Objectives: The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of climatic and socioeconomic indicators on malaria transmission and to predict malaria transmission risk until 2025 for all the southeastern endemic counties in Iran.
   Methods: The aggregated data from indigenous malaria cases, as well as, climatic and socioeconomic indicators of malaria endemic areas were collected on the monthly basis from each county between 2005 and 2015. The collected variables were, then, estimated until 2025 using time series analysis. Considering the nature of these data, two different multilevel models were implemented for vivax and falciparum based on the socioeconomic variable that was used. Finally, applying two different models, two sets of estimates were obtained for malaria transmission risk in each county.
   Results: The annual decline of malaria transmission was estimated to be 17% based on model 1, and 25% based on the model 2 for vivax ( P < 0.001). These estimates were 13% and 21% for falciparum ( P < 0.001), respectively. For every increased unit in the wealth index, malaria transmission for vivax and falciparum decreased by 33% ( P = 0.001) and 12% ( P = 0.54), respectively. Also, for every increase in the mean years of schooling, the transmission decreased by 65% ( P < 0.001) and 57% ( P = 0.001) for vivax and falciparum.
   Conclusions: The results of this study, using climatic variables along with socioeconomic variables, indicated the obvious influence of socioeconomic status improvement on decreasing malaria transmission. According to the results, malaria transmission risk will considerably diminish in the next few years. The pattern of malaria transmission decline was consistent with the declining trend of malaria incidence which will move from the west to the east and from the north to the south in the years to come. The transmission risk for falciparum was considerably lower than that of vivax and the endemic areas of falciparum move towards 0 faster than vivax.

AB  - This review collates the available knowledge on the distribution and area covered by eelgrass Zostera capensis and shows that it has a wide distribution occurring in 62 estuaries from the Olifants Estuary on the west coast to Kosi Bay on the east coast. It has protected meristems, a strong root system and flexible leaves which enable it to grow under strong tidal conditions as well as tolerate periods of exposure and desiccation characteristic of the intertidal zone. Estuaries with the largest areas of Z. capensis are Olifants, Langebaan, Berg, Knysna, Keurbooms, Swartkops.and Bushmans. Only Langebaan and Knysna have some formal protection status. Large populations were lost from KwaZulu-Natal estuaries at the time of Durban Bay harbour development in the 1950s and more recently from St Lucia. There have been a number of studies in South Africa showing the utilisation of eelgrass beds by a variety of invertebrate and fish species for habitat, shelter, foraging sites and nurseries. Fewer studies have addressed nutrient recycling and other ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration. In all estuaries the distribution of Z. capensis is highly dynamic and therefore difficult to map, assess changes over time and use as an indicator of estuary health. Cover and biomass are removed after large floods and have been shown to fluctuate in response to bait digging and disturbance by boats. This review identifies eutrophication as an emerging threat that encourages macroalgal growth, which smothers Z. capensis. Despite its wide distribution range, Z capensis is sensitive to human impacts which have led to the species being listed as vulnerable in the Red Data List. It is encouraging that approximately 46% of all estuaries with Z. capensis have estuary management plans as these strive to protect sensitive habitats using activity zoning. Studies tracking the changes over time of the 1 capensis beds in specific estuaries are needed to understand dynamic responses. In addition there is urgency for a national assessment of the distribution and health of this keystone species in South Africa. (C) 2016 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The proposed study draws a novel framework to assess the sustainability of winter wheat under climate change conditions and irrigation as an adaption measure to reduce yield variability. The methodology combines outputs from a general circulation model (GCM), the Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) crop growth model (AquaCrop), a life cycle assessment (LCA) model and economic modelling. Long-term observed climate data (1970-1991) collected in Cambridge (Cambridgeshire, UK) were used to downscale the projected climate data from the GCM for 2050. The structural characteristics of the case study are representative of a typical farm in this UK region. A six-year average wheat price (2007-2012) was considered and the irrigation costs for the economic model were calculated assuming the market prices in 2014. Sensitivity analysis assessed in the longer term included the expected variations due to the increase in world wheat prices and the energy costs.
   The direct impacts of climate change on winter wheat grown in the East of England, would be a reduction in the rainfed yield (between -5.4% and -32.9%), stronger under the low emission scenario (B1). The projected economic losses from rainfed winter wheat production are expected to range between -43.6% and -100.0%. Irrigation could in the future be an adaptation measure for yield increase (10.5% to 64.3%), lower under B1 and to improve the financial appraisal of irrigation investment which would raise between 41 and 429 ha(-1) pound. However, negative externalities are exacerbating pressures on air and water resources; an increase in irrigation water requirements between 25.0% and 39.1% increases global warming potential between 20.4% and 28.3%. Environmental indicators under scenario B1 performed better than the high emission scenario (A1). Finally, under future climate scenarios, the results confirmed that irrigated winter wheat grown on lighter soils using hose reel sprinkler systems fitted with a boom, is more sustainable than that grown on heavier soils using hose reel sprinkler systems fitted with a raingun.

AB  - Key message Few integration steps (adding low-cost ozone measurements, link to existing conventional monitors, joint data processing) transformed the traditional forest monitoring network into a multifunctional infrastructure producing information relevant for estimating risk to vegetation and human health
   Context Traditionally, forest monitoring networks have been designed to assess status and trends of forest condition. We argue that they can help providing answers to a much broader range of questions for science, policy, and society. Here, we concentrate on the example of ground-level ozone pollution. Aims The aim of this study is to demonstrate the value of present forest monitoring networks as infrastructures that-with few integration steps-can provide important data and information to estimate the risk posed by ground-level ozone to vegetation and human health.
   Methods We measured ozone concentration by passive samplers at the local (Trentino, northern Italy) plots of the ICP Forests Level I network over the period 2007-2011. By integrating these data with those from conventional ozone monitors (mostly located in urban areas), we (i) obtained an even distribution of air quality measurements over the investigated area, (ii) estimated international exposure indicators for vegetation and human population, and (iii) obtained data allowing geostatistical modeling and mapping of ozone concentrations, exposure, and associated potential risk.
   Results Mean May-July ozone concentration ranged from 58 to 169 mu g m(-3), depending on forest site and year. Modeling and mapping (root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) = 12.31 mu g m(-3)) provided evidence that the risk threshold for vegetation in terms of AOT40 was exceeded in large parts (90 %) of the study area, and frequently even by two times, depending on the year. With respect to population, up to 43 % of the dwellers were exposed to medium-high risk of exceedances of the information threshold.
   Conclusion Ozone measurements carried out at the ICP Forests Level I forest monitoring network permitted mapping ozone levels and the estimation of possible risk for vegetation and human health. Forest monitoring networks can be seen as infrastructures that can be useful to address a wide range of environmental issues and with a much broader scope than their original one.

AB  - Productivity changes in Norway spruce show important regional and local spatial variations, highlighting their context dependence at different spatial scales. These variations suggest the enhancing role of climate warming, and interplay with local water and nutrient limitations.
   While forest growth changes have been observed in many places worldwide, their spatial variation and environmental origin remain poorly documented. Analysis of these historical changes in contrasted regional contexts, and their mapping over continuous environmental gradients, may help uncover their environmental causes. The approach was tested on Norway spruce (Picea abies) in three western European mountain contexts (Massif Central, Alps and Jura), using National Forest Inventory (NFI) data. We explored the environmental factors influencing stand basal area increment (BAI) in each context. We then estimated and compared mean regional changes in BAI and related these to the regional environmental limitations evidenced. Within each region, we further mapped local BAI trends using a geographically weighted regression (GWR) approach. In each region, local estimates of BAI changes were finally correlated to environmental indicators. We found an increase in BAI in the three regions over 1980-2005, greater in the Massif Central (+71 %) than in the Alps (+19 %) and the Jura Mountains (+21 %). Inter-regional differences in BAI changes suggested the release of a thermal constraint-found more important in the Massif Central-by the strong temperature increase over the period, and a limitation by water availability in the Jura and the Alps Mountains. Spatial patterns of BAI change revealed significant local variations in the Massif Central and the Alps. From the correlation analysis, these were again found consistent with the hypothesis of an enhancing effect of climate warming in these mountain ranges. They were also related to local soil nutritional status in the two regions, and negatively related to nitrogen deposition level in the Massif Central. As a main outcome, a strong context and spatial scale dependence of productivity changes is emphasized. In addition, the enhancing effect of climate warming on productivity is suggested, with local modulation by climatic and nutritional conditions.

AB  - The Permian Lucaogou Formation is an important hydrocarbon source rock in the Junggar, Turpan, and Santanghu basins in Xinjiang, NW China. For the first time, dolostones associated with mantle-originated exhalative hydrothermal fluid flows are discovered in Yuejingou section in the Santanghu Basin area. They include dolomicrite, doloarenite, and a small amount of dolorudite, and are finely (0.05-0.15 cm thick) interlaminated with lime micrite and dolomicritic analcime laminites. Alkali feldspar and analcime grains are common in doloarenite and are interpreted as having been derived from analcime phonolites and peralkaline magmatic rocks. These magmatic fragments were brought up from subsurface by hydrothermal fluid flow and had experienced exhalative brecciation, transport, and deposition on the lake floor. The matrix consists dominantly of dolomite and ankerite smaller than 0.01 mm. The dolostones can be subdivided into four types on the basis of mineral composition and content. The detrital analcime and alkaline feldspar grains and tuff lithics are interpreted as intraclasts, which were deposited in an under-filled starved lake basin. The delta (18) (OPDB) values of dolostones are -5aEuro degrees to -21.1aEuro degrees, and -11.9aEuro degrees on average; the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of dolostones are 0.70457 to 0.706194, and 0.705005 on average. These values, in combination with evidence of multi-episodes of peralkaline extrusion, suggest a mantle origin of the hydrothermal fluids, which may have promoted primary dolomite formation. The fluid from the upper mantle caused serpentinization of ultramafic rocks that intruded into the lower crust to obtain Mg2+ and Fe2+, and injected the ions into the lake water as the Mg and Fe sources for dolomite and ankerite. Hydrothermal fluids associated with peralkaline magmatic rocks also provided Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, and CO3 (2-). Explosive breccias formed and dolostones were convoluted near the vent of hydrothermal fluid exhalation, whereas laminated dolostones formed farther away from the vent. The dolostones are primary dolomite deposition in an intracontinental rift basin and associated with mantle-originated hydrothermal fluids. They provide an insight into the origin of dolomite formation in the geologic history and clues to understand the sedimentary environments and tectonic conditions in northern Xinjiang during the late Paleozoic.

AB  - We present a method for the stochastic simulation of point-to-point transport connectivity honoring data from three types of information: (1) travel time estimates obtained from field tracer tests; (2) estimates of flow connectivity indicators obtained from the relatively fast or slow flow response that is observed at a point location given the flow impulse at another location, and (3) measurements of transmissivity at a local scale. The method thus efficiently integrates data obtained from different hydraulic tests, each sampling different areas within the aquifer. To achieve this, we first extend the concept of point-to-point flow connectivity and transport connectivity, mathematically formulated by Trinchero et al. (2008) for pumping conditions, to support a more general flow configuration. Interestingly, point-to-point flow connectivity can be generally seen as a weighted integral of transmissivity over the entire domain, the weighting function being proportional to the sensitivity of heads with respect to the natural log of transmissivity per unit of aquifer volume. On the contrary, point-to-point transport connectivity is a weighted integral along the particle path of the solute mass that involves two variables: transmissivity and flow connectivity. Each variable has its own distinct weighting function. The weighting function of transmissivity is inversely proportional to both the homogeneous travel time and the point velocity sampled along the travel path. On this basis, we show how to generate conditional point-to-point transport connectivity maps. The method avoids the inference of cross-covariance functions between variables measured over different scales and sampled areas (which cannot be otherwise estimated with a few data measurements) by expressing them as a function of the local transmissivity covariance function. An example of the method is provided to evaluate the worth of including tracer data to delineate capture zones of abstraction wells originally defined from local transmissivity measurements. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the impact of including tracer data is a maximum when the travel time data are obtained at a location different than that of transmissivity measurements. The reason is that weighting functions give larger weights to the injection location, so introducing tracer test data at points where transmissivity is already known is somewhat redundant.

AB  - Quantitative reconstruction of the climatic history of the Chinese Loess Plateau is important for understanding present and past environment and climate changes in the Northern Hemisphere. Here, we reconstructed mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP) trends during the last 136 ka based on the analysis of phytoliths from the Weinan loess section (34 degrees 24'N, 109 degrees 30'E) near the southern part of the Loess Plateau in northern China. The reconstructions have been carried out using a Chinese phytolith-climate calibration model based on weighted averaging partial least-squares regression. A series of cold and dry events, as indicated by the reconstructed MAT and MAP, are documented in the loess during the last glacial periods, which can be temporally correlated with the North Atlantic Heinrich events. Our MAT and MAP estimations show that the coldest and/or driest period occurred at the upper part of L2 unit (Late MIS 6), where MAT dropped to ca 4.4 degrees C and MAP to ca 100 min. Two other prominent cold-dry periods occurred at lower L1-5 (ca 77-62ka) and L1-1 (ca 23-10.5ka) where the MAT and MAP decreased to about 6.1-6.5 degrees C and 150-370 mm, respectively, ca 6.6-6.2 degrees C and 400-200 mm lower than today. However, the highest MAT (average 14.6 degrees C, max. 18.1 degrees C) and MAP (average 757 mm, max. 1000 mm) occurred at Sl interval (MIS 5). During the interstadial of L1-4-L1-2 (M I S 3) and during the Holocene warm-wet period, the MAT was about 1-2 degrees C and MAP 100-150 mm higher than today in the Weinan region. The well-dated MAT and MAP reconstructions front the Chinese Loess Plateau presented in this paper are the first quantitatively reconstructed proxy record of climatic changes at the glacial-interglacial timescale that is based on phytolith data. This study also reveals a causal link between climatic instability in the Atlantic Ocean and climate variability in the Chinese Loess Plateau. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Increased environmental regulations and loss of crops due to viral disease outbreaks have created a demand for productive, pathogen-free, efficient and sustainable shrimp production practices. These methods, for the most part, call for raising shrimp under limited, minimal, water exchange with careful monitoring of water quality. Two studies were conducted using the Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei to evaluate the effect of carbon supplementation on selected water quality indicators and shrimp performance in the nursery and the grow-out phases using the limited water discharge practice with molasses as carbon addition.
   A preliminary nursery study was conducted in four 40 m(3) greenhouse-enclosed raceways stocked with 12-day old postlarvae at a density of 1800 m(-3) and were fed 45% crude protein feed. Molasses (24% carbon, w/w) was used for carbon supplementation to provide 6 g of carbon for each I g of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) as measured in the water, and started 32 d after stocking, shortly after the TAN level has risen over 3 mg L-1. The data suggest that molasses addition resulted in rapid reduction of TAN and nitrite-nitrogen and could be used to prevent buildup of these compounds.
   The grow-out study was carried out using twenty 7.8 m(3) tanks stocked with juvenile shrimp at a density of 81 m(-3). Shrimp were fed a commercial diet (30% crude protein, Rangen Inc., Buhl, ID). Feed rations were determined based on assumed growth of 1 g week(-1), FCR of 1.5 and weekly mortality rate of 0.5%. Molasses additions, at five levels, were started 26 days post stocking, to provide 0%, 50%, 100%, and 150% of the theoretical carbon level needed for bacteria to assimilate the TAN provided in the feed. The fifth treatment was based on the actual level of TAN in the tanks and was adjusted daily on as needed basis. The data suggest that under the condition of this study, addition of molasses did not result in a significant effect on water quality or on shrimp performance. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Antarctic marginal ice zone is an important oceanic front separating the pack-ice and open-water environments. During summer, the retreating pack ice creates a meltwater lens in the euphotic zone, allowing primary producers and microheterotrophs to flourish in a discrete bloom just seaward of the retreating ice edge that lasts about 60 days. The purpose of the present study was to see if the ice-edge bloom had a discernible effect on the metabolism and physiological condition of Antarctic micronekton similar to that observed in zooplankton species. We also wished to assess the importance of the summer season to species' life cycles. Two major data sets were collected on 25 species in the following taxonomic groups: amphipods, cephalopods, decapods, euphausiids, isopods, mysids, ostracods, and polychaetes. The first data set described the metabolic rates of individuals in areas of the marginal ice zone with widely different levels of chlorophyll biomass to investigate the effect of the ice-edge bloom on metabolism. Additionally, summer metabolic rates were compared with data from other seasons. The second data set detailed the levels of protein, water, ash, RNA and DNA, and the activities of metabolic enzymes (citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase) to examine the efficacy of biochemical indices as predictive tools for metabolism. Results suggested that the mobility of the micronektonic species eliminated most direct effects of the bloom on metabolism. Individuals captured in very different productivity regimes showed few significant differences in the metabolic indicators listed above. Isolated cases of changes in body composition and enzyme activity, however, implied that longer-term effects of the bloom may be exhibited. Seasonal increases in metabolism from winter to summer were observed in the euphausiids Euphausia superba, E. triacantha, and Thysanoessa macrura and the amphipod Vibilia stebbingi. It was concluded that the seasonal shifts were indicative of a "type 2" or compromise overwintering strategy whereby metabolism drops without an accompanying dormant state. Protein content and MDH activity were found to be the best predictors of respiration rate, while nucleic acid measures only correlated with respiration in immature specimens. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Responses of the waterbird community to the management regime of a wet grassland system (primarily small changes in the water regime but also hunting disturbance) in a large floodplain lake, Grand-Lieu, were studied during three consecutive years (winter and spring in 1998-2000). These temporarily flooding grasslands (1100 ha) constituted a very important feeding area by supporting large flocks of waterbird species (52 regular spp., totalling up to 14250-22850 birds). A global similar seasonal pattern in the presence of waterbird species was recorded whatever the year. The March-May period was a key phase with the maximum species richness (42-48 spp.) and the maximum abundance (30-40% of the total according to year, essentially Anseriformes). Late in spring Ciconiiformes and to a lesser extent some waders exploit this feeding area. Nevertheless some changes in bird assemblages were exhibited according to the management regime (a decreasing spring water level from 1998 to 2000, and an exceptional hunting ban in January 2000, instead of an usual stop in late February). The hunting disturbance clearly limited diurnal accessibility of ducks to wet grasslands in January and February 1998 and 1999. Also, the duck population in flooding grasslands increased by 55-65% in January 2000 when hunting was prohibited and in the same time the richness species grew from 14-19 spp. up to 23 spp. in 2000. The overall impact of a high spring water level on waterbirds as in 1998 and to a lesser extent in 1999 (with respectively 54 and 35 cm of mean water level against 25 cm in 2000) was an increase in diving fish-eating birds and larger flocks of resting gulls. Conversely these conditions, notably a reduced period with a spring water level under 25 cm in spring (20 days in 1998-1999 instead of 40 days in 2000) were adverse to numerous ground-feeding waterbirds (Ciconiiformes and waders) that require shallow waters. This study showed that limitation of human disturbance and moderate flooding of wet grasslands can increase their attractiveness for numerous species of high conservation status.

AB  - Understanding the history of relative Holocene sea levels on Pacific islands is important for constraining fundamental geodynamic theories, interpreting the environments of early human occupation sites, and forecasting future environmental conditions on the islands, An observational paleoshoreline record is provided by emergent paleoshoreline indicators formed at higher relative sea levels, hence standing at higher elevations than modem counterparts. Emergent paleoshoreline notches in limestone seacliff's record paleo-high-tide levels and emergent paleoreef flats record paleo-low-tide levels, whereas emergent paleobeachrock locally records paleo-intertidal levels. Both paleonotches and paleoreefs occur along the coasts of high-standing islands exposing volcanic bedrock and uplifted reef complexes, but low-lying coralline atolls lack sufficient relief to preserve paleonotches. Controls on relative Holocene sea level include global eustatic and regional hydro-isostatic changes in ambient sea level relative to island landmasses, and shifts in the elevations of islands relative to sea level caused by thermal subsidence of the oceanic lithosphere or thermally rejuvenated loci of hotspot volcanism, by flexure of the lithosphere under the load of growing volcanic edifices (Hawaii, Samoa, Society Islands), by arching of the lithosphere over trench forebulges (Loyalty Islands, Niue, Bellona-Rennell), and by tectonism within forearc belts between active volcanic chains and trenches (Mariana Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu). The dominant pattern of relative sea-level change, where not overprinted by local tectonism or lithospheric flexure, was a uniform early Holocene rise in eustatic sea level followed by a regionally variable late Holocene hydro-isostatic drawdown in sea level. The resultant was a mid-Holocene highstand in relative sea level that affected the development of shoreline morphology throughout the tropical Pacific Ocean. The earliest human migrations into intra-oceanic island groups of both the northwestern and Southwestern Pacific Ocean followed close on the heels of the mid-Holocene sea-level highstand, and took advantage of newly attractive coastal environments engendered by sea-level drawdown. The effects of the mid-Holocene highstand were modified to varying degrees in different island groups by geodynamic uplift or subsidence. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The preferences of some woodland understorey species for ammonium and nitrate were investigated by measuring the potential nitrification (conversion of ammonium to nitrate) in the rhizosphere compared with the bulk soil. Less acid-tolerant species, which usually prefer nitrate or a mixture of ammonium and nitrate in hydroponic culture, should have a higher potential nitrification in the rhizosphere compared to the bulk soil due to a low uptake of ammonium (since ammonium is relatively immobile). Acid-tolerant species should have a high uptake of ammonium and thereby lower or equal potential nitrification in the rhizosphere compared to the bulk soil. The hypothesis was tested in a field investigation of five understorey herb species, Deschampsia flexuosa, Convallaria majalis, Poa nemoralis, Geum urbanum and Aegopodium podagraria performed in oak forests in southern Sweden. Overall, the two less acid-tolerant species, Geum urbanum and Aegopodium podagraria, had high potential nitrification in the rhizosphere compared to the bulk soil (indicating a relatively low uptake of ammonium), whilst the acid tolerant species, Deschampsia flexuosa and Convallaria majalis, had approximately equal potential nitrification in the rhizosphere compared to the bulk soil (indicating a relatively high uptake of ammonium). In the case of Poa nemoralis, a species which grows in both acid and less acid soils, we found the potential nitrification in the rhizosphere and in the bulk soil to be similar at low inorganic nitrogen concentrations, but the difference (rhizosphere > bulk) increased when nitrification in the bulk soil was enhanced (i.e. when the nitrogen availability increased). The potential nitrification in the bulk soil varied between 0 and 16 nmol g(-1) h(-1) and was positively correlated with pH. When species occurred at the same site, the potential nitrification in the bulk soil tended to be lower for the acid tolerant species. Despite a large variation in potential nitrification, the method offers a possibility of measuring the preference of plants for ammonium/nitrate in a soil system, under natural conditions.

AB  - We have determined the calcium carbonate (CaCO3), organic carbon (C-org), trace element, and rare earth element (REE) composition of surface sediments collected from a transect on the central western continental shelf and slope of India in the Eastern Arabian Sea. The transect samples across the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) allows us to compare the relative abundances of trace elements and REEs in the sediments beneath and beyond the OMZ.
   Shale-normalized REE patterns, La-n/Yb-n ratios, and Eu/Eu* anamolies indicate that the sediments in the study area are either derived from the adjoining Archaean land masses or from distal Indus source. Sediment deposited in the OMZ have high U Values from 3.6 to 8.1 ppm, with their U-excess (of that can be supplied by continental particles) values ranging between 82-91% of the total U, indicating that the U may be precipitated as U+4 in the reducing conditions of OMZ.
   Sediments deposited beneath the intense OMZ(<0.2 mL/L) and away from the OMZ(1-2 mL/L) show slight negative Ce anomalies, with no significant differences between these two sets of sediments. The Ce/Ce-shale* values are poorly related to U and C-org which are indicators of suboxic bottom waters. Normative calculations suggest that two sources, namely, terrestrial and seawater( terrestrial much greater than seawater) contribute to the total Ce anomaly of the sediments. The Ce anomaly values of the calculated seawater derived component are similar to the anomalies reported for other coastal waters and the oxygenated surface waters of the Arabian Sea and do not show any correspondence to the lowered redox state of the overlying water, probably due to the redirection of dissolved Ce into the oxic deeper water. This data on recently deposited sediments from a known oxygen-poor environment suggest that the Ce/Ce-sh* in high sedimentation areas of continental margin environments may not be a good paleoredox proxy. U/Th ratios above 1.25 noticed in OMZ are in accordance with the earlier usage of this ratio for identifying reducing environment of ancient sediments. Copyright (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - A detailed fabric and microstructural analysis of the granitic mylonites was carried out on the southern side of Besparmak Mountain north of Selimiye (Milas). The mylonitic augen gneisses have a blastomylonitic texture characterized by large retort-shape porphyroclasts or augen of feldspars, around which a more ductile, medium to fine-grained matrix of muscovite, biotite, quartz and feldspar is deflected. Feldspars behave in both plastic and brittle fashion, because size reduction occurs through grain boundary migration and/or subgrain rotation, and also through fracturing. Typical ''core-and-mantle'' structure, characterized by a large feldspar core surrounded by a mantle of fine recrystallized grains, is very characteristic. The majority of plagioclase twins obey the albite-twin law; however, the association with pericline-law twinning suggests that many of the twins are mechanical. Evidence of strain, such as deformation twins, bent or curved twins, undulatory extinction, deformation bands and kink bands occur characteristically in plagioclase. Myrmekite is ubiquitous at K-feldspar grain boundaries, most notably on the long sides of inequant grains parallel to the S-foliation direction, which invariably face the maximum finite shortening direction. Deformation of quartz in mylonitic augen gneisses commonly results in the development of core-and-mantle structure and ''type-4'' quartz ribbons of elongated, preferably oriented, newly recrystallized quartz aggregates suggesting a primary dynamic recrystallization. Undulatory extinction, deformation bands and lamellae are the strain-related features associated with quartz porphyroclasts. Micas, especially biotite, undergo internal deformation by bend gliding and kinking. Most of the micas are completely attenuated and aligned such that their (001) planes are subparallel or parallel to the margins of quartz ribbons and define the foliation in the rock. These microstructures of feldspars, quartz and mica in the mylonitic augen gneisses in this part of the southern Menderes Massif are broadly consistent with fabric development under upper-greenschist- to lower-amphibolite-facies conditions, rather than almandine-amphibolite facies, as was previously believed. This supports the previous contention of the authors that the protoliths of augen gneisses are younger granitoids and do not represent an exposed Precambrian Pan-African basement in the Menderes Massif.

AB  - The ultrastructure of the exine (protective wall) of the Wealden (Lower Cretaceous) megaspore species Arcellites hexapartitus is very similar to that of two other species, A. disciformis and A. santacrucensis, first recovered from mid Cretaceous formations in Greenland and Argentina respectively. The wall of Wealden A. vectis differs in that the outer exoexinal layer is thinner, but it is otherwise similar. The morphology of these and several other taxa from Barremian and younger Cretaceous deposits coupled with, in some cases, an association with the microspore Crybelosporites, suggests derivation from a single, now extinct, group of plants within the water fern order Marsileales. A. medusus differs somewhat from this group of species in the construction of both the neck around the triradiate suture and the wall. The oldest Wealden specimens are Valanginian. The possibility that diminutive examples might be its microspores suggests a different evolutionary lineage, perhaps linked to Aptian and younger Ariadnaesporites. Megaspores hitherto considered to belong to the same group as Arcellites, and therefore usually identified as A. pyriformis, first appear in Berriasian deposits in the Wealden succession. The construction of the neck of this spore has, however, led to the suggestion that the species should perhaps be referred to a different genus. Bohemisporites was erected just over 10 years ago to accommodate apparently identical Czech specimens, but has been little used since then. The structure of the wall of both British and Czech material, which includes a well-ordered exoexinal layer, confirms that assignment to this genus is appropriate. Although the spores may be derived from plants that grew in or near water, reference to the water fern group is now questioned. Links with the lycopsid order Selaginellales are possible. Regardless of the origins of the megaspores discussed, their palynological associations and recovery in abundance from sediments laid down in quiet freshwater bodies (ponds, lakes, disused river channels) render all of them useful indicators of environmental conditions and composition of local vegetation, and might also support inferences from other data for a seasonal climate during much of the period of deposition of the Wealden succession.

AB  - An historical introduction to the geotherm and its significance for the existence of a diamond window at the base of the peridotite lithosphere is followed by a brief survey of types of mantle zenoliths (low T, high T and metasomatized peridotites, megacrysts or discrete nodules, eclogites and less common varieties). The similarities of eclogite xenoliths to the subducted eclogites with graphitized diamonds in the peridotite massif of Beni Bousera, northern Morocco, are reviewed. Diamond-bearing peridotite (Archaean harzburgite and Iberzolite) and eclogite xenoliths are rare, having suffered excessive disaggregation. They do not necessarily relate proportionately to the types of diamonds in the host kimberlite/lamproite.
   Batches of single mineral species from disaggregated diamondiferous xenoliths, particularly garnets, form a realistic approach to diamond exploration. Nickel thermometry applied to Cr pyropes, developed by Griffin et al. (1989) Contr. Miner. Petrol. 103, 199-203, and barometry dependent upon Cr content in notional coexisting spinels, provide a realistic appreciation of the extent of the diamond window. Sodium and K pressure ''indicators'' in eclogitic garnets and clinopyroxenes are reviewed, but estimates are affected by mantle processes (metasomatism) and amounts of coexisting P and Ti.
   Metasomatic processes in the basal lithosphere are sourced in the underlying asthenospheric (megacryst) magmas. Depending on the degree and type of interaction they can result in the destruction of ancient diamonds or the growth of new peridotitic diamonds. Partial destruction or replacement of mineral indicators may also result and Cr garnets acquire distinctive quantifiable trace element signatures. High T minerals encapsulated in diamond are either relict from former ambient high T conditions or the result of localized thermal highs emanating from asthenospheric magmas (or plume/diapir).
   It is concluded that the fullest significance of the geochemistry (sensuo lato) of the diamondiferous debris erupted by kimberlites and lamproites, can only be made by reference to complementary geophysical, structural and isotopic studies of the surrounding cratonic country rocks. Thus, tectonothermal events which punctuate the varied evolutionary histories of cratons-plume migration, rifting, subduction/overthrusting, delamination, cratonization, flood basalt generation, regional metamorphism and metasomatism, etc.-can be manifested in the deep lithosphere environment, and cannot be divorced from questions of diamond formation and survival.

AB  - Reflectivity data from Doppler radars are used to construct vertical profiles of radar reflectivity (VPRR) of convective cells in mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) in three different environmental regimes. The National Center for Atmospheric Research CP-3 and CP-4 radars are used to calculate median VPRR for MCSs in the Oklahoma-Kansas Preliminary Regional Experiment for STORM-Central in 1985. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere radar in Darwin, Australia, is used to calculate VPRR for MCSs observed both in oceanic, monsoon regimes and in continental, break period regimes during the wet seasons of 1987/88 and 1988/89.
   The midlatitude and tropical continental VPRRs both exhibit maximum reflectivity somewhat above the surface and have a gradual decrease in reflectivity with height above the freezing level. In sharp contrast, the tropical oceanic profile has a maximum reflectivity at the lowest level and a very rapid decrease in reflectivity with height beginning just above the freezing level. The tropical oceanic profile in the Darwin area is almost the same shape as that for two other tropical oceanic regimes, leading to the conclusion that it is characteristic.
   The absolute values of reflectivity in the 0-degrees to -20-degrees-C range are compared with values in the literature thought to represent a threshold for rapid storm electrification leading to lightning, about 40 dBZ at - 10-degrees-C. Most oceanic cells have reflectivities below the threshold; most midlatitude continental cells exceed the threshold, and the tropical continental cells are about equally divided above and below the threshold. The large negative vertical gradient of reflectivity in this temperature range for oceanic storms is hypothesized to be a direct result of the characteristically weaker vertical velocities observed in MCSs over tropical oceans. It is proposed, as a necessary condition for rapid electrification, that a convective cell must have its updraft speed exceed some threshold value. Based upon field program data, a tentative estimate for the magnitude of this threshold is 6-7 m s-1 for mean speed and 10(-12) m s-1 for peak speed.

AB  - Across much of the Arctic, lakes and ponds dominate the landscape. Starting in late September, the lakes are covered in ice, with ice persisting well into June or early July. In summer, the lakes are highly productive, supporting waterfowl and fish populations. However, little is known about the diversity and ecology of microscopic life in the lakes that influence biogeochemical cycles and contribute to ecosystem services. Even less is known about the prevalence of species that are characteristic of the seasons or whether some species persist year-round under both ice cover and summer open-water conditions. To begin to address these knowledge gaps, we sampled 10 morphometrically diverse lakes in the region of Ekaluktutiak (Cambridge Bay), on southern Victoria Island (NU, Canada). We focused on Greiner Lake, the lakes connected to it, isolated ponds, and two nearby larger lakes outside the Greiner watershed. The largest lakes sampled were Tahiryuaq (Ferguson Lake) and the nearby Spawning Lake, which support commercial sea-run Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) fisheries. Samples for nucleic acids were collected from the lakes along with limnological metadata. Microbial eukaryotes were identified with high-throughput amplicon sequencing targeting the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene. Ciliates, dinoflagellates, chrysophytes, and cryptophytes dominated the lake assemblages. A Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrix separated communities into under-ice and open-water clusters, with additional separation by superficial lake area. In all, 133 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) occurred either in all under-ice or all open-water samples and were considered "core" microbial species or ecotypes. These were further characterized as seasonal indicators. Ten of the OTUs were characteristic of all lakes and all seasons sampled. Eight of these were cryptophytes, suggesting diverse functional capacity within the lineage. The core open-water indicators were mostly chrysophytes, with a few ciliates and uncharacterized Cercozoa, suggesting that summer communities are mixotrophic with contributions by heterotrophic taxa. The core under-ice indicators included a dozen ciliates along with chrysophytes, cryptomonads, and dinoflagellates, indicating a more heterotrophic community augmented by mixotrophic taxa in winter.

AB  - Poverty is the most important metric for determining the nature and sense of wellbeing in a given area. Most economists consider poverty to be an economic criterion for assessing many aspects of human development as well as overall social development; yet, society is multi-faceted in its many forms. To address this pressing societal issue, the current study used the Multidimensional poverty index (MPI). To analyse urban poverty among slum communities, the researchers used the Global MPI of the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative and UNDP (following Alkire and Foster) techniques. Researchers attempted to create a Multidimensional poverty index (MPI) for impoverished households in Purulia's designated slums in this study. In the second phase, the multidimensional poverty of Purulia's urban poor households was assessed based on (a) location, (b) social groupings, and (c) length of stay. Finally, researchers have attempted to identify the factors that contribute to multidimensional poverty. Two indicators, the Head Count Ratio (H) and Intensity of Poverty, have been offered to better explain the nature of MPI (A). Based on slum population density and areal density, eight urban slum areas with 320 households has been taken from 8 selected slums based on Yamane's methodology from Purulia Municipality's wards. A structured questionnaire, an oral history interview, and a focus group discussion were used as primary data sources, with secondary data acquired from several officially published sources. The study displays a decomposed multidimensional poverty picture in terms of overall condition, socioeconomic groups, and household age, with a quantitative methodology that is transparent. When the locations have been considered, a qualitative approach has been used to determine that the slums closest to the railway track are the most multidimensionally disadvantaged of the eight slums. Furthermore, the schedule caste population has been found to be more deprived across many socioeconomic groups, with Scheduled tribe (ST) households being the most deprived in terms of health on one hand (applied quantitative methodology) and multi-nominal regression (applied qualitative methodology) indicating a mix mode approach. This form of analysis, which combines quantitative and qualitative approaches, can aid stakeholders and policymakers in developing specific poverty-reduction policies at the regional level.

AB  - Despite numerous studies, there are many knowledge gaps in our understanding of uranium (U) contamination in the alluvial aquifers of Punjab, India. In this study, a large hydrogeochemical dataset was compiled to better understand the major factors controlling the mobility and enrichment of uranium (U) in this groundwater system. The results showed that shallow groundwaters (<60 m) are more contaminated with U than from deeper depths (>60 m). This effect was predominant in the Southwest districts of the Malwa, facing significant risk due to chemical toxicity of U. Groundwaters are mostly oxidizing and alkaline (median pH: 7.25 to 7.33) in nature. Spearman correlation analysis showed that U concentrations are more closely related to total dissolved solids (TDS), salinity, Na, K, HCO3-, NO3-Cl-, and F- in shallow water than deep water, but TDS and salinity remained highly correlated (U-TDS: rho = 0.5 to 0.6; U-salinity: rho = 0.5). This correlation suggests that the salt effect due to high competition between ions is the principal cause of U mobilization. This effect is evident when the U level increased with increasing mixed water species (Na-Cl, Mg-Cl, and Na-HCO3). Speciation data showed that the mast dominant U species are Ca2UO2(CO3)(2-) and CaUO2(CO3)(3)(-), which arc responsible for the U mobility. Based on the field parameters, TDS along with pH and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) were better fitted to U concentration above the WHO guideline value (30 mu g.L-1), thus this combination could be used as a quick indicator of U contamination. The strong positive conflation of U with F- (p = 0.5) in shallow waters indicates that their primary source is geogenic, while anthropogenic factors such as canal irrigation, groundwater table decline, and use of agrochemicals (mainly nitrate fertilizers) as well as climate-related factors i.e., high evaporation under arid/semi-arid climatic conditions, which result in higher redox and TDS/salinity levels, may greatly affect enrichment of U. The geochemical rationale of this study will provide Science-based-policy implications for U health risk assessment in this region and further extrapolate these findings to other arid/semi-arid areas worldwide.

AB  - The term humic substances (HS) refers to a group of heterogeneous, dark-colored polydisperse substances found in soils, peats, natural waters, and sediments. It is hypothesized that HSs are formed as a result of degradation and transformation of biomolecules of organic residues and free radical condensation reactions (a process called humification). Humic substances are classified as a special category of natural compounds that are dissimilar to the biomolecules of plant and microbial tissues, and are resistant to biodegradation. On the basis of their solubility in alkalis, HSs are divided into humic acids (HAs, soluble, precipitated at pH < 2), fulvic acids (FAs, soluble at all pH values), and humin (insoluble residue). The review provides a critical analysis of the HS terminology and nomenclature, the method of extraction of HS from natural objects, and the hypotheses describing their formation. The ambiguity and duality of the concept of HSs (specific compounds and the sum of operational fractions) are demonstrated, as well as an arbitrary character of the division of organic matter (OM) into the dark-colored compounds of poorly defined structure (HSs) and the substances with a known structure (non-HSs). The interpretation of HSs as mass products of a secondary synthesis requires revision. The possibility of extracellular free radical reactions in soils leaves no doubt; however, a quantitative contribution of the corresponding products to the natural OM has not been established yet. The traditional alkaline extraction should be considered as a method for isolation of hydrophilic polar substances, while the precipitation with acid as their concentration for further analysis. The historical names of humic fractions (HAs, FAs, and humin) should be retained as well-established generic terms and names of the preparations obtained in a certain way without attaching unique features and specificity to all components of these fractions. The C-HA/C-FA (or C-HA/C-org) ratios are simple and convenient indicators of the types of humus reflecting bioclimatic conditions of its formation.

AB  - Nowadays, special attention is paid to the problem of integrating people with disabilities into society due to the fact that the Russian Federation has ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and adopted associated regulations. The article examines the socio-philosophical approaches to the problem of disability and identifies the most productive grounds for the integration of people with intellectual developmental needs. Despite the active creation of conditions for inclusion of people with disabilities, in practice there is a frequent unsuitability of these innovations, as well as the lack of successful mechanisms for integrating people with intellectual limitations. This situation is connected with the theoretical approaches underlying the consideration of the problem, such as positivism, the ideas of which are relevant to the medical model of disability. A person with a disability is considered as a patient, an inferior, who must either be cured or excluded from society, which leads to discrimination. However, social models which shift the focus of the problem from the disabled person to society are also criticized for creating an opposite, positive discrimination of the disabled, which generates public dissatisfaction. The article makes a conclusion that the most acceptable is the concept of human diversity, which assumes the normal coexistence of all categories of people, regardless of their characteristics. In turn, the development of inclusion mechanisms uses the theory of social exclusion, with the help of which exclusion indicators are identified. The highlighted indicators are the result of theoretical analysis and sociological research through interviews with specialists from boarding houses for mentally retarded children conducted in 2016-2018 in Siberia. As a result of the study, the following indicators were identified: exclusion from family upbringing; monotony of social environment; territorial remoteness; exclusion from educational, social and cultural life; predetermined life path. Indicators allow noting not only the existing limitations of integration, but also marking its most effective mechanisms. In conclusion, it is stated that the analysis of socio-philosophical foundations allows determining the most productive theories that underlie technologies. In the future, the model of human diversity and the theory of social exclusion could become fundamental in relation to the integration of people with cognitive disabilities.

AB  - The introduction of renewable energy (RE) is essential for building a sustainable society. However, RE can cause conflicts between energy production and biodiversity conservation. This study conducted a scenario analysis to evaluate potential conflicts in the nexuses between energy and biodiversity for the Bekambeushi River watershed located in northeastern Japan. The increasing rate of pastureland abandonment resulting from a declining farmer population is a source of great uncertainty in this area. Two alternative sources of RE were selected to utilize these abandoned pasturelands, each taking a unique approach to meet targets stipulated by regional energy plans, thereby producing different ecological consequences at the landscape scale. Thirty-one RE introduction options were simulated, comprising a range of pastureland abandonment expansion speeds and ratios of solar photovoltaic (PV) plant installation to biomass energy use. These were superimposed using two IPCC representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios, 2.6 and 8.5, resulting in 62 scenarios that were summarized as three groups based on the RE supply-demand balance and the ecological impacts. The LANDIS-II model was used to simulate these scenarios from 2016 to 2100. The results indicate that both the rate of pastureland abandonment and the ratio of the two RE sources had a large impact on changes in tree species diversity and the habitat suitability of raptors. Abandoned pastureland converted to tree biomass energy production shifted to pioneer species-dominated forest. The plant species composition of transitional forests varied between the climate scenarios. The higher temperature of the RCP 8.5 scenario toward 2100 prevented the establishment of Betula platyphylla and altered tree species diversity and the habitat suitability of Ketupa blakistoni blakistoni. Biomass energy utilization produced less energy than the demand but increased the three ecological indicators. Solar PV systems provided more energy than the regional demand, but the tree diversity and habitat suitability indices for two raptors declined. However, an appropriate mixture of the two RE sources satisfied the regional energy demand and maintained ecological conditions. Our results suggest that land-energy planning should consider energy-biodiversity nexuses to strike a balance between decarbonization and biodiversity conservation.

AB  - This article presents the data collected through an extensive research work conducted in a historic hilly town in central Italy during the period 2016-2017. Data concern two different datasets: long-term hygrothermal histories collected in two specific positions of the town object of the research, and three environmental transects collected following on foot the same designed path at three different time of the same day, i.e. during a heat wave event in summer. The short-term monitoring campaign is carried out by means of an innovative wearable weather station specifically developed by the authors and settled upon a bike helmet. Data provided within the short-term monitoring campaign are analysed by computing the apparent temperature, a direct indicator of human thermal comfort in the outdoors. All provided environmental data are geo-referenced. These data are used in order to examine the intra-urban microclimate variability. Outcomes from both long- and short-term monitoring campaigns allow to confirm the existing correlation between the urban forms and functionalities and the corresponding local microclimate conditions, also generated by anthropogenic actions. In detail, higher fractions of built surfaces are associated to generally higher temperatures as emerges by comparing the two long-term air temperature data series, i.e. temperature collected at point 1 is higher than temperature collated at point 2 for the 75% of the monitored period with an average of +2.8 degrees C. Furthermore, gathered environmental transects demonstrate the high variability of the main environmental parameters below the Urban Canopy. Diversification of the urban thermal behaviour leads to a computed apparent temperature range in between 33.2 degrees C and 46.7 degrees C at 2 p.m. along the monitoring path. Reuse of these data may be helpful for further investigating interesting correlations among urban configuration, anthropogenic actions and microclimate variables affecting outdoor comfort. Additionally, the proposed dataset may be compared to other similar datasets collected in other urban contexts around the world. Finally, it can be compared to other monitoring methodologies such as weather stations and satellite measurements available in the location at the same time. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - High-temporal-resolution views of particle flux to the abyssal benthic boundary layer are provided for an eight-month period (October 2014-June 2015) at the long-term monitoring site Station M within the California Current ecosystem. Contributions of fecal pellets and aggregates to particulate organic carbon (POC) flux at 3900 m depth were estimated based on optical sediment trap (Sedimentation Event Sensor) images captured as a time-series of 2 h collections. POC flux estimated from Sedimentation Event Sensor (SES) images explained variation in carbon consumption and the carbon budget balance (supply - demand) with finer resolution than POC flux measurements from bulk collections by a concurrently deployed conventional sediment trap. Indicators of particle transport by benthic boundary layer currents and active transport by zooplankton were evaluated by comparing SES-estimated POC flux to measured current speed and direction, hours since solar noon, and modeled lunar illumination at the surface. Influence of particles (fecal pellets and aggregates) on the carbon budget was evaluated by comparing particle-specific contributions to POC flux with sediment community oxygen consumption (SCOC) measured by the Benthic Rover at 4000 m depth. During the eight-month sampling period, salp fecal pellets delivered an estimated 45% of the total POC flux to the benthic boundary layer and were responsible for an estimated 74% of a temporary carbon surplus in May and June 2015. Sa1p fecal pellets also appeared to be the primary source of chlorophyll peaks at the site. By contrast, most aggregates appeared to be lower-quality particles possibly sourced from lateral advection and local rebound of recently-settled detritus, which settled according to spring-neap tidal oscillations. Some aggregates may have been fresher, as suggested by non-linear relationships with SCOC and the carbon budget balance. Results suggest sinking particles packaged in surface waters and reaching abyssal depths in fresh condition (e.g. salp fecal pellets) had a greater influence on carbon consumption (e.g. SCOC) and the carbon budget balance than more refractory particles.

AB  - Many soil improvement practices are directly related to the reduction of weed infestation in crops. Sustainable use of the acid moraine loam Bathygleyic Distric Glossic Retisol prevailing in Western Lithuania is associated with the appropriate intensity of liming and tillage. Research was carried out at the Vezaiciai Branch of Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry during the period 2015-2018 in two long-term field experiments: liming (established in 1949) and soil tillage methods (established in 2003). The aim of the study was to establish the trends in weed infestation variation in the crop rotation after a long-term application of agronomic practices of different intensity (soil tillage and liming) Treatments of the soil tillage were as follows: conventional ploughing, shallow ploughing and shallow ploughless tillage. Treatments of liming were as follows: unlimed (pH(KCl) 4.0-4.1) and limed (pH(KCl) 6.2-6.8). The following weed infestation indicators were investigated: weed number and mass, weed species number, weed seed bank in the soil depths of 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm.
   Findings of the study suggest that the long-term liming had an impact on the disappearance of dominating acidophilic weeds from crop communities. In a limed soil (pH 6.4-6.8), the total number of weeds was 4.1 times lower compared to that in a naturally acid soil (pH 4.0-4.1). The contamination with weed seeds was 14.2 times greater in the naturally acid soil; however, irrespective of the soil acidity (pH), vertical seed distribution was determined to be similar in different depths of the soil. The long-term conventional ploughing reduced crop weediness in the soil of low acidity (5.1-5.3). The total weed number and mass were 1.6 and 1.4 times greater in the treatment of reduced tillage soil. The effect of long-term regular soil tillage tended to cause changes to the depth of soil loosening, affecting vertical weed seed distribution. Under reduced tillage conditions, the soil depth of 0-10 cm was the most contaminated with weed seeds.

AB  - The intensive nature of soil use in vegetable production areas has led to a marked decrease in soil quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of adoption of soil management systems on vegetable production with regards to the chemical properties of a Rhodic Ferralsol after five years and to evaluate the use of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) statistical tool in discriminating the different treatments. The experiment was conducted under field conditions in central Brazil in a randomized block design with four replications and a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement (three soil management systems x two cover crops). The soil management systems used were NT (no-tillage), RT (reduced tillage), and CT (conventional tillage). The cover crops used were corn (Zea mays) alone and corn intercropped with the gray velvet bean (Stizolobium niveum). Reduced tillage showed the highest values of sum of bases, cation exchange capacity (T), and total organic carbon contents in the 0.00-0.05 m layer. In the same layer, RT and CT showed higher values of pH and K content. No-tillage and RT showed the highest P and Ca2+ contents and H+Al and T values. In the 0.05-0.10 m layer, RT had higher a pH value and Mg2+ contents. No-tillage and CT had higher potential acidity in this layer. The management systems (0.10-0.30 m) and the cover plants (all layers) had no effect on the properties analyzed. The use of PCA determined that the two principal components explained the following percentage of the data variance: 90.8 % (0.0-0.05 m), 79.8 % (0.05-0.10 m), and 83.1 % (0.10-0.30 m). Analysis of the eigenvectors and the grouping of treatments in PCA also showed that RT was most effective in improving soil fertility properties. Reduced tillage was most effective in increasing soil fertility after five years. The PCA is recommended as a useful tool and it allowed the identification of patterns not revealed by traditional tools.

AB  - To identify superoxide dismutase (SOD) genes and evaluate their usefulness as potential markers for monitoring metal toxicity in aquatic environment, we cloned, sequenced, and characterized 3 SOD genes (Cu/Zn-SOD1, Cu/Zn-SOD2, and Mn-SOD) from the marine polychaete Perinereis nuntia. The accumulated metal contents and expressions of 3 SOD genes were compared after exposure to single and combinations of heavy metals, As, Ni, and Pb. The deduced amino acid sequences of the 3 SODs had evolutionary conserved domains, such as metal binding sites, and signature sequences. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that Cu/Zn-SOD1, Cu/Zn-SOD2, and Mn-SOD were clustered with extracellular Cu/Zn-SOD, intracellular Cu/Zn-SOD and mitochondrial Mn-SOD, respectively, of other species. The accumulated contents of Ni and Pb increased significantly in a time - dependent manner after exposure to both single and combination of the metals. However, the concentration of As did not change significantly in the exposure test. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array showed that the 3 SOD genes had differential expression patterns depending on the exposure condition. The expression of all SODs mRNAs was significantly elevated in response to Pb alone and in combination with As. The mRNA level of Cu/Zn-SOD1 was the highest after exposure to Pb alone, while that of Mn-SOD was remarkably enhanced after exposure to a combination of As and Pb. Exposure to Ni alone rapidly elevated the expression of Cu/Zn-SOD1 and Mn-SOD mRNA, which then gradually decreased. Exposure to As had no significant effect on the modulation of any of the SOD genes of P. nuntia. These results suggest that all SOD genes might play important roles in cellular protection as antioxidant enzymes against heavy metal toxicity via different modes of action in P. nuntia and might have the potential to act as indicators in an environment containing a mixture of metals.

AB  - The Atlantic dipole phosphate utilization (ADPU) index, derived through statistical conversion of 20th century Atlantic basin subpolar sea surface temperatures, is used as a fingerprint of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) variability and as an indicator of global Meridional Overturing Circulation (MOC) variability. ADPU index correlations with differences in sea level anomalies (SLAs) between Canada and the UK and across the Isthmus of Panama demonstrate intrabasin and interbasin associations with MOC variability. Cross-correlation analyses of ADPU index, SLAs, and sardine (S) and anchovy (A) catch differences [S A] (normalized sardine catch minus normalized anchovy catch) confirm strong correlations between ADPU and [S A] off Japan, California, Peru and Southwest Africa (Benguela). Statistically significant cross correlations also exist between the ADPU index and SLAs for Japan, California, Peru and Benguela, and for SLAs and [S A] for Japan, California and Peru, but the short time-series lengths compared with the length of the multidecadal cycle limit the interpretation of the observed lead-lags. Though correlation is not causality, the correlation analyses developed here are useful in support of hypothesis generation. The proposed hypothesis to explain the observed small pelagic fishery synchronies asserts: (i) ocean bathymetry and continental distributions interact with multidecadal variations in MOC strength that occur along the conceptual global conveyor belt to generate changes in global oceanic planetary waves and mesoscale eddies that propagate through the world ocean; (ii) each small pelagic fishery region has a unique spatial relationship with pertinent oceanic planetary wave and mesoscale eddy source regions that affect the timing and strength of the waves and eddies that influence the nearby boundary current; (iii) synchronous changes or phasing among global fisheries depend on how and when MOC variability mediated by oceanic planetary waves and mesoscale eddies reaches each fishery region; (iv) oceanic planetary waves and/or mesoscale eddies influence the strength or meandering of the boundary current adjacent to a small pelagic fishery region to change local SLAs and environmental conditions to favour sardine or anchovy populations at different times.

AB  - Our researches have focused primarily on variations of different biophysical and biochemical effects on vegetal and animal material at macro, micro, and ultra-micro scale resulted from changes in environmental condition. Growth and spectral parameters of rapeseed seedlings from seeds exposed to UVA-VIS radiation with a high pressure lamp which emits incoherent continuously radiation for different time periods were examined 14 days after germination. These studied parameters correspond at macro, respectively ultra-micro scale. Thus, the physiological parameters, allometric exponent associated with statistical analysis were analyzed. The responses of the functional groups, mainly related with lipid structure which occurred on a molecular level during the radiation process, were investigated with Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Another objective of our study was the behavior of indicators of the functional pigments and light adaptation of the photosynthetic apparatus analyzed by UV-VIS spectroscopy. The highest germination percentage of rapeseed seedlings, 84.37 %, was recorded for seeds exposed for 135 minutes and it is greater than the control sample with 6.6 %, and the lowest (69.79%) was calculated for seeds exposed for 65 minutes. Variations of allometric exponent as growth parameter resulting from relationship between different organ parts as consequence of UVA-VIS irradiation were found. The results show that the value of negative allometric exponent computed from power regression shape decreases from 7/8 to approximately 4/8 when the irradiation dose increases. Power regression describes all variations between stem and root length from a strong to a weak link with variations for R-2 from 0.902 for control sample to 0.395 for the most irradiated sample. Values of the partial eta squared chi(2) indicate that the irradiation impact is more pronounced in steam case. Enhanced UVA-VIS irradiation specifically affects conformational changes of the hydrocarbon chain by increasing the ratio between gauche and trans isomers, simultaneously with the decreasing of the degree of fatty acid components saturation. Early indicator of senescence decreased and the greenness of seedlings increased with increasing of the exposure time of rape seeds.

AB  - Deep-water massive (featureless) sands are commonly interpreted as indicators of flow conditions during or shortly after deposition and are almost never interpreted to reflect post-depositional homogenization due to bioturbation. Deep-water deposits of the lower Rio Dell Formation (Pliocene), Eel River basin (NW California), however, reveal previously unrecognized cryptically bioturbated fabrics in massive sandstone and mudstone. This study represents the first detailed documentation of cryptically bioturbated massive-appearing sandstone in deep-water channelized environments.
   Although fluid escape contributed to some of the massive-appearing textures in the Rio Dell Formation, we present criteria for recognizing cryptic bioturbation fabrics: (1) tubes with lithologically distinctive concentric linings or infillings, (2) meniscate backfill in burrows, (3) lithologically distinctive spreite, (4) concentric grain orientations, and (5) grains realigned adjacent to tubular structures.
   Using biostratigraphic data, detailed stratigraphic descriptions, core photos, and photomicrographs, we document ichnofabrics associated with two main lithofacies and their bounding surfaces: (1) diffuse muddy siltstone lithofacies (e.g. Planolites, Phycosiphon, Schaubcylindrichnus), (2) massive sandstone lithofacies (e.g. cryptic bioturbation, Planolites), (3) lithofacies crossers, (4) burrows that prefer the top-of-sand/base-of-mud interface (e.g. Planolites, Skolithos), and (5) a Glossifungites-demarcated discontinuity at the base of the massive sand lithofacies.
   We also establish two main lithofacies associations with characteristic sedimentologic traits. We use relative percentages of the lithofacies associations to interpret slope-channel depositional facies: distal channel margin, proximal channel margin, and channel axis. By comparing ichnologic characteristics to depositional facies, we conclude that proximity to the channel axis appear to control the degree and type of bioturbation observed in the massive-appearing deposits. Distal channel margin deposits preserve the smallest burrows, highly developed cryptic bioturbation fabrics, and the most complete sequence of background bioturbation. Proximal channel margin and channel axis deposits record larger burrows but incomplete cryptic bioturbated fabrics and an overall smaller proportion of preserved background bioturbation.

AB  - The European Medicines Agency guideline for the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products provides a step-by-step phased approach to evaluate the potential risks of new medicines to the environment Phase I ("prescreen") estimates the initial exposure of the new medicine in the environment. Phase II A ("screen") estimates the fate and effects in the environment The fate screen determines the inherent properties of the new medicinal active ingredient to sorb to sludge, soil, and sediment matrices and its potential to degrade in a sewage treatment plant and in the subsequent water-sediment compartment Current ERA Guidance (2006) recommends the OECD 301B Ready Biodegradation Test for Phase II Tier A testing without a clear recommendation for Phase II Tier B testing when further refinement may be needed. With the recent approval of the OECD 314B method for activated sludge, there is now an alternative test method that may be better suited for Phase II Tier A testing and to the data needs of the ERA. As a batch test, it fits the needs of a Tier A screen. It is not designed to simulate the operational steps of a sewage treatment plant such as the OECD 303 tests, and yet provides the following without considerable costs or resources of OECD 303: (1) useful kinetic information in a test that reflects the conditions of the sewage-treatment environment i.e., realistic biomass solids concentrations and low level test material concentrations to simulate first-order (nongrowth) kinetics, (2) mass balance analysis for CO(2) evolution and for residues found in mixed liquor, (3) use of an abiotic control to assess losses other than those attributed to biotic biodegradation, and (4) biotransformation profile of degradants. This paper presents the results of OECD 301B with that of OECD 314B for activated sludge biodegradation for five Pfizer drug substances. The use of this new method as an alternative to OECD 301B would strengthen the fate testing screen in Phase II Tier A of the EMEA ERA. It would provide a characterization of a substance's potential for biotransformation and mineralization during sewage treatment and provide a means for revising predicted environmental concentration of surface water for amount removed during sewage treatment.

AB  - Numerous studies have explored the influence of forest management on avian communities empirically, but uncertainty about causal relationships between landscape patterns and temporal dynamics of bird communities calls into question how observed historical patterns can be projected into the future, particularly to assess consequences of differing management alternatives. We used the Habplan harvest scheduler to project forest conditions under several management scenarios mapped at 5-year time steps over a 40-year time span. We used empirical models of overall avian richness, richness of selected guilds, and probability of presence for selected species to predict avian community characteristics for each of the mapped landscapes generated for each 5-year time step for each management scenario. We then used time series analyses to quantify relationships between changes in avian community characteristics and management-induced changes to forest landscapes over time. our models of avian community and species characteristics indicated habitat associations at multiple spatial scales, although landscape-level measures of habitat were generally more important than stand-level measures. Our projections showed overall avian richness, richness of Neotropical migrants, and the presence of Blue-gray Gnatcatchers and Eastern Wood-pewees varied little among management scenarios, corresponding closely to broad, overall landscape changes over time. By contrast, richness of canopy nesters, richness of cavity nesters, richness of scrub-successional associates, and the presence of Common Yellowthroats showed high temporal variability among management scenarios, likely corresponding to short-term, fine-scale changes in the landscape. Predicted temporal variability of both interior-forest and early successional birds was low in the unharvested landscape relative to that in the harvested landscape. Our results also suggested that early successional species can be sensitive to both availability and connectivity of habitat on the landscape. To increase or maintain the avian diversity, our projections indicate that forest managers need to consider landscape-scale configuration of stands, maintaining a spatially heterogeneous distribution of age classes. Our findings suggest which measures of richness or species presence may be appropriate indicators for monitoring effects of forest management on avian communities, depending on management objectives.

AB  - As central-place foragers, colonial seabirds should be able to compensate, up to some threshold, for changing breeding conditions by remaining flexible in the amount of time allocated to foraging versus other activities. Black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) colonies in Chiniak Bay, Kodiak Island, Alaska experienced high productivity from 2001 to 2003 and virtually no productivity from 2004 to 2005. In the absence of disease epidemics, increased human disturbance or predation, we applied multilevel, mixed, regression models to assess the hypothesis that the collapse from high to low breeding success was due primarily to changes in prey availability. Under this hypothesis, we predicted that longer foraging trips would be associated with reduced breeding performance in cohorts of kittiwakes-groups marked with radio-transmitters at the same colony in the same year. We separately modeled two response variables: foraging trip-durations made during the incubation and early chick stages. Multilevel mixed models revealed only weak variation at the cohort-level in either response variable; hatching success and fledging success accounted for none or less than 2% of the total variation in trip-durations made during the incubation and early chick stages, respectively The majority of the variation in our response variables was at the observation (ca. 80-90%) and bird (or individual) levels (ca. 10-12%). Our results expose the unreliability of using indirect evidence to implicate prey availability as the primary cause of widespread breeding failures in colonial seabirds. In the ecological literature, two types of inferences seem particularly vulnerable to indirect evidence: inferences following studies on species that are accepted or strongly promoted as bioindicators of changes in marine productivity such as the black-legged kittiwake, and inferences that implicate a fisheries-induced reduction in prey availability to failed breeding. In light of these pitfalls, we recommend that long-term monitoring studies on kittiwakes and other seabirds carefully consider in their study designs and implementations multiple working hypotheses that might explain major changes in breeding success.

AB  - A possible deep-water non-evaporitic unit equivalent of the Messinian Lower Evaporites has been recognised in the Northern Apennine foredeep. This unit, whose existence is implicitly admitted in the two-step model of the Mediterranean Messinian salinity crisis is documented here for the first time; it occurs throughout the Apennine foredeep basin below a thick horizon of resedimented gypsum deposits, usually ascribed to the Lower Evaporites. Actually, the Lower Evaporites of the Apennine foredeep basin include both shallow-water, in situ precipitated facies and deep-water, resedimented facies deposited in distinct depocenters. The usually envisaged coeval nature of the two deposits has been recently challenged in several works based on a) physical-stratigraphic considerations about the downbasin correlation of the Messinian erosional surface cutting on top the in situ evaporites with the sharp base of the resedimented evaporites unit and b) the common occurrence of a barren unit below the resedimented evaporites which has no obvious equivalents in pre-evaporitic successions underlying the in situ precipitated evaporites. In this work a multidisciplinary study has been carried out on a 140 m-thick composite section (Fanantello section) to definitely assess the age and palaeoenvironmental characteristics of the unit underlying the resedimented gypsum deposits. The topmost part of the section comprises a 60 m-thick succession of barren euxinic shales falling entirely within a reversed polarity chron and characterised by a) the complete disappearance of Foraminifera, b) the occurrence of high salinity tolerant thecosomatous pteropods (Creseis sp.) c) the abundance peaks of the calcareous nannofossil Sphenolithus abies (interpreted as related to highly stressed likely hyperhaline conditions), d) the appearance of hyperhaline and/or stratified water molecular indicators (gammacerane, < 0.2 pristane/phytane ratio, < 1 n-alkanes odd-even predominance).
   Based on a multidisciplinary integrated stratigraphic approach this barren interval, is here proposed to be a deeper-water time equivalent of the in situ primary Lower Evaporites, thus allowing to assess the events connected to the onset and the first phase of the Messinian salinity crisis from a basinal perspective.

AB  - Aims: To describe the relation of various water status measures of woody perennial plants (predawn and midday stem and leaf water potential), to indices of physiological activity such as leaf conductance, vegetative growth and fruit growth and composition.
   Methods and results: Almonds were exposed to three levels of irrigation over three years, and midday stem water potential (SWP) and leaf conductance, collected at approximately weekly intervals, is reported for the third year of the study. A strong linear increase in both leaf conductance and trunk growth occurred with increasing SWP, and this relation was consistent both within and between treatments. A similarly positive linear relation was found between SWP and fruit size in pear, with a negative relation between SWP and fruit soluble solids and fruit color. In grapevine, SWP was found to be uniform across all lower canopy positions tested (trunk, cordon and near the base of current year shoots) and positively correlated to early season shoot growth even before irrigation treatments were applied. Midday SAT was found to be more sensitive than midday leaf water potential (LWP) for detecting treatment differences over the course of the season, but both were well correlated to average seasonal leaf conductance within and between irrigation treatments. Predawn SWP and LWP were not as well correlated to average seasonal leaf conductance, but the most important factor determining midday leaf conductance was wind speed, indicating that grape leaf stomatal responses are quite sensitive to this environmental factor.
   Conclusion: In a wide variety of woody crop species midday stem water potential (SWP) has been found to be a valuable tool for quantifying the degree of water stress experienced by the plant, and for understanding the physiological responses of the plant to water limited conditions. In grapevine, SWP detected irrigation differences over I month sooner than midday leaf water potential when the number of vines used and the number of samples taken were the same for both methods, and SWP had a higher correlation to leaf conductance than predawn leaf or stem water potential.
   Significance and impact of study: SWP as a standard method for quantifying water stress in grapevine and other crops will aid research in the development of reliable management practices to improve crop productivity and quality.

AB  - Simple Summary The dairy system is facing many environmental issues, such as greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and consumption of human-edible raw materials, as well as increased demand for milk by the growing world population. Dairy cow farming must evolve toward more efficient and sustainable methods of production. Strategies to reduce the carbon footprint of the animal feed used and enhance overall productivity should be considered. Feed production, especially soybean meal, represents the second source of total dairy greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, there is a positive correlation between production efficiency and environmental footprint. Using slow-releasing urea sources as an alternative to soybean meal can enhance rumen efficiency, functionality and reduce emissions related to the feed used due to a lower carbon footprint. The effects of partially replacing soybean meal (SBM) with a slow-release urea source (SRU) on production performance, feed efficiency, digestibility, and environmental sustainability of dairy cows were evaluated. A total of 140 lactating Holstein Frisian cows were allocated into two study groups: (i) control (diet entirely based on SBM), and (ii) treatment (diet of 0.22% on dry matter basis (d.m.)) of SRU. Milk yield, dry matter intake (DMI), feed conversion rate (FCR), body condition score (BCS), reproductive parameters, and milk quality were evaluated. The chemical composition of the feeds and feces were analyzed to calculate the in vivo digestibility of the two diets. The carbon footprint (CFP) and predicted methane (CH4) emissions were evaluated. The inclusion of SRU significantly increases milk yield, DMI, and FCR (p < 0.0001), whereas milk quality, BCS, and reproductive indicators were not affected (p > 0.05). In the treatment group, the digestibility of crude protein (CP) (p = 0.012), NDF (p = 0.039), and cellulose (p = 0.033) was significantly higher, while the other nutritional parameters weren't affected. All the environmental parameters were significantly improved in the treatment group (p < 0.0001). Replacing SBM with SRU can be a strategy to enhance dairy cows' sustainability due to improved production efficiency, reduced feed CFP, and predicted CH4 production.

AB  - Understanding the causes of spread of overabundant species plays a key role in deciphering their invasion mechanisms, while providing managers with targeted management actions to control their spread. The objective of this research was to quantify the spread of Hooded Crow (Corvus cornix) in Israel and to elucidate the causes of its spread. Long-term occurrence data of Hooded Crow sightings were used to analyze the species range expansion rate. This dataset was analyzed with a range of climatic, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and land-use variables. Analysis of opportunistic presence-only data, corrected for possible sampling biases, illustrated traveling waves of eastward expansion, from the Mediterranean coast into Israel's central mountain range, and a star-like pattern of spread southward into the northwestern Negev desert. A diffusion equation model revealed an expansion rate of 1.60 km year(-1). Land-use analysis revealed an affinity of sighted individuals toward urban and low vegetation land types. Hooded Crow sightings were positively correlated with annual precipitation, with the remaining variation being negatively correlated with precipitation during the wettest quarter. Species distribution modeling suggested that the species has established new populations and is currently expanding its range. The slow rate of dispersal is consistent with a neighborhood diffusion pattern, corresponding to the species life-history traits. Human-managed environments, including low-cover agricultural fields, provide constant available food and nesting trees, allowing the Hooded Crow to thrive all year-round. Precipitation may aid in enhancing Hooded Crow tolerance toward other unfavorable physical conditions. In light of these new findings, management plans ought to recognize centers of Hooded Crow activity as indicators of highly disturbed native wildlife communities. Also, our findings emphasize the need to establish agri-environmental schemes (AES) in such areas, which would raise community resistance to overabundant species. As AES are currently not in place on a national scale, and since their creation has the power to improve landscape connectivity of native species, this last component is especially necessary.

AB  - Much of human exposure to particulate matter (PM) of ambient origin occurs indoors. While the oxidative potential (OP) of PM is an emerging indicator of the intrinsic toxicity of PM, little is known about the OP of indoor PM of ambient origin. Here we characterize the OP of indoor and outdoor size-resolved PM in an unoccupied apartment unit in Chicago, IL, free from indoor emission sources, to explore how the transport of ambient PM from outdoors affects OP indoors. Simultaneous measurements were conducted in both indoor and outdoor locations for at least 5 consecutive days during 11 separate sampling campaigns spanning all seasons. OP was assessed by the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay. Indoor PM2.5 concentrations were consistently lower than outdoor PM2.5 concentrations, with an average (+/- standard deviation, SD) indoor/outdoor (I/O) PM2.5 mass concentration ratio of 0.36 +/- 0.10. The volume-normalized (or extrinsic) OP of the particles was much higher for the outdoor for PM2.5 samples across all size-ranges, with an average (+/- SD) indoor-to-outdoor ratio (I/O) of 0.54 +/- 0.57. However, the mass-normalized (or intrinsic) OP of indoor PM2.5 samples was greater than concurrent outdoor PM2.5 samples during 7 of the sampling periods and had an overall average +/- SD I/O of 1.38 +/- 0.97. The extent of enhancement in intrinsic OP of ambient-infiltrated indoor PM2.5 was positively correlated with differences in indoor and outdoor temperature and relative humidity (RH). We hypothesize that changes in the intrinsic OP of ambient PM as it infiltrates indoors may be influenced by transformation processes such as size-resolved penetration, indoor deposition, evaporation of volatile chemical components with lower OP, and/or temperature/RH-dependent partitioning of redox-active substances to indoor-infiltrated PM. However, further investigations, including chemical analyses of the size-segregated indoor and outdoor PM samples and the effect of environmental factors on this chemical composition, will be needed to confirm these hypotheses.

Our main goal was to verify whether SAR data allow for the calculation of the basic indicators for the trough (w-subsidence, T-trough slope, K-curvature, u-horizontal displacements, epsilon-horizontal deformations). We verified the extent to which the Mogi and Yang models can be fitted to match the actual displacements recorded after an induced seismic tremor. The calculations were performed for the Legnica-Glogow Copper Belt (LGCB) area in southwest Poland. Due to intensive mining operations and specific geological and tectonic conditions, the area shows a high level of induced seismic activity. Our detailed analysis focused on four powerful mining tremors: the first tremor occurred on 29 November 2016 (MW3.4), the second on 7 December 2017 (MW3.3), the next on 26 December 2017 (MW3.6) and the last tremor on 29 January 2019 (MW3.7). For each analyzed event, we determined the displacements based on the Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) method and Sentinel 1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from two paths (22 and 73). Additionally, for the period from November 2014 to October 2020, we calculated the displacements using the Small Baseline Subset method (SBAS) time series method. In all cases, the tremor was followed by the development of long-lasting surface deformations. The obtained results allowed us to conclude that it is possible to calculate indicators that result from a specific induced mining event. Considering the full moment tensor and nature of the tremor source, we demonstrated that the Mogi and Yang models can be employed to describe the influence of an induced tremor on the surface in an area of mining activity. We also confirmed the global character of the influence of the reduced troposphere on SAR data calculations. Our conclusions indicate that accounting for the tropospheric correction does not distort horizontal and vertical displacement values in regions influenced by mining activity/tremors.

AB  - Here we report the relative degrees of thermal metamorphism for five Antarctic Ornans-like carbonaceous (CO) chondrites, including Dominion Range (DOM) 08006, as determined from the Cr-content of their FeO-rich (ferroan) olivine. These five CO3 chondrites complete the previously poorly-defined CO3.00 to 3.2 chondrite metamorphic trend. DOM 08006 appears to be a highly primitive CO chondrite of petrologic type 3.00. We report the detailed mineralogy and petrography of DOM 08006 using a coordinated, multi-technique approach.
   The interchondrule matrix in DOM 08006 consists of unequilibrated mixtures of silicate, metal, and sulfide minerals and lacks Fe-rich rims on silicates indicating that DOM 08006 has only experienced minimal, if any, thermal metamorphism. This is also reflected by the Co/Ni ratios of Ni-rich and Ni-poor metal, a sensitive indicator of thermal metamorphism, and the presence of euhedral chrome-spinel grains, which typically become subhedral to anhedral during progressive metamorphism. DOM 08006 matrix shows minor evidence for aqueous alteration and while the presence of magnetite surrounding metal in chondrules indicates that there has been some interaction with fluid, much metal remains and none of the sulfides analyzed show evidence of being formed by aqueous alteration. Furthermore, the plagioclase of similar to 50% of chondrules analyzed show resolvable excess silica indicating that these chondrules have experienced minimal, if any, reprocessing in the CO parent body.
   Noble gas data for DOM 08006 show that it contains the highest concentrations of trapped Ar-36 and Xe-132 of all CO chondrites analyzed to date, further indicating that DOM 08006 is the most primitive CO chondrite known. The cosmic ray exposure age of DOM 08006 is estimated to be similar to 19 Ma.
   The minimally altered nature of DOM 08006 demonstrates that it is an extremely important sample for providing valuable insight into early Solar System conditions. At a total weight of 667 g, a significant amount of material is available for a wide array of future studies. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of present study was evaluated chosen quality parameters (oxidative stability, colour, sensory quality) of raw cooked meat product after sea buckthorn application. In the experiment was 5 groups: control group (C) (without addition), P1 (5 ml of sea buckthorn juice per kg of meat mixture), P2 (10 ml of sea buckthorn juice per kg of meat mixture), P3 (0.1 ml of sea buckthorn oil per kg of meat mixture), P4 (0.5 ml of sea buckthorn oil per kg of meat mixture). The samples were stored under refrigerated conditions at 4 +/- 1 degrees C and analysed on 1,4, 7 and 10 days. At the end of storage, we observed higher oxidation stability (P <= 0.05) in all experimental groups compared to the C group. In C group was recorded the highest production of MDA (0.289 mg.kg(-1)). From the experimental groups with different additions (P >= 0.05) of bio juice and oil, we observed the highest degree of oxidative stability in the P4 with addition of bio oil in the amount of 0.5 ml (0.229 mg.kg(-1)) and bio juice with addition of 10 ml (P2 - 0.234 mg.kg(-1)). A slightly higher degree of oxidative damage was observed with the addition of bio oil in the amount of 0.1 ml (P3 - 0.245 mg.kg(-1)) and bio juice with the addition of 5 ml (P1 - 0.248 mg.kg(-1)). We had not found significantly differences (P> 0.05) among all groups at colour parameters evaluation (L* a* b*) of raw cooked meat products. In the evaluation of the individual sensory quality indicators after addition natural antioxidants we did not record statistically significant differences (P> 0.05) between individual groups, indicating that the sensory quality of raw cooked meat products was not negatively affected by their addition. The fortification of meat-fatty batters using 100% bio juice and bio oil Sea buckthorn berries strongly inhibit lipid oxidation during storage and that suggest that it can be used as a natural preservative instead of chemical food additives.

AB  - The contradiction between the shortage of land for agriculture due to rapid expansion of industrialization and urbanization and increasing population pressure is projected to impose great threats to future food security. Agricultural land suitability evaluation is an effective approach to improve the utilization of land resources for crop production and thus enhance the capacity of food provision. In this study, we evaluated the land suitability for agriculture of the production space in the Taihang Mountains by three steps: establishing indicator system, determining weights for indicators, and constructing a fuzzy matter-element model to assess the grades of suitability. Results showed that the land suitability had a significant linear correlation with potential crop yields, indicating our evaluation was effective to predict crop production. The spatial pattern of land suitability for crop production demonstrated that land with higher suitability was generally located in piedmont plains and basins, while land with lower suitability was mostly situated in mountainous areas. The area of highly, moderately, marginally suitable and unsuitable land for agriculture was 32.13%, 28.58%, 37.49% and 1.80% of the production space, respectively. However, the correlation degree analysis indicated that the requirements of these four suitability grades were currently not satisfied but could be potentially fulfilled. In terms of indicator weights, soil properties were much more important than topography and location conditions to influence the grades of suitability. Among all indicators, slope, soil organic matter, soil texture and soil depth were the most influential factors, so slope farming prevention and organic fertilization were most likely to improve land suitability for agriculture. Compared the outputs of our land suitability evaluation model with the distribution of the existing croplands, we found that about 66.52% of marginally suitable and 54.55% of unsuitable land for agriculture were currently used for croplands. Therefore, de-farming policy should be implemented in areas of these two suitability grades. In contrast, cropland expansion was encouraged in the land that was highly or moderately suitable for agriculture. Our evaluation of agricultural land suitability is beneficial for future land use planning and decision-making in the Taihang Mountains.

AB  - The fixation and accumulation of critical elements in the near surface environment is an important factor in understanding elemental cycling through the crust, both for exploration of new resources and environmental management strategies. Carbonaceous black shales are commonly rich in trace elements relative to global crustal averages, many of which have potential environmental impacts depending on their speciation and mobility at surface. This trace element mobility can be investigated by studying the secondary mineralisation (regolith) associated with black shales at surface. In this study, Carboniferous shales on the west coast of Ireland are found to have higher than average shale concentrations of As, Cd, Cu, Co, Mo, Ni, Se, Te and U, similar to the laterally equivalent Bowland Shales, UK. Groundwater penetration and oxidative weathering of these pyritic black shales produces oxide deposits, dominated by goethite and jarosite, which are significantly enriched in As (44- 468 ppm), Se (12-184 ppm), U (6-158 ppm) and other trace elements, compared to concentrations in the parent shales. Major elemental abundances vary in composition from 3.5 to 29.4% sulphate, 0.6-9.1% phosphate and 36.6-47.2% iron-oxide. Phosphate substitution within jarosite is observed in these samples, formed under ambient pressure and temperature conditions.
   The major and trace elements forming these secondary deposits are predominantly sourced from the underlying black shales through mobilisation by groundwater. This discovery is critical for the environmental assessment of black shale lithologies during shale gas exploration and production, where the demonstrated mobility of in situ elemental enrichments may indicate a significant source of produced- and groundwater contamination during and after hydraulic fracturing processes. The proportions of the major oxide phases exhibit a clear control on the trace elemental enrichments within the secondary deposits, where increasing Se and As concentrations correlate with increasing phosphate content of the jarosite mineralisation. This has implications for the remediation of acid mine drainage seeps, where phosphate-rich jarosite phases could be utilised for more efficient trace element removal.

AB  - Persistent drought conditions in the Central valley of California demands efficient irrigation scheduling tools such as precision or variable rate irrigation (VRI). To assist VRI scheduling, an experiment was conducted in almond and walnut orchards using a sensor system called leaf monitor', which was developed at UC Davis to detect plant water status. A Modified Crop Water Stress Index (MCWSI) was calculated to quantify plant water status using leaf temperature and environmental data collected by the leaf monitor. This technique also took into account spatio-temporal variability of plant water status. Stem water potential (SWP), which is considered a standard method for determining plant water stress (PWS), was also measured simultaneously. Relationships between measured deficit stem water potential (DSWP), which is the difference between SWP and the saturated baseline, and MCWSI were developed for both crops based on data collected during the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons. A linear relationship was found in the case of walnut crop with a coefficient of determination (r(2)) value of 0.67. A quadratic relationship was found in the case of almonds with a coefficient of multiple determination (R-2) value of 0.75. Moreover, these results highlighted that at lower PWS of below 0.5MPa of DSWP, almonds crops did not show any decrease in transpiration rate. However, when the stress level exceeded 0.5MPa of DSWP, transpiration rate tended to decrease. On the other hand, walnut crop showed decrease in transpiration rate even at low PWS of below 0.5MPa of DSWP. Temporal variability was noticed in PWS as it was found that coefficients of saturation baseline used for MCWSI method changed significantly throughout the season. MCWSI values estimated before an irrigation event was used to calculate the irrigation amount for low frequency variable rate irrigation (VRI) based on the relationship found between MCWSI and DSWP, and VRI led to an average 39% reduction in water usage as compared to the fixed 100% ET replacement irrigation method for all trees. Based on the results, leaf monitor showed potential for use as an irrigation scheduling tool.

AB  - Continuing the search for new potential analgesics among the derivatives of 4-methyl-2,2-dioxo-1H-2 lambda(6),1-benzothiazine-3-carboxylic acid, the possibility of obtaining its esters by the alkylation of the corresponding sodium salt with iodoethane in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at room temperature was studied. It was found that under such conditions, together with the oxygen atom of the carboxyl group, a heteroatom of nitrogen is also alkylated. Therefore, the product of the reaction studied is a mixture of ethyl 4-methyl-2,2-dioxo-1H-2 lambda(6),1-benzothiazine-3-carboxylate (major) and its 1-ethyl-substituted analog (minor). A simple but very effective method of preparative separation of these compounds was proposed. Moreover, the heterogeneous crystallization from ethanol was revealed to result in a monoclinic polymorphic form of ethyl 4-methyl-2,2-dioxo-1H-2 lambda(6),1-benzothiazine-3-carboxylate, while the homogeneous crystallization results in its orthorhombic form. The molecular and crystal structures of both forms were confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis, and the phase purity by powder diffraction study. The pharmacological tests carried out on the model of a carrageenan edema showed that the screening dose of 20 mg/kg of 1-ethyl-substituted ester and the orthorhombic form of its analog unsubstituted in position 1 exhibited weak anti-inflammatory and moderate analgesic effects. At the same time, the monoclinic form of ethyl 4-methyl-2,2-dioxo-1H-2 lambda(6),1-benzothiazine-3-carboxylate appeared to be both a powerful analgesic and an anti-inflammatory agent that exceeded Piroxicam and Meloxicam in the same doses by these indicators. A detailed comparative analysis of the molecular and crystal structures of two polymorphic forms of ethyl 4-methyl-2,2-dioxo-1H-2 lambda(6),1-benzothiazine-3-carboxylate was carried out using quantum chemical calculations of the energies of pairwise interactions between molecules. An explanation of the essential differences of their biological properties based on this was offered.

AB  - Studies quantifying the impact of climate change have so far mostly examined atmospheric variables, and few are evaluating the cascade of aquatic impacts that will occur along the land-ocean continuum until the ultimate impacts on coastal eutrophication potential. In this study, a new hydro-biogeochemical modeling chain has been developed, based on the coupling of the generic pyNuts-Riverstrahler biogeochemical model and the GR4J-CEMANEIGE hydrological model, and applied to the Seine River basin (France). Averaged responses of biogeochemical variables to climate-induced hydrological changes were assessed using climate forcing based on 12 projections of precipitation and temperature (BC-CORDER) for the stabilization (RCP 4.5) and the increasing (RCP 8.5) CO2 emission scenarios. Beyond the amount of nutrients delivered to the sea, we calculated the indicator of coastal eutrophication potential (ICEP). The models run with the RCP4.5 stabilization scenario show low variations in hydrological regimes and water quality, while five of the six models run with the increasing CO2 emissions scenario (RCP8.5) leads to more intense extreme streamflow (i.e., higher maximum flows, lower and longer minimum flows), resulting in the degradation of water quality. For the driest RCP 8.5 projection, median biogeochemical impacts induced by decreasing discharge (until -270 m(3) s(-1) in average) are mostly located downstream of major wastewater treatment plants. During spring bloom, e.g., in May, the associated higher residence time leads to an increase of phytoplankton biomass (+31% in average), with a simultaneous -23% decrease of silicic acid, followed downstream by a -9% decrease of oxygen. Later during low flow, major increases in nitrate and phosphate concentrations (until +19% and +32% in average) are expected. For all considered scenarios, high ICEP values (above zero) lasted, indicating that coastal eutrophication is not expected to decrease with changing hydrological conditions in the future. Maximum values are even expected to be higher some years. This study deliberately evaluates the impact of modified hydrology on biogeochemistry without considering the simultaneous alteration of water temperatures, in order to disentangle the causes of climate change-induced impact. It will serve as a first comparative step toward a more complete modeling experiment of climate change impacts on aquatic systems.

AB  - Irrigation water has been highlighted as a source of microbial contamination in produce. Water treatment has been recommended as an intervention strategy to reduce microbial risks associated to irrigation water. Commercial water treatments mostly depend on chemical agents; although growers search for greener alternatives to chemical biocides. Ultrasounds (US) have been proposed as an environmentally friendly technology for irrigation water. In the present study, the suitability of two US treatments (20 kHz: US20 and 40 kHz: US40 at a specific energy (Es) of 745 J/L) and one chlorine treatment (1-2 ppm free chlorine) was evaluated and compared to the untreated control. Five water reservoirs belonging to five commercial intensive farms were selected as representative of irrigation practices generally used in south of Europe. All tested water treatments were able to reduce microbial loads, including Escherichia coli (0.5-0.6 log units), to values that were accepted in most of the recommended guidelines of good agricultural practices (<= 2 log units). The obtained reductions were lower than those previously reported for these water treatment technologies in lab-scale tests. High microbial reductions are commonly obtained in laboratory studies, yielding impressive results. However, when the same treatments are applied under real commercial conditions, microbial reductions are usually less impressive. All water treatments were able to reduce COD of irrigation water when compared to the untreated control. COD reductions obtained using chlorine (>= 430 mg/L) and US 20 (similar to 100 mg/L) were higher than those observed using US 40 (<50 mg/L). The impact of the water quality on the efficacy of US treatments was evaluated in two types of water including surface water and treated wastewater. It was found that the quality of the irrigation water significantly influences the efficacy of the ultrasound treatment. Correlations between indicator parameters have been also evaluated. Obtained results showed that high algae counts were well correlated with high levels of coliforms and E. coli. It could be concluded that US can be proposed as an alternative water treatment to chemical treatments to preserve microbial quality of irrigation water stored in water reservoirs reducing the environmental impact.

AB  - The variability of water chemistry on a daily scale is rarely addressed due to the lack of records. Appropriate tools, such as typologies and dimensionless indicators, which permit comparisons between stations and between river materials, are missing. Such tools are developed here for daily concentrations (C), specific fluxes or yields (Y) and specific river flow (q). The data set includes 128 long-term daily records, for suspended particulate matter (SPM), total dissolved solids (TDS), dissolved and total nutrients, totalling 1236 years of records. These 86 river basins (103106 km2) cover a wide range of environmental conditions in semi-arid and temperate regions. The segmentationtruncation of Cq rating curves into two parts at median flows (q50) generates two exponents (b50inf and b50sup) that are different for 66% of the analysed rating curves. After segmentation, the analysis of records results in the definition of nine major Cq types combining concentrating, diluting or stable patterns, showing inflexions, chevron and U shapes. SPM and TDS are preferentially distributed among a few types, while dissolved and total nutrients are more widely distributed. Four dimensionless indicators of daily variability combine median (C50, Y50), extreme (C99, Y99) and flow-weighted (C*, Y*) concentrations and yields (e.g. C99/C50, Y*/Y50). They vary over two to four orders of magnitude in the analysed records, discriminating stations and river material. A second set of four indicators of relative variability [e.g. (Y*/Y50)/(q*/q50)], takes into account the daily flow variability, as expressed by q*/q50 and q99/q50, which also vary over multiple orders of magnitude. The truncated exponent b50sup is used to describe fluxes at higher flows accounting for 75% (TDS) to 97% (SPM) of interannual fluxes. It ranges from - 0.61 to + 1.86 in the database. It can be regarded as the key amplificator (positive b50sup) or reductor (negative b50sup) of concentrations or yields variability. C50, Y50, b50sup can also be estimated in discrete surveys, which provides a new perspective for quantifying and mapping water quality variability at daily scale.

AB  - This paper describes the results of a study of the correlation between the performances of wheels for lunar vehicles predicted using the Nepean wheeled vehicle performance model (NWVPM), developed under the auspices of Vehicle Systems Development Corporation, Ottawa, Canada, and the corresponding test data presented in 'Performance evaluation of wheels for lunar vehicles', Technical Report M-70-2, prepared for George C. Marshall Space Flight Center, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), USA, by the US Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station (WES). The NWVPM was originally developed for design and performance evaluation of terrestrial off-road wheeled vehicles. The purpose of this study is to assess the potential of the NWVPM for evaluating wheel candidates for the new generation of extra-terrestrial vehicles. Two versions of a wire-mesh wheel and a hoop-spring wheel, which were considered as candidates for lunar roving vehicles for the NASA Apollo program in the late 1960s, together with a pneumatic wheel were examined in this study. The tractive performances of these wheels and of a 4 x 4 test vehicle with the pneumatic wheels on air-dry sand were predicted using the NWVPM and compared with the corresponding test data obtained under Earth's gravity and previously documented in the above-named report. While test data on wheel or vehicle performances obtained under Earth's gravity may not necessarily be representative of those on extra-terrestrial bodies, because of the differences in gravity and in environmental conditions, such as atmospheric pressure, it is still a valid approach to use test data obtained under Earth's gravity to evaluate the predictive capability of the NWVPM and its potential applications to predicting wheel or wheeled rover performances on extra-terrestrial bodies. Results of this study show that, using the ratio (P(20)/W) of the drawbar pull to normal load at 20 per cent slip as a performance indicator, there is a reasonable correlation between the predictions and experimental data. This indicates that the NWVPM has the potential as an engineering tool for evaluating wheel candidates for a future generation of extra-terrestrial vehicles, provided that appropriate input data are available.

AB  - Fifty buried manganese nodules at different depth intervals were recovered in 12 sediment cores from the Central Indian Ocean Basin (CIOB). A maximum of 15 buried nodules were encountered in one sediment core (AAS-22/GC-07) and the deepest nodule was recovered at 5.50 m below seafloor in core AAS-04/GC-5A. Approximately 80% of the buried nodules are small in size (similar to 2 cm diameter) in contrast to the Atlantic Ocean and Peru Basin (Pacific Ocean) where the majority of the buried nodules are large, similar to 8 cm. and > 6 cm, respectively. Buried nodule size decreases with core depth and this distribution appears to be similar to the phenomenon of "Brazil Nut Effect". Buried nodules exhibit both smooth and rough surface textures and are ellipsoidal, elongated, rounded, sub rounded, irregular and polynucleated. Buried nodules from siliceous ooze are enriched in Mn, Cu, Ni, Zn, Mo, Ga, V and Rb whereas those from red clay are enriched in Fe, Co, Ti, U, Th, Y, Cr, Nb and Rare Earth Elements (REE). Buried nodules from siliceous ooze suggest their formation under hydrogenetic, early digenetic and diagenetic processes whereas those from red clay are of hydrogenetic origin.
   REE are enriched more than 1.5 times in buried nodules from red clay compared to siliceous ooze. However, the mode of incorporation of REE into buried nodules from both sedimentary environments is by a single authigenic phase consisting of Fe-Ti-P. Shale-normalized REE patterns and Ce anomalies suggest that nodules from siliceous ooze formed under more oxidizing conditions than those from red clay. Nodules buried at depths between 1. 5 and 2.5 in are diagenetic (Mn/Fe ratio 10- 15), formed in highly oxic environments (large positive Cc anomalies) and record aeolian dust (high Eu anomalies). Chemical composition, surface texture and morphology of buried nodules are similar to those of surface nodules from the same basin. Furthermore, buried nodule compositions do not exhibit any distinct patterns within the core depth, suggesting that buried nodules neither grow nor dissolve after their burial in the sediment column.

AB  - Cognitive challenges presented in connexion with the foraging behaviour of animals may have the potential to enrich the housing environment of captive animals, and thus can have beneficial effects on their behaviour and welfare. Therefore, we have developed a food-rewarded learning system based on a combination of classical and operant conditioning for groups of domestic pigs using acoustic cues ('call-feeding station'). The present study investigated the characteristics of learning behaviour in seven experimental groups (n= 8 individuals each) of growing pigs in postnatal weeks 7-20. The behavioural budget of each group was observed weekly within the housing environment and compared to seven conventionally fed control groups (n = 8) which were supplied with an equal food amount. The alterations of individual behavioural responses after 6 and 12 weeks of cognitive enrichment were analysed in combined open-field/novel-object tests and compared to controls. All experimental pigs were able to discriminate reliably an individual tone that was associated with a locally changing feeding site. Generally, the animals were also willing to work for food (push a button with increasing fixed ratio, FR) but this motivation varied considerably between the groups ranging from FR 1 to 10. Sustained cognitive enrichment also affected other behavioural patterns within the housing environment as indicated by an increased locomotor behaviour and less belly nosing. Behavioural test responses were altered towards a greater reduction in open-field activity as well as a reduced excitement and fear behaviour compared to control pigs. Behavioural differences seem to be more pronounced the longer pigs were faced with the cognitive challenge. However, with equal food intake, the weight gain of the experimental pigs was not different compared to the controls. The present study suggests that, in domestic pigs, the presented cognitive enrichment may induce repeated positive appraisals in pigs by the association of successful coping with a demanding behavioural task rewarded by several small portions of food during the day. This appears to agree very well with pigs' motivational needs and may also be applicable for animal welfare enhancing management of feeding. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives. Cardiovascular fitness represents the ability of active skeletal muscle to utilize oxygen during aerobic exercise. Elevated homocysteine, causing tissue injury by such mechanisms as oxidative stress, endothelial damage, and protein homocysteinylation, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia and osteoporotic fracture. However, the association between elevated homocysteine and cardiovascular fitness has not been reported.
   Design. Population-based cross-sectional study.
   Setting. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999 to 2002 in the USA.
   Subjects. A total of 1444 noninstitutionalized adults aged 20-49 years with reliable measures of cardiovascular fitness and nonmissing values in homocysteine.
   Main outcome measures. Cardiovascular fitness, estimated maximal oxygen uptake or VO(2)max (mL kg(-1) min(-1)), was obtained by a submaximal exercise test. Levels of homocysteine were measured by the Abbott homocysteine assay, a fully automated fluorescence polarization immunoassay method and were natural-log-transformed due to right skewness.
   Results. After adjustment for age, race and body mass index, there was a 0.70 mL kg(-1) min(-1) decrease (P = 0.033) in the estimated VO(2)max for each standard deviation (SD) increase in the natural-log-transformed homocysteine level for women. Additional adjustment of hypertension, diabetes, smoking status, alcohol intake, use of lipid-lowering agents, physical activity, self-report health condition, as well as levels of folate, vitamin B-12, creatinine, C-reactive protein, total cholesterol and haemoglobin seemed to influence the association. In the fully adjusted model, we observed a 1.18 mL kg(-1) min(-1) decrease (P = 0.003) in the estimated VO(2)max for each SD increase in the natural-log-transformed homocysteine level in women. There was no association between cardiovascular fitness and homocysteine levels in men.
   Conclusion. High homocysteine levels were inversely associated with cardiovascular fitness in women, but not in men. The results suggest that homocysteine levels are important indicators of exercise tolerance amongst women and may be useful in targeting female individuals requiring endurance intervention to prevent loss of cardiovascular fitness and function.

LA  - English
AB  - Cables insulated with eleven different PVC compounds representing fire-retardant, non-fire retardant, 60 degreesC, 75 degreesC, and 90 degreesC temperature ratings were evaluated. The specimens were subjected to accelerated thermal, radiation, and sequential radiation and thermal exposure simulating 15, 20, 30, and 40 yr in-service environments in Ontario Power Generation Nuclear Plants. The radiation level was limited to 12 to 30 Mrad. Two sets of samples were evaluated. The first contained 15 cm insulation specimens in tubular form with the conductors removed. The material performance of the insulations was assessed using the 15 cm specimens during the various stages of aging exposures by conventional elongation measurement. The second set was made from 4.3 m single or twisted pair of cable samples (unjacketed) wound on mandrels. The cable samples were sequentially irradiated and thermally aged and subjected to an additional 5 Mrad accident radiation exposure, followed by a simulated loss of coolant accident (LOCA). Similarly, thermal only aged specimens with 2 Mrad of background radiation representing powerhouse environment were subjected to a main steam line break (MSLB) steam test. During the steam tests, samples were energized and their insulation resistance (IR) values were continuously monitored using an on-line setup and periodically with a megohm meter at 500 V-dc. The results from the insulation samples were compared with the electrical performance of the cable samples wound on mandrels that had been subjected to the LOCA/MSLB steam test. The test results indicate that elongation values were not a good indicator of electrical performance of PVC insulated cables subjected to radiation and thermal environment. With remaining elongation values ranging from 50 to 150% absolute, four out of eleven compounds performed poorly electrically during the steam test. All thermal only aged specimens functioned satisfactorily. In addition, two additional compounds rated for 60 degreesC applications were investigated and functioned unsatisfactorily despite high elongation values. It was found that specific additives were responsible for poor electrical behavior. During radiation exposure ionic salts were formed as a result of break down of Pvc and of some plasticizers. Upon thermal aging or later in the steam test, these ionic compounds migrated to the conductor surface. Then, under high temperature and pressure steam conditions, the salts were dissolved and created an electrical leakage path. Similarly, in thermal only aged specimens, breakdown products of specific plasticizers caused poor electrical behavior.

AB  - In worldwide orogenic belts, crustal-scale ductile shear zones are important tectonic channels along which the orogenic root (i.e., high-grade metamorphic lower-crustal rocks) commonly experienced a relatively quick exhumation or uplift process. However, their tectonic nature and geodynamic processes are poorly constrained. In the Trans-North China orogen, the crustal-scale Zhujiafang ductile shear zone represents a major tectonic boundary separating the upper and lower crusts of the orogen. Its tectonic nature, structural features, and timing provide vital information into understanding this issue. Detailed field observations showed that the Zhujiafang ductile shear zone experienced polyphase deformation. Variable macro- and microscopic kinematic indicators are extensively preserved in the highly sheared tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) and supracrustal rock assemblages and indicate an obvious dextral strike-slip and dip-slip sense of shear. Electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) was utilized to further determine the crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) of typical rock-forming minerals, including hornblende, quartz, and feldspar. EBSD results indicate that the hornblendes are characterized by (100) <001> and (110) <001> slip systems, whereas quartz grains are dominated by prism <a> prism <c> slip systems, suggesting an approximate shear condition of 650-700 degrees C. This result is consistent with traditional thermobarometry pressure-temperature calculations implemented on the same mineral assemblages. Combined with previously reported metamorphic data in the Trans-North China orogen, we suggest that the Zhujiafang supracrustal rocks were initially buried down to similar to 30 km depth, where high differential stress triggered the large-scale ductile shear between the upper and lower crusts. The high-grade lower-crustal rocks were consequently exhumed upwards along the shear zone, synchronous with extensive isothermal decompression metamorphism. The timing of peak collision-related crustal thickening was further constrained by the ca. 1930 Ma metamorphic zircon ages, whereas a subsequent exhumation event was manifested by ca. 1860 Ma syntectonic granitic veins and the available Ar-Ar ages of the region. The Zhujiafang ductile shear zone thus essentially record an integrated geodynamic process of initial collision, crustal thickening, and exhumation involved in formation of the Trans-North China orogen at 1.9-1.8 Ga.

AB  - The evaluation of mercury (Hg) toxicity in wildlife species has prompted a search for sensitive indicators to accurately measure the body burden of Hg. Despite the extensive use of feathers as an indicator of Hg in birds, they do not appear to be an entirely suitable indicator of the extent of contamination in certain conditions and bird species since Hg levels are influenced by the growth period, timing of the last moult and migration. This research aimed to evaluate rhamphotheca as a potential indicator of environmental Hg concentrations in seabirds. We used culled yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis) (n = 20) and determined THg in rhamphotheca and feathers. We distinguished between upper and lower rhamphotheca, and divided each one into 16 equal portions along the culmen to analyse their THg content spatially. In each bird, THg was also determined in primary (P1) and secondary (S8) feathers and compared with rhamphotheca. The median (25th, 75th percentile) rhamphotheca Hg concentration was 13.44 (9.63, 17.46) mu g/g, which was twofold higher than in the feathers 7.56 (4.88, 12.89) mu g/g. Median THg in rhamphotheca was significantly higher (p 0.05) in females 15.05 (10.35, 23.04) mu g/g than in males 12.34 (8.57, 15.19) mu g/g, whereas no differences (p 0.05) were found in the feathers. No significant differences in Hg levels were found between upper and lower beak mandibles or along either. In contrast, significant differences in Hg concentrations were found between the P1 and S8 feathers (mean, 12.04 vs. 6.04 mu g/g). No correlation was found between Hg content in rhamphotheca and feathers. Mercury levels in rhamphotheca exhibited stronger significant relationships with weight (R-2 = 0.568), length (R-2 = 0.524) and culmen (R-2 = 0.347) than the levels in the feathers, which showed no correlation. Overall, our results suggest that rhamphotheca is a suitable tissue indicator for Hg monitoring in gulls; however, further studies are needed to extend our research to other bird species.

AB  - Ecosystem services (ESs), as important indicators for ecosystem conditions, are always interacted complexly, however, the underlying mechanisms remain not fully understood. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region is a typical example of this complexity and is one of the most populous regions globally. In this study, we take the BTH region as the study area and try to identify the spatiotemporally complex relationships and dominant drivers of ESs, by utilizing multiple methods: Pearson correlation analysis, partial correlation analysis and the Geo-Detector method. Three critically important ESs: soil erosion, water yield, and net primary production (NPP) are simulated for the period of 2000 to 2018. The results show that the Pearson correlation coefficient indicated a synergistic relationship between soil erosion and water yield and between water yield and NPP and a trade-off relationship between soil erosion and NPP, while the partial correlation analysis using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and precipitation as controlling factors showed that the relationships between soil erosion and water yield and between water yield and NPP were transformed to trade-offs. We confirmed that the drivers (especially the shared drivers and dominant drivers of each ecosystem service) played important roles in the direction of complex relationships; when different factors were involved in the relationships, the direction of positive or negative relationships may be diverse. Furthermore, the slope (q = 0.32), precipitation (q = 0.42) and NDVI (q = 0.72) were the dominant factors for soil erosion, water yield and NPP, respectively. The power of determinants for ESs showed high spatial heterogeneity in different geomorphological types due to differences in each type of inner characteristic; for example, the q value of slope for soil erosion decreased with increasing mountain relief, but the q value of NDVI increased. In addition, the trade-off degree among the three ESs was spatially heterogeneous; in mountainous areas the trade-off scores were much higher than those in relatively flat areas. Our general approaches and results provide useful referents for researchers and policy makers to understand the mechanisms governing complex relationships among ESs and to manage ESs by manipulating these drivers to enhance synergies or weaken trade-offs.

AB  - The paleoenvironmental evolution of Lake Ismarida in Thrace (Northern Greece) is revealed by the combined lithological, micropaleontological (benthic foraminifera, pollen and NPPS), molluscan analyses, magnetic susceptibility measurement and radiocarbon dating of a 5.8-m long sediment core. The mid Holocene evolution of the lake area is evidenced by the documentation of four sedimentary Units in the core ISMR-2, corresponding to four distinct evolutionary stages: (1) during similar to 5500-3500 cal yr BP the lake area was a shallow marine environment characterized by an Ammonia beccarii, small rotaliids, miliolids, Bittium reticulatum and Veneridae spp. assemblage, marine dinoflagellate cysts, and low magnetic susceptibility values; (2) during similar to 3500-3000 cal BP the environment is gradually tending to more isolated conditions forming an open lagoon, characterized by marine and euryhaline fauna and low magnetic susceptibility values; (3) during 3000 cal yr BP, the open lagoon presented a transition to an oligohaline inner lagoon, characterized by an Ammonia tepida, Haynesina germanica, Aubignyna perlucida, Pirenella conica, Cerastoderma glaucum and Abra spp. assemblage, sedges and aquatic vegetation. This restricted, entirely isolated from the sea inner lagoon could be definitely used as the landmark of the Lake Ismaris from Heorodotus, while describing the march of Xerxes through Thrace in 480 B.C.; (4) since similar to 2000 cal yr BP to the present, the Lake Ismarida is formed, characterized by fresh-water indicators and aquatic pollen, Pseudoschizaea and high magnetic susceptibility values. Finally, the progradation of the Filiouris River deltaic deposits resulted to a 4 km wide deltaic plain between Lake Ismarida and the nowadays coastline. Pollen assemblages record the dominance of a rather rich deciduous forest in the area with traces of human presence in the lower part of the sequence, whereas the opening of the plant landscape under the increasing human pressure is evidenced after similar to 3000 cal yr BP. Finally, an open vegetation pattern, contemporaneous with the retreat of forest vegetation, is evidenced in the area already before 2000 cal yr BP.

AB  - Fossil morphological data are time-averaged and generally reflect an overlap of different sources of carapace variability. To examine whether a proposed relationship between size and population density in fossil spinicaudatans is biologically meaningful, we set up rearing experiments involving two extant species: Eulimnadia texana and Eocyzicus argillaquus. Three and five days after hydration, clam shrimp were transferred into cups of various population densities that ranged between 1 and 15 inds/400 ml. Size and shape were measured 14 and 16 days after hydration, respectively. Every second day, we recorded length and sex of E. texana, which matured faster in lower-density cups. According to our growth model, population density and maximal carapace length follow a logarithmic relationship. At maturity, hermaphrodites yielded similar lengths across all population densities (similar to 4.7 mm at 24 degrees C), independent of age. Hence, clam shrimp can put off reproductive maturity as a response to decreased growth under higher density conditions. Growth rate generally decreases at maturity, but that effect is more pronounced in clam shrimp of high population densities, while low-density adults keep growing. For both species, multivariate analyses reveal that carapace size of low-density individuals is significantly larger than carapace size of higher-density individuals, while size values of intermediate densities cannot be distinguished. Shape distinction is strong in hermaphrodites of E. texana: 39.8% of the density-dependent shape variation is associated with relative umbo height, which is generally higher in individuals of smaller population densities. The H/L ratio, which is often used as a simple shape indicator, does not contribute to the main variation in shape, but it forms one of several ratios significant for 18.3% of the shape variability. In turn, the H/L ratio drives 30% of the shape variation in E. argillaquus. In addition, higher densities triggered shifts in ontogenetic growth trajectories in one third of the individuals, which led to aberrant morphologies. The present rearing experiment shows that some of the morphological variability on fossil bedding planes can be explained by population density. Also, it implies a considerable amount of ecophenotypic variability in Spinicaudata that affects our understanding of fossil taxonomy and palaeoecology.

AB  - In this study, we introduce a simple screening method to predict the metal release from biostabilized wastes as a function of the total organic carbon (TOC) content of the sample. The method relies on a model that simulates the release of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) as a function of the applied liquid to solid (L/S) ratio. The metal release is then estimated using generic empirical DOC to metal correlation coefficients (K-DOC,K-Me) extrapolated from the literature. Specifically, the results of leaching tests carried out on different types of biowastes and biostabilized wastes were used to calculate the upper and lower K(DOC,Me)values that can be expected for common metals of concern (Al, Ba, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn). The statistical analysis of the estimated empirical coefficients highlighted that for most of the investigated metals, the adoption of generic DOC to metal correlation coefficients introduces relatively low uncertainties. The quartiles ratio (QR calculated as the ratio of third and first quartile) of the K(DOC,Me)coefficients extrapolated from the literature was indeed below 3 for Cu, Ni, and Zn and below 5 for Al, Ba, Cr, Pb, and V. Only for Mo, the QR was around 10 indicating that for this element, DOC can be a poor indicator of the release expected as a function of the applied L/S. Furthermore, by performing a sensitivity analysis, we found that the experimental conditions only slightly influence the metals release predicted by the model. Based on this evidence, simple nomograms that estimate the cumulative metal release in percolation column tests as a function of the applied L/S are provided. Furthermore, a simple equation that predicts the cumulative metal release expected at L/S of 10 L/kg is presented. The application of the latter to the results of percolation column tests carried out on 8 mechanical biological treatment (MBT) waste samples highlighted that the predicted metals release was close to the measured values with deviations within a factor of 5 for all the investigated metals.

AB  - In this work a comprehensive analysis of the environmental impact of the operation of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) using different control strategies is carried out considering the dynamic evolution of some environmental indicators and average operation costs. The selected strategies are PI (proportional integral) control schemes such as dissolved oxygen control in the aerobic zone (DO control), DO control and nitrates control in the anoxic zone (DO + NO control) and regulation of ammonium control at the end of aerobic zone (Cascade S-NHSP) commonly used in WWTPs to maintain the conditions that ensure the desired effluent quality in a variable influent scenario. The main novelty of the work is the integration of potential insights into environmental impact from the analysis of dynamic evolution of environmental indicators at different time scales. The consideration of annual, bimonthly and weekly temporal windows to evaluate performance indicators makes it possible to capture seasonal effects of influent disturbances and control actions on environmental costs of wastewater treatment that are unnoticed in the annual-based performance evaluation. Then, in the case of periodic events, it is possible to find solutions to improve operation by the adjustment of the control variables in specific periods of time along the operation horizon. The analysis of the annual average and dynamic profiles (weekly and bimonthly) of environmental indicators showed that ammonium-based control (Cascade S-NHSP) produce the best compromise solution between environmental and operation costs compared with DO control and DO + NO control. An alternative control strategy, named S-NHSP (var) Q(carb var), has been defined considering a sequence of changes on ammonium set-point (S-NHSP) and carbon dosage (Q(carb)) on different temporal windows. It is compared with DO control considering weekly and bimonthly profiles and annual average values leading to the conclusion that both strategies, Cascade S-NHSP and S-NHSP (var) Q(carb var), produce an improvement of dynamic and annual average environmental performance and operation costs, but benefits of Cascade S-NHSP strategy are associated with reduction of electricity consumption and emissions to water, while S-NHSP (var) Q(carb var) strategy reduces electricity consumption, use of chemicals (reducing external carbon dosage) and operation costs.

AB  - Increasing environmental complexity, e.g., by providing environmental enrichment, has been suggested as a way to increase activity levels and improve leg health in broilers. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different types of environmental complexity on leg health and measures of welfare of fast-growing broilers housed according to conventional European legislation. A total of 58 pens with approximately 500 broilers each (Ross 308), corresponding to a stocking density of 40 kg/m(2), were used. A total of 8 treatment groups, of which 5 were enrichment treatments (roughage, vertical panels, straw bales, and elevated platforms at 5 and 30 cm) and 3 were standard resources manipulations [increased distances between feed and water (7 m and 3.5 m), stocking density reduced to 34 kg/m(2), and 1 control group (1.5 m distance between feed and water and no enrichment objects)] were randomly assigned to each pen. At 35 D of age, 60 birds from each pen were assessed for gait, footpad dermatitis, hock burns, plumage cleanliness, presence of scratches, and leg deformities. Birds housed with 30 cm elevated platforms had worse gait compared to those housed with straw bales and at the lower stocking density of 34 kg/m(2) (P = 0.004 and P = 0.001). Broilers from the control group also had worse gait compared to those housed at 34 kg/m(2) stocking density. In addition, birds housed with access to a 30 cm elevated platform had healthier footpads compared to birds housed with access to straw bales (P = 0.0001) and with increased distance between feed and water (P = 0.011). Furthermore, birds housed with straw bales had worse footpad condition compared to birds with access to a 5 cm elevated platform (P = 0.002). There were no observed treatment effects on scratches, plumage cleanliness, leg deformities and body weight (P > 0.05). Based on the welfare indicators used in the present study, decreased stocking density has the potential of improving animal welfare, whereas the effects of elevated platforms need to be further studied before a final conclusion can be drawn, as footpad health was positively affected, but walking ability was impaired.

AB  - This paper deals with the mineralogy and geochemistry of alluvial sediments from the Tongo Gandima (Eastern Cameroon) using XRD, XRF, and ICP-MS instruments. The main aim of this work is to discuss the provenance of sediments and carry out a geochemical exploration in the areas where gold mining is taking place. Granites and monzonites outcrop as large masses of several decameters with granular texture. Petrographic description and SiO2, Al2O3, and TiO2 contents reveal the intermediate igneous rock nature of monzonites and the felsic igneous rock nature of granites. Both rocks fall into the field of peraluminous and S-type granites. The high proportion of feldspars and biotite led to high Al2O3, Fe2O3, CaO, Ba, Sr, Th, Zn, Zr, and REE (rare earth element) contents particularly in monzonites. The presence of accessory minerals results in high trace element contents including REEs. The alluvial sediments are composed of quartz, kaolinite, rutile, smectite, zircon, magnetite, and gibbsite. They are mainly classified as shale, wacke, Fe-shale, and Fe-sand. The chemical index of alteration (CIA) reveals moderate to intense weathering of the source rock highlighted by the depletion of alkaline (Na+, K+, and Ca2+) and the enrichment of Al2O3. The high Th/Sc ratio which is an indicator of chemical differentiation suggests a high degree of sediment recycling. The variable chemical differentiation corroborates with the variable contents in Zr, Hf, TiO2, P2O5, and REEs. The chondrite-normalized REEs show high REE contents and negative Eu-anomalies. The negative Eu-anomalies in sediments indicate reduction conditions or the depletion of europium bearing minerals. The few amounts of Cr, V, Ni, and Sc as well as the abundance of Th and REEs justify the felsic nature of rocks. There is a similarity between REE behavior of host rocks (granites and monzonites) and sediments. These rocks may contribute a lot as the sediment sources. The felsic source is confirmed by light REE-abundance and negative Eu-anomalies. In addition, both lithotypes show high REE contents while alluvial sediments possess attractive contents in Ba, Sr, Au, and REEs. These data suggest that the potential of the surface sediments of Tongo Gandima as gold deposits is low.

AB  - Water scarcity can have severe socio-economic and ecological consequences but can be alleviated by adapting water management plans and by increasing preparedness. Such adaptation measures require reliable estimates of potential water scarcity, which are derived at a certain temporal and spatial scale. The choice of scale might affect the outcome of water shortage assessments and conclusions drawn from them. It has been stressed that water scarcity assessments should be performed at a monthly instead of an annual scale, but it has not yet been investigated whether water scarcity assessments could profit from further increasing the temporal resolution. Furthermore, it has been shown that national scale assessments might hide regions potentially affected by water scarcity, and it remains unclear what scale nationwide assessments should focus on. In this study, we therefore investigate the effect of choosing a specific catchment size as the unit of nationwide water scarcity assessments. We compute water supply and demand on a dataset from Switzerland at two spatial scales, a regional scale consisting of large hydrological catchments and a local scale consisting of medium-sized hydrological catchments, and use them to derive water scarcity estimates. Our results show that water scarcity assessments performed at a monthly compared to an annual scale significantly affect the outcomes of water scarcity assessments, while a sub-monthly resolution does not lead to very different results than monthly assessments. In addition, our results also demonstrate that water scarcity can be over- or underestimated at a regional scale compared to at a local scale, at both a monthly and an annual scale and for both normal and extreme discharge conditions. These differences between the local and regional scale estimates can be explained by the within-region variability of local catchment characteristics, i.e. differences between local and regional estimates are larger in regions with diverse local catchment characteristics. We conclude that regional-scale assessments might not be sufficient in regions with highly variable physiographical and meteorological catchment characteristics and/or differences in water demand, infrastructure, and management. Therefore, water scarcity assessments should be conducted at a scale where the variability in these factors is small.

AB  - The great scallop, Pecten maximus, presents a strong variability of growth and reproductive patterns along its spatial distribution range. Such differences in life history traits result from complex interactions between organisms and environmental conditions that can be apprehended through the study of energy dynamics. As the determination of accurate food proxy can be a limitation for modeling bioenergetic, recent work by Lavaud et al. (accepted, this issue), based on the DEB theory, provided a new approach consisting of using temperature and growth time series to reconstruct the required assimilated energy to support observed growth. In this study we present an application of this method to growth trajectories of the great scallop P. maxims used to elucidate: (1) life history traits patterns and (2) the choice of food availability proxies. The inverted DEB model was used to reconstruct the functional response (f) for different age classes of P. maximus in 10 locations of its spatial distribution range. We especially explored the patterns of reconstructed f along latitudinal and bathymetric gradients. Average reconstructed f as well as its maximum value were found to increase with latitude. The variability off, although increasing, did not show a significant relationship with the geographical position. Along the bathymetric gradient strong positive relationships were found between the mean f or its variability and depth. Ontogeny had low effect on the reconstructed f. Furthermore, as the inverted DEB model allows the reconstruction of physiological variables and energy fluxes, we explored the potential differences in reserve and maintenance fluxes dynamics from great scallops living in these contrasting environments. For one of the study sites, comparisons of f with field measurements of 11 food indicators (chlorophyll-a from the pelagic/benthic domains, phytoplankton cell counts, etc.) highlighted the complexity of the functional response and the diet of P. maximus. Pelagic or benthic phytoplankton biovolume, diatoms and dinoflagellates counts and chlorophyll-a were found to be the major contributors to the variability of f. Results suggest that although assimilation is best described by a combination of indicators, chlorophyll-a remains a good enough indicator of food availability for great scallops and bivalves in general.

AB  - The Intermittent Upwelling Hypothesis (IUH) posits that subsidies of larvae and phytoplankton to intertidal communities should vary unimodally along a gradient of upwelling from persistent upwelling to persistent downwelling with most subsidies occurring where upwelling is of intermediate strength and intermittent. Furthermore, the hypothesis states that larvae and phytoplankton are transported far offshore by strong, persistent upwelling and fail to subsidize nearshore communities, whereas weak upwelling or downwelling reduces nutrients for phytoplankton production limiting food for larvae and nearshore communities. We review studies conducted at sea and onshore and reanalyze published data to test the IUH and evaluate alternative hypotheses. To test the hypothesis, we examine five predictions that must hold if the IUH is true. (1) Larvae should inhabit the surface Ekman layer where they are transported offshore during upwelling. Larvae of many intertidal taxa occur deeper in the water column where currents flow shoreward during upwelling. (2) Larvae of nearshore species should occur farther offshore during upwelling than during relaxation or downwelling. Larvae of many nearshore species remain within several kilometers of shore during both conditions. (3) Larval settlement in intertidal communities should be lower during upwelling than relaxation or downwelling. Daily larval settlement has not observed to be higher during relaxation or downwelling events; settlement has most often been seen to vary with the fortnightly tidal cycle likely due to onshore larval transport by internal tides. (4) Larval settlement and recruitment in intertidal communities should be lower in areas of strong, persistent upwelling than where upwelling is weaker and less persistent. Recruitment of mussels and barnacles to artificial and natural substrates did not vary with the strength of upwelling, but did vary inversely with two measures of desiccation potential, and directly with indicators of surf zone hydrodynamics; larval recruitment was higher where surf zones were more dissipative with rip currents. (5) Phytoplankton subsidies to nearshore communities should be highest where upwelling is moderate and intermittent. Like larval subsidies, phytoplankton subsidies varied spatially with surf zone hydrodynamics rather than upwelling. This reconsideration of the evidence for the IUH finds the hypothesis unsupported.

AB  - Flowback fluids associated with hydraulic fracturing shale gas extraction are a potential source of contamination for shallow aquifers. In the Marcellus Shale region of northeastern Pennsylvania, certified water tests have been used to establish baseline water chemistry of private drinking water wells. This study investigates whether a single, certified multiparameter water test is sufficient for establishing baseline water chemistry from which possible future contamination by flowback waters could be reliably recognized. We analyzed the water chemistry (major and minor inorganic elements and stable isotopic composition) of multiple samples collected from lake, spring, and well water from 35 houses around Fiddle Lake, Susquehanna County, PA that were collected over approximately a two-year period. Statistical models estimated variance of results within and between households and tested for significant differences between means of our repeated measurements and prior certified water tests.
   Overall, groundwater chemistry varies more spatially due to heterogeneity of minerals within the bed-rock aquifer and due to varying inputs of road salt runoff from paved roads than it does temporally at a single location. For wells located within road salt-runoff zones, Na+ and Cl- concentrations, although elevated, are generally consistent through repeated measurements. High add neutralizing capacity (ANC) and base cation concentrations in well water sourced from mineral weathering reactions, and a uniform stable isotopic composition for well water, suggests long flowpaths for groundwater that dampen seasonal variability of most elements. Exceptions occur for two wells within road salt runoff zones that show the greatest range of concentrations for Na+ and Cl-, suggesting that these wells have a faster pathway to surficial recharge. Additionally, sampling protocols can induce variability for Fe, Mn, and Pb, making other elements identified in flowback fluids (Ba, Br, Ca, Cl, Mg, Na, Sr) more dependable indicators of contamination. Although there is general concordance between our repeated measurements and the certified test results, characterizing baseline chemistry is strengthened when results from multiple households are combined to establish regional upper baseline limits that will have a low probability of being exceeded by future samples unless conditions have changed.

AB  - Seven-day-ahead forecasting models of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii in three warm-monomictic and mesotrophic reservoirs in south-east Queensland have been developed by means of water quality data from 1999 to 2010 and the hybrid evolutionary algorithm HEA. Resulting models using all measured variables as inputs as well as models using electronically measurable variables only as inputs forecasted accurately timing of overgrowth of C raciborskii and matched well high and low magnitudes of observed bloom events with 0.45 <= r(2) > 0.61 and 0.4 <= r(2) > 0.57, respectively. The models also revealed relationships and thresholds triggering bloom events that provide valuable information on synergism between water quality conditions and population dynamics of C. raciborskii. Best performing models based on using all measured variables as inputs indicated electrical conductivity (EC) within the range of 206-280 mS m(-1) as threshold above which fast growth and high abundances of C raciborskii have been observed for the three lakes. Best models based on electronically measurable variables for the Lakes Wivenhoe and Somerset indicated a water temperature (WT) range of 25.5-32.7 degrees C within which fast growth and high abundances of C raciborskii can be expected. By contrast the model for Lake Samsonvale highlighted a turbidity (TURB) level of 4.8 NTU as indicator for mass developments of C raciborskii.
   Experiments with online measured water quality data of the Lake Wivenhoe from 2007 to 2010 resulted in predictive models with 0.61 <= r(2) > 0.65 whereby again similar levels of EC and WT have been discovered as thresholds for outgrowth of C raciborskii. The highest validity of r(2) = 0.75 for an in situ data-based model has been achieved after considering time lags for EC by 7 days and dissolved oxygen by 1 day. These time lags have been discovered by a systematic screening of all possible combinations of time lags between 0 and 10 days for all electronically measurable variables. The so-developed model performs seven-day-ahead forecasts and is currently implemented and tested for early warning of C raciborskii blooms in the Wivenhoe reservoir. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Soil respiration is the main form of carbon flux from soil to atmosphere in the global carbon cycle. The effect of temperature on soil respiration rate is important in evaluating the potential feedback of soil organic carbon to global warming. We incubated soils from the alpine meadow zone and upper rocky zone along an altitudinal gradient (4400-5500 m a.s.l.) on the Tibetan Plateau under various temperature and soil moisture conditions. We evaluated the potential effects of temperature and soil moisture on soil respiration and its variation across altitudes. Soil respiration rates increased as the temperature increased. At 60% of soil water content, they averaged 0.21-5.33 mu mol g soil(-1) day(-1) in the alpine meadow zone and 0.11-0.50 mu mol g soil(-1) day(-1) in the rocky zone over the experimental temperature range. Soil respiration rates in the rocky zone did not increase between 25 and 35 degrees C, probably because of heat stress. Rates of decomposition of organic matter were high in the rocky zone, where the CN ratio was smaller than in the middle altitudes. Soil respiration rates also increased with increasing soil water content from 10% to 80% at 15 degrees C, averaging 0.04-2.00 mu mol g soil(-1) day(-1) in the alpine meadow zone and 0.03-0.35 mu mol g soil(-1) day(-1) in the rocky zone. Maximum respiration rates were obtained in the middle part of the alpine slope in any case of experimental temperature and soil moisture. The change patterns in soil respiration rate along altitude showed similar change pattern in soil carbon content. Although the altitude is a variable including various environmental factors, it might be used as a surrogate parameter of soil carbon content in alpine zone. Results suggest that temperature, soil moisture and altitude are used as appropriate environmental indicators for estimating the spatial distribution of potential soil respiration in alpine zone.

AB  - 1. Elevational gradients create environmental variation that is hypothesized to promote variation in life-history strategies. We tested whether differences in life-history strategies were associated with elevation in a songbird, the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis; Aves; A.O.U. 1998).
   2. We monitored birds in four replicated sites per elevation, at 2000 m a.s.l. (high elevation) and 1000 m a.s.l. (low elevation), in the Rocky Mountains of Canada.
   3. Over 5 years, we measured the following traits and vital rates: egg-laying schedules, morphological indicators of reproductive stage, seasonal reproductive success, indicators of competitive class (age, size, arrival time), and survival rates.
   4. We found two main patterns: with an increase in breeding elevation, dark-eyed juncos delayed the development of structures necessary for reproduction (e.g. cloacal protuberance in males) and reduced the duration of their reproductive period to less than half of the time used by low-elevation birds; and
   5. Juncos at high-elevation sites had 55-61% lower annual reproductive success and 15 to 20% higher survival rates. While adult juncos at high elevations produced fewer offspring, those offspring were in better condition. Proportions of age and size classes in high-compared to low-elevation populations were similar, suggesting that a life-history trade-off is present, rather than competition forcing inferior competitors to breed in a peripheral habitat. The apparent trade-off between reproduction and survival corresponded to a shorter period of favourable weather and available food in high-compared to low-elevation habitats.
   6. Thus, elevation had a strong influence on life-history characteristics of a single species over a short spatial distance, suggesting a shift in life history from a high reproductive strategy at lower elevations to a high survivor strategy at high elevations.
   7. This is the first paper to show a shift in avian life-history strategies along an elevational gradient (in both genders, of multiple age classes) when region (latitude) and phylogenetic histories are controlled for.

AB  - Background: The variability in the clinical or pathological presentation of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) in sheep, such as scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), has been attributed to prion protein genotype, strain, breed, clinical duration, dose, route and type of inoculum and the age at infection. The study aimed to describe the clinical signs in sheep infected with the BSE agent throughout its clinical course to determine whether the clinical signs were as variable as described for classical scrapie in sheep. The clinical signs were compared to BSE-negative sheep to assess if disease-specific clinical markers exist.
   Results: Forty-seven (34%) of 139 sheep, which comprised 123 challenged sheep and 16 undosed controls, were positive for BSE. Affected sheep belonged to five different breeds and three different genotypes (ARQ/ARQ, VRQ/VRQ and AHQ/AHQ). None of the controls or BSE exposed sheep with ARR alleles were positive. Pruritus was present in 41 (87%) BSE positive sheep; the remaining six were judged to be pre-clinically infected. Testing of the response to scratching along the dorsum of a sheep proved to be a good indicator of clinical disease with a test sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 98% and usually coincided with weight loss. Clinical signs that were displayed significantly earlier in BSE positive cases compared to negative cases were behavioural changes, pruritic behaviour, a positive scratch test, alopecia, skin lesions, teeth grinding, tremor, ataxia, loss of weight and loss of body condition. The frequency and severity of each specific clinical sign usually increased with the progression of disease over a period of 16-20 weeks.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that BSE in sheep presents with relatively uniform clinical signs, with pruritus of increased severity and abnormalities in behaviour or movement as the disease progressed. Based on the studied sheep, these clinical features appear to be independent of breed, affected genotype, dose, route of inoculation and whether BSE was passed into sheep from cattle or from other sheep, suggesting that the clinical phenotype of BSE is influenced by the TSE strain more than by other factors. The clinical phenotype of BSE in the genotypes and breed studied was indistinguishable from that described for classical scrapie cases.

AB  - Penetration of oxygenated waters to the deeper sub-surface may occur in association with deglaciation events and significantly change the geochemical processes acting at depth. Such a scenario may compromise long-term storage of radioactive waste in underground repositories where copper canisters would corrode in the presence of oxygen. In this study, Fe-oxides from fractures in granite drill-cores and from drilling debris were investigated and a method developed to trace the low-temperature, oxidising conditions which may have been caused by prior deglaciations. X-ray diffraction and Mossbauer spectroscopy showed that all the examined fracture fillings contained Fe-oxides. Based on their structure and form, three genetic types of Fe-oxides were identified: (I) coarse-grained (similar to 100 nm) hydrothermal hematite; (H) very fine-grained (similar to 10 ran) amorphous Fe-oxides that precipitated during drilling; (III) Intermediate grain-size crystalline Fe-oxides, that are interpreted to have formed naturally at low-temperatures (similar to 10 degrees C).
   Fe isotope composition of the Fe-oxides was determined by multiple-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry using a Fe-58-(54) Fe double-spike. delta Fe-56 of the Fe-oxides ranges from -0.8 to +0.8 parts per thousand (relative to the IRMM-14 standard). Hydrothermal samples have intermediate delta Fe-56 (-0.3 to 0.0 parts per thousand), whereas natural low-temperature samples may be isotopically lighter (-0.8 to 0.0 parts per thousand), and samples precipitated from drilling activity are isotopically heavier (-0.2 to 0.8 parts per thousand). Within the three genetic suites, 656 Fe correlates with the relative proportion of Fe(III). For the hydrothermal samples, Fe isotope composition likely reflects input of partially dissolved chlorite. The Fe isotope composition and Fe redox state of the low-temperature and drill-induced samples is consistent with a conceptual model where Fe isotope fractionation occurs during dissolution and oxidation. In our study, the deepest sample showing evidence of natural low-temperature oxidation, putatively as a result of penetration of oxidising surface waters during deglaciation, is from a depth of similar to 100 m.

AB  - Background Important controversies exist about the extent to which people's health status as adults is shaped by their living conditions in early life compared to adulthood. These debates have important policy implications, and one obstacle to resolving them is the relative lack of sufficient high-quality data on childhood and adult socioeconomic position and adult health status. We accordingly compared the health status among monozygotic and dizygotic women twin pairs who lived together through childhood (until at least age 14) and subsequently were discordant or concordant on adult socioeconomic position. This comparison permitted us to ascertain the additional impact of adult experiences on adult health in a population matched on early life experiences.
   Methods and Findings Our study employed data from a cross-sectional survey and physical examinations of twins in a population-based twin registry, the Kaiser Permanente Women Twins Study Examination 11, conducted in 1989 to 1990 in Oakland, California, United States. The study population was composed of 308 women twin pairs (58% monozygotic, 42% dizygotic); data were obtained on childhood and adult socioeconomic position and on blood pressure, cholesterol, post-load glucose, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, physical activity, and self-rated health. Health outcomes among adult women twin pairs who lived together through childhood varied by their subsequent adult occupational class. Cardiovascular factors overall differed more among monozygotic twin pairs that were discordant compared to concordant on occupational class. Moreover, among the monozygotic twins discordant on adult occupational class, the working class twin fared worse and, compared to her professional twin, on average had significantly higher systolic blood pressure (mean matched difference=4.54 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.10-8.97), diastolic blood pressure (mean matched difference=3.80 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.44-7.17), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (mean matched difference=7.82 mg/dl; 95% CI, 1.07-14.57). By contrast, no such differences were evident for analyses based on educational attainment, which does not capture post-education socioeconomic position.
   Conclusion These results provide novel evidence that lifetime socioeconomic position influences adult health and highlight the utility of studying social plus biological aspects of twinship.

AB  - The Pleistocene marine and associated periglacial deposits of the coasts of southern England from Cornwall to Sussex, the British Channel Islands, and northern France from Brittany and Normandy to the Pas de Calais are described. The deposition of almost all marine deposits is ascribed to temperate conditions, although large igneous erratic boulders may have been emplaced by shore-ice rafting at the end or beginning of cold stages. The balance of the evidence from a variety of dating methods including U-series dating, amino-acid geochronology and biostratigraphy of associated terrestrial formations indicates that deposits of the last three pre-Holocene temperate marine oxygen isotope stages (stages 9, 7 and substage 5e) can readily be identified along much of both coastlines of the Channel. Deposits attributable to stages 11 and 13 are uncommon and best seen in the staircase of marine terraces backing the Hampshire-Sussex coastal plain and perhaps in western Brittany and the Boulonnais. The height above modern sea-level of the marine deposits is thought to be the result of slow uplift of the coastal zone caused by the isostatic response to sediment unloading during accelerated phases of erosion in cold stages, although deep-seated tectonics also may have been partly responsible for uplift. However, the height above modern sea-level of a deposit alone is riot on its own an indicator of age.
   Periglacial head deposits are mainly exposed along the coasts, with the sections showing frost shattered debris moved downslope by cryoreptation (frost-creep). The age of these deposits is uncertain, although they appear to be principally of marine oxygen isotope stages 4 and 2 in age. Some remnants of marine oxygen isotope stage 6 or 8 head deposits are present both in England and northern France. in a few places with good dating control, head deposits dating to the marine oxygen isotope stage 12 can be recognised. The age of the head deposits in most sections is based on their stratigraphical relationship with loess, palaeosols and on the dating of the underlying raised beaches.

AB  - 1 The bryophyte and vascular flora were described for a range of forested and open peatlands in the mid-boreal Clay Belt region of Canada, and in the subarctic region of the Labrador Trough, Quebec. The floristic patterns and their relationships to methane (CH4) emission, hydrology and water chemistry were analysed with classification (TWINSPAN), detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA).
   2 Despite differences in vegetation physiognomy, chemistry, and geology, water chemistry (pH, Ca, Mg, K-corr) and hydrology explain most of the species distribution in both peatland regions. In the Clay Belt, bryophytes respond primarily to water table position, and secondarily to water chemistry; the reverse is true for the vascular flora. The bryophyte and vascular ordinations are more similar to each other in the Labrador Trough than in boreal sites.
   3 Although CH4 emissions are lower in subarctic than in boreal sites, mean CH4 flux is strongly correlated with mean water table position (r(2) = 0.73) in both regions, but is not correlated with water chemistry. The highest CH4 emissions (seasonal mean greater than or equal to 100 mg m(-2) day(-1)) occur in raised bog and patterned poor fen pools where the peat mat is degrading.
   4 The relationships among CH4 flux, mean water table position, and species distribution are similar in both boreal and subarctic regions. Bryophytes are generally better predictors of CH4 flux than vascular plants, except for certain species in flooded sites (e.g. Carer spp.). Bryophytes are also better indicators of the long-term average position of the water table, reflecting relative zones of methane production and oxidation over the season. In the vascular plant analyses, shrub cover indicates dry conditions and low CH4 flux in the sharply differentiated string-flark-pool topography of the subarctic fens, but is less predictive of CH4 emission in the drier hummock-hollow microtopography at boreal sites where shrubs and trees are more pervasive. Overall herbaceous or sedge cover is not indicative of CH4 flux in either region.

AB  - Simple Summary In the pig industry, new market trends and consumer demands have emerged over the past decades, which includes increased concerns about how animals are raised on farms. As a consequence of consumers' concerns, technologies capable of predicting animal welfare on farms have been explored. One of the technologies that are permeating the frontier of knowledge in this area are epigenetic biomarkers. Epigenetic biomarkers are biochemical markers surrounding the genome, which may be able to predict the exposures that individuals had during their lifetime. These markers represent an advance in the molecular level accuracy to support the current welfare indicators. In this literature review focused on pigs, we show some studies already carried out, we performed an integrative analysis of the already reported genes surrounding epi-biomarkers, and we highlight the benefits of investing efforts in this research field to enhance animal welfare and consumers' trust. Epigenetics works as an interface between the individual and its environment to provide phenotypic plasticity to increase individual adaptation capabilities. Recently, a wide variety of epi-genetic findings have indicated evidence for its application in the development of putative epi-biomarkers of stress in farm animals. The purpose of this study was to evaluate previously reported stress epi-biomarkers in swine and encourage researchers to investigate potential paths for the development of a robust molecular tool for animal welfare certification. In this literature review, we report on the scientific concerns in the swine production chain, the management carried out on the farms, and the potential implications of these practices for the animals' welfare and their epigenome. To assess reported epi-biomarkers, we identified, from previous studies, potentially stress-related genes surrounding epi-biomarkers. With those genes, we carried out a functional enrichment analysis of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of the DNA of swine subjected to different stress-related conditions (e.g., heat stress, intrauterine insult, and sanitary challenges). We identified potential epi-biomarkers for target analysis, which could be added to the current guidelines and certification schemes to guarantee and certify animal welfare on farms. We believe that this technology may have the power to increase consumers' trust in animal welfare.

AB  - Microbial agents have been widely used in the Chinese aquaculture industry due to their advantages of enhancing the immunity of aquatic animal, improving disease resistance and improving the aquaculture environment. In previous studies, we found a highly antagonistic Aeromonas hydrophila strain, Bacillus methylotrophicus WM-1, isolated from grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) culture systems. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of WM-1 on cultured water and fish. Strain WM-1 was mixed into the feed and fed to the grass carp for 30 days, set control group (CG, 0 CFU/g feed), low concentration group (LG, 10(3) CFU/g feed), medium concentration group (MG, 10(5) CFU/g feed) and high concentration group (HG, 10(7) CFU/g feed). Water quality and physiological indicators of grass carp were tested. Compared with CG, the concentrations of total phosphorus (TP) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) were significantly increased in the MG in the early stage (before day 18, p < 0.05), whereas decreased in the long stage. After the 12th day, treatment groups showed a significant decrease in chemical oxygen demand (COD) (p < 0.05). Total nitrogen (TN), ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N), nitrite (NO2--N) and nitrate (NO3--N) had no significant difference (p > 0.05). In grass carp serum, GPT activity in MG and HG was significantly reduced, SOD activity was significantly increased, and POD in MG was significantly higher than LG and HG (p < 0.05). In the liver, the GPT activity of the LG was significantly increased (p < 0.05). Other indicators (the specific growth rate and condition factor of grass carp, serum GOT, AKP and POD activity, total liver protein content, liver SOD, POD, AKP and GPT activity, haemocyte counts) have no significant difference between CG and treatment groups (p > 0.05). The results show that WM-1 is safe for water quality and culture objects, and has the effects of improving water quality and the immunity of grass carp. The corrent results combined with WM-1 effectively inhibit A. hydrophila shown that WM-1 can be applied to aquaculture production as a probiotics.

AB  - Collapse is one of the main hazards during tunnel construction by the drill-and-blast method. In order to evaluate the collapse risk and provide a basis for risk control, a failure probability evaluation method for collapse of drill-and-blast tunnels based on the multistate fuzzy Bayesian network is proposed in this paper. First, the typical tunnel collapse cases are analyzed statistically based on the risk breakdown structure method, a fault tree model is built for drill-and-blast tunnel collapses and the causal relationships between the tunnel collapse and the influential factors, such as natural conditions, engineering geology and construction etc., are revealed. Secondly, the multiple fault states of nodes, including rock mass grade and groundwater, are described by the fuzzy numbers. The fuzzy subsets are utilized to describe the failure probability of nodes and the uncertain logic relationship between nodes described by the multistate fuzzy conditional probability table is established. In order to ensure the reliability of the survey data when evaluating the possibility intervals of the multistate fuzzy conditional probability tables and the fuzzy failure probability of root nodes, as well as taking the expert judgment ability level and subjective reliability level into consideration, an expert investigation method based on the confidence indicator is proposed. Finally, in order to fully exploit expert knowledge and empirical data, the alpha-weighted valuation method is adopted for defuzzification so as to obtain precise parameters for the conditional probability tables. The 3 sigma criterion is employed to calculate the characteristic values of triangular fuzzy numbers so as to determine the prior fuzzy failure probability of root nodes. By means of the fuzzy Bayesian inference, the proposed method is capable of calculating the probability distribution of tunnel collapse and identifying the critical risk factors under both prior knowledge and given evidence circumstances. Taking the collapse failure probability evaluation for the Xiucun Tunnel passing through the fault F18 as an example, the application results demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method and it can be utilized as a decision-making tool for safety risk management during tunnel construction.

AB  - Assessments of organisms' vulnerability to potential climatic shifts are increasingly common. Such assessments are often conducted at the species level and focused primarily on the magnitude of anticipated climate change (i.e., climate exposure). However, wildlife management would benefit from population-level assessments that also incorporate measures of local or regional potential for organismal adaptation to change. Estimates of genetic diversity, gene flow, and landscape connectivity can address this need and complement climate exposure estimates to establish management priorities at broad to local scales. We provide an example of this holistic approach for desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) within and surrounding lands administered by the U.S. National Park Service. We used genetic and environmental data from 62 populations across the southwestern U.S. to delineate genetic structure, evaluate relationships between genetic diversity and isolation, and estimate relative climate vulnerability for populations as a function of five variables associated with species' responses to climate change: genetic diversity, genetic isolation, geographic isolation, forward climate velocity within a population's habitat patch (a measure of geographic movement rate required for an organism to maintain constant climate conditions), and maximum elevation within the habitat patch (a measure of current climate stress, as lower maximum elevation is associated with higher temperature, lower precipitation, and lower population persistence). Genetic structure analyses revealed a high-level division between populations in southeastern Utah and populations in the remainder of the study area, which were further differentiated into four lower-level genetic clusters. Genetic diversity decreased with population isolation, whereas genetic differentiation increased, but these patterns were stronger for native populations than for translocated populations. Populations exhibited large variation in predicted vulnerability across the study area with respect to all variables, but native populations occupying relatively intact landscapes, such as Death Valley and Grand Canyon national parks, had the lowest overall vulnerability. These results provide local and regional context for conservation and management decisions regarding bighorn populations in a changing climate. Our study further demonstrates how assessments combining multiple factors could allow a more integrated response, such as increasing efforts to maintain connectivity and thus potential for adaptation in areas experiencing rapid climate change.

AB  - The study aimed at assessing the depuration potentials of endoparasite, Amplicaecum africanum on trace metals in its toad host, Amietophrynus regularis at sites of significant anthropogenic perturbations within the Lagos metropolis, in Nigeria. A total of 120 toads of both sexes, alongside 45 soil samples were collected from each of three (3) stations labeled Dumpsite, Lagoon front and Highrise, using hand nets and by hand-picking between February and October, 2018. The intestinal tissues sections of the toads were examined using a binocular dissecting microscope (American Optical Corporation, Model 570) and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain. Oxidative stress in toad intestine was assessed by estimating the levels of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and lipid peroxidation (MDA). Trace metals in the water, soil, toad liver, intestine and parasite, Amplicaecum africanum were tested using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry (Philips model PU 9100). Lead (Pb), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd), and chromium (Cr) were detected in the toads, with the infected toads having lower concentrations of most trace metals than the uninfected toads, irrespective of the locations and sex. Strong negative correlations between parasitological indices and concentrations of trace metals in the toads suggest that the parasites might have taken up significant amounts of trace metals from the host. The study demonstrated the potentials of parasite, A. africanum to depurate trace metal burden in Amietophrynus regularis. When the dominant factor impacting the toad is the parasitic infection, parasite intensity determines the trade-off between parasitological harm and depuration benefit to the host. Hence, under controlled conditions, parasites may serve as bioremediation agent in the event of pollution. Depuration potential of A. africanum in the study was supported by the mild tissue alterations observed in the intestine of infected toads, compared to the uninfected counterparts, which exhibited severe glandular hyperplasia, increased connective tissue, and severely stunted villi. Consistently lower activities of biochemical biomarkers which characterize the uninfected toads compared to the infected, irrespective of the sex and stations, further corroborate drawn inferences.

TI  - Sediment-filled karst depressions and riyad - key archaeological environments of south Qatar
T2  - E&G QUATERNARY SCIENCE JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - Systematic archaeological exploration of southern Qatar started in the 1950s. However, detailed local and regional data on climatic fluctuations and landscape changes during the Holocene, pivotal for understanding and reconstructing human-environment interactions, are still lacking. This contribution provides an overview on the variability of geomorphic environments of southern Qatar with a focus on depression landforms, which reveal a rich archaeological heritage ranging from Palaeolithic(?) and Early Neolithic times to the Modern era. Based on a detailed geomorphic mapping campaign, sediment cores and optically stimulated luminescence data, the dynamics of riyad (singular rawdha; shallow, small-scale, sediment-filled karst depressions clustering in the central southern peninsula) and the larger-scale Asaila depression near the western coast are studied in order to put archaeological discoveries into a wider environmental context. Geomorphic mapping of the Asaila basin shows a much greater geomorphic variability than documented in literature so far with relict signs of surface runoff. An 8 m long sediment core taken in the sabkha-type sand flats of the western basin reveals a continuous dominance of aeolian morphodynamics during the early to mid-Holocene. Mounds preserved by evaporite horizons representing capillarites originally grown in the vadose zone are a clear sign of groundwater-level drop after the sea-level highstand ca. 6000-4500 years ago. Deflation followed the lowering of the Stokes surface, leaving mounds where the relict capillarites were able to fixate and preserve the palaeo-surface. Abundant archaeological evidence of Early and Middle Neolithic occupation - the latter with a clear focus inside the central Asaila basin - indicate more favourable living conditions than today. In contrast, the sediment record of the investigated riyad in the south is very shallow, younger and controlled by surface discharge, deflation and the constantly diminishing barchan dune cover in Qatar over the Middle and Late Holocene. The young age of the infill (ca. 1500 to 2000 years) explains the absence of findings older than the Late Islamic period. Indicators of current net deflation may relate to a decrease in surface runoff and sediment supply only in recent decades to centuries. In the future, geophysical prospection of the riyad may help to locate thicker sedimentary archives and the analysis of grain size distribution, micromorphology, phytoliths or even pollen spectra may enhance our understanding of the interplay of regional environmental changes and cultural history.

AB  - Relatively little is known of how the world's largest vegetation transition zone the Forest Tundra Ecotone (FTE) is responding to climate change. Newly available, satellite-derived time-series of the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) across North America and Europe could provide new insights into the physiological response of evergreen trees to climate change by tracking changes in foliar pigment pools that have been linked to photosynthetic phenology. However, before implementing these data for such purpose at these evergreen dominated systems, it is important to increase our understanding of the fine scale mechanisms driving the connection between PRI and environmental conditions. The goal of this study is thus to gain a more mechanistic understanding of which environmental factors drive changes in PRI during late-season phenological transitions at the FTE including factors that are susceptible to climate change (i.e., air- and soil-temperatures), and those that are not (photoperiod). We hypothesized that late-season phenological changes in foliar pigment pools captured by PRI are largely driven by photoperiod as opposed to less predictable drivers such as air temperature, complicating the utility of PRI time-series for understanding climate change effects on the FTE. Ground-based, time series of PRI were acquired from individual trees in combination with meteorological variables and photoperiod information at six FTE sites in Alaska. A linear mixed-effects modeling approach was used to determine the significance (alpha = 0.001) and effect size (i.e., standardized slope b*) of environmental factors on late-seasonal changes in the PRI signal. Our results indicate that photoperiod had the strongest, significant effect on late season changes in PRI (b* = 0.08, p < 0.001), but environmental variables susceptible to climate change were also significant (i.e., daily mean solar radiation (b* = 0.03, p < 0.001) and daily mean soil temperature (b* = 0.02, p < 0.001)). These results suggest that interpreting PRI time-series of late-season phenological transitions may indeed facilitate our understanding of how northern treeline responds to climate change.

AB  - In males, age-related decline in free testosterone (T) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) by 2-3% per year has been reported. Estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) seem to decrease as well, but to a lesser extent. Lower sex steroid levels in men have been related to physical and mental symptoms. Low birthweight and left-/mixed-handedness (L/MH) are indicators of an adverse fetal environment during pregnancy, and both have been linked to morbidity in later life. The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between lower birthweight as well as L/MH and age-related sex steroid decline. In a cross-sectional study design, saliva samples were collected under standardized conditions from healthy men for subsequent steroid hormone analysis using standard luminescence immunoassays. T (M = 67.57 pg/mL), DHEA (M = 247.91 pg/mL), E2 (M = 1.29 pg/mL), and P (M = 28.20 pg/mL) have been quantified leading to a final sample of 256 men providing complete data on sex hormones (M-Age=57.8; SDAge = 10.8). Information on participants' birthweight was obtained from birth reports (N = 134), and participants were asked about their handedness (right-handed, left-handed, mixed-handed) (N = 256). Multivariate-adjusted linear regression models relating each sex hormone individually and the principal component of declining steroid hormones (DSH)-an integrated hormonal parameter-with handedness and birthweight did not identify significant associations except for handedness and E2. Moderation analysis using robust regression accounting for bias due to influential data points detected a significant association between age and DSH for handedness (beta = -0.0314, p = 0.040) but only a trend for birthweight (beta = 0.0309, p = 0.073). For lower birthweight, a trend toward intensified age-related sex steroid decline in men was observed, while for L/MH, a significant association with intensified age-related sex steroid decline was identified. These results indicate that L/MH and potentially also lower birthweight might be considered as early risk factors for endocrine health in later life.

AB  - Issue of deterioration of condition and preservation of protective forest plantations, loss of their protective and ameliorative functions due to the lack of forest management service have become more urgent in recent decades in forest and agrarian landscapes of the Central Black Earth Region. Improvement thinning is the main tool in the forestry practice system which provides improvement in growth, development and sanitary state of protective forest plantations. The purpose of our research is to determine the effect from improvement thinning on growth and sanitary state of forest belt stand and its main species - English oak. Forest valuation and pathology research were carried out in Kamennaya Steppe (Talovsky district, Voronezh region) in the period of 1986-2017. Afforestation belt no. 240 was a research object laid out according to line planting with the following scheme of species mixture: where - silver birch, - Norway maple, - English oak. Stationary experiment is presented by the following plots: 1 -control without improvement thinning; 2 -plantation thinning with intensity of 21-33 % of wood stock by means of dominating thinning of fast-growing species (silver birch and balsam poplar), thinning of weak and bruised trees of the main species (English oak) and associated species (Norway maple) with felling waste removal from the plantation; 3 - the same as 2, but with lifting the canopy to the height of 1.5-2 m; 4 -the same as 3, but with clearing by scattering slash under stand's canopy. Length of plots 1-3 is 250 m, plot 4 - 140 m. It is established that thinning contribute to the improvement of forestry and biological indicators of English oak. Preservation excess of vigorous trees of the main species at the plots with improvement thinning in comparison with control plot is 13.0-24.3 %. Preserved trees of English oak on the plot without improvement thinning stunt in trunk diameter for 1.2-5.0 cm and height for 0.1-1.3 m. Proportion of forest mortality and inviable trees of English oak is increasing and proportion of viable and partially viable trees decreases after thinning. There is a need to carry out improvement thinning during growth and development of plantations for cultivating them sustainable, ameliorative and effective.

AB  - Current approaches to risk assessment in bees do not take into account co-exposures from multiple stressors. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is deploying resources and efforts to move towards a holistic risk assessment approach of multiple stressors in bees. This paper describes the general principles of pesticide risk assessment in bees, including recent developments at EFSA dealing with risk assessment of single and multiple pesticide residues and biological hazards. The EFSA Guidance Document on the risk assessment of plant protection products in bees highlights the need for the inclusion of an uncertainty analysis, other routes of exposures and multiple stressors such as chemical mixtures and biological agents. The EFSA risk assessment on the survival, spread and establishment of the small hive beetle, Aethina tumida, an invasive alien species, is provided with potential insights for other bee pests such as the Asian hornet, Vespa velutina. Furthermore, data gaps are identified at each step of the risk assessment, and recommendations are made for future research that could be supported under the framework of Horizon 2020. Finally, the recent work conducted at EFSA is presented, under the over-arching MUST-B project ("EU efforts towards the development of a holistic approach for the risk assessment on MUltiple STressors in Bees") comprising a toolbox for harmonised data collection under field conditions and a mechanistic model to assess effects from pesticides and other stressors such as biological agents and beekeeping management practices, at the colony level and in a spatially complex landscape. Future perspectives at EFSA include the development of a data model to collate high quality data to calibrate and validate the model to be used as a regulatory tool. Finally, the evidence collected within the framework of MUST-B will support EFSA's activities on the development of a holistic approach to the risk assessment of multiple stressors in bees. In conclusion, EFSA calls for collaborative action at the EU level to establish a common and open access database to serve multiple purposes and different stakeholders. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Historical channel adjustments are documented and discussed in context with anthropogenic disturbances along two meandering, coastal plain rivers - the lower Brazos and Sabine Rivers in the south-central United States. Hard-copy streamflow-measurement notes of the U.S. Geological Survey were utilized to render historical cross sections (1925-2007) at nine gauging stations, which were complemented with repeat photographs and flood-frequency analysis to assess trajectories of channel change and interpret causative mechanisms. Downstream- and upstream-propagating disturbances caused episodes of channel-bed incision and aggradation at different locations for distinct time periods along both rivers. Incision associated with upstream dams is detected, but channels are compensated downstream with sediment inputs from lateral channel migration and tributaries. In one case, temporary aggradation along the Brazos River at Waco was likely caused by a combination of dam construction and regional soil erosion. Channel-bed incision on the lowermost Brazos River is unrelated to dams, but is associated with instream aggregate extraction, possibly in conjunction with downstream channelization. On the Sabine River, extensive aggradation during the 1930s might be associated with logging activities (1880s-1930s), but whether the cause is pervasive regional-scale hillslope erosion or local-scale mill-site activities is indeterminate. Following passage of this sediment, the river generally recovered to pre-disturbance conditions and has exhibited stability despite a mainstem reservoir. Translation of this sediment slug is attenuated by a transition to a flood-prone, distributary-dominated system downstream of the Holocene-Pleistocene terrace onlap position. Additional findings include cross-channel hingepoints separating thalweg incision from simultaneous point-bar or bank accretion at meander bends, which indicates channel adjustment occurs along non-cohesive beds in preference to cohesive or artificially reinforced banks. Also, flood reduction has resulted in bankfull stages that are higher than levels associated with the post-regulation 2-year return period. Finally, vegetation encroachment along banks since the 1970s coupled with reduced flooding along the lower Brazos River has promoted bank accretion deposits that, when fully developed, serve as morphologic indicators of the post-regulation 1- to 2-year return period stage.

AB  - Top predators inhabiting a dynamic environment, such as coastal waters, should theoretically possess sufficient cognitive ability to allow successful foraging despite unpredictable sensory stimuli. The cognition-related hunting abilities of marine mammals have been widely demonstrated. Having been historically underestimated, teleost cognitive abilities have also now been significantly demonstrated. Conversely, the abilities of elasmobranchs have received little attention, despite many species possessing relatively large brains comparable to some mammals. The need to determine what, if any, cognitive ability these globally distributed, apex predators are endowed with has been highlighted recently by questions arising from environmental assessments, specifically whether they are able to learn to distinguish between anthropogenic electric fields and prey bioelectric fields. We therefore used electroreceptive foraging behaviour in a model species, Scyliorhinus canicula (small-spotted catshark), to determine cognitive ability by analysing whether elasmobranchs are able to learn to improve foraging efficiency and remember learned behavioural adaptations. Positive reinforcement, operant conditioning was used to study catshark foraging behaviour towards artificial, prey-type electric fields (Efields). Catsharks rewarded with food for responding to Efields throughout experimental weeks were compared with catsharks that were not rewarded for responding in order to assess behavioural adaptation via learning ability. Experiments were repeated after a 3-week interval with previously rewarded catsharks this time receiving no reward and vice versa to assess memory ability. Positive reinforcement markedly and rapidly altered catshark foraging behaviour. Rewarded catsharks exhibited significantly more interest in the electrical stimulus than unrewarded catsharks. Furthermore, they improved their foraging efficiency over time by learning to locate and bite the electrodes to gain food more quickly. In contrast, unrewarded catsharks showed some habituation, whereby their responses to the electrodes abated and eventually entirely ceased, though they generally showed no changes in most foraging parameters. Behavioural adaptations were not retained after the interval suggesting learned behaviour was not memorised beyond the interval. Sequences of individual catshark search paths clearly illustrated learning and habituation behavioural adaptation. This study demonstrated learning and habituation occurring after few foraging events and a memory window of between 12 h and 3 weeks. These cognitive abilities are discussed in relation to diet, habitat, ecology and anthropogenic Efield sources.

AB  - Cultivation and overgrazing can cause desertification of sandy grasslands in arid and semiarid regions. However, little was known about their effects on soil macro-fauna. In this study, we described the soil macro-faunal community structure at cultivated, grazed, and ungrazed sites in the semiarid Horqin steppe, northern China. Soil bulk density was 1.61gcm(-3) at grazed sites, similar to that at cultivated sites. Cultivation reduced soil organic carbon and total nitrogen by 36 and 46%, respectively, compared with grazed grassland. Grazing exclusion decreased soil bulk density and pH by 16 and 3%, respectively, and increased soil moisture, soil organic carbon and total nitrogen by 75, 22, and 4%, respectively, compared with grazed grassland. Cultivated and grazed sites had similar group richness (9 and 10 groups, respectively) and Shannon's index (1.98 and 1.93, respectively); both were significantly lower there than at ungrazed sites. Simpson's index at grazed sites was 0.18, markedly higher than at ungrazed (0.12) and cultivated (0.16) sites. There were no significant differences in soil macro-faunal density among the three treatments, although the density at grazed sites was 24% higher than at cultivated sites and 30% lower than at ungrazed sites. Soil bulk density, electrical conductivity, pH, and the C/N ratio significantly affected the community structure. Specific macro-faunal groups responded to the different living conditions by adaptation to or selection of specific habitats. For example, the Thomisidae, Reduviidae, Staphilinidae, and Curculionidae responded negatively to increasing soil bulk density and all of these except the Curculionidae responded negatively to increasing soil temperature. These groups have important implications for the soil food web, and thus for the soil ecosystems. Our results suggested that cultivation and continuous grazing negatively affected soil properties and macro-faunal diversity, whereas livestock exclusion enhanced soil macro-faunal assemblies and improved their biodiversity. Changes in these assemblies might be potential indicators of ecosystem recovery and management impacts. Supplementary materials are available for this article.

AB  - Low-field magnetic susceptibility (chi(in)) measurements are quick and sensitive enabling the creation of high-resolution records; making chi(in) an attractive correlation tool and a proxy for paleoclimate and paleoenvironments. In geologically young material - foremost in Cenozoic sediments - chi(in) belongs to the geoscientist's toolkit. However, chi(in) is a convolved signal and may reflect other processes than the often implicitly inferred depositional conditions. Diagenesis, remagnetization and low-grade metamorphism, can potentially obscure the original, depositional, chi(in) signal. This aspect is particularly important when interpreting chi(in) records from Paleozoic rocks.
   Here, we review data obtained from a large sample collection of Middle to Upper Devonian sections in Belgium. Comparison of chi(in) trends with paleoenvironmental indicators (facies) and with detrital input proxies (Zr, Th, Ti, Al) allowed to assess the persistence of depositional trends. Furthermore, the;an signal was deconvolved into its dominant mineralogical contributions with the help of magnetic-property analysis.
   The main results are pointing to a magnetic signal dominated by fine-grained magnetite, of which paleomagnetic analysis indicated a formation during Carboniferous remagnetization. This prompts a potentially strong influence of post-depositional processes and it complicates the interpretation of chi(in) records in terms of depositional environments. However, in most of the sections, there is a relatively good relationship between chi(in) trends and facies evolution and between chi(in) and geochemical proxies for detrital inputs. This indicates that the newly formed magnetite grains would at least partly remain where they are formed, and this allows a relative preservation of the original signal, despite the strong influence of diagenesis. Two sections show a stronger impact of diagenesis, where for about half of these sections, the primary, depositional information is lost.
   The Eifelian-Givetian Monts de Baileux section was selected for time-series analysis of the chi(in) series. The Average Spectral Misfit (ASM) method is applied to explicitly evaluate the null hypothesis of no orbital signal and in this section, there is 99.05% chance that the MS signal is reflecting an orbital imprint.

AB  - At present the worldwide energy market is dominated by fossil fuels, despite that it has been demonstrated to be a major source of environmental problems. In Cuba, about 96% of the power generation comes from fossil fuels, and 26% of this is produced by decentralized power stations (DPSs). DPS technology grew by a factor of six from 2005 to 2010, aiming to increase the efficiency in power generation and distribution, and to reduce the vulnerability on climate events. However, environmental impacts related to this technology, especially those impacts on human health, require a detailed analysis, considering that many DPSs have been located nearby densely populated areas.
   This paper presents an analysis of the external effects related to gaseous emissions from decentralized power generation in Santa Clara City, Cuba. Also a perturbation analysis aiming to reduce such effects is presented. For this purpose a rather novel method called Integrated Assessment of Energy Supply (IAES) was developed. The IAES is built on the Impact Pathway Approach (IPA) and the System Perturbation Analysis (SPA), but including additional developments. The first of these concerns is the implementation of perturbations analysis to evaluate the external effects variation related to modifications in facility characteristics and operating conditions. E.g.: fuel type, efficiency, stacks geometry and microlocalization. Second, the exposure to polluting gases in the study area is determined taking into account the dispersion of pollutants, and the geographical distribution of the population. The exposure modeling is determinant to estimate human health impact. In this way it was found that northwest DPS cause the highest local impact on human health. This is associated with the pollutants concentration increase in densely populated areas. The higher CO2 emissions correspond to the southeast DPS by a factor of 1.8 compared to the northwest DPS. However, the local impact related to the southeast DPS is lower, due to its location where downwind population is lower. A reduction potential on health impact of about 20% and 9% respectively was finally determined for northwest and southwest DPS. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soil quality (SQ), a measure of the sustainability of land use and soil management practices, can be assessed by indicators including soil physical, chemical, and biological properties. Our primary objectives were to investigate the influence of consecutive cultivation and different crop rotation systems on individual SQ indicators and to examine the impact of rotation systems on SQ using soil quality index (SQI) model.
   A site-specific selection of 17 potential SQ indicators representing soil chemical and physical attributes (0-10 cm) and groundwater features on 60 sampling locations and 10 representative soil profiles was chosen in a typical coastal newly reclaimed farmland of north Jiangsu Province, China. Using ANOVA analysis, the crop rotation effect was analyzed by comparing SQ indicators between rice/rape rotation soil and cotton/barley rotation soil. An overall SQI was calculated to examine whether plant biomass indices exactly responded to the SQI value.
   Results indicated that cultivation had significant effect on some soil profile characteristics, including SOM, SOCD, AP, CEC, AK, ECe, and I (f). Crop rotation systems also had significant influence on some SQ indicators. Compared with cotton/barley rotation soil, rice/rape rotation soil was characterized by higher organic matter, undifferentiated nutrient storage and salinity/alkalinity, lower water accommodation and infiltration, and adverse groundwater conditions. Cotton/barley rotation had higher SQI values over rice/rape rotation (0.523 vs. 0.422). SQ indicators of SAR(e), ECe, and WTg contributed the most to the overall SQI value for each rotation system. Plant biomass indices significantly correlated with the SQI values for both rotation systems, suggesting that the SQI values essentially reflected the status of SQ.
   Such results allowed us to conclude that cotton/barley rotation system contributed more to the improvement of SQ than rice/rape rotation system in coastal farming area. Also, we suggested SOCD, AK, rho (b), WTg, and ECg as the minimum data set for SQ assessment, as they had potential in discriminating the effect of rotation systems on SQ between the rotation systems used here.

AB  - The last 5500 years of climate change and environmental response in the northern Benguela Coastal Upwelling are reconstructed by means of three sediment cores from the inner shelf off central Namibia. The study is based on nutrient (delta N-15, delta C-13) and productivity proxies (accumulation rates of total organic carbon; AR(TOC)). Reconstructed sea surface temperatures (alkenone-derived SST) and temperatures at subsurface depths (T-delta 18O; based on tests of planktonic foraminifers) reflect the physical boundary conditions. The selection of proxy indicators proved a valuable basis for robust palaeo-climatic reconstructions, with the resolution ranging from multi-decadal (NAM1) over centennial (core 178) to millennial scale (core 226620). The northern Benguela experienced pronounced and rapid perturbation during the middle and late Holocene, and apparently, not all are purely local in character. In fact, numerous correlations with records from the adjacent South African subcontinent and the northern hemisphere testify to global climatic teleconnections. The Holocene Hypsithermal, for instance, is just as evident as the Little Ice Age (LIA) and the Roman Warm Period. The marked SST-rise associated with the latter is substantiated by other marine and terrestrial data from the South African realm. The LIA (at least its early stages) manifests itself in intensified winds and upwelling, which accords with increased rainfall receipts above the continental interior. It appears that climate signals are transferred both via the atmosphere and ocean. The combined analysis of SST and T-delta 18O proved a useful tool in order to differentiate between both pathways. SSTs are primarily controlled by the intensity of atmospheric circulation features, reflecting changes of upwelling-favourable winds. T-delta 18O records the temperature of the source water and often correlates with global ocean conveyor speed due to varying inputs of warm Agulhas Water. It seems as though conveyor slowdown or acceleration not only affected the temperature of the source water but also its nutrient content. This relationship between source water quality and conveyor speed is already known from glacial times.

AB  - Innovation and new product success are often a core precursor to superior performance. Although research has examined the resource-based view (RBV) and market orientation (MO) individually, limited research has evaluated and compared their effect on innovation and new product success in one study. Furthermore, relative to MO, comparatively less research has been conducted to evaluate the relationship between organizational learning (OL) and the RBV to examine their effects on a firm's ability to innovate and succeed. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of environmental variables (i.e., market turbulence and technological turbulence) on the relationship between two strategic orientations and performance and to extend a previous study. Specifically, it aims to evaluate whether a focus on the customer or the firm will impact innovation, product quality, new product success, financial performance, and customer value in settings of varying environmental turbulence. Data were collected from more than 200 senior executives. LISREL was applied to evaluate the relationships under examination. Interaction effects were assessed using a nested goodness-of-fit strategy using a multiple-group solution. Results depicted significant relationships between organizational learning and both resource and market orientations. Significant relationships also emerged between each strategic orientation and various performance indicators. Interaction effects were observed for market turbulence on customer value and market orientation as well as for resource orientation (RO) on innovation in times of high technological turbulence. The paper concludes with a review of theoretical and managerial implications to stimulate further debate. These results suggest that managers seeking innovation and new product success cannot afford to ignore the environment and do so at their peril. The provision of customer value is essential for positive financial performance. Thus, management needs to monitor environmental contexts so that they are able to adjust their investment in market orientation and the requisite processes that enable its implementation. Conversely, the effects of RO on performance are more robust across industry conditions, presenting an alternative avenue for management to achieve market superiority. The paper concludes with a review of theoretical and managerial implications to stimulate further debate.

AB  - Hydraulic structures such as a dam, weir and water gate affect on the flow depth, velocity, bed topology, water quality and so on, so that the hydraulic structures may affect on the water environment for plants and aquatic lives in and around rivers. Therefore, before construction of such hydraulic structures, it is necessary to conduct the environmental assessment. However, the accuracy of the environmental assessment is not so high at present, because the preference curves of the flow depth, velocity and so on are not clear. Recently, Nagaya et al. [Nagaya, T., Onitsuka, K., Higashino, M., Takami, T., Otsuka, N., Akiyama, J., Matsumoto, K., 2004. Evaluation of weight of parameter for spawning of ayu, Plecoglossus altivelis, and prediction of spawn density per unit area. In: Lee, J.H.W, Lam, K.M. (Eds.), Environmental Hydraulics and Sustainable Water Management, vol. 2. AA. Balkema Publishers, UK, pp. 947-954] pointed out that the velocity, flow depth and substrate affect on the suitability of spawning for ayu, Plecoglosses altivelis altivelis on the basis of statistical investigation. Preference curves of velocity and flow depth were made clear by Onitsuka et al. [Onitsuka, K., Nagaya, T., Higashino, M., Takami, T., Otsuka, N., Akiyama, J., Ozeki, H., Matsumoto, K., Shiraishi, Y, 2005. Suitable flow depth and velocity for spawning of ayu, Plecoglossus altivelis. In: Proceedings of the 31th Congress of IAHR, Korea, pp. 1850-1858]. On the other hand, the preference curve of substrate has not been investigated. In this study, the preference curve of substrate was investigated on the basis of field survey. Further, a numerical simulation by making use of a horizontal 2D numerical model was carried out with changing the discharge at the Gokasegawa River due to a lot of ayu inhabits in the Gokasegawa River. The numerical model is based on the model which was suggested by Nagata et al. [Nagata, N., Hosoda, T., Muramoto, Y., 2000. Numerical analysis of river channel processes with bank erosion. journal of Hydraulic Engineering, ASCE 126 (4), 243-252]. The suitability of spawning for ayu is predicted with the preference curves of the flow depth, velocity and substrate. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Drought is a complex natural hazard that is best characterized by multiple climatological and hydrological parameters. Improving our understanding of the relationships between these parameters is necessary to reduce the impacts of drought. Data mining is a recently developed technique that can be used to interact with large databases and assist in the discovery of associations between drought and oceanic data by extracting information from massive and multiple data archives.
   In this study, a new data-mining algorithm [i.e., Minimal Occurrences With Constraints and Time Lags (MOWCATL)] has been used to identify the relationships between oceanic parameters and drought indices. Rather than using traditional global statistical associations, the algorithm identifies drought episodes separate from normal and wet conditions and then uses drought episodes to find time-lagged relationships with oceanic parameters. As with all association-based data-mining algorithms, MOWCATL is used to find existing relationships in the data, and is not by itself a prediction tool.
   Using the MOWCATL algorithm, the analyses of the rules generated for selected stations and state-averaged data for Nebraska from 1950 to 1999 indicate that most occurrences of drought are preceded by positive values of the Southern Oscillation index (SOI), negative values of the multivariate ENSO index (MEI), negative values of the Pacific-North American (PNA) index, negative values of the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), and negative values of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The frequency and confidence of the time-lagged relationships between oceanic indices and droughts at the selected stations in Nebraska indicate that oceanic parameters can be used as indicators of drought in Nebraska.

AB  - We determined the delta(13)C and delta(15)N of water-column particulate organic matter (POM), dissolved inorganic carbon, and nitrate, together with water chemistry and phytoplankton biomass and species composition every month in eutrophic Lake Lugano. As primary productivity increased during spring, the delta(13)C of photic-zone POM increased from -34parts per thousand to -24parts per thousand. This C-13 enrichment reflects decreasing C-isotope fractionation between organic and inorganic carbon pools in response to decreasing surface water [CO2(aq)]. Variations in the delta(15)N of surface-water POM (+2parts per thousand to +8parts per thousand) collected during the productive period were attributed to isotope effects associated with nitrate uptake, nitrogen fixation, and mixing of different organic matter sources. The apparent N-isotope enrichment (epsilon) associated with nitrate assimilation varied with epsilon = - 1.0parts per thousand +/- 0.9 for diatoms and epsilon = - 3.4parts per thousand +/- 0.4 for green algae. The mechanisms controlling the N-isotopic composition of surface-water nitrate include the combined processes of nitrate assimilation, nitrification, mixing of water masses, and external nitrate loading. There was no consistent relation between the delta(15)N of POM, the delta(15)N of nitrate, and the nitrate concentration in surface waters. Low delta(13)C (-60parts per thousand) of POM from the benthic nepheloid layer (BNL) indicated that as much as 80% of the POM in the BNL consisted of methanotrophic bacteria. The delta(13)C and delta(15)N of near-bottom POM allowed tracing a "bacteriocline", which rose with the expanding volume of bottom-water suboxia. Associated with the development of anaerobic conditions and coupled to decreasing [NO3-], the delta(15)N of bottom-water nitrate progressively increased from +8parts per thousand to +27parts per thousand, indicating active denitrification in the hypolimnion. This study demonstrates the potential of natural-abundance level measurements of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes to trace biogeochemical processes in lakes. However, the delta(15)N of POM in eutrophic lakes is of limited use as an indicator of the degree of nitrate utilization and trophic state.

AB  - The concentration of chlorophylla degradation products, i.e. chlorins, preserved in deep-sea sediments is a function of the amount of primary production input and the rate at which it is subsequently degraded. Sedimentary chlorins can be used as a proxy for paleoproductivity; however, our understanding of the factors controlling their preservation is limited. To study the effects of changes in export of primary production from the euphotic zone and of differences in depositional conditions on chlorin concentration in marine sediments, chlorins were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography from sediments taken within and below the oxygen minimum zone on the Oman margin in the Arabian Sea. Among five stations at water depths between 400 and 1250 m, variation in chlorin concentration in surface sediments (0-0.5 cm) was significantly related to water depth (used here as a proxy for chlorin fluxes to the sediments) and bottom-water oxygen concentration; the more important control on chlorin concentration of surficial sediments measured in this study is the amount of chlorins reaching the sediment. Chlorins decayed exponentially downcore (0-20 cm). The degradation of sedimentary chlorins was better described by a model in which chlorins decayed at different rates within and below the sediment mixed layer. The degradation rates within the mixed layer were 0.0280 +/- 0.0385 yr(-1) (t(1/2) = 73 yr). Below the mixed layer, degradation rates were one to two orders of magnitude less, ranging from 0.0022 +/- 0.0025 yr(-1) (t(1/2) = 680 yr). Many stations had subsurface chlorin concentration peaks between 6 and 10 cm depth. The most likely explanation for these peaks is a period of increased deposition of chlorins in the past. This could result from changes in local depositional environment or a more general increase in surface production resulting in an increased sedimentation of chlorins to the sediments 500-1000 years ago. Chlorins are a useful indicator of the magnitude of chlorin deposition; however their usage as indicators of paleoproductivity is more complicated. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examined how weakly electric fish, Gnathonemus petersii, integrate multiple sensory modalities (passive and active electrosenses, and vision) to maintain proximity to tubular structures, serving as the fish's hiding place or shelter during the daytime. By moving the shelter along a linear 2-meter path, causing a mechanical disturbance, we challenged the fish's shelter-seeking behavior and used the length of travel that shelter proximity was maintained (contact distance) as an indicator of how well the: animal maintained its shelter. In order to determine the contribution of vision and electrosense to this behavior, four groups of fish were tested in which: (1) all three modalities were intact; (2) vision alone was eliminated by optic nerve transection; (3) the active electrosense was. silenced by spinal cord transection rendering the electric organ inoperative; and (4) both vision and active electrosense were deactivated. Further elimination or minimization of various sensory cues was achieved by testing the fish with optically transparent, acrylic shelters (Plexiglas) that stimulate active, but not passive, electrosense, and aluminum shelters that theoretically stimulate all three modalities. As expected, performance was optimal when all three modalities were operating, but better than expected from quantitative models based on additive processes alone. Although the absence of one sense (vision or active electrosense) caused initial deficits, these were fully compensated for over repeated daily exposure to the task, suggesting that learning might generate sensory substitution and/or the formation of sensory expectation. Finally, environmental conditions, such as shelter opacity, also affected shelter-seeking performance, sometimes in a negative direction. These results demonstrate that: (1) the integration of multiple sensory inputs in G. petersii can be synergistic, additive, redundant, or even inhibitory, and (2) multisensory processes also take into account the respective sensory cues; i.e. (a) the prevailing ambient light intensity and optical qualities of the object; (b) the geometry and strength of the DC potential emanating from the object ('battery effect'); and (c) the complex perceived impedance differential with the surrounding medium.

TI  - QUANTITATIVE FLUORESCENCE METHOD FOR CONTINUOUS MEASUREMENT OF DNA HYBRIDIZATION KINETICS USING A FLUORESCENT INTERCALATOR
T2  - ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY

KW  - BINDING
AB  - We present a quantitative fluorescence method for continuous measurement of DNA or RNA hybridization (including renaturation) kinetics using a fluorescent DNA intercalator, The method has high sensitivity and can be used with reaction volumes as small as 1 mu l and amounts of DNA around 1 ng, The method is based on the observations that (i) for the usual hybridization conditions, intercalators such as ethidium bromide bind (intercalate) to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) but not single-stranded DNA or RNA and (ii) there is a large increase in fluorescence intensity when intercalators such as ethidium bromide bind to dsDNA. In this application, the intercalator can be considered as a quantitative indicator of dsDNA concentration, When a small amount of intercalator is added to a hybridizing solution, the fluorescence intensity of the intercalator increases with increase in dsDNA, The hybridization reaction can thus be monitored by continuously recording fluorescence intensity vs time, Because the amount of intercalator bound to dsDNA is not necessarily proportional to dsDNA concentration, the time-dependent fluorescence intensity graph is not identical to the kinetic graph [dsDNA] vs t. However, the fluorescence intensity vs time graph can easily be converted to the true [dsDNA] vs t graph by means of an experimental calibration graph of fluorescence intensity vs [dsDNA], This calibration graph is obtained in a separate experiment using samples containing known amounts of dsDNA in the ethidium bromide buffer used in the kinetic measurement, We present results of experimental tests of the intercalator technique using ethidium bromide as an intercalator and DNA from Escherichia coli and lambda-phage and Poly(I)-Poly(C) RNA hybrids. These DNA and RNA samples have Cot(1/2) values that cover a range of 10(6). Our experimental results show that (i) the kinetics of hybridization are not significantly perturbed by the intercalator at concentrations where no more than 10% of the binding sites on DNA or RNA hybrids are occupied, (ii) the kinetic graphs obtained by the intercalator fluorescence method and corrected with the calibration graph agree with kinetic graphs obtained by optical absorbance measurements at 260 nm, and (iii) the intercalator technique can be used in the different salt environments often used to increase the velocity of the hybridization reaction and at the hybridization temperatures (35-75 degrees C) normally used to minimize nonspecific hybridization.

AB  - The development of information and communication technologies, Internet services availability, and constant broading of their options incentivize the network activity and the involvement of users in previously inaccessible "closed" spheres of action in particular, in politics. Nowadays everyone can take on the role of a political activist by keeping a blog or create content, commenting on news and posts. This kind of "amateur activity" is called "Political prosumption". In studies devoted on citizen journalism and political communication the concepts of "Politainment" and "Media prosumer" are used, for emphasizing of new political communication formats. The authors of the article think that prosumer agency is, first of all, productive labor, working practice. Therefore, it must be analyzed from the perspective of the production system. The purpose of this article is to analyze the forms of political activity using the author's system of prosumer agency indicators, based on Marxist theoretical and methodological principles and the categories. The main prosumer agency indicators (including the political blogosphere) are: 1) Individualized voluntary labor, aimed at creating a product for self-realization and personal consumption (information content), in the absence of economic coercion. 2) Availability of production means, providing independence from external conditions and actors. 3) Network model of labor organization. 4) Non-alienated personalized product, which has both individual and public benefits (high use value). The analysis showed that producers of online political content use their own or leased production means, have a certain autonomy in the organization of the labor process, strive for self-expression and self-realization, express their political identity by objectifying themselves in the product. These features allow us to consider online political activity as a prosumption. At the same time, the distribution and consumption of the information product on the network leads to its massification and depersonalization, which is contrary to the prosumtion essence. This ambivalence is due to the influence of Late capitalism/Platform capitalism, which creates new (hidden) forms of exploitation, appropriates the free time and experience of the individual, and monetizes his emotions and experiences. The thesis that online political activity is embedded in the market relations system of the consumer society is confirmed by examples related to the development of the Russian blogosphere.

AB  - Purpose Usually, the machinery in process plants is exposed to harsh and uncontrolled environmental conditions. Even after taking different types of preventive measures to detect and isolate the faults at the earliest possible opportunity becomes a complex decision-making process that often requires experts' opinions and judicious decisions. The purpose of this paper is to propose a framework to detect, isolate and to suggest appropriate maintenance tasks for large-scale complex machinery (i.e. gearboxes of steel processing plant) in a simplified and structured manner by utilizing the prior fault histories available with the organization in conjunction with case-based reasoning (CBR) approach. It is also demonstrated that the proposed framework can easily be implemented by using today's graphical user interface enabled tools such as Microsoft Visual Basic and similar. Design/methodology/approach CBR, an amalgamated domain of artificial intelligence and human cognitive process, has been applied to carry out the task of fault detection and isolation (FDI). Findings The equipment failure history and actions taken along with the pertinent health indicators are sufficient to detect and isolate the existing fault(s) and to suggest proper maintenance actions to minimize associated losses. The complex decision-making process of maintaining such equipment can exploit the principle of CBR and overcome the limitations of the techniques such as artificial neural networks and expert systems. The proposed CBR-based framework is able to provide inference with minimum or even with some missing information to take appropriate actions. This proposed framework would alleviate from the frequent requirement of expert's interventions and in-depth knowledge of various analysis techniques expected to be known to process engineers. Originality/value The CBR approach has demonstrated its usefulness in many areas of practical applications. The authors perceive its application potentiality to FDI with suggested maintenance actions to alleviate an end-user from the frequent requirement of an expert for diagnosis or inference. The proposed framework can serve as a useful tool/aid to the process engineers to detect and isolate the fault of large-scale complex machinery with suggested actions in a simplified way.

AB  - This work evaluates the potential of Adesmia atacamensis, an endemic species from the North of Chile, in phytoremediation processes of copper mining tailings. The selection of this species was based on the fact that its presence was found in 4 copper mining companies that are close to each other, its endemic quality, and its great capacity to adapt to the adverse climatic conditions of the sector of the project, characterized by having a semi-arid climate. In the experiment, the concentrations of 5 metals of environmental connotation for the country's mining were measured: Cu, Fe, Cd, Pb, and Zn; however, given the small concentrations in Cd, these could not be measured by the team. The applied experimental design quantified the variation of bioconcentration and translocation factors (BCF and TF) for the following treatments: (1) tailing control without amendment (T0), (2) tailing plus 4% CaCO3 + 3% vermicompost (VC), and (3) tailing + 8% CaCO3 + 6% VC. In addition, for treatments T1 and T2 (T0 was not considered as it is the control treatment), the following levels of mycorrhiza were considered: 0, 10, 15, and 20 gm(-2). The Baker and Brooks criteria and the BCF were used to evaluate the species as hyperaccumulators. Regarding the first criterion, high concentrations of copper were found in the shoots (shoots) of the specimens, which generally exceeded 1000 mg kg(-1), with an average of 1513 mg kg(-1), which allowed classifying the species as a copper hyperaccumulator; however, when compared with the BCF criterion, given that all the values were less than 1, they indicated that the species was an excluder of all the evaluated metals. Given the high concentrations of metals in the tailings, in this work, the plant has been considered as a hyperaccumulator of copper. Another indicator was the TF, which, for all experiments, resulted in a value greater than 1 for Fe, Pb, and Zn, which shows that A atacamensis translocates effectively these metals from the roots toward the aerial part and, therefore, presents the potential to accumulate metals in the aerial part. Regarding the treatments carried out, no significant impact was detected.

AB  - Forests in mountain ecosystems provide a diversity of services and goods in mountain landscapes, and the immediate utility of the forest to upstream residents must be balanced with the insurance forests provide for downstream residents in the form of, especially, the services of water regulation and soil stabilization. Little empirical data exist for Bhutan that confirm a causal link between upstream forest use and downstream security. To help to fill this gap, we summarize the results of two literature reviews related to forest ecosystem services and human well-being, using the framework of Bhutan's Gross National Happiness (GNH). We report preliminary findings of three field-based assessments of forest ecosystem services on hillsides. We conducted an assessment of the perceptions of local residents about the forest ecosystem services in three distinct forest areas of Bhutan. The studies were carried out in high-altitude oak forests, forest management units (FMUs) in government reserve forests, and community plantations. We engaged villagers in focus group discussions and conducted key informant interviews. The strongest evidence in the literature for linkages between forests and GNH was found for the role forests play in socio-economic development and good governance, particularly through the community forestry program. Regulating services of forests were cited as crucial to several aspects of human well-being, but little empirical evidence was provided. To local residents in the three study locations, the provisioning services of forests were highly ranked, as were water regulating services. At the plantation sites, residents felt that the new forests did improve soil stability and water provisioning services. Cultural services were identified but not highly prioritized. Awareness of forest ecosystem services was high among participants in the study, but understanding of the causal links between forest use and human well-being was mixed. Lack of direct evidence about causal pathways between upstream forest condition and downstream security leaves gaps in our knowledge and even perpetuates myths and misconceptions about the role that forests play. We encourage further research at multiple scales and using mixed methods to test hypotheses on the linkages between forests and human well-being in mountain landscapes.

AB  - In the framework of the model for surfactant clusterization description at the air/liquid and liquid/liquid interfaces proposed earlier (Vysotsky et al. J. Phys. Chem. B, 2015,119 (7), 3281-3296) and based on the quantum chemical semi -empirical PM3 method the structural and thermodynamic parameters of the formation of 1-(N-alkyl)-imidazole monolayers with alkyl chain lengths of 6-16 carbon atoms at the air/water interface are calculated. The model allows the calculation of the thermodynamic parameters (enthalpy, entropy and the Gibbs' energy) of monomers, clusters and monolayers at the interface between two liquids or between the air and liquid phases. To obtain such results one needs to calculate the corresponding thermodynamic parameters for both adjacent phases within the semi -empirical PM3 method (in the frameworks of the COSMO procedure), then to calculate the increments from the different types of the pairwise interactions and, with the help of the additive scheme, to calculate the required parameters. It has been shown that 1-(n-alkyl)-imidazole forms monolayers with hexagonal and oblique unit cells normal conditions. The parameters of the unit cell are calculated for each of these monolayers: 4.6 angstrom and 7.2 angstrom (the angle gamma between the sides of the unit cell is equal to 62 degrees) for the hexagonal unit cells and 4.6 angstrom and 4.6 angstrom (gamma = 80 degrees) for the oblique unit cells. Enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs' energy for small clusters (dimers-hexamers), representing the structural elements of the investigated monolayers, are calculated. The probable way of the clusterization process is proposed on the basis of these parameters. In the framework of the model the thermodynamic functions of the monolayer formation are calculated. These results indicate that for both types of the monolayers (with oblique and hexagonal unit cells) spontaneous clusterization is possible when the alkyl chain length is >= 14-15 carbon atoms.

AB  - Trace element abundances in three indicator minerals (corundum, chrysoberyl, and zircon grains) from the western Mamfe gem placers, as determined by LA-ICP-MS analytical techniques, are shown to be sensitive to their crystallization conditions and source rock types.
   Corundum is dominantly composed of Al (standardized at 529,300 ppm), Fe (2496-12,899 ppm), and Ti (46-7070 ppm). Among element ratios, Fe/Mg (73-1107), Fe/Ti (0.5-245.0), Ti/Mg (1-175), and Ga/Mg (4-90) are generally higher whereas, Cr/Ga (<0.072) is low. The Fe (<= 12,899), Ga (<= 398), Mg (2-62), Cr (1.1-33.0), and V (3.0-93.0) contents (in ppm) mostly typify corundum grains formed in magmatic rocks, although some are metamorphic affiliated. A very higher Ti and significantly low Ga, Ta and Nb contents in some blue grains, suggest interesting concentrations of those high-tech metals in their source rocks.
   Chrysoberyl is dominantly composed of Al (standardized at 425,000 ppm) and Be (62701 64371 ppm). Iron (7605-9225 ppm), Sn (502-3394 ppm), and Ti (33-2251 ppm) contents are high, whereas Ga (333-608 ppm), Ta (<456.0 ppm), and Nb (<3.0 ppm) are significantly low. The high (Be and Sn) and significantly low Ga-Rb abundances, and Ta > Nb in the western Mamfe chrysoberyls show that they were crystallized in granitic pegmatites, with some of those source rocks being enriched in Ta and Sn.
   Zirconium oxide (ZrO2: standardized at 66.1 wt.%)) is the only major oxide in analysed coarse-grained zircons. Within the minor elementary suites: Hf (4576-12,565 ppm) and Y (48-2805 ppm) contents are significantly high. The trace element suites include: Th (7-1565 ppm), U (13-687 ppm), and FREE (50 2161 ppm), whose values are significantly low. The (Yb/Sm)(N), Ce/Ce*, and Eu/Eu* anomalies range from 1.0 to 227.0, 0 to 308, and 0.08 to 1.7 respectively. They are Hf-Y-HREE enriched and depleted zircons mainly crystallized in magmatic oxidized environments. They were mainly sorted from granitoids, syenites and kimberlites. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Tropical climate dynamics play a major role in the global climate system. Precipitation patterns in the Serra do Espinhaco Meridional (Minas Gerais, Brazil) are influenced by both the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ) and the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). This makes the area important for the interpretation of climate dynamics. The composition of the Holocene Pau de Fruta peat deposit was analysed using pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC-MS). Molecular records agreed well with delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotopes, C content and mineral content, and pollen records. Changes in peatland plant species composition and fire occurrence indicated several wet and dry periods for the Pau de Fruta peatland during the Holocene; from the beginning of the Holocene to 7400 cal yr BP (phase I; dry and cold), from 7400 to 4200 cal yr BP (phase II; wet and warm), from 4200 to 1000 cal yr BP (phase III; dry and warm), from 1000 to 400 cal yrBP (phase IV; wet and warm) and from 400 cal yr BP to the present (V). The hydrological shifts showed a chronology comparable with that described in other palaeoclimatic studies for central-eastern Brazil, indicating that local conditions agree with regional ones. Analytical Py of the peat deposit provided a multi-proxy record via the identification of specific markers for both peatland plants (vegetation) and charred material (fire), whereas the general chemistry provided information on the degree of decomposition of the organic matter. Molecular chemistry of the peat core sampled at high resolution provided insight into peatland C dynamics, which is important for the interpretation of C sequestration in tropical peatlands. Molecular aspects accurately reflected local environmental change. The general agreement of Py data with pollen and inorganic chemistry supports the use of the molecular approach, because it provides local proxy indicators for peatlands, avoiding a mixture of local and regional signals.

AB  - The Holocene hydrological changes of fen peatland in northern Mongolia were reconstructed using diatom fossils with an aid of Sphagnum leaf fossils. Analyses were conducted on three cores taken across the basin and reconstructed water environments were compared to find basin-wide hydrological changes and climate anomalies. The peatland has been covered by sedges during most of its 10 thousand years history, but all cores showed common peatland hydrosere processes from fluvial environment in the early Holocene period, shallow marsh to present acidic fen peatland. The establishment of fen peatland at 6.8-6.4 cal ka BP was marked synchronously by the shift of diatom and Sphagnum taxa assemblages and this period was inferred as the onset of the mid-Holocene dry climate which is widely observed around Mongolia. The dry environment lasted until around 2.8 cal ka BP with a temporal wetter condition at 4.4-3.5 cal ka BP. Short term diatom trend shifts indicated temporal wetter environments at 8.7-8.4, 8.0-7.6, 2.4-2.1, 1.2-0.5 cal ka BP and a dry environment at 0.4-0.2 cal ka BP. These periods of hydrology changes were correlative with other studies in Mongolia and East Siberia, so they would represent climate-induced hydrological changes, and those regions might share the same response to long term insolation changes or global climate anomalies. However, disagreements of climate data even within northern Mongolian region suggest large influence of regional geography and the balance of evapotranspiration on climate behaviors as shown by recent dendrological paleoenvironment researches. Coherent differences of main taxa compositions between three cores were attributed to core site-specific local hydrology mainly in terms of relative wetness from wettest core site accompanied by abundant planktonic diatom taxa to driest site with acidic peat indicator taxa. Timings and manners of temporal diatom trend shifts were also largely different between cores suggesting significant difference in each core site sensitivity to basin-wide hydrology changes, confirming the necessity of using multiple cores and proxies in peatland sediments to detect climate-induced environmental changes.

AB  - QuestionsAre seed release and hydrochory of riparian plants coupled with seasonal flood pulses for a river with bimodal flows? What phenological hydrochore guilds are present? How representative of riparian vegetation are hydrochores? What is the role of hydrochory in riparian plant community composition in arid land streams?
   LocationVerde River, central Arizona, USA.
   MethodsWe recorded phenology of flowering and primary seed dispersal monthly for >100 riparian plant species, seined hydrochores 12 times during the growing season, sampled the extant plant community, and collected soil seed bank samples. Emergence of seedlings from hydrochore and soil samples was monitored for 1yr in a greenhouse. Plant species were classified as to wetland indicator status and assessed for traits including life span, growth form and seed mass.
   ResultsFlowering and primary seed dispersal at the community level was bimodal for dryland species but more constant through time for wetland species. Numbers and richness of wetland hydrochores were high during the three floods that occurred in the atypical study year, while dryland species pulsed during a single flood. Three of 56 hydrochore taxa were vernal flood specialists, characterized by a spring hydrochore pulse during their period of seed release, and one was associated with summer floods. Another six were phenological generalists, with hydrochores constant or semi-constant through time (including before and after primary dispersal) and persistent soil seed banks. Hydrochorous species spanned a wide range of traits, but overall had smaller seeds and higher wetland affinity than extant riparian vegetation.
   ConclusionsAs with other regions, hydrochory in dryland rivers is governed by the individual and combined influences of extrinsic factors, such as seasonal flow patterns and hydraulics, and intrinsic factors, such as timing of seed release and seed traits. Floods at different times during the season disperse distinct guilds, emphasizing the importance of flow variability for structuring riparian plant communities. Identifying temporal flood specialists and flood generalists is important, both for informing environmental flow regimes and for understanding patterns of plant distribution. The phenological dispersal plasticity of the generalist hydrochore species allows for adaptability to varying flow conditions and likely contributes to their broad geographic distributions.

AB  - In many parts of the world, plantations make up a considerable proportion of the total forest area. In such regions, the identification of high biodiversity value stands and of management practices to enhance biodiversity is essential if the goals of Sustainable Forest Management are to be achieved. Since complete biodiversity assessments are rarely possible, efforts have been increasingly focussed on the use of indicators. Of particular interest are indicators applicable to individual stands that require no specialist taxonomic or technical knowledge to assess. Candidate biodiversity indicators had been identified in a previous study using data from Irish Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) plantations but had yet to be tested on independent data. In the present study, the provisional indicators for vascular plant, bryophyte, spider and bird diversity were tested on data from Irish Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), oak (Quercus petraea/Quercus robur), Sitka spruce and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) plantations. Conifer canopy cover was confirmed as an important biodiversity indicator, due to its influence on below-canopy microclimatic and structural conditions. Bryophyte species richness was higher in relatively high canopy cover plantations on poorly drained soils, while bird species richness was higher in more open plantations with high shrub cover. Coarse woody debris was an important substrate for forest-associated bryophytes, with higher species richness at higher volumes of deadwood. Both proximity to old woodland and stand age were confirmed as positive indicators for forest-associated vascular plants. This is related to dispersal limitation in these species, with nearby woodlands acting as important seed sources and colonisation increasing with time. Stand age was also confirmed as a positive indicator for forest-associated spiders and is related to the development of suitable habitat as the plantation matures. All of the confirmed indicators can be assessed without need for specialist knowledge, are ecologically meaningful and applicable to a range of forests managed under a clearfelling system. They can be used to assess the potential value of stands for the taxonomic groups to which they apply, as well as giving insights into management practices to enhance diversity in these groups.

AB  - A very serious effort to modernize irrigation systems is being made in Spain, to reduce water and energy losses in an environmentally sustainable way. This is expensive and it is important that the new irrigation systems work properly over a long period. The systems have been designed taking into account historical evapotranspiration (ET) averages during the months of maximum demand, as well as the crop-specific ET values (Kc coefficients) of typical crops. However, the increase in ET rates due to global warming could mean that the capacity of these new and expensive irrigation systems to fulfil the crop water requirements may be exceeded in the near future. However, the expected increase in CO, concentration could diminish crop transpiration rates for similar water demands from the atmosphere, thereby reducing irrigation requirements. A methodology was developed in order to estimate crop water requirements under climate change conditions. The reliability of a new irrigation system designed in Valladolid, Northern Spain was tested. The regionalized climate change scenarios for Valladolid, provided by the National Institute of Meteorology, were used for the periods 2011-40, 2041-70 and 2071-2100 and the A2 and B2 emission scenarios were considered using the ECHAM and coupled general circulation model (CGCM) global circulation models. A historical series of daily meteorological data for Valladolid was used to generate statistical ET distributions through the LARS-WG generator. Simulations considered each of the above periods, global circulation models (GCM) and emission scenarios. Furthermore, the Kc of the typical irrigated crops of the zone (maize, potato and sugar beet) were reduced for each period, GCM and emission scenario according to the relationships between CO2 concentrations and transpiration obtained by Kruijt et al. (2008). The results indicated that, on average, historical ET rates provide a sufficiently robust indicator to enable estimations of the crop ET in the future, particularly considering the CO2 effect in reducing crop transpiration. However, ET variability is significantly increased after 2040, especially for the A2 emission scenario. The results show that ET variability rather than global increase is the most serious risk that current irrigation systems must face in the near future in Northern Spain, as consequence of climate change. Such variability should be included in irrigation designs.

AB  - Conceptual geological models of industrial and mining megasites ire all essential task of groundwater investigations as well as environmental risk assessment studies. Therefore, the conceptualization process of the structural geological model has depended oil the development of,I set of 2D cross-sections to portray a 3D picture of groundwater flow. This attempt always includes some simplifications that require, only to some extent, the true 3D situation of heterogeneous aquifers. Consequently, the modelled predictions of the path flow and transport conditions of contaminated groundwater are not satisfying in terms of a flow-path and risk based modelling approach. A more structured approach to develop the hydrogeological framework for the conceptual model is advocated, using different 3D geological modelling software packages to assemble the data, working in three dimensions and using this platform for subsequent groundwater flow modelling. Attention is given to the capability of different 3D modelling approaches, indicated by geostatistically based versus constructive cross-section based interpolations of complex sedimentary successions, that are compared in their results and suitability for subsequent hydrogeological modelling requirements.
   The paper describes the results, in high-resolution 3D modelling, of the complex geological environment of the Bitterfeld/Wolfen megasite in the eastern part of Germany. Identification, assessment, and remediation of large-scale groundwater contamination require a detailed knowledge of the heterogeneous geological structure to predict the fate and pathways of contaminants and their potential interaction with, e.g., surface water. An area of 16 kill 2 of the model area of the Bitterfeld/Wolfen area was chosen to transfer the complex structural geological setting. The subsurface geology could be assigned to 31 lithostratigraphic units and depicted using a 10 x 10m GIS grid. This constructive and "knowledge-driven" 3D modelling allows the prediction of vertical and horizontal Sections, Visualization purposes, volumetric calculations of distinct sedimentary units, GIS applications, and the use of the detailed digital information within the subsequent flow and transport groundwater modelling. The high-resolution digital 3D model improves the hydrogeological modelling results. It is considered a basic requirement for groundwater modelling and investigations on environmental risk and impact assessment by fate and pathway exposure route analysis of the complex geological and groundwater situations.

AB  - In Hong Kong, discharges of domestic and industrial wastewaters and disposal of contaminated muds into coastal waters have resulted in high levels of persistent organic contaminants in the water column, biota and bottom sediments. Although the acute toxicity of effluents has been tested by government regulators using mortality-based bioassays, the sublethal effects of many of the pollutants, Including environmental carcinogens, have not been well studied. The objective of the present work was to examine the efficiency and efficacy of using: (1) DNA strand breaks (comet assay and alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis assay); (2) oxidative DNA damage (levels of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine in cellular DNA) and (3) micronuclei (MN) formation as early warning toxicological indicators of potential environmental carcinogen exposure. Green-lipped mussels (Perna viridis) were transplanted to study sites and retrieved after 4, 8, 12, 16 and 30 days. The bioaccumulation of organic pollutants, including the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organochlorine pesticides (OC pesticides) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was observed, and compared with biomarker assays. Some significant dose- and time-dependent inductions of the genotoxic biomarkers, including 8-OHdG, DNA strand breaks and micronuclei were observed. In particular, several very strong (r > 0.9) and significantly positive relationships were found at all sites during days 0-12. In addition, significant strong relationships between certain organic contaminants (carcinogenic PAHs and 4 common OC pesticides) and micronuclei were detected at the polluted sites, Tsim Sha Tsui and Sai Wan Ho. The results suggest that the use of micronuclei as a biomarker is potentially effective, especially at the more polluted sites. Nonetheless, further research is required to validate their effectiveness under varying field conditions, especially to elucidate responses under lower contaminant loads, interactions between the environmental and physiological factors affecting organisms in differing coastal environments, and changes in biotransformation and DNA repair Enzymes in test organisms.

AB  - A field validation study of two sediment-amphipod toxicity tests as conducted using sediment samples collected subtidally in the vicinity, of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-contaminated Superfund site in Elliott Bay (WA, USA). Sediment samples were collected at 30 stations with a 0.1 m(2) grab from which subsamples were taken for sediment toxicity testing and geochemical and macrofaunal analyses. Standard 10-d sediment-amphipod toxicity tests were conducted with Rhepoxynius abronius and Leptocheirus plumalosus, Sediments Acre analyzed for 33 PAHs, pentachlorophenol. polychlorinated biphenyls, acid-volatile sulfide, simultaneously extracted metals (Cd, Cu, Zn, Ph, Ni), total organic carbon, and grain size. Sediment temperature. oxygen-reduction potential, water depth. and interstitial water salinity were also measured. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, quantified as total PAH toxic units (TU,,), were confirmed to be an important common causal agent of the changes in the two toxicity test (17, survival R. abronius, % survival L. plumulosus) and five macrofaunal community (number of species, S; numerical abundance, A; total biomass, B; Swartz's dominance index. SDI; Brillouin's index, H) endpoints. Two other macrofaunal community metrics (the complement of Simpson's index. I - SI, and McIntosh'.,, index, MI) %Acre less sensitive to TUP H than the two toxicity test endpoints. The sensitivities of R. abronius and L. plumulosus to TUPAH were statistically indistinguishable. Field validations were conducted by testing the association between or among each toxicity test endpoint. each of seven macrotaunal community metrics (S, A, B, SDl, H, 1 - SI, W), and TUPAH by (1) Spearman's coefficient of rank correlation, (2) Kendall's coefficient of concordance, (3) G tests of independence, and (4) regression analysis. Some field validations based on multivariable tests of association (e.g., points 2 and 3) among toxicity test, field, and stressor endpoints produced false positive results. Both toxicity test endpoints were validated as indicators of changes in S, A, SDI, and H by all the methods tested. The resolution power of the relationships between the laboratory toxicity test and macrofaunal field endpoints was low (! - three classes) but sufficient to discriminate ecologically important effects. We conclude that standard sediment-amphipod toxicity tests are ecologically relevant and that, under the proper conditions, their results can be used for lab-to-field extrapolation.

AB  - Broad bean (Vicia faba L.) plants were exposed, in duplicate controlled environment chambers, to charcoal/Purafil(R)-filtered air (CFA-grown plants) or to 75 nmol mol(-1) ozone (O-3) for 7 h d(-1) (O-3-grown plants) for 28 d, and then exposed to 150 nmol mol(-1) O-3 for 8 h. The concentration of ascorbate (ASC) was determined in leaf extracellular washing fluid (apoplast) and in the residual leaf tissue (symplast) after 0, 4 and 8 h acute fumigation, and after a 16 h 'recovery' period in CFA. Changes in stomatal conductance were measured in vivo in order to model pollutant uptake, while the light-saturated rate of CO2 assimilation (A(sat)) was recorded as an indicator of O-3-induced intracellular damage. Measurements of A(sat) revealed enhanced tolerance to 150 nmol mol(-1) O-3 in plants pre-exposed to the pollutant compared with equivalent plants grown in CFA, consistent with the observed reduction in pollutant uptake due to lower stomatal conductance. The concentration of ASC in the leaf apoplast (ASC(apo)) declined upon O-3-treatment in both CFA- and O-3-grown plants, consistent with the oxidation of ASC(apo) under O-3-stress, Furthermore, the decline in ASC(apo) was reversible in O-3-grown plants after a 16 h 'recovery' period, but not in plants grown in CFA. No significant change in the level and/or redox state of ASC in the symplast (ASC(symp)) was observed in plants exposed to 150 nmol mol(-1) O-3, and there was no difference in the constitutive level of ASC(symp) between CFA- and O-3-grown plants. Model calculations indicated that the reaction of O-3 with ASC(apo) in the leaves of Vicia faba is potentially sufficient: to intercept a substantial proportion (30-40%) of the O-3 entering the plant under environmentally-relevant conditions. The potential role of apoplastic ASC in mediating the tolerance of leaves to O-3 is discussed.

AB  - Tropical marginal seas host important sedimentary archives that may be exploited to reveal past changes in continental erosion, chemical weathering, and ocean dynamics. However, these records can be challenging to interpret due to the complex interactions between climate and particulate transport across ocean margins. For the southern South China Sea over the last 90 Kyr, we observe a contrasting temporal relationship between the deposition of clay minerals and magnetic minerals, which were associated with two different hydrodynamic modes. Fine-grained clay minerals can be carried in suspension by ocean currents, leading to a rapid response to regional climate-driven inputs. In contrast, changes in magnetic mineralogy were linked to glacial-interglacial sea level variability, from which we infer a control by bedload transport and resuspension. Overall, this study indicates that the transfer pathways and mechanisms imparted by varying hydrodynamic conditions exert a substantial influence on the distribution of terrigenous material in continental margin sediments.
   Plain Language Summary Sediments that accumulate in the ocean along continental margins contain the minerals that were eroded and transported by rivers on the nearby land masses. Past changes in the composition of such sediments can be used to reconstruct the history of physical erosion and chemical weathering on the continents, but can also be affected by ocean dynamics over orbital and millennial timescales. Here, clay mineralogy, sediment grain size, and rock magnetic signatures are measured in a core from the continental slope of the southern South China Sea, spanning the last 90 thousand years. Differences between the clay mineral and magnetic records, which are linked to finer and coarser sediment fractions respectively, indicate that specific mechanisms and timescales influenced sediment transport to the core site. This depositional framework must be considered when interpreting the timing of changes in weathering and erosion proxies hosted in sediment records from marginal seas. Specifically, fine-grained clay minerals may reveal a rapid response to continental weathering changes, whereas the magnetic records are influenced by the transport of denser coarser-grained minerals under the influence of sea level change. In addition, this framework could potentially serve as an indicator of past sea level change on wide continental shelves.

AB  - Purpose of the study is to shed light on the role of psychophysiology in the creative process, namely, the style corrections connected with pathological changes in the artist's organism, deviating from empirical-descriptive methods. Theoretical basis of the study implies the interpretation of the notions style and disease not in their narrow professional limitation but from the standpoint of expanding the parameters of these concepts to philosophical dimensions. Based on the principle of analogy, the research findings prove that non-mimetic creative process ("pure" action) manifests itself exclusively in connection with a human from a bodily viewpoint through anthropological mimesis, which can program the propensity to certain capabilities of the individual organism (both psychophysiological and in its creative and stylistic manifestations). C. G. Jung was the first who pointed to the productivity of this method in his work "Theoretical Reflections on the Nature of the Psyche". The creativity phenomenon (and its most specific feature - style) reflects not only "pure" psychology and the intellectual and spiritual component but also its relation to the artist as a physical being. It, outside its belonging to and being conditioned by transcendent factors, includes a quantitative aspect related to the moment of intensity. The disease (quantitative-intensive indicator) acts to some extent as a stimulator of the production/change of aesthetic enzyme ("The Obsessed" by Lesia Ukrainka) In this context, the dialectic method is also effective because the subject of study cannot be comprehensively argued using naturalistic approaches only and requires (according to A. Losev) a semantic explanation too. The essence of it is the logic of contradictions. In this case, the antinomy of matter-spirit plays a conceptual role in the projection on the plane of word-formation. Originality of the research findings is in the expansion of the causal relationship range of the creative process, namely the inclusion of the factor of psycho-physiological pathology into the system artist-work. This factor performs important stylistic functions. Conclusions. In contrast to scientific studies, where 1) style is analyzed separately (mostly in terms of text landscape description) and 2) the figure of the artist (mainly - in the parameters of empiricism, rarely - in psychoanalytic perspective), this study argues the need to correlate these issues, taking them beyond descriptiveness to avoid schematics and one-dimensionality.

AB  - The increase of waste from electric and electronic equipment has pushed the research towards the development of high sustainability treatments for their exploitation. The end-of-life printed circuit boards (PCBs) represent one of the most significant waste in this class. The interest for these scraps is due to the high Cu and Zn content, with concentrations around 25% and 2% respectively, combined with further precious metals (e.g. Au, Ag, Pd). Currently, the most common approaches developed for PCBs recycling include pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical treatments. On the other hand, biohydrometallurgical strategies are gaining increasing prominence, for the possibility to decrease both the environmental and the economic costs. Nevertheless, these techniques show the main limit due to the possibility to treat low quantities of waste, which makes unsustainable the further scale-up. To overcome this criticality, the present paper introduces an innovative bioleaching process carried out by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (At. ferrooxidans) and Leptospirillum ferrooxidans (L. ferrooxidans). The developed technology allows to reach high PCB concentration, up to 5% (w/v), thanks to a high efficiency two-step design, able to reduce the metal toxicity on the bacteria metabolism. The treatment uses the ferric iron generated by bacterial oxidation, as oxidant, to leach Cu and Zn from PCBs. The possibility to overcome the solid concentration criticality is combined with high yield of 94% and 70% for Cu and Zn, respectively. The best selected conditions involve the At. ferrooxidans bacteria use at: 30 degrees C, solid concentration of 5% (w/v), 10 g/L of Fe2+, time of treatment 9 days. The experimental results are further enhanced by the carbon footprint assessment which proved the environmental advantage, compared to both the reference chemical treatment through ferric iron and literature processes (hydrometallurgical and bioleaching approaches). The analysis explained as the PCBs concentration in the solution allows to decrease the bioreactor size with the consequent reduction of energy and raw material demand. This benefit can be translated into a 4 times reduction of the CO2-eq./kg treated PCB emissions, compared to the best bioleaching processes, reported in the literature.

AB  - Some otherwise non-aggressive dogs may display fear-induced aggression under stressful conditions. Admittance to an animal shelter is a stressful experience for dogs, and aggression is often used as a criterion by shelters for precluding opportunities for adoption. We, therefore, examined whether a program of enrichment centered around a form of human interaction known to reduce the stress of shelter dogs would also reduce the aggression of fearful dogs and improve their general welfare. Fearful dogs displaying signs of aggression, as well as dogs displaying neither fear nor aggression, either did or did not receive 30 min a day of human interaction in a secluded room for approximately the first 5 days in a shelter. We then determined the number of enriched and non-enriched fearful and non-fearful dogs that passed a standard test of dog aggression as typically implemented in this shelter to determine eligibility for adoption. We also examined the affective state of dogs in a test of cognitive bias. In two separate experiments, we found that most fearful dogs without enrichment failed the aggression test, whereas most fearful dogs undergoing enrichment completed this assessment successfully (P < 0.001 in each experiment). In contrast, nearly all non-fearful dogs passed the aggression test regardless of enrichment experience. In cognitive bias testing, enrichment reduced the latency at which fearful dogs approached two locations at which the likelihood of reinforcement was ambiguous, a measure of increased positive expectancy (P '' s < 0.01). Unexpectedly non-fearful dogs receiving enrichment approached one of the ambiguous locations more slowly than non-enriched controls (P < 0.05), a finding that might be an artifact of the testing procedures used here. While the generality of the results needs to be tested in other populations and shelter environments, the findings: 1) document the vulnerability of dogs exhibiting fear-induced aggression in a shelter environment; 2) demonstrate the ability of an enrichment program focusing on human interaction to reduce aggressiveness in these dogs and thereby increase their chances of being offered for adoption; and, 3) indicate a more-general outcome of the enrichment procedure on the affective state of fearful dogs.

AB  - Aim Many studies use differences among plant populations to infer future plant responses, but these predictions will provide meaningful insights only if patterns of plasticity among populations are similar (i.e., in the absence of population-by-environment interaction, P x E). In this study, we tested whether P x E is considered in climate change studies. Specifically, we evaluated whether population differentiation varies across environments and whether P x E is determined by aspects of the study system and experimental design. Location Global. Methods We conducted a literature search in the Thomson Reuters Web of Science database to identify studies assessing population differentiation in a climate change context. We quantified the occurrence of P x E and performed a meta-analysis to calculate the percentage of traits showing P x E in the study cases. Results We identified 309 study cases (from 237 published articles) assessing population differentiation in 172 plant species, of which 64% included more than one test environment and tested P x E. In 77% of these studies, P x E was significant for at least one functional trait. The overall proportion of traits showing P x E was 33.4% (95% confidence interval 27.7-39.3). These results were generally consistent across life-forms, ecoregions and type of experiment. Furthermore, population differentiation varied across test environments in 76% of cases. The overall proportion of traits showing environment-dependent population differentiation was 53.7% (95% confidence interval 37.9-69.3). Conclusions Our findings revealed that differences in phenotypic plasticity among populations are common but are usually neglected in order to forecast population responses to climate change. Future studies should assess population differentiation in many test environments (accounting for P x E) that realistically reflect future environmental conditions, assessing climate change drivers that are rarely considered (e.g., multifactor experiments incorporating higher CO2 levels). Our review also revealed the predominant focus of population studies on trees from temperate climates, identifying underexplored life-forms (shrubs, annuals), phylogenetic groups (ferns, ancient gymnosperms) and ecoregions (tropical, arctic) that should receive more attention in future.

AB  - The phrase form and function was established in architecture and biology and refers to the idea that form and functionality are closely correlated, influence each other, and co-evolve. We suggest transferring this idea to hydrological systems to separate and analyze their two main characteristics: their form, which is equivalent to the spatial structure and static properties, and their function, equivalent to internal responses and hydrological behavior. While this approach is not particularly new to hydrological field research, we want to employ this concept to explicitly pursue the question of what information is most advantageous to understand a hydrological system. We applied this concept to subsurface flow within a hillslope, with a methodological focus on function: we conducted observations during a natural storm event and followed this with a hillslope-scale irrigation experiment. The results are used to infer hydrological processes of the monitored system. Based on these findings, the explanatory power and conclusiveness of the data are discussed. The measurements included basic hydrological monitoring methods, like piezometers, soil moisture, and discharge measurements. These were accompanied by isotope sampling and a novel application of 2-D time-lapse GPR (ground-penetrating radar). The main finding regarding the processes in the hillslope was that preferential flow paths were established quickly, despite unsaturated conditions. These flow paths also caused a detectable signal in the catchment response following a natural rainfall event, showing that these processes are relevant also at the catchment scale. Thus, we conclude that response observations (dynamics and patterns, i.e., indicators of function) were well suited to describing processes at the observational scale. Especially the use of 2-D time-lapse GPR measurements, providing detailed subsurface response patterns, as well as the combination of stream-centered and hillslope-centered approaches, allowed us to link processes and put them in a larger context. Transfer to other scales beyond observational scale and generalizations, however, rely on the knowledge of structures (form) and remain speculative. The complementary approach with a methodological focus on form (i.e., structure exploration) is presented and discussed in the companion paper by Jackisch et al. (2017).

AB  - Biofilters are becoming an increasingly popular treatment device for odors and other volatiles found at wastewater treatment plants. A seashell media based biofilter was installed in April 2011 at Lake Wildwood Wastewater Treatment Plant located in Penn Valley, California. It was sampled seasonally to examine its ability to treat odorous compounds found in the air above the anaerobic equalization basin at the front end of the plant and to examine the properties of the biofilter and its recirculating water system. The odor profile method sensory panels found mainly sulfide odors (rotten eggs and rotten vegetable) and some fecal odors. This proved to be a useful guidance tool for selecting the required types of chemical sampling. The predominant odorous compounds found were hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan and dimethyl sulfide. These compounds were effectively removed by the biofilter at greater than 99% removal efficiency therein reducing the chemical concentrations to below their odor thresholds. Aldehydes found in the biofilter were below odor thresholds but served as indicators of biological activity. Gas chromatography with mass spectrometry and gas chromatography with sensory detection showed the presence of dimethyl disulfide and dimethyl trisulfide as well, but barely above their respective odor thresholds. The neutrality of the pH of the recirculating water was variable depending on conditions in the biofilter, but a local neutral pH was found in the shells themselves. Other measurements of the recirculating water indicated that the majority of the bio-activity takes place in the first stage of the biofilter. All measurements performed suggest that this seashell biofilter is successful at removing odors found at Lake Wildwood. This study is an initial examination into the mechanism of the removal of odorous compounds in a seashell biofilter.Implications:This paper presents a thorough examination of a seashell media biofilter, a sustainable treatment technology used to remove reduced sulfide compounds. The durable performance of the seashell biofilter ensures that odors will be adequately controlled, preventing odor nuisance to surrounding residences, which is an emerging problem faced by waste management facilities. The odor profile method technique used in this study can be applied in many situations by waste management facilities and regulatory air management organizations for source tracking in relation to prevention and management of odor complaints, respectively.

AB  - Occupancy and density of the epiphytic lichen L. pulmonaria were studied in the mountains of Uholka-Shyrokyi Luh (Ukraine), which include the largest primeval beech forest in Europe. The lichen occupancy was assessed on 314 plots laid out on a systematic grid. Additional data on population density were collected from 483 trees growing both, on and between these plots. The trees harbouring L. pulmonaria were distributed very sparsely within Uholka-Shyrokyi Luh, and occupy nearly 10 % of the studied perimeter. The generalized linear models showed that area of occupancy of L. pulmonaria was significantly influenced by altitude and canopy cover, whereas the species' density was explained by habitat types and slope exposition. Population density is higher at the timberline than in the interior forest or on lowland meadows. We found a bimodal altitudinal distribution of L. pulmonaria, with maxima below and above 900 m a.s.l., where it prefers forest stands with loose or scattered canopy. The preferred position of L. pulmonaria on host tree trunks depends on stand density and allows the species to get the necessary level of insolation also in shaded sites where it grows higher up on the trunk than in open stands. While L. pulmonaria occupied trees with various diameters, juvenile individuals are more frequent on small trees, but mature lichen individuals are predominantly found on trees of average or large sizes. Fertile individuals require specific environmental conditions, which are available at intermediate altitudes, related with sheltered light, and horizontal terraces on slopes with eastern exposition. In general, the primeval beech forest of Uholka-Shyrokyi Luh harbours a high percentage of juvenile thalli of L. pulmonaria, which lack vegetative propagules. Mature individuals have a low frequency of fruit bodies and reproduce mainly with vegetative diaspores. We interpret this as an indication of a currently growing population of L. pulmonaria within the area. We hypothesize that transboundary air pollution has decreased the lichens' population frequency and density and has altered the ratio of developmental stages in L. pulmonaria during earlier decades.

AB  - Forests provide humankind with essential raw materials and the demand for these materials is increasing. Further expanding forestry into unmanaged forests is environmentally costly and increasing forest area via plantations will not immediately lead to increased wood supply. Thus, just like in agriculture, forestry faces the challenge how to intensify forest management in existing production forests in sustainable ways. Yet, our current understanding of what determines forest management intensity is weak, particularly at broad scales, and this makes it difficult to assess the environmental and social trade-offs of intensification. Here, we analyse spatial patterns of forest harvesting intensity as one indicator for forest management intensity across Europe, a region where most forests suitable for production are already in use and where future intensification is likely. To measure forest harvesting intensity, we related harvested timber volumes to net annual increment for the period 2000-2010. We used boosted regression trees to analyse the spatial determinants of forest harvesting intensity using a comprehensive set of biophysical and socioeconomic explanatory variables. Our results show that forest harvesting intensity varied markedly across Europe and harvested timber volumes were well below the increment in most regions. Harvesting intensity was especially high in southern Finland, southern Sweden, southwestern France, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic. The spatial patterns of forest harvesting intensity were well explained by forest-resource related variables (i.e., the share of plantation species, growing stock, forest cover), site conditions (i.e., topography, accessibility), and country-specific characteristics, whereas socioeconomic variables were less important. We also found the relationship between forest harvesting intensity and some of its predictors (e.g., share of plantation species, accessibility) to be strongly non-linear and characterised by thresholds. In summary, our study highlights candidate areas where potentials for sustainably intensifying timber production may exist. Our analyses of the spatial determinants of harvesting intensity also provides concrete starting points for developing measures targeted at increasing regional wood supply from forests or lowering harvest pressure in regions where forests are heavily used. Finally, our study emphasises the importance for systems' understanding for designing and implementing effective sustainable forest management policies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nitrogen fertilizer application rates in intensive vegetable production in (South) East Asia have increased exponentially over the past decades, including in the low income countries. While there have been reports of excessive N inputs from e. g. Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia, very little quantitative knowledge exists on the real extent of the problem. We calculated N balances and agronomic N use efficiencies (ANUE) for a number of typical intensive vegetable rotations in the highlands of Central Java, Indonesia, on fertile Andisols, both for individual cropping cycles (short term) as for 6 consecutive cropping cycles (long term). This was done for farmers practice (FP) treatments, and improved practice (IP) treatments, where N fertilization was significantly reduced. Yields were in general similar in FP and IP, but tended to be slightly higher in IP, with some significant differences. Both the short and long term N balances were always positive and usually very high. Short term N balances ranged from 9 to 559 kg N ha(-1) and 219 to 885 kg N ha(-1) in IP and FP, respectively, while short term ANUE ranged from 8 to 67 and 4 to 39% in IP and FP, respectively. Long term N balances ranged from 627 to 1,885 kg N ha(-1) and 962 to 3,808 kg N ha(-1) in IP and FP, respectively, indicating a massive excess of N supply especially in FP. N balances can thus be drastically reduced with no negative impacts on yield, on the contrary. Soil mineral N in the 0-25 cm layer was in general not very high (6.5-38.8 mg N kg(-1) soil) and not systematically different between IP and FP, probably as a result of excessive NO3- leaching. Therefore, topsoil mineral N seems to have only limited indicator value under these conditions. Because denitrification losses in these soils are not very high, most N in excess of the crop requirements will be lost by leaching. Quantitative data on N balances as obtained here may be used to sensitize policy makers and farmers about the threat of current farming practices to the environment, and to improve economic performance.

AB  - Restoration of diverse semi-natural grasslands is potentially limited by high availability of soil phosphorus (P). Successful targeting of restoration effort requires a knowledge of plant community tolerances to soil P availability. Many extraction methods for P availability have been developed but most are calibrated against the growth and P uptake of crop species grown in monoculture.
   To test which methods are most suitable for measuring available P in soils of mesotrophic grasslands, a bioassay experiment was undertaken to compare seven extraction methods with the growth and P uptake of grassland species. Five species were grown together on a soil treated to create a range of conditions of pH, mycorrhizal infection and P availability.
   Olsen P and Bray P were found to be significantly correlated with P uptake in plant growth across the range of soil treatments whilst ion exchange membrane P and resin P were significantly correlated with P uptake in plant growth in all but the calcareous soils. The acid extractions of Truog, acetic acid and EDTA-ammonium acetate were found to be less correlated with P uptake in plant growth. All extraction methods correlated more strongly with P uptake in the sterilised treatments than in those inoculated with mycorrhizal spores.
   The method of Olsen was therefore selected to analyse P availability in soils supporting a range of mesotrophic grassland communities from eleven sites across England. At each sampling location, the species composition of the vegetation was assessed and classified using the British National Vegetation Classification (NVC). Species-rich hay meadows across a range of alliances were found to occur on soils with low phosphorus availability. Species-poor communities, such as inundation grassland, were found to occur on soils with higher phosphorus availability. Pasture communities, of intermediate species richness, tended to occur on soils of intermediate phosphorus availability.
   Olsen's method of P extraction is recommended for analysing soils of areas identified for habitat creation; values of less than 10 mg kg(-1) will give the greatest potential for the restoration of species-rich mesotrophic grassland. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Spatial distributions and patchiness of dominant megafaunal invertebrates in deep-sea seep environments may indicate heterogeneities in the flux of reduced chemical compounds. At the Blake Ridge seep off South Carolina, USA, the invertebrate assemblage includes dense populations of live vesicomyid clams (an undescribed species) as well as extensive clam shell beds (i.e. dead clams). In the present study, we characterized clam parameters (density, size-frequency distribution, reproductive condition) in relation to sulfur chemistry (sulfide and sulfate concentrations and isotopic compositions, pyrite and elemental sulfur concentrations) and other sedimentary metrics (grain size, organic content). For clams > 5 mm, clam density was highest where the total dissolved sulfide concentration at 10 cm depth (Sigma H2S10cm) was 0.4 to 1.1 mmol l(-1); juvenile clams (< 5 mm) were most dense where Sigma H2S10cm was lowest. Clams were reproductively capable across a broad range of Sigma H2S10cm (0.1 to 6.4 mmol l(-1)), and females in the sampled populations displayed asynchronous gametogenesis. Sulfide concentrations in porewaters at the shell-sediment interface of cores from shell beds were high, 3.3 to 12.1 mmol l(-1), compared to < 1 mmol l(-1) sulfide concentrations at the clam-sediment interface in live clam beds. Concentration profiles for sulfide and sulfate in shell beds were typical of those expected where there is active microbial sulfate reduction. In clam beds, profiles of sulfide and sulfate concentrations were also consistent with rapid uptake of sulfide by the clams. Sulfate in shell beds was systematically enriched in 34 S relative to that in clam beds due to microbial fractionation during sulfate reduction, but in clam beds, sulfate delta S-34 matched that of seawater (similar to 20 parts per thousand). Residual sulfide values in clam and shell beds were correspondingly depleted in S-34. Based on porewater sulfide concentrations in shell beds at the time of sampling, we suggest that clam mortality may have been due to an abrupt increase in sulfide concentration and sulfide toxicity, but other alternatives cannot be eliminated.

AB  - A mesophilic enrichment culture of sulphate-reducing bacteria isolated from the water phase of a North Sea oil tank using oil from the same tank as sole source of carbon and energy specifically depletes certain CL-CS alkylbenzenes in crude oil during growth. The enrichment culture grows on oils of different origin and composition resulting in similar patterns of alkylbenzene depletion. Two pure cultures of sulphate-reducing bacteria, strain oXyS1 and mXyS1 which were isolated on o-xylene and m-xylene, respectively, also grow on crude oil. Strain oXyS1 preferentially depletes o-xylene and o-ethyltoluene while strain mXyS1 preferentially depletes In-xylene and m-ethyltoluene. Roth strains also utilize toluene. The degradative patterns of the pure cultures are complementary and their combination results in the degradative pattern of the enrichment culture. During growth of the enrichment culture and the pure strains on crude oil alkylated benzoic acids were the main metabolic products, which were isolated from the water phases of the incubation experiments. The patterns of alkylated benzoic acids produced by the pure cultures are again complementary with respect to the pattern observed for the enrichment culture. The spectrum of alkylated benzoic acids suggests that partial oxidation of alkylbenzenes, which do not support growth, takes place resulting in the formation of dead-end metabolites. Alkylphenylsuccinic and fumaric acids were produced in trace amounts only. The portion of alkylbenzenes remaining in crude oil becomes enriched in (13)C during growth of bacteria. From the data obtained in this study it can be estimated that the carbon isotopic fractionation of the initial reaction of alkylbenzene degradation by the present bacteria is between -26 and -33 parts per thousand. We suggest that the variability in alkylbenzene concentrations and their carbon isotopic signature together with the occurrence of alkylated benzoic acids may be used as a specific indicator of initial biodegradation of crude oils and fossil fuel products by sulphate-reducing bacteria in various environments.

AB  - Regular intra-tooth variations in the delta(18)O value of mammalian tooth enamel phosphate (delta(18)O(p)) have been considered a potential measure of seasonal changes in continental climate variables since they were first observed. In order to investigate this possibility in more detail, analyses were made of teeth from a number of mammalian herbivores (sheep, cattle, elk, and pigs) that lived over a wide range of geographic locations, ecological settings, and climatic conditions (Iowa, Florida, Wyoming, Iceland,. England, Croatia, and the Philippines). The lack of intra-tooth delta(18)O(p) variations in teeth of cattle that were given tap water to drink provides strong evidence that the underlying cause of observed intra-tooth variations is primarily a change in the isotopic composition of ingested water. In concert with this interpretation, the range of intra-tooth delta(18)O(p) values and their absolute values from each locality mirror observed differences in the range and absolute delta(18)O values of local precipitation (delta(18)O(pt)) and in climate variables. Thus intra-tooth delta(18)O(p) values can indeed be considered a qualitative measure of seasonal climate change in continental settings. Quantitative use of intra-tooth delta(18)O(p) values as a climate proxy is possible, but is hindered by lack of detailed information on aspects of mammalian physiology, behavior, and perhaps local hydrology that may also play a role in influencing delta(18)O(p). This problem is exemplified by the different range in delta(18)O(p) values measured for sheep and cattle from the same locality around York, UK (3.4 vs. 2.6 parts per thousand, respectively). The observed difference most likely reflects a difference in the relative amount of leaf water ingested by the two species. Future studies of well-constrained samples are required to test physiological models and to develop empirical relations that accurately relate delta(18)O(p) to delta(18)O(pt). In addition to their use as indicators of seasonality, intra-tooth variations in delta(18)O(p) values provide valuable information for longer-term climate change and paleobiological investigations.

AB  - The European Commission requested EFSA to assess if different thermal processes achieve a 5 log(10) reduction in Enterococcus faecalis or Salmonella Senftenberg (775W) and (if relevant) a 3 log(10) reduction in thermoresistant viruses (e.g. Parvovirus) as well as if different chemical processes achieve a 3 log(10) reduction of eggs of Ascaris sp., in eight groups of Category 2 and 3 derived products and animal by-products (ABP). These included (1) ash derived from incineration, co-incineration and combustion; (2) glycerine derived from the production of biodiesel and renewable fuels; (3) other materials derived from the production of biodiesel and renewable fuels; (4) hides and skins; (5) wool and hair; (6) feathers and down; (7) pig bristles; and (8) horns, horn products, hooves and hoof products. Data on the presence of viral hazards and on thermal and chemical inactivation of the targeted indicator microorganisms and biological hazards under relevant processing conditions were extracted via extensive literature searches. The evidence was assessed via expert knowledge elicitation. The certainty that the required log(10) reductions in the most resistant indicator microorganisms or biological hazards will be achieved for each of the eight groups of materials mentioned above by the thermal and/or chemical processes was (1) 99-100% for the two processes assessed; (2) 98-100% in Category 2 ABP, at least 90-99% in Category 3 ABP; (3) 90-99% in Category 2 ABP; at least 66-90% in Category 3 ABP; (4) 10-66% and 33-66%; (5) 1-33% and 10-50%; (6) 66-90%; (7) 33-66% and 50-95%; (8) 66-95%, respectively. Data generation on the occurrence and reduction of biological hazards by thermal and/or chemical methods in these materials and on the characterisation of the usage pathways of ABP as organic fertilisers/soil improvers is recommended.

AB  - The goal of this study was to check the feasibility of the use of dendmmeters to monitor water stress levels in avocado trees (Persea americana Mill, cv. Hass) during the period of 2015-2017. This water stress was generated naturally during events of high vapor pressure deficit (VPD) that normally take place during the Israeli spring (May) and late autumn (September). It was also generated artificially by considering two irrigation regimes, one providing the crop water needs estimated using lysimeter data, and one applying 75% of that amount. The different water regimes and climatic conditions allowed us to investigate the impact of seasonal atmospheric changes on transpiration (T) and on the maximum trunk daily shrinkage (MDS) of the trees. The MDS captured well the differences between the irrigation treatments, showing over 100 mu m increase at peak summer in response to the treatment providing 75% of the irrigation dose applied to the well-watered treatment. We found that T increased linearly with the daily average value of VPD up to around 1.3 kPa, above which the slope of the linear relationship decreased with the increase in VPD. This reduction of T induced moderate changes in MDS under high VPD. The relationships between MDS and VPD and between MDS and T depended on the season, exhibiting substantially lower MDS during the spring and early summer. The hysteretic nature of these relationships indicates that MDS values are related to tree phenology: a VPD of 1.3 kPa corresponds to an MDS of 50 mu m in the first half of the year (flowering and fruit set) and to an MDS of 150 mu m during the second half of the year (fruit growth and maturation). Finally, we found that MDS was highly correlated with the stem water potential, regardless of the irrigation treatment or time of year, and is, therefore, a reliable stress indicator in avocado trees as long as VPD and phenological stage of the tree are considered.

AB  - Understanding the change in function of the biological community under different soil conditions is key to effective soil quality monitoring and mitigation of soil degradation. Current measures of biological soil quality suffer from drawbacks with most techniques having high expense, low throughput or a narrow focus on one component of the community. The aim of this study was to assess the use of volatilomics as a method to profile the soil microbial community and compare the technique to phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiling as a measure of biological soil quality. An agricultural grassland soil (Eutric Cambisol) was subjected to a range of stresses in replicate laboratory mesocosms. Treatments included the imposition of hypoxia/anoxia by flooding with freshwater or saltwater in the presence or absence of plant residues. The volatile organic compound (VOC) and PLFA profile of each treatment was then compared to unamended mesocosms. We hypothesized that the VOC fingerprint of soil would be highly responsive to changes in microbial metabolic status/functioning and thus provide a complementary approach to PLFAs for evaluating soil biological health. We also hypothesized that the VOC profile would have greater discriminatory power than PLFAs for determining differences between soil treatments. A headspace solid phase microextraction (HSSPME) method coupled with gas chromatography quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry (GC/Q-TOFMS) was used to analyse the broad spectrum of VOCs produced by each soil. Across all soil treatments 514 unique VOC peaks were detected. Overall, VOCs showed greater sensitivity than the PLFA analysis in separating soil quality treatments. Eighteen individual VOCs were identified which were primarily responsible for this separation (e.g. indole, a-ionone, isophorone, 3-octanone, p-cresol, 2-ethyl-phenol). Anaerobic soils amended with residues showed the greatest separation from other treatments, with most of this differentiation associated with ten individual VOCs. The anaerobic soils also showed a significant reduction in the number of VOCs emitted but an increase in total VOC emissions. In conclusion, our findings provide evidence that soil VOCs rapidly respond to changes in soil quality and therefore hold great potential as a novel functionally relevant diagnostic measure of biological soil quality.

AB  - BackgroundThis study describes a promising method for understanding how halophytes adapt to extreme saline conditions and to identify populations with greater resistance. Image and colour analyses have the ability to obtain many image parameters and to discriminate between different aspects in plants, which makes them a suitable tool in combination with genetic analysis to study the plants salt tolerance. To the best of our knowledge, there are no publications about the monitoring of halophytic plants by non-destructive methods for identifying the differences between plants that belong to different maternal salinity environments. The aim is to evaluate the ability of image analysis as a non-destructive method and principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the multiple responses of two S. europaea populations, and to determine which population is most affected by different salinity treatments as a preliminary model of selection.ResultsImage analysis was beneficial for detecting the phenotypic variability of two S. europaea populations by morphometric and colour parameters, fractal dimension (FD), projected area (A), shoot height (H), number of branches (B), shoot diameter (S) and colour change (Delta E). S was found to strongly positively correlate with both proline content and Delta E, and negatively with chlorophyll content. These results suggest that proline and Delta E are strongly linked to plant succulence, while chlorophyll decreases with increased succulence. The negative correlation between FD and hydrogen peroxide (HP) suggests that when the plant is under salt stress, HP content increases in plants causing a reduction in plant complexity and foliage growth. The PCA results indicate that the greater the stress, the more marked the differences. At 400mM a shorter distance between the factorial scores was observed. Genetic variability analysis provided evidence of the differences between these populations.ConclusionsOur non-destructive method is beneficial for evaluating the halophyte development under salt stress. FD, S and Delta E were relevant indicators of plant architecture. PCA provided evidence that anthropogenic saline plants were more tolerant to saline stress. Furthermore, random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis provided a quick method for determining genetic variation patterns between the two populations and provided evidence of genetic differences between them.

AB  - Significant areas of the mixedgrass prairie (MGP) in Alberta have experienced heavy equipment traffic due to industrial infrastructure development, which may change edaphic conditions that influence soil microbial communities. Direct wheeled traffic effects may be alleviated by using access mats that spread traffic impacts over a larger area; however, no scientific assessments of access mat efficacy have been conducted on soil microbial responses. Our objectives were to assess soil properties and the diversity, community structure, and size of soil microbial communities, as impacted by wheeled traffic occurring with and without access mat use on grassland. Two representative sites with differing soil texture (sandy versus loamy) were selected from a set of MGP sites established at the University of Alberta Mattheis Research Ranch in SE Alberta, Canada. Treatments at each site included non-disturbed vegetation controls, areas affected by direct traffic, and grassland with access mats placed for 12 weeks with traffic applied. Soil was sampled in July 2015 (immediately after access mat/traffic treatments ended) and in 2016 (12 months after access mat/traffic treatments) from both sites. Soil DNA was extracted and used to target N-cycling genes via qPCR and for next-generation sequencing (Illumina Miseq) of bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities. Direct wheeled traffic without access matting increased the size of the N2O-reducing community in the sandy soil and conversely deceased the size of this community in the loamy soil. Non-metric multidimensional scaling, perMANOVA, and indicator species analyses indicated a large effect of traffic without access mat use on fungal community structure, as well as distinct bacterial and fungal indicator OTUs associated with disturbed soils compared to control soils. Fungal community structure remained affected by traffic impacts 12 months later, highlighting the extended impacts of traffic on fungal communities. Access matting mitigated some of the impacts direct traffic had on fungal community structure, but in the loamy site increased soil N and decreased the size of the N2O-reducing bacterial community. The latter indicates that ecosystem functioning of these grasslands may not only be impacted by direct wheeled traffic but also by using matting as a mitigation technique.

AB  - Background: Drought may become one of the greatest challenges for cereal production under future warming scenarios, and its impact on insect pest outbreaks is still controversial. To address this issue, life-history responses of the English grain aphid, Sitobion avenae (Fabricius), from three areas of different drought levels were compared under three water treatments.
   Results: Significant differences were identified in developmental time, fecundity and adult weight among S. avenae clones from moist, semiarid and arid areas under all the three water treatments. Semiarid and arid area clones tended to have higher heritability for test life-history traits than moist area clones. We identified significant selection of water-deficit on the developmental time of 1st instar nymphs and adult weight for both semiarid and arid area clones. The impact of intermediate and severe water-stress on S. avenae's fitness was neutral and negative (e.g., decreased fecundity and weight), respectively. Compared with arid-area clones, moist- and semiarid-area clones showed higher extents of adaptation to the water-deficit level of their respective source environment. Adult weight was identified as a good indicator for S. avenae's adaptation potential under different water-stress conditions. After their exposure to intermediate water-deficit stress for only five generations, adult weight and fecundity tended to decrease for moist- and semiarid-area clones, but increase for arid-area clones.
   Conclusions: It is evident from our study that S. avenae clones from moist, semiarid and arid areas have diverged under different water-deficit stress, and such divergence could have a genetic basis. The impact of drought on S. avenae's fitness showed a water-level dependent pattern. Clones of S. avenae were more likely to become adapted to intermediate water-deficit stress than severe water-deficit stress. After continuous water-deficit stress of only five generations, the adaptation potential of S. avenae tended to decrease for moist and semiarid area clones, but increase for arid area clones. The rapid shift of aphids' life-history traits and adaptation potential under drought could have significant implications for their evolutionary dynamics and outbreak risks in future climate change scenarios.

AB  - Stable carbon isotopes (delta C-13) and C/N ratios in bulk sediment organic matter were used as indicators of C-3 and C-4 vegetation functional types in a ca. 40-kyr, predominantly alluvial sequence from Arroyo La Estacada (33.5 degrees S, 69 degrees W), in the arid Andean piedmont of central Argentina. Although this sediment sequence has the potential to contribute to the knowledge of past vegetation dynamics through its fossil pollen content, previous palynological studies provided scant information, constrained to a few time windows, because of poor pollen preservation. Stable isotope results for the total organic carbon fraction from three lithostratigraphic sections that span the past 40 kyr show shifts in delta C-13 values associated with changing contributions from C-3 and C-4 plants, suggesting this proxy can detect changes in these photosynthetic pathways, representative of Patagonian (and/or stream margin macrophytes) and Monte phytogeographic units, respectively. Climate and local factors, such as water availability in the basin, are inferred to be the main drivers of vegetation dynamics. The C/N ratios in a few samples show that organic matter sources are algae and/or phytoplankton, not solely C-3 or C-4 vascular plants. The delta C-13 record from Arroyo La Estacada is an example of how isotope geochemistry has overcome difficulties with pollen analysis and provided a reliable tool to investigate past vegetation changes in regions where C-3 and C-4 are differentially distributed. Isotope values during part of the Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3) and the middle Holocene are attributed to C-3 local floodplain plants, with a little or no contribution from regional terrestrial (Patagonian) vegetation. Late Pleistocene-Holocene palaeosols have a clear C-4 signal of terrestrial dominance, representative of Monte plants, thus, carbon isotope values constrain the early times of MIS 1, particularly where the Pleistocene Holocene transition occurs. A mixture of C-3 and C-4 values during the last 3-4 kyr is indicative of environmental conditions that prevail in the region today.

AB  - Aim: A major problem for conservation in Amazonia is that species distribution maps are inaccurate. Consequently, conservation planning needs to be based on other information sources such as vegetation and soilmaps, which are also inaccurate. We propose and test the use of biotic data on a common and relatively easily inventoried group of plants to infer environmental conditions that can be used to improvemaps of floristic patterns for plants in general.
   Location: Brazilian Amazonia.
   Methods: We sampled 326 plots of 250 m x 2 m separated by distances of 1-1800 km. Terrestrial fern individuals were identified and counted. Edaphic data were obtained from soil samples and analysed for cation concentration and texture. Climatic data were obtained from Worldclim. We used a multivariate regression tree to evaluate the hierarchical importance of soils and climate for fern communities and identified significant indicator species for the resultant classification. We then tested how well the edaphic properties of the plots could be predicted on the basis of their floristic composition using two calibration methods, weighted averaging and k-nearest neighbour estimation.
   Results: Soil cation concentration emerged as the most important variable in the regression tree, whereas soil textural and climatic variation played secondary roles. Almost all the plot classes had several fern species with high indicator values for that class. Soil cation concentration was also the variable most accurately predicted on the basis of fern community composition (R-2 = 0.65-0.75 for log-transformed data). Predictive accuracy varied little among the calibration methods, and was not improved by the use of abundance data instead of presence-absence data.
   Conclusions: Fern species composition can be used as an indicator of soil cation concentration, which can be expected to be relevant also for other components of rain forests. Presence-absence data are adequate for this purpose, which makes the collecting of additional data potentially very rapid. Comparison with earlier studies suggests that edaphic preferences of fern species have good transferability across geographical regions within lowland Amazonia. Therefore, species and environmental data sets already available in the Amazon region represent a good starting point for generating better environmental and floristic maps for conservation planning.

AB  - Advances in textile materials, technology and miniaturization of electronics for measurement instrumentation has boosted the development of wearable measurement systems. In several projects sensorized garments and non-invasive instrumentation have been integrated to assess on emotional, cognitive responses as well as physical arousal and status of mental stress through the study of the autonomous nervous system. Assessing the mental state of workers under stressful conditions is critical to identify which workers are in the proper state of mind and which are not ready to undertake a mission, which might consequently risk their own life and the lives of others. The project Assessment in Real Time of the Stress in Combatants (ATREC) aims to enable real time assessment of mental stress of the Spanish Armed Forces during military activities using a wearable measurement system containing sensorized garments and textile-enabled non-invasive instrumentation. This work describes the multiparametric sensorized garments and measurement instrumentation implemented in the first phase of the project required to evaluate physiological indicators and recording candidates that can be useful for detection of mental stress. For such purpose different sensorized garments have been constructed: a textrode chest-strap system with six repositionable textrodes, a sensorized glove and an upper-arm strap. The implemented textile-enabled instrumentation contains one skin galvanometer, two temperature sensors for skin and environmental temperature and an impedance pneumographer containing a 1-channel ECG amplifier to record cardiogenic biopotentials. With such combinations of garments and non-invasive measurement devices, a multiparametric wearable measurement system has been implemented able to record the following physiological parameters: heart and respiration rate, skin galvanic response, environmental and peripheral temperature. To ensure the proper functioning of the implemented garments and devices the full series of 12 sets have been functionally tested recording cardiogenic biopotential, thoracic impedance, galvanic skin response and temperature values. The experimental results indicate that the implemented wearable measurement systems operate according to the specifications and are ready to be used for mental stress experiments, which will be executed in the coming phases of the project with dozens of healthy volunteers.

AB  - In aquaculture, fish are exposed to a range of unfavourable environmental conditions. Amongst these, stocking density has attracted considerable attention as inappropriate densities may compromise welfare and negatively impact production. However, the recommendations for stocking remain elusive. The aim of the present study was to apply a novel method to investigate a level of crowding that indicated aversiveness in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). In a two-tank system, where two identical tanks were connected via a doorway, it was observed that social behaviour controlled the distribution of the fish between the tanks. Fish were stocked at equal quantities in each tank of the system. The doorway was opened and the fish moved between the two tanks. Typically, this resulted in one tank being occupied by a few highly aggressive dominant individuals ("dominant" tank) and the majority of the fish occupying the second tank ("crowded" tank). Here, the potential of this unequal spatial distribution for quantifying aversion to crowding was explored. Fish were stocked in three two-tank systems at a total density of 20, 40 and 80 kg m(-3) respectively. The number of fish in each tank was determined every three days throughout the duration of the experiment and the percentage of fish in the "crowded" tank was used as an indicator of the distribution pattern in the two-tank systems. The results indicated a negative relationship between the total density stocked (20, 40 and 80 kg m-(3)) and the percentage of fish in the "crowded" tank. A subsample of individuals was sacrificed for blood and brain samples every three days from the "crowded" tank, prior to the fish count. The neuroendocrine indicators of stress, elevated serotonergic activity levels which were not associated with high plasma levels of cortisol, suggested chronic stress in the fish at the highest total density stocked (80 kg m-(3)). Taken together, these results indicated that a level of aversiveness to crowding had been reached at the highest density stocked, where the mean absolute density, irrespective of time of day, observed in the "crowded" tank was 126.5 +/- 3.7 kg m(-3).

AB  - Ecosystem monitoring and assessment are often based on functional indicators, which provide integrated and yet simple and affordable measures of key ecosystem functions. The landscape function analysis (LFA) assesses ecosystem functioning through three indices that represent basic soil functions: surface stability, infiltration, and nutrient cycling. Given the high scale-dependency of hydrological and erosion processes in semiarid ecosystems, the validation of the stability and infiltration indices requires a multi-scale approach, which has not been applied by previous works. Using records from a four-year monitoring of a semiarid landscape in SE Spain, we evaluated the LFA infiltration and stability indices against quantitative measurements of water and sediment flows at multiple scales. At the finest scale, the indices correctly reflected the higher infiltration and lower sediment production of plant patches as compared with bare-soil interpatches. The infiltration index also captured the spatial variation in the infiltration capacity of bare-soil interpatches. At the hillslope scale, total runoff was inversely related to the average infiltration index for bare-soil interpatches, but it was not related to the global infiltration index, which combines the values from both bare-soil interpatches and plant patches. These results suggest that the hydrological response of semiarid hillslopes depends mainly on the variation in the functioning of bare-soil interpatches. Total sediment yield from the hillslope plots was not related to the stability index. At the catchment scale, both the bare-soil interpatch and the global infiltration indices correctly captured the variability in total runoff produced by three micro-catchments of comparable size. The bare-soil infiltration index predicted bare-soil infiltration rate and hillslope runoff better than common simple indicators of soil functioning such as soil organic carbon, stone cover, crusted bare-soil cover, bulk-density and plant cover, and exhibited a similarly high indicatory potential that a variety of plant spatial-pattern indicators. In contrast to the multi-scale validation of the infiltration index, the indicatory potential of the stability index was only proved for the most contrasting soil conditions in the study site, pointing to a lower sensitivity of this latter index.

AB  - This research characterizes associations between multiple pollutants in the near-road environment attributed to a roadway line source. It also examines the use of a tracer gas as a surrogate of mobile source pollutants. Air samples were collected in summa canisters along a 300 m transect normal to a highway in Raleigh, North Carolina for five sampling periods spanning four days. Samples were subsequently measured for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using an electron capture gas chromatograph. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) was released from a finite line source adjacent to the roadway for two of the sampling periods, collected in the canisters and measured with the VOCs. Associations between each VOC, and between VOCs and the tracer, were quantified with Pearson correlation coefficients to assess the consistency of the multi-pollutant dispersion profiles, and assess the tracer as a potential surrogate for mobile source pollutants. As expected, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and m, p-and o-xylenes (collectively, BTEX) show strong correlations between each other; further, BTEX shows a strong correlation to SF6. Between 26 VOCs, correlation coefficients were greater than 0.8, and 14 VOCs had coefficients greater than 0.6 with the tracer gas. Even under non-downwind conditions, chemical concentrations had significant correlations with distance. Results indicate that certain VOCs are representative of a larger multi-pollutant mixture, and many VOCs are well-correlated with the tracer gas.
   Implications: This research characterizes associations between volatile organic compounds in a near-road environment to evaluate the consistency of the composition of the multipollutant mixture. It demonstrates the potential use of a tracer gas as an indicator of pollutant dispersion. Near-roadway exposures have been associated with a myriad of health effects; however, associations with individual pollutant components have yet to be well established. This work characterizes a multipollutant profile for a moderately traveled highway with typical rush hour characteristics. Insights on the composition of the complex mixture emitted from mobile sources will improve exposure, health, and epidemiological assessments.

AB  - Data sets for two bottom trawl fisheries, the coastal pair-trawler fishery and offshore single-trawler fishery in the Tsushima Warm Current (TWC) region of the Japan Sea, were compiled and analyzed for the last three decades (1974-2006). These data sets were used to (1) identify and compare the variability in demersal fish assemblages, and (2) relate these to water temperature to examine the impacts of climate regime shifts. Principal component analysis (PCA) of catches of target species in the two trawler fisheries showed synchronous decadal variability with step changes around 1986/1987 and 1996/1997. These step changes strongly suggest the effect of the late 1980s climate regime shift, which was characterized by an abrupt change from a cool to a warm condition in the TWC. The first and second principal components (PC1 and PC2) for both trawler fisheries agreed closely with winter and summer water temperature in the Japan Sea, respectively, suggesting PC1 (PC2) was associated with cold- (warm-) water species. However, between warm- and cold-water species the response pattern to water temperature was different. CPUE (catch per unit effort) of warm- (cold-) water species correlated positively (negatively) with water temperature, indicating the increase in water temperature has a positive (negative) effect on warm(cold-) water species. Cold-water species decreased (increased) both in biomass and distribution during the warm (cold) regime, while warm-water species increased in biomass and/or distribution during the warm 1990s. These results suggested that the demersal fish assemblage structure changed abruptly as a consequence of the late 1980s climate regime shift. Impact of fishing was unclear on the demersal fish assemblage as a whole, but fishing pressure has been intensified for specific species under unfavorable climate regimes even with a declining fishing effort. Differing response patterns between warm- and cold-water species to climate regime shifts suggest the importance of integrated assessment and ecosystem-based management for the whole trawl fishery rather than only for individual target species.

AB  - Evolution of the mixed and shortgrass prairie of the North American Great Plains is Poorly understood because of limited proxies available for environmental interpretations. Buried soils in the Great Plains provide a solution to the problem because they are widespread both spatially and temporally with their organic reservoirs serving as a link to the plants than once grew on them. Through stable carbon isotopic analysis of soil organic carbon (delta C-13), the percent carbon from C-4 plants (%C-4) can be ascertained. Because C-4 plants are primarily warm season grasses responding positively to summer temperature, their representation has the added advantage of serving as a climate indicator. To better understand grassland and climate dynamics in the Great Plains during the last 12 ka (ka = 1000 radiocarbon years) we developed an isotopic standardization technique by: determining the difference in buried soil delta C-13 and modern Soil delta C-13 expected for that latitude (Delta delta C-13), and transferring the Delta delta C-13 to Delta%C-4 (% C-4) using mass balance calculations.
   Our analysis reveals two isotopic stages in the mixed and shortgrass prairie of the Great Plains based on trends in Delta%C-4. In response to orbital forcing mechanisms, Delta%C-4 Was persistently below modern in the Great Plains between 12 and 6.7 ka (isotopic stage 11) evidently because of the cooling effect of the Laurentide ice sheet and proglacial lakes in northern latitudes, and glacial meltwater pulses cooling the Gulf of Mexico and North Atlantic Ocean. The Delta%C-4 after 6.7 ka (isotopic stage 1) increased to modern levels as conditioned by the outflow of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and dry incursions from the west that produced periodic drought. At the millennial-scale, time series analysis demonstrates that Delta%C-4 oscillated with 0.6 and 1.8 ka periodicities, possibly governed by variations in solar irradiance. Our buried soil isotopic record correlates well with other environmental proxy from the Great Plains and surrounding regions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In hilly areas of south Germany with tertiary and quaternary sediments, percolation has been studied applying an isotope tracer of the water molecule in small-scale field experiments to better understand the hierarchies and interconnections of quick and slow seepage. On a catchment-related scale, these results have been connected with traditional and environmental isotope analysis of discharge to better quantify quick and slow seepage components, and to better assess the export of agrochemicals into ground- and surface waters. Consequently, the development of improved application techniques of agrochemicals and better strategies for ground and surface water protection is possible. The unsaturated zone of the study area was traced with Deuterium on areas of about 50 m(2). Results show that infiltration splits into bypass and matrix-flow. Bypass-flow exceeds flow velocities of 0.5 in day(-1), which is close to flow velocities of overland-flow, and matrix-flow ranges between 0.7 in year(-1) (Loess) and 1.2 in year(-1) (Tertiary gravels and sands). In these unconsolidated rocks, bypass-flow seems to (1) be strongest under wet and dry conditions at the soil surface; (2) be more dominant in coarse than fine-grained sediments; (3) be more pronounced in terrestrial than in marine sediments and (4) penetrate to an average depth of less than I in in fine-grained sands and silts, and deeper than 3 in in gravels before it either finally incorporates into matrix-flow or generates interflow, Hydrographic analysis shows that more than 21% infiltration produces interflow by the transformation of bypass-flow into lateral flow, and about 75% infiltration groundwater recharge; 4% of bypass-flow incorporates into matrix-flow. In the study area, plowing techniques and Field size influence significantly and proportionally the distribution of overland- and interflow-flow. However, groundwater recharge is not significantly changed. As matrix-flow is too slow an indicator to clarify how changes in land use affect groundwater quality over time, the analysis of direct discharge may be considered a good early indicator to assess land use changes on the export of agrochemicals.

AB  - Zircon U-Pb dating is a powerful and widely used geochronologic technique to constrain the timing and rates of magmatic and high and lower-grade metamorphic processes, as well as sediment provenance. Zircon trace element (TE) compositions also record magmatic and metamorphic processes during zircon growth. In this study, zircon laser ablation split-stream (LA-SS)-ICP-MS U-Pb and TE depth-profiling and novel two-dimensional zircon mapping techniques are used in combination with oxygen isotope analyses (secondary ion mass spectrometry, SIMS) to reconstruct the timing and metamorphic conditions recorded by recrystallization and growth of zircon rims, which provide valuable insight into the petro-tectonic evolution of high-pressure/low-temperature (HP/LT) metamorphic rocks formed in subduction zones. These techniques are applied to zircon grains from HP/LT metamorphic rocks of the Cycladic Blueschist Unit (CBU) and Cycladic Basement (CB) on Sikinos and Ios islands, Greece, which experienced metamorphism and deformation associated with subduction and subsequent back-arc exhumation. Zircon records multiple episodes of non-magmatic zircon rim growth at similar to 50 Ma and similar to 26 Ma. Eocene metamorphic rims are associated with HP/LT metamorphism and are observed in both units, suggesting likely juxtaposition prior to or during subduction and associated HP metamorphism. The similarity between TE concentrations and delta O-18 values of the Eocene rims and their corresponding cores is an indicator for recrystallization and precipitation as a mechanism of zircon growth. In contrast, Oligocene zircon rims appear to be restricted to a < 0.5 km thick zone along the CB-CBU contact, characterized by garnet break-down, and show HREE enrichment and higher delta O-18 values in the rims compared to the cores, consistent with a model suggesting metasomatic infiltration of fluids derived from dehydrating sedimentary rocks during progressive subduction and underplating prior to back-arc extension. This metamorphism appears to be static in nature and does not support major late Cenozoic reactivation of the contact as an extensional shear zone during back-arc extension.

AB  - Research background: SMEs represent an integral part of the economy environment in a majority of the countries all over the world. They signify the most efficient, progressive, and important part of the advanced economies. The long-term effort of the EU countries, as well as other advanced economies is to create quality and stable conditions for their development in order to be able to respond to all the possible changes in the business environment that is being changed to more and more comprehensive in the recent time.
   Purpose of the article: The objective of the contribution is to examine administrative and legislative obstacles to SMEs business in the Czech Republic and Slovakia and the quantification of the differences in perceiving legislative and administrative obstacles to business by entrepreneurs in both countries.
   Methods: A questionnaire survey was conducted within SMEs in the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 2019. The research sample included 641 SMEs, 312 from the Czech Republic and 329 from Slovakia. We focused on 5 dimensions related to legislative and administrative obstacles to SMEs business within which selected statements were examined. Contingency tables were used to analyze the ratios of the examined variables.
   Findings & Value added: The differences detected in both countries in the respondents' perception and assessment are evidence of the changes in the business environment of both countries, giving rise to the questions about the extent to which the legislative and administrative obstacles, as well as the obstacles related to law enforcement and bureaucracy are acceptable and by which groups of entrepreneurs. The results of the research provide valuable findings for the creators of regional and national policies, and represent a valuable basis for the creation of the concepts focused on the SMEs' development in both countries. The results of the study also support the implementation of follow-up research in this area that will reveal other determinants affecting the development of SMEs. They also create a valuable platform for the construction of national and international benchmarking indicators in this area and the implementation of comparative analyses. This will also support the methodological area necessary for a creation of high-quality concepts and strategies.

AB  - Little research regarding the organic geochemistry of source rock deposited in marine or transitional environment in the eastern deep-water area of the Qiongdongnan Basin (QDNB) has been performed so far. Based on the organic geochemical and petrological data of mudstone samples collected from the eastern deep-water area in the QDNB, combined with palynological data of rock samples in the shallow-water area, this paper studies the paleoenvironment, hydrocarbon potential, and controlling factors of Oligocene source rock in different sedimentary facies in the eastern QDNB. Two distinct models of delta front source rock and neritic source rock are proposedaccording to organic matter sources and geochemical characteristics. Source rock in the delta front subface is of medium to high organic abundance and gas-prone-type kerogen, the geochemical biomarkers are characterized by high ratios of pristane/phytane, oleanane/C-30 hopane, T-bicadinane/C-30 hopane, and low ratios of C-23 tricyclic terpane/C-30 hopane, C-27 sterane/C-29 sterane, (nC(21) + nC(22))/(nC(28) + nC(29)). However, source rock in the neritic face has medium organic richness and kerogen type prone to generate both oil and gas; the biomarkers are characterized by low ratios of pristane/phytane, oleanane/C-30 hopane, T-bicadinane/C-30 hopane, and high ratios of C-23 tricyclic terpane/C-30 hopane, C-27 sterane/C-29 sterane, (nC(21) + nC(22))/(nC(28) + nC(29)). During the Oligocene epoch, the paleoclimate in the QDNB was subtropical warm-humid, and paleovegetation around and within the sags was dominated by pteridophyte and angiosperm plants, causing terrestrial higher plants to be the main organic matter source. Source rock in the delta front subface is formed in oxidation fresh or brackish water environment, whereas source rock in the neritic face is formed in weak oxidization brackish or saline water conditions. Organic matter abundance in the delta front subface is mainly controlled by the terrigenous organic matter input, whereas organic matter abundance in the neritic face is controlled by aquatic organic matter input and influenced by the water redox environment.

AB  - The rate of release of anthropogenic heat-heat that results fromhuman activity (mainly motorized transportation and air-conditioning)-is a crucial input to urban microclimate models. Traffic related anthropogenic heat, in particular, is notoriously difficult to estimate and often evades systematic treatment, especially in developing countries where traffic intensity indicators are either not routinely recorded or not publicly available. The most challenging aspect is the derivation of a typical daily profile of the anthropogenic heat release rate, which is essential for the accuracy of the urban microclimate models, given the dynamic nature of the heat island phenomenon. The basic premise of this study is that the traffic intensity profile, and hence the traffic related anthropogenic heat rate profile(s), can be inferred from urban air pollutant concentration measurements. Volatile organic compounds such as Benzene, Toluene, Ethylbenzene and m-, p-, o-Xylenes (BTEX) are the most relevant in this context. A newmethodology is proposed for deriving normalized daily profile(s) of traffic related heat release rates using one year of hourly BTEX measurements recorded by a road-side air quality monitoring station in downtown Abu Dhabi. These normalized profiles are calibrated using average traffic related heat release rates derived from a 'top-down' analysis of aggregate transportation data. The calibrated daily profiles are subsequently validated according to a 'bottom-up' approach whereby the total number of circulating vehicles at a specific time of the day is estimated from satellite images of several carefully selected representative urban districts. The daily traffic related anthropogenic heat rate profile(s) derived according to this methodology are consistent with expectations and comparable to those reported in the literature for comparable cities. The daily profile presents two peaks, the first at about 8 am and the second, more pronounced, at about 9 pm. The average workday sensible heat release rate is estimated to be 11.4 W/m(2) with an evening peak of about 19 W/m(2). The peak latent heat rate is approximately 1.9 W/m(2) which amounts to about 10% of the sensible rate. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - South Africa experiences a range of different climatic regimes and is thus an ideal region to investigate Late Pleistocene environmental and climate change. However, detailed quantifiable palaeoclimate data are sparse in the region. In particular, reliable palaeoclimatic data are essential to resolve ongoing controversies regarding temperature depression and moisture availability during glacial periods in the sub-continent. Small glaciers close to the glaciation threshold are highly sensitive to changes in temperature and precipitation and are therefore ideal indicators of past climatic conditions during their existence. This paper derives some of the first quantitative data on Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) palaeoprecipitation in southern Africa, based on glacier reconstruction and mass balance modelling for the Lesotho Highlands.
   The reconstruction of former glaciers and their dynamics enables the determination of glacier viability under specific climatic envelopes. Glacier reconstructions at five sites in the Lesotho Highlands yield palaeoglaciers with Equilibrium Line Altitudes (ELAs) ranging from 3095 to 3298 m a.s.l., and reconstructed steady-state mass balance and flow dynamics are comparable with modern analogues. Topclimatic factors are investigated, with temperature-radiation-index modelling indicating that topographic shading was an important factor determining the existence of small glaciers in this region. The occurrence of glaciation in the Drakensberg during the LGM suggests a potential increase in precipitation and change in its seasonality. Such trends are likely associated with an increased frequency of westerly wave (cold front) disturbances due to the northward shift of pressure belts, which would also increase precipitation as snow at higher altitudes. The application of a high resolution climate model (HadAM3h) to test this, displays a change in the seasonal timing of precipitation during the Last Glacial cycle, with a decrease in precipitation evident during the summer months. This is likely to have had important implications for the mass balance and survival of small niche glaciers in the region, with more precipitation falling during the spring winter autumn months as snow.

AB  - Although considerable progress has been made in reducing concentrations of persistent organic compounds in the environment, these contaminants are still found in many taxa. Here, we investigate the relationship between environmental contamination and avian egg coloration to examine whether egg coloration could be used as a bioindicator of contaminant load. The Herring Gull Monitoring Programme has documented changes in contaminant levels found in herring gull Larus argentatus Pontoppidan eggs across the Great Lakes for nearly 40 years. We measured the coloration of these eggs using reflectance spectrophotometry and evaluated the influence of a suite of contaminants on egg colour using general linear mixed models. Herring gull egg coloration was related to the levels of environmental contaminants found within the eggs. Our findings reveal a negative association between blue-green chroma and a principal component explaining contaminant load. We also found that ultraviolet chroma varied positively with contaminant load, whereas brown chroma was not significantly related to contaminant load. In addition, a cross-validated discriminant function analysis was able to correctly classify 84% of eggs to either high or low contaminant load. This is an important first step in assessing the utility of using egg coloration as a proxy for contaminant load in a colonially breeding waterbird. Synthesis and applications. Our study utilized a large, multi-year data set to provide the first evidence that a suite of environmental contaminants appear to influence avian eggshell coloration. We also found that objective spectrophotometric measurements provide a reliable tool for assessment of egg contaminant load, and we provide a discriminant function for contaminant classification directly in the field. Our findings should be broadly relevant, because the pigments responsible for avian egg coloration are shared across all birds. The application of eggshell colour as a bio-monitoring tool has important conservation and management applications; measuring egg coloration may provide a rapid, inexpensive and nondestructive means of estimating contaminant levels in the environment. This may provide an essential tool for monitoring areas or species of concern, as well as evaluating potential human health risks, by identifying populations supported by an environment that requires more attention and potentially environmental remediation.

AB  - Phytoplankton plays a dominant role in shelf biogeochemistry by producing the major part of organic matter. Part of the organic matter will reach the sediment where diagenetic processes like denitrification, apatite formation or burial will remove nutrients from the biogeochemical cycle. In this article current knowledge on the decadal plankton variability in the North Sea is summarized and possible implications of these changes for the biogeochemistry of the North Sea are discussed. Most of the observed interdecadal dynamics seem to be linked to large-scale oceanographic and atmospheric processes. Prominent changes in the North Sea ecosystem have taken place around 1979 and 1988. In general, the phytoplankton color (CPRS indicator of phytoplankton biomass) reached minimum values during the end of the 1970s and has increased especially since the mid 1980s. Changes with a similar timing have been identified in many time series from the North Sea through the entire ecosystem and are sometimes referred to as regime shifts. It is suggested that the impact of global change on the local biogeochemistry is largely driven by the phyto- and zooplankton dynamics during spring and early summer. At that time the extent of zooplankton phytoplankton interaction either allows that a large part of the new production is settling to the sediment, or that a significant part of the new production including the fixed nutrients is kept within the pelagic system. The origin of the extent of the phytoplankton-zooplankton interaction in spring is probably set in the previous autumn and winter. In coastal areas, both large-scale atmospheric and oceanographic changes as well as anthropogenic factors influence the long-term dynamics. Due to eutrophication, local primary production nowadays still is up to five times higher than during pre-industrial conditions, despite a decreasing trend. Recently, introduced species have strengthened the filter feeder component of coastal ecosystems. Especially in shallow coastal seas like the Wadden Sea, this will enhance particle retention, shift organic matter degradation to the benthic compartment and enhance nutrient removal from the biogeochemical cycle by denitrification or apatite formation.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to characterize the relationship between organic material and thermal maturity during the process of evaluation of hydrocarbon potential. Samples studied include Miocene high volatile bituminous coal and coaly shale collected from outcrops and exploration wells in Hsinchu-Miaoli area, NW Taiwan, density centrifuge separated macerals, bituminous coal and anthracite from China, in addition to Woodford and Green River oil shale from the United States. Maceral composition analysis, elemental analysis, vitrinite reflectance measurement and Rock-Eval pyrolysis were performed for evaluation. The results of study show that: 1) coal samples from the Shiti Formation (middle Miocene) exhibit more vitrinite and less mineral matter contents than samples from the Nanchuang Formation (upper Miocene); H% is increased in exinite-enriched maceral mixtures with density < 1.25 g cm(-3), after density centrifuge separation. 2) A positive linear correlation between Tmax and Ro illustrates both Rock-Eval pyrolysis and vitrinite reflectance can be used as indicators of thermal maturity. 3) From the plot of H/C ratio vs. vitrinite reflectance, even though the depositional environments were different in Taiwan and China, their organic micelles exhibit a similar trend in the process of thermal maturation. As a whole, the curve has a turning point at Ro = 0.5% and H/C = 0.1 (atomic ratio 1.2) in this study. 4) A rather good correlation between S2 and TOC of samples studied indicates the contribution of S2 from TOC. 5) The highest HI occurred in certain maturities (Tmax and Ro) of samples studied, and not in the stages of less maturity or over-maturity. 6) Two different linear trends were observed in the cross plot of S1 vs. S2. Field outcropped shale or C-shale exhibits a steeper slope compared to that of coal samples which can be attributed to the compositional difference in their organic material. 7) A rather strong positive correlation for H% vs. S2 illustrates the contribution of H-containing macerals, especially exinite. As a result of this study, we expect to promote evaluation techniques for HC exploration; for instance, the development or improvement of evaluation methods for Source rocks, reservoirs, structural evolution, and thermal maturity. Evaluations are expected to give more detail regarding local conditions, and be better quantified and more accurate.

AB  - This Study tried to clarify the question if nuclear genotoxicity played a role in 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) toxicity. We investigated cytotoxic and DNA-damaging effects of AZT on human hepatoma HepG2 and human colonic CaCo-2 cells as well as on human diploid lung fibroblasts HEL. The amount of induced DNA damage was measured by standard alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE). The nature of induced DNA lesions was evaluated (1) by modified SCGE, which includes treatment of lysed cells with DNA repair enzymes Endo III and Fpg and enables to recognize oxidized bases of DNA, and (2) by SCGE processed in parallel at pH 13.0 (standard technique) and pH 12.1, which enables to recognize alkali labile DNA lesions and direct DNA strand breaks. Cytotoxicity of AZT was evaluated by the trypan blue exclusion technique. Our findings showed that 3-h treatment of cells with AZT decreased the viability of all cell lines studied. SCGE performed in the presence of DNA repair enzymes proved that AZT induced oxidative lesions to DNA in all cell types. In hepatoma HepG2 cells and embryonic lung fibroblasts HEL the majority of AZT-induced DNA strand breaks were pH-independent, i.e. they were identified at both pH values (12.1 and 13.0). These DNA lesions represented direct DNA breaks. In colonic Caco-2 cells DNA lesions were converted to DNA strand breaks particularly under strong alkaline conditions (pH > 13.0), which is characteristic for alkali-labile sites of DNA. DNA strand break rejoining was investigated by the standard cornet assay technique during 48 h of post-AZT-treatment in HepG2 and Caco-2 cells. The kinetics of DNA rejoining, considered in indicator of DNA repair, revealed that AZT-induced DNA breaks were repaired in both cell types slowly, though HepG2 cells seemed to be more repair proficient with respect to AZT-induced DNA lesions.

AB  - Goal and Background. The LCA methodology is used to compare the potential environmental benefits of an emerging biotechnology, enzyme-bleaching, with those of elemental chlorine free (ECF) bleaching, an existing technology that is widely used in paper making. Through the use of biodegradable enzymes to supplement, or eventually to replace, chemicals in the bleaching process to extract lignin, enzyme bleaching processes are aimed to reduce the use of chlorine based bleaching chemicals and to achieve cost savings by circumventing investment into oxygen delignification or ozone bleaching technology.
   Scope and Method. The assessment is conducted using SimaPro 4.0 and focuses on the processes within the bleach plant stage. For this study, ECF is replaced by enzyme bleaching only in the first stage of the bleaching process. Because this is a comparative study, all upstream and downstream processes are excluded. The impact categories based on Eco-indicator 95 are used to characterize the inventory data in this study. Other methodologies, such as Eco-indicator 99 and CML 2000, have not been chosen as they are more region-specific and are not yet fully applicable to the Canadian environmental condition. A new initiative to develop a Canadian Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) Method is ongoing at the Interuniversity Reference Center for the Life Cycle Assessment, Interpretation and Management of Products, Processes and Services (CIRAIG), Ecole Polytechnique, Canada.
   Results and Conclusion. The analysis shows that the introduction of enzyme bleaching into the ECF process significantly improves the overall environmental performance in the majority of the impact categories. Extending the substitution of enzyme bleaching for chlorine dioxide is warranted. Of the three impact categories where increased impact was noted, two of these which increased emissions of greenhouse gases and increased incidence of summer smog, would be completely eliminated if the enzyme mediator was manufactured at the point of use. There remains a potential for increased impact from eutrophication, which would need to be managed.
   Recommendations and Outlook. With the only partial substitution of ECF by enzyme bleaching examined here, chlorine dioxide consumption, energy consumption, NaOH consumption, and transportation remain the key hot spots and warrant further research. Anything that can be done to replace or reduce chlorine dioxide consumption will benefit the environment.

AB  - in three year field experinients (2001-2003) the growth, yield and productivity of 8 flax cultivars were compared. Cultivars 'AC Linora', 'Flanders', 'Linola (TM) 947', 'Norlin' and 'Omeg' were obtained from Canada, 'Barbara' and 'Hungarian Gold' frorn Hungary and 'Opal' frorn Poland. Apart frorn the estimation of the yield of above-round parts dry matter and seed yield the determinations of the primary index value of growth analysis were done and on their basis the indices LAI, LAD, RGR, CGR and HI were calculated. The obtained yield results of the examined flax cultivars show significant genotypic - environmental relationships pertaining to the dynamics of dry matter LICCUMUlation and tile aniount of seed yield. Meteorological conditions in the successive years significantly influenced the particular phases of growth and development of cultivars and the factor which increased the amount of dry matter was the air temperature during the period of plant emergence - budding. During the vegetative season with a large amount of rainfall the average seed yield was about 40% lower than compared with a year of average precipitation and it warm second part of the second period of flax vegetation. Among the analyzed cultivars a stable yield in all the years was characteristic for cultivars 'Flanders', 'Barbara' and 'AC Linora' (that cultivar, however, during a wet year yielded at a low level). The assimilation leaf surface of the linseed quickly increased during the period frorn budding to flowering and the accumulation of dry matter of the aboveground parts lasted up to the green maturity. In the successive years of the experiment there were observed significant (linear or logarithmic regressions) relationship between the yield of dry matter and the indices of growth analysis. The biggest values of the CGR indicator were observed for the period from budding to flowering. The maintaining of a high CGR value after plant flowering in the year with a favourable course of climatic parameters was beneficial for a better yield of all flax cultivars. The low values of the RGR index after flowering of cultivar 'Hungarian Gold' and 'Opal' strictly corresponded to their low yield of seed and straw biomass.

AB  - The potential application of the comet assay for monitoring the effect of DNA damaging agents on the marine mussel, Mytilus edulis tan important pollution indicator organism), was explored. A detailed investigation of the baseline levels of single-strand breaks in isolated gill cells, and how they were affected by age/size of animal, time since collection, feeding regime, in vivo vs, in vitro exposure conditions, and by antioxidant supplementation was undertaken. The level of cometing in untreated controls was found to be highly variable over time (fluctuations between low and very high DNA damage occurred over just 14 days post collection). No difference was observed between age/size and feeding regime of the animals. On exposure to 0, 100, 500 and 1000 mu M H2O2, it was observed that the in vitro exposure produced a markedly more homogeneous dose response compared to the in vivo studies (where gill cells were exposed as a tissue). An important finding of our research was the effect of prior supplementation of the animals' diet with 1 mg/ml alpha-tocopherol acetate (vitamin E compound), which resulted in a marked reduction in the levels of DNA damage expressed by the negative controls, without influencing the actual response to H2O2 (0, 5, 25, and 100 mu M) and N-nitrosodimethylamine, NDMA (0, 5, 25, and 100 mM), The effect of vitamin E supplementation was to increase the sensitivity of the comet assay at the lower end of the dose range. This study demonstrated the potential application of the comet assay to the gill cells of the mussel, M. edulis. Although preliminary findings suggest that antioxidant supplementation can improve the sensitivity of the assay by lowering the baseline damage in untreated animals, our conclusion is that the assay has mon potential for use in an in vitro context for the screening of agents destined for release or disposal into the marine environment.
