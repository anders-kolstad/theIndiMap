AB  - The challenges of food security rely on highly technical productive systems. Monocultures, on the other hand, are reliant on a high input load, negatively impact soil conservation, affecting edaphic biota and generating biological degradation. The study aimed to evaluate the sustainability of Agricultural Productive Units (APU) dedicated to soybean cultivation in Los Rios province, Ecuador, and compare these results with benefits from Ecosystem Services calculated with a geographic information system (GIS) protocol. Through surveys, social, economic and ecological dimensions were evaluated via a multicriteria model. In addition, macrofauna and soil physicochemical conditions were analyzed. As a result, we obtained that 100% of the APU had an Economic Indicator (KI > 2), 65% a Socio-cultural Indicator (SCI > 2) and 99% an Ecological Indicator (EI > 2). Also, there was a suitable agreement between calculated benefits of Ecosystem Services (CBESs) and economic (KI), socio-cultural (SCI), ecological (EI) and general sustainability (GSI) indices. This study intends to make a contribution to the model coupling efforts targeting at exploring the interaction between available farmer information and ES. The dependence on external inputs is established as a critical point, which could constitute a threat to the sustainability of the production system, these findings can play an important role in a decision-making process.

AB  - Wildlife can be exposed to human pharmaceuticals via prey that have accumulated the compounds from wastewater, surface water, sediment, and soil. One factor affecting internal absorption of pharmaceuticals is bioaccessibility, the proportion of the compound that enters solution in the gastrointestinal tract. Currently, the bioaccessibility of most pharmaceuticals in prey remains unknown for most wildlife species. The authors evaluated the potential of a 2-compartment in vitro gastrointestinal tract model to compare the bioaccessibility of the antidepressant fluoxetine from invertebrate prey for birds and mammals. Samples of gizzard (or stomach) and intestinal-phase digestive juices were obtained from the in vitro models along with the residual solid material. High-performance liquid chromatographic analysis revealed that the bioaccessibility of fluoxetine in the avian in vitro models was statistically significantly lower than that in the mammalian models as a percentage of what was recovered; however, there were no statistically or biologically significant interspecies difference in terms of the amount recovered per gram of "food" inserted at the start of the simulation. This in vitro model provides a useful method of comparing the bioaccessibility of pharmaceuticals in different prey for species with different gastrointestinal conditions. There is merit for ecological risk assessments in further developing this in vitro approach to improve estimates of internal exposure for organics. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB  - In response to peatland degradation by human activities worldwide, restoration through gully blocking is now being implemented in an attempt to return valuable ecological and hydrological services to degraded systems. Re-establishing these services requires an understanding of how systems have formed and evolved in order to establish conditions that assist with physical and ecological recovery. However, management of peatlands and swamps continues without prior investigation into the environmental history of these ecosystems. This study investigates stratigraphy, sediment ages and peat forming potential within three Temperate Highland Peat Swamps on Sandstone in the Blue Mountains, NSW. These swamps are listed as Endangered Ecological Communities under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cwlth) and the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 (NSW). High discontinuity in sediment structure, peat forming potential and timeframes of swamp initiation were observed across the three swamps. This localised variation reflects the complex geomorphic processes acting within and between these systems. Such data provides scientists and managers with key indicators to assess timeframes over which infilling, vegetation establishment and peat formation occurs. These tools can guide prioritisation, conservation and financial expenditure for the management and rehabilitation of temperate peat swamps.

AB  - This paper presents a method for assessing environmental performance in industrial operations. The method was applied to three logistical operations in an industrial supply chain performed by a single operator: road transportation, warehousing, and urban transportation. Environmental performance was treated as a complex object and was structured according to the following five criteria: atmospheric emissions, liquid effluents, solid waste, natural and energy resources, and managerial and legal regulations. The first four criteria address a direct impact on the environment, whereas the last is a necessary condition for the first four to have a satisfactory performance. Six experts in environmental management prioritized the criteria and defined sets of indicators for the field appraisal. The indicators were expected to be correlated for the same criteria. The validity of the indicators was assessed through questionnaires answered by six managers of the operation. Finally, three overall indices corresponding to the environmental performance of the three logistical operations were calculated for the operations and were found to be 73.58, 79.21, and 76.28% (higher is better). These indicate good results because the maximum performance is expected to be 100%. This environmental performance assessment can aid in reformulating the environmental strategies embedded in the operational strategy of the company.

AB  - The colonizing ability, catholic habitat utilization and wide distribution of house mice (Mus domesticus, Rutty) are indicators of their ecological resilience. Numerous studies have been made of commensal, caged and free-living mouse populations though few have assessed the relative importance of physiological and genetical components of adaptability in a simple ecosystem. This paper reports such findings, derived from live-trapping which formed part of an inter-disciplinary study of adaptability in a feral population of house mice living on a small Scottish island (57 ha).
   The population size ranged from 450-3250 animals. A high proportion of mice showed home-range tenacity, though 15-20% shifted their range during winter. This 'churning' of the population is consistent with the island population forming an effectively panmictic unit rather than fragmented demes. The breeding season, survival of individuals and change in population size related to patterns of gross climatic variation (temperature and rainfall) so that rates of reproduction and survival were lowest in cold, wet conditions. Thermo regulatory adjustment of the mice to lowered ambient temperatures and its contribution to overwinter survival are discussed. Genetical monomorphism of May Island mice is discussed in relation to their biological performance compared with other populations, especially that of the ecologically comparable Skokholm Island (Wales),

AB  - The article provides brief geobotanical characteristics of plant communities of three populations of R. iliensis Chrshan. found in the floodplains of the Ili and Sharyn rivers, as well as presents the morpho-anatomical structure of vegetative organs (stem and leaf) of the species under study. R. iliensis Chrshan. is undoubtedly a rare, endangered species of the flora of Kazakhstan. Its distribution area is shrinking from year to year as a result of the anthropogenic pressure on the environment. The biometric indicators of vegetative organs in the samples collected from populations 1 and 2 were approximately the same. The indicators of the samples collected from population 3 differed substantially. This is a completely natural process, since there are substantial differences in the climatic conditions of the upper and lower parts of the basin where the Ili River flows: a sharp increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation from high to low hypsometric levels of the basin. Moreover, there is a gradual aridization of the territory from east to west. Naturally, this entails a change in both soil and vegetation cover as well as leaves its mark on the morpho-anatomical structure of vegetative organs. With this in mind, the authors recommend continuous monitoring of the state of the populations at the three sites where R. iliensis Chrshan. was found.

AB  - Predators such as seabirds are often used as bio-indicators of the marine environment. This is based on the assumption that changes in seabird populations are driven by changes in their prey. We tested this assumption in a High Arctic seabird community by assessing the relationships between the diet, body condition, and breeding performance of 4 ecologically different species: the little auk AIM alle, black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla, Brunnich's guillemot Uria lomvia, and glaucous gull Larus hyperboreus, breeding in Svalbard, Norway. Interannual changes in seabird diet (2009-2015) were assessed by estimating their carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios (delta N-15 and delta C-13) during the breeding and non-breeding seasons (i.e. using blood and feather tissues). We found interannual variation in the isotopic ratios during both seasons in all 4 species. These variations differed among species, thus suggesting dietary changes, instead of changes in isotopic baselines, as the most plausible mechanism underlying such patterns. We also found that seabirds had a lower average hatching success when the average delta N-15 during the previous non-breeding season was higher. Our results suggest that changes in the average prey composition during the non-breeding season may partially explain changes in breeding performance of Svalbard seabirds.

AB  - The capacity of fluvial potholes to trap sediments, together with the geochemical analysis of their stored sediments for environmental assessment, is an overlooked research topic in small bedrock rivers. The present exploratory study is focused on this issue. It was developed in a small river over rock, in the inland territory of Galicia (NW Iberian Peninsula). The study started from an analysis of the inventoried fluvial potholes to identify suitable forms for sampling, and the collection of sediment samples within them. After this, the determination of the grain texture, mineralogy and content of major and trace elements in sediments were carried out. Potholes with maximum vertical depth from 25 cm to 1 m, located in central and sidewall sectors of the bedrock channel, provided the best conditions for sediment sampling. The sediments collected from six potholes showed predominance of coarse-medium grain size and sand fraction. The rough contents of the major and even trace elements are related with the nature of the more refractory minerals of the bedrock. An adequate sampling strategy, considering grain-size fractions, show potential to use trace elements as environmental indicators.

AB  - Wetland carbon storage is an important and environmentally sensitive ecosystem service. Carbon burial in the floodplain lakes of the Pantanal (tropical South America) appears to have varied during the late Quaternary, but several paleolimnological studies have recorded unusually high sediment organic carbon content from similar to 7.3 to 6.0 cal kyr BP in lakes connected to the Upper Paraguay River. We conducted a multi-indicator (phytoliths, sponge spicules, and geochemistry) study of a sediment core from Lake Caceres (Bolivia), and found evidence for enhanced organic carbon burial during the middle Holocene that provides insights into the flooding history of the Upper Paraguay River. delta(13)C(org)and C/N data suggest that organic matter deposited at that time in Lake Caceres was from macrophytes. Similar datasets from three other floodplain lakes are consistent with this finding. We suggest that enhanced carbon burial occurred when lake levels declined under relatively dry climate conditions, which increased the littoral area at the expense of open water and captured floating macrophyte islands. This study sheds new light on hydroclimate controls on carbon cycling in the Pantanal wetlands, and improves interpretations of geochemical measures on bulk organic matter in floodplain lake cores.

AB  - Preseason abundance forecasts drive management of US West Coast salmon fisheries, yet little is known about how environmental variability influences forecast performance. We compared forecasts of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) against returns for (i) key California-Oregon ocean fishery stocks and (ii) high priority prey stocks for endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales (Orcinus orca) in Puget Sound, Washington. We explored how well environmental indices (at multiple locations and time lags) explained performance of forecasts based on different methods (i.e. sibling-based, production-based, environment-based, or recent averages), testing for nonlinear threshold dynamics. For the California stocks, no index tested explained >50% of the variation in forecast performance, but spring Pacific Decadal Oscillation and winter North Pacific Index during the year of return explained >40% of the variation for the sibling-based Sacramento Fall Chinook forecast, with nonlinearity and apparent thresholds. This suggests that oceanic conditions experienced by adults (after younger siblings returned) have the most impact on sibling-based forecasts. For Puget Sound stocks, we detected nonlinear/threshold relationships explaining >50% of the variation with multiple indices and lags. Environmental influences on preseason forecasts may create biases that render salmon fisheries management more or less conservative, and therefore could motivate the development of ecosystem-based risk assessments.

AB  - Cushion plants are a key Arctic, Antarctic, and alpine growth form, with many cushion-forming species strongly affecting community structure in abiotically stressful environments. Despite their ecological importance, there is little information about what drives the distribution of species exhibiting this growth form. This study investigates the determinants of the distribution of a cushion plant species, Euphorbia clavarioides at (1) a fine scale, using field-collected predictors from an alpine landscape; and (2) a broad scale, using distribution records and climate data across the species' distributional range. At the fine scale, the species was locally rare (occurring in about 4 percent of samples) and may be limited to specific microsites by interspecific competition with taller-growing species. Broad-scale species distribution modeling showed that both temperature and rainfall are important in predicting the distribution of E. clavarioides with a higher probability of occurrence in areas with higher annual precipitation and mean annual temperatures < 15 degrees C. Given the species' sensitivity to competition and abiotic conditions (high temperatures and low precipitation), E. clavarioides may be vulnerable to environmental changes. Therefore, assuming that other cushion plant species exhibit similar patterns, species of this growth form may be particularly useful indicators of change in alpine, Arctic, and Antarctic areas.

AB  - The use of non-native invertebrate biological control agents (IBCAs) in Europe is not covered by a Directive equivalent to that which regulates biocontrol with microorganisms or the genetic modification of crop plants. Regulation is at the discretion of individual member states and largely derived from national legislation on pesticides, plant health or environmental protection. There is no EU country with regulation of IBCAs that requires information on the microbial symbiont content of candidate species, and in the absence of horizontal transfer under natural conditions, this policy is unlikely to change. Although there have been few reported negative effects linked to the import and release of IBCAs, a number of countries have introduced or revised their regulatory frameworks in recent years. This article reviews major developments in the regulation and environmental risk assessment (ERA) of IBCAs in Europe over the last 10 years including: the fragmented pattern of regulation between countries, variation in information requirements for release licences, format and methods of ERA for different taxonomic groups of IBCAs, use and updating of the European Plant Protection Organisation Positive List, sources of expert advice on ERA data, communication between IBCA regulators, and options for the provision of international leadership to coordinate regulatory and ERA-related issues with IBCA-based biocontrol in Europe.

AB  - The widespread, severe negative impacts of human activities on Earth's ecosystems over the past few decades have highlighted the importance of continuous and up-to-date monitoring of ecosystems health. On the other hand, it has been proven that the use of remote sensing technology in environmental studies can lead to accurate and reliable results with spending less cost and time. This research attempts to use remote sensing indicators and the framework of Vigour, Organization, Resilience, and Services (VORS) to assess ecosystem health by introducing Remotely Sensed Ecosystem Health Assessment (RSEHA) Model. By applying 10 spatiotemporal indices, ecosystem health has been assessed in Lake Urmia Basin (LUB) during the years 2001-2014. The results showed that the health status of LUB in its different parts varied from 'very strong' to 'very poor'. The health status around LUB has changed from 'poor' to 'very poor', while it has improved, especially in cultivated lands. The health of the lake has been sacrificed in favour of the development of agricultural areas in the basin. Based on validation results, the RSEHA model can determine the ecosystem conditions at pixel level at any time at reasonable cost and accuracy.

AB  - Aiming to enrich the knowledge a bout the flora of savannas, this pa per studied the composition and structure of the bryophyte community of Park Savanna areas in Marajo Island - PA. Biological material was collected within 60 100-m(2) plots equally distributed in the dry season of 2016 and the rainy season of 2017 in five Park Savanna areas (SP-I to SP-V). The composition, density, richness and diversity of species and presence of indicator species were compared between the sampled areas and seasons. The species were classified according to the substrates colonized and ecological groups of light tolerance. Significant differences in SP-V indicated that the area was the main factor influencing the composition of bryophytes (p: 0.0001), with five indicator species. There were also significant differences ill density (p = 0.0001168) and richness (p = 0.0001317) of bryophytes between seasons (p-value = 0.3393; p-value = 0.04065; p: 0.1081). There was a predominance of generalist (25 spp.) and corticolous (728 individuals) species, which were widely distributed in the sampled areas. Therefore, the structure of the bryophyte communities was not influenced by seasonality, and this indicates that these plants are adapted to the environmental conditions.

AB  - A micronucleus test is a common test used as a biological indicator reflecting environmental genotoxicity caused by some of the hazardous substances' presence, and due to this it is recommended as one of the indicators for marine environmental status assessment. To determine the status of the environment, herring blood samples were collected in 2014-2017 in the southern Baltic Sea area at seven fishing grounds. The conducted analysis revealed that there is no significant correlation between the number of micronuclei in erythrocytes and sampling locations each year. This could be a result of a similar chemical status of the assessed areas as well as similar physico-chemical characteristics, but also the individual condition of the examined fish has to be taken into account as well as the their size parameters (length and weight). Statistical analysis showed statistically significant differences between the results over the years of research. The highest median values in all locations occurred in 2017, in which they were in the range of 0.57-1.37, probably as a result of longer lengths. The threshold value was exceeded in 2016 and 2017 in all locations, indicating inadequate status of the marine environment.

AB  - Contamination of natural environments by metals is basically due to anthropogenic activities such as iron and steel industries, mining, electroplating and tannery. As a consequence, proliferating microbes in such environments are subjected to stress conditions which induce decreases of the microbial diversity and biomass, particularly the bacterial one. This study reports statistical significant reductions of the total organic carbon content (70 %), urease activity (54 %), microbial biomass (47 %), and bacterial load (3080 %) in soil samples containing permissible levels of metals according to the Venezuelan legislation. Besides, the basal respiration/microbial biomass ratio increased 58 % respect to the witness soil. The bacterial diversity was severally reduced and only 12 bacterial morphotypes were isolated from agar LB plates supplemented with Cr3+, Cr6+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Zn2+, Fe2+, and Co2+ salts. Five of these strains were assigned to Rothia, Vibrio, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter and Raoultella bacterial genera. The pH (9) and metal concentrations (Cr3+, Cr6+ and Ni2+) were the most important parameters involved in reducing the bacterial diversity and load. The reported data should constitute an alarm call to the Venezuelan environmental authority to revise and set the metal permissible levels in natural environments, in such a way the soil biochemical and physiological parameters are not negatively affected; besides, microbial load and diversity should be included as health bioindicators to soils.

AB  - Conservation of natural resources can be challenging in a rapidly changing world and require collaborative efforts for success. Conservation planning is the process of deciding how to protect, conserve, and enhance or minimize loss of natural and cultural resources. Establishing conservation targets (also called indicators or endpoints), the measurable expressions of desired resource conditions, can help with site-specific up to landscape-scale conservation planning. Using conservation targets and tracking them through time can deliver benefits such as insight into ecosystem health and providing early warnings about undesirable trends. We describe an approach using value-focused thinking to develop statewide conservation targets for Florida. Using such an approach allowed us to first identify stakeholder objectives and then define conservation targets to meet those objectives. Stakeholders were able to see how their shared efforts fit into the broader conservation context, and also anticipate the benefits of multi-agency and -organization collaboration. We developed an iterative process for large-scale conservation planning that included defining a shared framework for the process, defining the conservation targets themselves, as well as developing management and monitoring strategies for evaluation of their effectiveness. The process we describe is applicable to other geographies where multiple parties are seeking to implement collaborative, large-scale biological planning. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Recreation ecology, the study of environmental consequences of outdoor recreation activities and their effective management, is a relatively new field of scientific study having emerged over the last 50 years. During this time, numerous studies have improved our understanding of how use-related, environmental and managerial factors affect ecological conditions and processes. Most studies have focused on vegetation and soil responses to recreation-related trampling on trails and recreation sites using indicators such as percent vegetation cover and exposed mineral soil. This applied approach has and will continue to yield important information for land managers. However, for the field to advance, more attention needs to be given to other ecosystem attributes and to the larger aspects of environmental conservation occurring at landscape scales. This article is an effort at initiating a dialog on needed advances in the field. We begin by reviewing broadly generalizable knowledge of recreation ecology, to separate what is known from research gaps. Then, based on the authors' perspective of research in the USA and North America, several research directions are suggested as essential for continued progress in this field including theoretical development, broadening scale, integration with other disciplines, and examination of synergistic effects.

Over the past 20 years, due to abnormally high air temperatures and increased aridity of the territory, the number of forest fires has increased 1.5 times, and the area more than 5 times. The article discusses the differences in the influence of meteorological factors on the occurrence and development of fires in two climatically contrasted forestries of the Republic of Buryatia (in the humid Baikalskoe forestry and in arid Zaigraevskoe). It was revealed that the influence of average monthly temperatures on the occurrence and development of fires is not significant compared to the effect of liquid precipitation in the arid Zaigraevskoe forestry. A statistically significant closeness of the relationship between soil moisture according to satellite measurements and fire indicators in both forestries was established with a confidence level of 95%. The VEGA remote sensing database does not have detailed accuracy, but it determines the qualitative trends in soil moisture change over vast areas (pixel size is about 40 km). For instrumental measurements in situ and verification of satellite information on soil moisture, it is proposed to use the measurement data of the atmospheric-soil measuring complex.

AB  - Regions of rainfall gradients at desert margins are areas where eco-geomorphic changes and degradation in response to global warming and grazing are most intensive. Assessment and understanding of the consequences of global warming and human disturbance of these vulnerable ecosystems requires detailed information regarding the spatial variation of soil and vegetation properties and their dependence on rainfall. Such detailed information is still of limited availability. This study aimed to rectify this shortcoming by analyzing data on the chemical and spectral properties of soil samples collected along the Judean Desert climatic gradient. Six clusters of typical chemical soil properties were identified. Dependencies of clusters' chemical properties (total iron, organic and inorganic carbon) on annual rainfall amounts were found to be significant. Two spectral Landsat TM band ratios introduced to assess soil conditions showed significant correlations with these chemical properties. These ratios were found to be higher correlated than individual chemical properties with average rainfall suggesting that spectral data may represent a broader range of chemical, physical, and biological site properties. Examining the three-way relationships between soil chemical properties, their spectral reflectance characteristics and rainfall, facilitates a better understanding of the generalized trends along the climatic gradient and more specifically of modes of transition from semi-arid to arid zones.

AB  - Chaco forests have high structural and floristic diversity, due to their soil conditions, their fire regimes and the intense logging that they have undergone. Arthropods can be good indicators of habitat heterogeneity, ecosystem biodiversity, as well as the stress of the environment. We carried out a taxonomic and a functional description of the epigeal arthropod assemblages of the soil surface in a quebracho forest. Samples were taken in convex areas with bromeliads (EB) and in flat areas with grasses (PS). Pitfall traps were used to capture arthropods for five consecutive days in three seasons (spring, summer and winter). In spring, we evaluated different physical and chemical characteristics of soil and litter. We captured 1668 individuals from 78 morphospecies; the ants are the most abundant taxa and the Coleoptera had the largest species richness. Lycosidae spiders were the most abundant spiders and Carabidae and Scarabaeidae presented the highest abundance among the Coleoptera. The species composition, trophic structure of epigeal arthropods and ant functional groups differed among seasons and between microsites. The higher ash content and conductivity in microsites EB is attributed to the contribution of shrubs leaves, which are rich in calcium, magnesium and potassium. The physical and chemical conditions of the litter-soil interface could determine the presence or abundance of detritivorous species at different microsites, accelerating the processes of litter decomposition.

AB  - We studied habitat selection of three-toed woodpecker (TTW) in relation to forest structural variables, habitat types and hydrological conditions in north-eastern Poland. Based on known locations of 34 breeding pairs and the data on location of forest areas with high conservation value (referred to as Biologically Important Forests), we created a habitat prediction model for TTW using a Maxent algorithm. We found that this species most often selected breeding sites characterized by high contribution of old-growth stands with uneven vertical structure and considerable amount of very old trees of previous generations, as well as boreal spruce-dominated bogs and riverine forests. Such sites were preferred regardless of their actual protection status, which leads to the following conclusion: although existing forest reserves are very important to three-toed woodpecker, suitable habitats with similar characteristics can still be found outside protected areas and are also utilized by the species. However, such sites outside reserves are threatened by fragmentation due to timber extraction. Therefore it is recommended to protect these sites by either including them into existing reserves or putting them under special management schemes.
   The presented model can be applied in similar environmental conditions across lowland Europe, allowing for identification of representative habitat network for future conservation planning at landscape scale. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Earthworms have a major role in soils and are used as biological indicators for ecological risk assessment. Aporrectodea caliginosa s.s. is one of the dominant earthworm species in agroecosystems and a good candidate for ecotoxicological testing. In order to improve knowledge on its life cycle, we performed growth and reproduction experiments. These data were used to calibrate an energy-based model that displayed good descriptions of A. caliginosa life cycle parameters under different feeding conditions (ad libitum, food limitations, or absence of food). Here we showed that the maintenance costs were negligible, resulting in a linear growth in length when food was provided ad libitum (i.e., without any restriction). We also found that the switch from the juvenile to adult stage depended on the individual weight, and that the threshold weight was not influenced by the amount of provided food (horse dung). Moreover, we provided evidence that once adults, if they were not isolated from other individuals, the energy was entirely allocated to cocoon production, which only depended on the available food amount, without any effect of the earthworm density. Finally, we discussed the usefulness of our energy-based model to support the set up and analyses of ecotoxicological tests and experiments.

AB  - Free-living nematodes were investigated in the Mar Piccolo of Taranto (Ionian Sea), a semi-enclosed basin of strategic importance for its complex productive infrastructure but in need of remediation due to the alarming amounts of heavy metals and synthetic organic contaminants in the sediments. Abundance, genera composition, biodiversity and trophic traits of nematodes were related to the gradual transition from marine to more brackish conditions and to the varying levels of contaminants in different sub-areas of the basin. Nematodes were more abundant and diverse at the most marine site while low numbers and diversity characterized the most contaminated station. Going towards the innermost part of the basin, gradually increasing values of abundance and biodiversity were observed although the assemblage was susceptible to the organic enrichment caused by mussel farms. The use of nematodes as ecological indicators mirrored the response of the assemblage to the main patterns acting in the basin (High/Good scores at the most marine site and Poor/Bad scores at the most contaminated station), giving a clear indication of environmental quality to stakeholders/authority that can contribute to address remediation actions in contaminated sediments.

AB  - High abundance and widespread distribution of the archaeal phylum Bathyarchaeota in marine environment have been recognized recently, but knowledge about Bathyarchaeota in terrestrial settings and their correlation with environmental parameters is fairly limited. Here we reported the abundance of Bathyarchaeota members across different ecosystems and their correlation with environmental factors by constructing 16S rRNA clone libraries of peat from the Dajiuhu Peatland, coupling with bioinformatics analysis of 16S rRNA data available to date in NCBI database. In total, 1456 Bathyarchaeota sequences from 28 sites were subjected to UniFrac analysis based on phylogenetic distance and multivariate regression tree analysis of taxonomy. Both phylogenetic and taxon-based approaches showed that salinity, total organic carbon and temperature significantly influenced the distribution of Bathyarchaeota across different terrestrial habitats. By applying the ecological concept of 'indicator species', we identify 9 indicator groups among the 6 habitats with the most in the estuary sediments. Network analysis showed that members of Bathyarchaeota formed the "backbone" of archaeal community and often co-occurred with Methanomicrobia. These results suggest that Bathyarchaeota may play an important ecological role within archaeal communities via a potential symbiotic association with Methanomicrobia. Our results shed light on understanding of the biogeography, potential functions of Bathyarchaeota and environment conditions that influence Bathyarchaea distribution in terrestrial settings.

AB  - Bacteria are essential components of natural environments. They contribute to ecosystem functioning through roles as mutualists and pathogens for larger species, and as key components of food webs and nutrient cycles. Bacterial communities respond to environmental disturbances, and the tracking of these communities across space and time may serve as indicators of ecosystem health in areas of conservation concern. Recent advances in DNA sequencing of environmental samples allow for rapid and culture-free characterization of bacterial communities. Here we conduct the first metabarcoding survey of bacterial diversity in the waterholes of the Kruger National Park, South Africa. We show that eDNA can be amplified from waterholes and find strongly structured microbial communities, likely reflecting local abiotic conditions, animal ecology, and anthropogenic disturbance. Over timescales from days to weeks we find increased turnover in community composition, indicating bacteria may represent host-associated taxa of large vertebrates visiting the waterholes. Through taxonomic annotation we also identify pathogenic taxa, demonstrating the utility of eDNA metabarcoding for surveillance of infectious diseases. These samples serve as a baseline survey of bacterial diversity in the Kruger National Park, and in the future, spatially distinct microbial communities may be used as markers of ecosystem disturbance, or biotic homogenization across the park.

AB  - At the regional scale, although environmental factors are known to shape the distributions of belowground communities in terrestrial ecosystems, these environmental factors account for relatively low percentages of the variation in belowground communities. More of this variation might be explained by considering ecosystem stable isotopic values, which can provide insight into environmental conditions. Here, we investigated ecosystem (plant and soil) delta C-13 and delta N-15 values and belowground communities (microbes and nematodes) as well as environmental factors (climates, soils, and plants) across the Mongolian Plateau. The regression analyses showed that plant isotopic values were more closely associated with belowground communities than soil isotopic values, while ecosystem delta C-13 values were more closely associated with the belowground communities than ecosystem delta N-15 values. We also found isotopic values were more closely associated with nematode communities than microbial communities. Variation partioning analyses indicated that environmental variables together explained 16-45% of total variation in belowground communities. After isotopic variables were added as predictors to the variation partition analyses, the explanation of the variance was improved by 14-24% for microbial communities and was improved by 23-44% for nematode communities. These findings indicate that isotopic values could be used to predict the properties of belowground communities at a regional scale.

AB  - One of the main challenges to facilitate the classification of water bodies is to identify direct relationships between anthropogenic pressures and the behavior of biological organisms such as macrophytes in different environments including transitional areas. The investigation of many lagoons and ponds described here shows that macrophyte variables and the community composition have strong and univocal relationships with ecological parameters that are a measure of anthropogenic pressure on the ecological status of water bodies. The areas surveyed represent about 78% of the Italian transitional waters (169 sites sampled both in spring and fall). Anthropogenic impacts affect the availability of nutrients in the water column and surface sediments, causing changes in water transparency and phytoplankton concentration (as chlorophyll-a [Chl-a]) that act as the main drivers of variation for macrophyte assemblages, changing species dominance and the conditions that govern their presence or absence. The response of macrophytes to anthropogenic pressure is quite similar in all the examined transitional environments, even when the basin morphology, species richness and composition are different. Some taxa and species assemblages are so sensitive to environmental changes that monitoring them can be considered the most suitable and rapid method for assessing the quality of the environment they inhabit.

AB  - Charrs of the genus Salvelinus form distinct trophic morphs living in sympatry in numerous postglacial lakes. Here we demonstrate that charrs can diversify into amphipod foraging specialists and sedentary macrobenthos consumers in the shallow-water ecosystems. This pattern was revealed in three out of six lakes under exploration supported by differences in stomach content, trophic-transmitted parasite, and stable isotope ratio analyzes. The body shape and growth rate comparison indicates that this kind of trophic-based diversification emerges at a juvenile stage and is maintained throughout the whole life. The restriction in gene flow found between the morphs allows to propose the possibility for the hereditable-based specialization to evolve. We found that those diversification phenomena are possible only in the lakes situated in vicinity of the ocean coastline, while no evidence of this split was found for inland mountain lakes. We suggest that the trophic-based diversification in the littoral ecosystems is accounted for the heterogeneity in the ecological conditions and food resources' distribution linked to coastal wind action. This phenomenon was previously reported for the charr in Lake Fjellfrosvatn, Scandinavia, so it seems to be some universal yet poorly described kind of disruptive selection pressure for northern latitude fishes.

AB  - The gut microbial communities of beetles play crucial roles in their adaptive capacities. Environmental factors such as temperature or nutrition naturally affect the insect microbiome, but a shift in local conditions like the population density on a host tree could also lead to changes in the microbiota. The emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, is an exotic wood borer that causes environmental and economic damage to ash trees in North America. This study aimed to describe the taxonomic structure of the EAB gut microbiome and explore its potential relationship with borer population size. The number of EAB adults collected per tree through a 75 km transect from an epicenter allowed the creation of distinct classes of population density. The Gammaproteobacteria and Ascomycota predominated in bacterial and fungal communities respectively, as determined by sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the fungal internal transcribed spacer ITS2. Species richness and diversity of the bacterial community showed significant dependence on population density. Moreover, alpha-diversity and beta-diversity analysis revealed some indicator amplicon sequence variants suggesting that the plasticity of the gut microbiome could be related to the EAB population density in host trees.

AB  - Sustainability assessment of a waste management system is a very complex problem for numerous reasons. Firstly, it is a problem of environmental assessment, economic viability and social acceptability, and also a choice of the most practical waste treatment technique, taking into account all the specific areas in which a waste management system is implemented. For these reasons, among others, it is very important to benchmark, cooperate and exchange experiences in areas with similar characteristics. In this study, a comparison of waste management scenarios in the Cities of Ni and Sofia was performed. Based on the amount and composition of municipal solid waste, and taking into account local specifics (economic conditions, social acceptance, etc.), different scenarios were developed: landfilling without energy recovery, landfilling with energy recovery, mechanical-biological treatment, anaerobic digestion with biogas utilization and incineration with energy recovery. Scenario ranking was done using multi-criteria analysis and 12 indicators were chosen as the criteria. The obtained results show that the most sustainable scenario in both case studies is the mechanical-biological treatment (recycling, composting and Refuse Derived Fuel production). Having in mind that this scenario is the current waste management system in Sofia, these results can help decision-makers in the City of Ni in choosing a successful and sustainable waste management system.

AB  - This study investigated the environmental quality of the Bizerte Lagoon (Tunisia) through an integrated approach that combined environmental, biogeochemical, and living benthic foraminiferal analyses. Specifically, we analyzed the physicochemical parameters of the water and sediment. The textural, mineralogical, and geochemical characteristics of the sediment, including total organic carbon, total nitrogen, simultaneously extracted metals (SEM), acid volatile sulfides (AVS), chlorophyll a, CaCO3, and changes in bacterial populations and carbon isotopes were measured. The SEM/AVS values indicated the presence of relatively high concentrations of toxic metals in only some areas. Foraminiferal assemblages were dominated by species such as A. parkinsoniana (20-91%), Bolivina striatula (<40%), Hopkinsina atlantica (<17%), and Bolivina ordinaria (<15%) that cannot be considered typical of impacted coastal lagoons both in Mediterranean and northeast Atlantic regions. The results of this work suggest that Bizerte Lagoon is a unique setting. This lagoon is populated by typical marine species that invaded this ecosystem, attracted not only by the prevailing favorable environmental conditions but also by the abundance and quality of food. The results indicate that the metal pollution found in some areas have a negative impact on the assemblages of foraminifera. At present, however, this negative impact is not highly alarming.

AB  - Analyses based on complete faunas are more reliable than those based on a few species. To minimize errors in identification due to geographical and ecological variations in skeletal morphology, as well as taxonomic "noise" caused by ontogenetic stages, the polycystine radiolarian fauna was grouped into 20 high-rank taxa (HRT); 12 Spumellaria and 8 Nassellaria families. Every region or local province has a characteristic "HRT-assemblage" on either the family/subfamily or the suborder/order level, with very specific quantitative ratios. The polycystine assemblages of the Norwegian fjords and the Norwegian Sea contain essentially the same set of species, but data on the HRT show differences between the offshore and fjord associations, and between the main fjords and their tributaries. We show herein that HRT can be used not only in the Norwegian Sea, but also in most of the climatic zones of the Pacific. We used 21 published surface sediment samples along longitude 175 degrees E between latitudes 48 degrees N and 14 degrees S in the western Pacific Ocean, documenting the relationships between the modern distribution of radiolaria and the present oceanographic conditions. The low-rank and high-rank approaches gave nearly identical results for this data set. Factor analysis produced essentially the same four factors using low-rank and high-rank taxa, but with different eigenvalues. Temperature reconstruction based on the factor analysis of high-rank taxa was also successful.

AB  - Owing to their induction by metals metallothioneins (MTs) have been proposed as biomarkers of the metallic contamination of the environment. On the other hand, bivalves are regarded as very convenient bioindicators of the aquatic ecosystems and an extensive literature has been dedicated to their response to metals. Among studies supporting the involvement of MTs in metal detoxification some discrepancy appears due to inter- and intra-specific variations, or to heterogeneous exposure conditions. A lesser number of papers are dealing with the use of metallothionein levels as biomarkers, and sometimes they evidence that natural factors influencing metallothionein synthesis have to be taken into account before final conclusions can been drawn. Moreover, there is still a large number of non-intercalibrated protocols used to quantify amounts of metallothioneins in organisms. As comparisons are necessary to assess the relative abundance of metallothioneins in a studied species, more work has to be completed before such comparisons could be validated. In the present paper we wish to establish the limits of the use of mollusc metallothioneins as a biomarker of aquatic ecosystem contamination by trace metals, using published and recent data as support for our conclusions and perspectives.

AB  - Microorganisms are fundamental to the functioning of Antarctic ecosystems. Although microbial biomass can be immense in Southern Ocean blooms and freshwater cyanobacterial mats, species richness is generally more restricted than it is in temperate regions. However, there are representatives of a broad variety of taxa providing a diverse gene pool. Species diversity may be low while metabolic flexibility is high so that a few strains can provide most necessary functions. In this context, biodiversity is the sum of biological potential. This Special Issue highlights aspects of microbial ecology that can be studied only in Antarctica or which are defined most clearly in Antarctic habitats. Relatively simple microbial communities, or conspicuous species within them, can be used as indicators of microbial processes and responses to environmental change. These include the palaeological record of benthic diatoms and response of soil cyanobacterial communities to regional warming and UV-B stress. The climatic conditions and relict habitats of the Antarctic dry valleys are a valuable analogue for detecting microbial life and diversity on Mars. The global microbial biodiversity initiative Diversitas and international Antarctic networks such as BIOTAS (Biological Investigations of Terrestrial Antarctic Systems) harness taxonomic and ecophysiological expertize to understand better these unique polar ecosystems.

AB  - 1. Leaf litter constitutes the major source of organic matter and energy in woodland stream ecosystems. A substantial part of leaf litter entering running waters may be buried in the streambed as a consequence of flooding and sediment movement. While decomposition of leaf litter in surface waters is relatively well understood, its fate when incorporated into river sediments, as well as the involvement of invertebrate and fungal decomposers in such conditions, remain poorly documented.
   2. We tested experimentally the hypotheses that the small interstices of the sediment restrict the access of the largest shredders to buried organic matter without compromising that of aquatic hyphomycetes and that fungal decomposers in the hyporheic zone, at least partly, compensate for the role of invertebrate detritivores in the benthic zone.
   3. Alder leaves were introduced in a stream either buried in the sediment (hyporheic), buried after 2 weeks of exposure at the sediment surface (benthic-hyporheic), or exposed at the sediment surface for the entire experiment (benthic). Leaf decomposition was markedly faster on the streambed surface than in the two other treatments (2.1- and 2.8-fold faster than in the benthic-hyporheic and hyporheic treatments, respectively).
   4. Fungal assemblages were generally less diverse in the hyporheic habitat with a few species tending to be relatively favoured by such conditions. Both fungal biomass and sporulation rates were reduced in the hyporheic treatment, with the leaves subject to the benthic-hyporheic treatment exhibiting an intermediate pattern. The initial 2-week stage in the benthic habitat shaped the fungal assemblages, even for leaves later subjected to the hyporheic conditions.
   5. The abundance and biomass of shredders drastically decreased with burial, except for Leuctra spp., which increased and was by far the most common leaf-associated taxon in the hyporheic zone. Leuctra spp. was one of the rare shredder taxa displaying morphological characteristics that increased performance within the limited space of sediment interstices.
   6. The carbon budgets indicated that the relative contributions of the two main decomposers, shredders and fungi, varied considerably depending on the location within the streambed. While the shredder biomass represented almost 50% of the initial carbon transformed after 80 days in the benthic treatment, its contribution was < 0.3% in the hyporheic one and 2.0% in the combined benthic-hyporheic treatment. In contrast, mycelial and conidial production in the permanently hyporheic environment accounted for 12% of leaf mass loss, i.e. 2-3 times more than in the two other conditions. These results suggest that the role of fungi is particularly important in the hyporheic zone.
   7. Our findings indicate that burial within the substratum reduces the litter breakdown rate by limiting the access of both invertebrate and fungal decomposers to leaves. As a consequence, the hyporheic zone may be an important region of organic matter storage in woodland streams and serve as a fungal inoculum reservoir contributing to further dispersal. Through the temporary retention of litter by burial, the hyporheic zone must play a significant role in the carbon metabolism and overall functioning of headwater stream ecosystems.

AB  - Soundscape ecology has gained prominence in the monitoring of marine ecosystems due to its non-invasive characteristics and spatiotemporal efficiency. However, the development of ecoacoustic indices is a recent field that needs to address many challenges to fulfill its great potential, especially in the context of marine ecology. Here, we reviewed the most recent studies that used ecoacoustic indices in marine ecosystems. The literature search was conducted in the Scopus (Elsevier) database and used the chain referral sampling in the list of references of each publication. In total, we identified 27 publications that used ecoacoustic indices inmarine environments such as coral reefs, rocky shores, coastal regions, and offshore regions. A total of four major limitations were identified and addressed, including: the challenge to find adequate acoustic bioindicators; the lack of a universal index or standardized protocol; the issue that most acoustic indices applied to marine environments have been developed to be used in terrestrial environments; and the lack of studies that have tested ecoacoustic indices under different environmental conditions. Once these challenges are addressed, the analysis of marine sound based on the interpretation of ecoacoustic indices has a great potential to become one of the most cost-effective tools for monitoring environments.

AB  - Changes in hydrometeorological conditions that play a major role in the life of the Caspian Sea are combined with the impact on its ecosystem of economic activity, one of the types of which is pollution of the marine environment. Much attention is paid to environmental safety in the search and exploration of hydrocarbon deposits in the North Caspian, because without it, neither its high biological productivity, nor the fishery value can be maintained The Caspian Sea, and especially its northern shallow part, is a highly productive body of water. Such extremely high productivity of the Caspian is combined with the relative poverty of the biological diversity of this reservoir. A significant part of the Caspian hydrobionts is relict. This part of the sea is the richest in biological productivity. And it is not by chance that the rich nutrients and the organic substrate of the waters of the Northern Caspian have a great influence on the diversity of the flora and fauna of the entire Caspian. However, at present, the Caspian Sea and especially the Northern Sea, like the other seas of the world, are experiencing increasing anthropogenic impact, which is manifested in pollution with oil products and heavy metals, as well as in active shipping and hydro-construction.

AB  - In aquatic environments, especially in shaded patches (where primary production is limited by the low-light conditions), energy flow and organic-matter cycling are fundamental for maintaining a system's metabolism. The breakdown of this organic detritus is a key process for its remobilization into the trophic chains. Our objective was to describe the temporal dynamics of leaf breakdown in a tropical stream with a riparian canopy degraded by the extraction of palm trees. The vertical input of leaves was collected monthly in a natural stream and incubated for 30 days in a stream with a degraded canopy. Leaf breakdown rates (k), and leaf associated microbial biomass, fungal sporulation and invertebrate community were estimated. Higher values of k were observed in summer most likely due to high temperatures (increased metabolic activity) and rainfall (higher physical abrasion). Aquatic invertebrates (mainly shredders) and total microorganisms showed no overall influence on leaf breakdown rates. Therefore, in this large temporal sampling, water flow, temperature and precipitation were the factors controlling k in this stream. There were no observed changes in k compared to natural environments, most likely because the canopy degradation is a structural modification and does not represent a source of pollution.

AB  - Rangelands occupy more than 80% of the agricultural land in Kyrgyzstan. At least 30% of Kyrgyz pasture areas are considered to be subject to vegetation and soil degradation. Since animal husbandry is the economic basis to sustain people's livelihoods, rangeland degradation presents a threat for the majority of the population. We present for the first time an ecological assessment of different pasture types in a remote area of the Naryn Oblast, using vegetation and soils as indicators of rangeland conditions. We analysed the current degree of utilization (grazing pressure), the amount of biomass, soil samples, and vegetation data, using cluster analysis as well as ordination techniques. Winter pastures (kyshtoo) are characterized by higher pH values (average of 7.27) and lower organic matter contents (average of 12.83%) compared to summer pastures (dzailoo) with average pH values of 6.03 and average organic matter contents of 21.05%. Additionally, summer pastures show higher above-ground biomass, and higher species richness and diversity. Our results support the hypothesis that winter pastures, which are located near settlements, suffer from over-utilisation, while the more distant summer pastures are subjected to much lower grazing pressure.

AB  - Wave energy converter (WEC) arrays deployed in coastal regions may create physical disturbances, potentially resulting in environmental stresses. Presently, limited information is available on the nature of these physical disturbance or the resultant effects. A quantitative Spatial Environmental Assessment Tool (SEAT) for evaluating the potential effects of wave energy converter (WEC) arrays on nearshore hydrodynamics and sediment transport is presented for the central Oregon coast (USA) through coupled numerical model simulations of an array of WECs. Derived climatological wave conditions were used as inputs to the model to allow for the calculation of risk metrics associated with various hydrodynamic and sediment transport variables such as maximum shear stress, bottom velocity, and change in bed elevation. The risk maps provided simple, quantitative, and spatially-resolved means of evaluating physical changes in the vicinity of a hypothetical WEC array in response to varying wave conditions. The near-field risk of sediment mobility was determined to be moderate in the lee of the densely spaced array, where the potential for increased sediment deposition could result in benthic habitat alteration. Modifications to the nearshore sediment deposition and erosion patterns were observed near headlands and topographic features, which could have implications for littoral sediment transport. The results illustrate the benefits of a risk evaluation tool for facilitating coastal resource management at early market marine renewable energy sites.

AB  - Predicted pH decreases in ocean surface waters of similar to 0.3-0.5 and 0.7-0.8 pH units (for 2100 and 2300, respectively) are expected to negatively affect calcification processes and physiological performances of many marine organisms. Here we evaluated the response of important parameters such as growth, mortality, oxygen consumption, and mineralization of transplanted Pinna nobilis juveniles in the naturally acidified waters of a CO2 vent system. Our field experiments show a general decrease of physiological responses of juveniles for the studied parameters along a decreasing pH gradient, even if significant effects are only observed under pH values of 7.6 units ("extreme" pH). In particular, the mortality rate increased from 10-30 % over the study period at control conditions to 60-70 % at extreme pH values. We conclude that near-future decreases in pH (decreases of 0.3-0.5 pH units) may not have a significant effect on performance of P. nobilis juveniles, while predicted longer-term decreases (decreases of 0.7-0.8 pH units) could affect the survival of the species. The combination of laboratory experiments with the assessment of naturally acidified environments can provide further insights into the threshold pH affecting the performance of vulnerable marine species.

AB  - This study is the first to report on the relationships between immature mosquitoes (larvae and pupae) and landscape and environmental habitat characteristics in wetlands associated with row crop agriculture. Indicator species analysis (ISA) was used to test for associations among mosquito species and groups of wetland sites with similar Landscape Development Intensity (LDI) values. Results indicated that Anopheles quadrimaculatus, Culex erraticus, and Psorophora columbiae were associated with agricultural wetlands (LDI > 2.0), whereas Anopheles crucians and Culex territans were associated with forested reference wetlands (LDI < 2.0) in both wet and dry years. The species fidelity to wetland type, regardless of the hydrologic regime, demonstrates these species are robust indicators of wetland condition. Data on immature mosquito assemblages were compared to selected landscape and environmental habitat variables using Akaike's Information Criterion (AlCc) model selection. LDI indices, dissolved oxygen concentration, the proportion of emergent vegetation, and the proportion of bare ground in wetlands were important factors associated with the selected mosquito species. These results indicate that LDI indices are useful in predicting the distributions of disease vectors or other nuisance mosquito species across broad geographic areas. Additionally, these results suggest mosquitoes are valuable bioindicators of wetland condition that reflect land use and hydrologic variability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Diatoms respond to toxicants in lotic systems, and they are commonly considered to be sensitive indicators in environmental safety assessment. In addition to the structural characteristics of the algal populations, recent studies have shown that endpoints such as nuclear anomalies or diatom motility measures can be affected quickly by environmental changes. We sought to determine if cell density, cell size, nuclear anomalies and motility of the diatom Nitzschia palea were useful indicators of sediment quality from agricultural streams. For this purpose, we exposed cultures of the diatom to elutriates from sediments of a stream that flows through an intensive agricultural area, and measured the responses of the populations for 7 days in laboratory tests. The bioassays showed that motility measures in Nitzschia palea and the condition of their nuclear membranes rapidly reflected the effects of sediment quality after only 48 h of exposure; mean cell density and length were affected by day 7. The sediment elutriates affected cell movements by shortening the total path length and decreasing cell velocity; they also increased the number of cells with nuclear membrane breakage. Our results from these bioassays show that diatom motility measurements and the condition of the nuclei might be indicators that respond faster to impacts than the traditional structural parameters, such as cell density, specific composition of the assemblage or diversity metrics of the algal communities more often used in biomonitoring.

AB  - Forecasting abundance and understanding year class strength is key to the ecosystem-based fisheries management of herring and other small pelagic fish. Using the San Francisco Bay herring population, we tested the hypothesis that abundance (spawning stock biomass; SSB) could be predicted prior to the commencement of annual fisheries using estimates of i) previous SSB (SSBlag1), ii) young-of-the-year production (YOY), and iii) environmental conditions. A time series model including SSBlag1, YOY lagged 3 years (YOYlag3), and environmental conditions in the season before spawning explained 67% of the variance in annual biomass, with better predictive error in comparison with simpler models. YOYlag3 was by far the strongest predictor. It was robust over the entire study period (1980-2017) and also for a more limited period (1991-2017) when observed variance in SSB increased. We attribute the predictive power of YOY productivity to age structure, as almost 70% of the population is comprised of young fish. We hypothesize that an age truncation effect, probably resulting from a combination of long-term environmental effects and fisheries impacts, supports this model, which effectively predicts year class strength. Assuming the population age structure remains the same in the future, our model provides management with an early warning indicator of upcoming SSB with a 3-year lead, which could be applied in harvest control rules.

AB  - Coastal waters are subject to great environmental and anthropogenic pressures. The diffusion and the transport of these waters are a key element for environmental, ecological and economic management. There are numerous indicators of hydrological characteristics based on theories of transport time scale. However, these indicators strongly depend on the geographical shape of the studied area and tend to give information after long integration time periods, generally on the order of weeks. Here, to qualify a coastal area's dispersion more precisely, we combined two Lagrangian approaches and estimated a local diffusivity. This paper presents the numerical implementation and the results obtained over a tidally flushed, semi-enclosed water body located at mid-latitude. This new coefficient was estimated using the hydrodynamic model MARS 3D with a barycentric repositioning technique over a tidal period to ensure its reliability. We highlight the existing relationships between local diffusivity and both horizontal and vertical processes. Methodological aspects were analysed based on a reference case (number and distribution of particles, resolution, integration time period). The consistency and sensitivity of the coefficient were studied with different forcing conditions (hydrodynamical and meteorological regimes). In conclusion, our local diffusivity provides a new perspective for understanding the land-sea interface and coastal dispersion and holds potential for future studies of coastal marine ecosystems.

AB  - Riparian zones are complex, dynamic habitats that play a critical role in river ecosystem functioning. Terrestrial invertebrates comprise much of the diversity found in riparian habitats and facilitate the transfer of energy between aquatic and terrestrial systems. However, the consequences for terrestrial invertebrates of invasion of riparian zones by invasive non-native plants (INNP) remain poorly understood. Responses of terrestrial macroinvertebrate morphospecies to invasion by two common INNP, Fallopia japonica (Japanese knotweed) and Impatiens glandulifera (Himalayan balsam) were assessed, relative to local environmental factors. Terrestrial invertebrates were collected from 20 sites on low order streams in June and August alongside data on physical attributes and land use. Greater cover of F. japonica and I. glandulifera cover reduced total invertebrate abundance and morphospecies diversity at the individual sample scale, whilst increasing spatial heterogeneity of invertebrates at the site scale. Impatiens glandulifera reduced morphospecies diversity at the site scale with increasing cover, but this was not observed for F. japonica. INNP affected terrestrial invertebrate morphospecies abundance and diversity, to a greater extent than prevailing environmental conditions. Our findings therefore offer support for managing riparian plant invasions to improve habitat heterogeneity, restore terrestrial invertebrate diversity and repair aquatic-terrestrial linkages.

AB  - Ecosystem modelling is increasingly used to explore ecosystem-level effects of changing environmental conditions and management actions. For coral reefs there has been increasing interest in recent decades in the use of ecosystem models for evaluating the effects of fishing and the efficacy of marine protected areas. However, ecosystem models that integrate physical forcings, biogeochemical and ecological dynamics, and human induced perturbations are still underdeveloped. We applied an ecosystem model (Atlantis) to the coral reef ecosystem of Guam using a suite of management scenarios prioritized in consultation with local resource managers to review the effects of each scenario on performance measures related to the ecosystem, the reef-fish fishery (e.g., fish landings) and coral habitat. Comparing tradeoffs across the selected scenarios showed that each scenario performed best for at least one of the selected performance indicators. The integrated 'full regulation' scenario outperformed other scenarios with four out of the six performance metrics at the cost of reef-fish landings. This model application quantifies the socio-ecological costs and benefits of alternative management scenarios. When the effects of climate change were taken into account, several scenarios performed equally well, but none prevented a collapse in coral biomass over the next few decades assuming a business-as-usual greenhouse gas emissions scenario.

AB  - In Piedmont (Italy) the impact of human beings is causing some deep environmental changes in freshwaters and their inhabitants, so much so that we need to develop some practical tools for immediate use in providing accurate ecological assessments of the freshwater system and of the conditions of the species living there, one of which is Telestes muticellus, an endangered Cyprinidae found in the western Alps and the central Apennines in Italy. We aimed to help manage this species by assessing its presence using two types of data-mining approaches-decision-tree models and artificial neural networks. We built models using 10 environmental input variables to classify sites as positive or negative for the species. The unpruned decision tree models classified a high percentage of instances correctly and made accurate predictions, as did the post-pruned tree models. The post-pruned methods yielded simpler trees and therefore clearer models. Generally, the artificial neural networks (ANN) performed better than the decision tree models, except in the case of Cohen's k. We used the sensitivity analysis technique to understand which inputs are the most important ones for building the ANN model we obtained. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Chrysophytes with their species-specific siliceous scales serve as tools for paleolimnological studies. However, their value as indicators depends on the compliance with several taxonomical and ecological demands. There is a particular need for information on the limits of occurrence and the autecology of individual species. The present study includes records of 29 Mallomonas species sampled in 29 mostly eutrophic and alkaline water bodies exhibiting high specific conductivity. These sites offer optimum growth conditions for a limited number of species only. Chrysophytes were predominantly found during spring and autumn at low temperatures. However, some species such as M. caudata and M. tonsurata developed maxima in summer at high temperatures. The occurrence of these species is discussed with special regard to their seasonality and their preferences to temperature, specific conductivity and pH of the water bodies. Most species are specialized to eutrophic, alkaline waters (M. acaroides, M. alpina, M. caudata, M. cratis, M. striata, M. tonsurata) or indifferent to the mentioned environmental factors (M. parvula). Some species such as M. cratis, M. multiunca and M. tolerans show no clear preference and seem to be bound to local sites. Many rare species were only found at dystrophic sites which may serve as nature reserves in this eutrophic area.

AB  - Global warming urges governments to decarbonise their energy portfolios. Many governments have indistinctly transited away from fossil fuels towards renewable energies. However, a sustainable turnaround calls for limiting the overall impact of this transition on environmental resources and the economy. This study identifies the most desirable energy alternatives for the Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) countries based on their environmental and economic footprints using the Relative Aggregate Footprint (RAF) indicator. The RAFs of eleven widespread electricity generation technologies are computed for each country by considering the availability of four resources - energy, water, land, and the economy - which were weighted according to the national resource availability conditions. The results indicate that the MENA region must adapt their electricity mix to mitigate the impacts of climate change with respect to resource availability conditions, especially their scarce water resources. Due to the specificities of this region, deploying biomass and large-scale hydropower may lower greenhouse gases but significantly alter the impact on other valuable natural resources. Therefore, wind, geothermal, and nuclear power plants seem more desirable for a transition away from carbon-intensive technologies while their secondary effects on other resources (e.g. nuclear energy's possible water and environmental impacts) must be carefully considered.

AB  - Organic rich sediments were obtained from seven core tops taken in Lake Quistococha, near the city of Iquitos in the Peruvian Amazon. Subsamples from 0 to 4 cm depth in each core were analyzed under dissecting light microscopy to carry out the first investigation of Arcellinida (testate lobose amoebae) from a lacustrine environment in this ecologically important region. The fauna was characterized by a low diversity, low abundance community dominated by centropyxids. This fauna is similar to 'stressed' assemblages reported from temperate latitudes, except that test concentrations were two orders of magnitude lower than typical in temperate lakes. Principle arcellinidan stressors in Lake Quistococha likely include the low pH 4 conditions in the lake, and a general lack of suitable minerogenic material to construct tests in the organic rich lake substrate. The low pH conditions are the result of runoff and seepage of water high in dissolved organic carbon from the adjacent similarly low pH 4 terrestrial peatland. The dearth of minerogenic material is the result of the lake being isolated from riverine input for the past similar to 2000 years, even during flooding events. Other limiting factors contributing to depressed arcellinidan populations may include nutrient supply, predation pressure, competition, and post-mortem taphonomic factors. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - In the present study, an additional combination of end-points was applied on the natural populations of the common plantain, previously estimated using morphometric assays. Here, besides measuring developmental instability (DI), by determining the level of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and the total amount of phenotypic variability (PV), we tried to distinguish the three natural populations under contrasting environmental conditions using the morphological data. Results obtained using both FA indices were the same; higher asymmetry levels in the reference than in the polluted environments were detected for leaf width, vein distances within a leaf and lobe length. The one-way analysis of variance results revealed that there were significant differences in PV values among populations analysed for each character. When all leaf traits were considered together, the PV median value was significantly higher in Crni Lug leaves compared with leaves from other sites. The multivariate analysis of variance results revealed the significant effect of environment on both FA4 and PV values. The component scores of first factor (PC1) were significantly different between the Karaburma and Crni Lug populations. Besides, component scores of both PC1 and PC2 were significantly different between the Zemun and Crni Lug samples. The stepwise discriminant functional analysis results allowed us to identify a set of four variables, with a sufficient discriminating ability (75%).

AB  - Research regarding seedling quality issues has been performed for decades and focused primarily on conifer species, which comprise the greatest proportion of nursery production worldwide. Demand for hardwood seedlings, particularly for conservation purposes, has increased steadily in recent years, emphasizing the need for seedling quality assessment protocols specific to these species. Important differences between conifer (gymnosperm) and hardwood (angiosperm) species require the creation of seedling evaluative programs specific to each group. Variation in phenology and ecological adaptability of hardwood species limits the validity of inferences made between and within genera. Annual cycles of leaf emergence followed by abscission in temperate hardwoods necessitate examination of seasonal variation in indicators of physiological condition that do not require leaf tissue (e.g., mineral nutrition, electrolyte leakage). Also, it is crucial to identify appropriate sampling periods and plant tissues for testing such that test results may be accurately compared. Though certain parameters (e.g., morphological) may be readily used in both conifer and hardwood seedling quality testing programs with little modification, additional refinement is needed to improve predictive capacity for hardwoods across a variety of environments. We review the current state of knowledge regarding seedling quality testing of temperate deciduous hardwood species, discuss limitations in incorporating traditional components of quality testing programs, and set priorities for future study.

AB  - Dairy animals in the tropics face numerous challenges under tropical environments. They have to maintain their primary body functions within optimum ranges during the extreme seasonal variations, especially the thermal stresses during summer. The malnutrition and prevalence of diseases exert further stresses. Under such circumstances the animal has to re-visit its priorities for the body functions and survival remains the topmost priority over growth, productivity and fertility. Reproduction gets the last priority for nutritional partitioning and hence it is the first to be affected by any type of stress. The local breeds of dairy animals are well adapted to local environment of temperature variation, feed availability and diseases prevalence. However the stress factors do affect the reproductive physiology and lactation, adversely. Resistance to stress is reduced with the genetic improvement coupled with productivity enhancement of animals. The genetically improved animals exhibit repeat breeding probably due to delayed ovulation under stress conditions. There is a need to investigate the relationship among various stressors like higher milk yield, abnormal levels of blood metabolites and ambient temperature, with reproductive physiology. Relationship of stress indicators like reactive oxygen species and enzymes with pituitary, adrenal and ovarian hormones needs exploration. The stress comprises nutritional, health and thermal factors and is revealed by the inability of an animal to cope with its environment, a phenomenon that is often reflected in a failure to achieve genetic potential. The author has reported reproductive and productive disorders associated with crossbreeding in cattle. An important cause of reproductive problems in crossbred cattle in Philippines was under-nutrition, particularly at critical periods of the cow's reproductive life, reflected in the slow recovery from loss in body weight and condition score during the early postpartum period and the increased plasma BHB values at peri-partum period in some cows, indicative of negative energy balance, and the flat lactation profile. It has been suggested that a variety of endocrine regulatory points exist whereby stress limits the efficiency of reproduction. Negative feedback effects appear to operate mainly at the pituitary level during transport but at the hypothalamus during hypoglycemia. The endocrine evidence showed that stressors interfere with precise timings of reproductive hormone release within the follicular phase. Stressors also delay the onset of the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge. The author has concluded that excess intake of crude protein, associated with higher serum urea levels and low energy intake, associated with poor body condition, are the key factors for low reproductive efficiency. It may be corrected by adopting a proper feeding strategy. We also reported a decline in milk with advancement pregnancy was slight up to a point which was declared as joining point; thereafter the decline was much greater, showing a pregnancy stress on milk yield. Milk production stress was found to lower milk progesterone concentration in buffaloes. This review concludes that dairy animals need an optimum range of metabolites, body condition score, nutritional status and management conditions to express reproductive cyclicity at its best level.

AB  - One of the essential factors influencing the overall urban experience is the presence of biologically active surfaces. Despite widespread awareness of the beneficial effects of such spaces, the natural tissue in cities is still being significantly limited by the priority given to functionality and the economy. The aim of this article is to assess the potential of using a hybrid infrastructure in the grey-green-blue system (GGB) on a public site. In order to assess the efficiency of the implemented solutions, a multi-criteria method was developed, thereby recognising this research aspect as necessary in the process of designing urban built-up spaces. The assessment compared indicators of biological activity in the area using the biotope area factor and green space factor scales. The rainwater retention potential was estimated using a quantitative method. The change in the site's thermal conditions was analysed by conducting numerous experiments with the use of micrometeorogical computational fluid dynamics models ENVI-met. The demonstrated improvement in the proportion of the biologically active area, water retention, and thermal conditions, ranging from a few to a dozen percent compared to the initial state, confirms the legitimacy of using grey-green-blue infrastructure systems as a method of shaping a sustainable and climate-responsive urban design.

AB  - Ratios of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stable isotopes in plants are important indicators of intrinsic water use efficiency and N acquisition strategies. Here, we examined patterns of inter- and intraspecific variations and phylogenetic signal in foliar delta C-13 and delta N-15 for 59 alpine tundra plant species, stratifying our sampling across five habitat types. Overall, we found that variation in both delta C-13 and delta N-15 mirrored well-known patterns of water and nitrogen limitation among habitat types and that there was significant intraspecific trait variation in both delta C-13 and delta N-15 for some species. Lastly, we only found a strong signal of phylogenetic conservatism in delta C-13 in two habitat types and no phylogenetic signal in delta N-15. Our results suggest that although local environmental conditions do play a role in determining variation in delta C-13 and delta N-15 among habitat types, there is considerable variation within and among species that is only weakly explained by shared ancestry. Taken together, our results suggest that considering local environmental variation, intraspecific trait variation, and shared ancestry can help with interpreting isotope patterns in nature and with predicting which species may be able to respond to rapidly changing environmental conditions.

AB  - Plant life relies on complex arrays of environmental stress sensing and signalling mechanisms. Extremophile plants develop and grow in harsh environments with extremes of cold, heat, drought, desiccation, or salinity, which have resulted in original adaptations. In accordance with their polyphyletic origins, extremophile plants likely possess core mechanisms of plant abiotic stress signalling. However, novel properties or regulations may have emerged in the context of extremophile adaptations. Comparative omics of extremophile genetic models, such as Arabidopsis lyrata, Craterostigma plantagineum, Eutrema salsugineum, and Physcomitrella patens, reveal diverse strategies of sensing and signalling that lead to a general improvement in abiotic stress responses. Current research points to putative differences of sensing and emphasizes significant modifications of regulatory mechanisms, at the level of secondary messengers (Ca2+, phospholipids, reactive oxygen species), signal transduction (intracellular sensors, protein kinases, transcription factors, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis) or signalling crosstalk. Involvement of hormone signalling, especially ABA signalling, cell homeostasis surveillance, and epigenetic mechanisms, also shows that large-scale gene regulation, whole-plant integration, and probably stress memory are important features of adaptation to extreme conditions. This evolutionary and functional plasticity of signalling systems in extremophile plants may have important implications for plant biotechnology, crop improvement, and ecological risk assessment under conditions of climate change.

AB  - There are many approaches of pesticide risk assessment. Despite their variation in difficulty and information complexity, all of them are intended to predict the actual pesticide risk as accurately as possible, i.e., to predict the behavior and hazard of a pesticide in the environment with high precision. The aim of this study was to develop a risk indicator of pesticide's negative impact on soil and aquatic organisms. The developed pesticide risk indicator constitutes the sum of points of acute toxicity exposure ratio, long-term toxicity exposure ratio, and the bioconcentration factor. To develop the indicator, mathematical models were used; the input data included the soil and climate conditions of a specific region. Combining the data of pesticide toxicity in the environment allowed for a more accurate risk assessment in terms of using plant protection products. The toxicity and behavior in soil and water of 200 widespread pesticides were studied. It could be concluded that a mathematical model, PEARL 4.4.4, calibrated for region-specific soil-climate conditions, provides a relevant description of the natural translocation and decomposition of pesticides in soils. In addition, the output data of this model can be applied to calculate the risk indicators. The combination of these parameters with pesticide toxicity for non-target groups of organisms allows the risk indicator to be a universal tool for predicting the negative impact of pesticides on the environment at the regional level.

AB  - As significant indicators of deep-time palaeoclimate, a number of new palaeontological, pedological and geochemical characteristics are provided for the Chemnitz Fossil Lagerstatte to depict more precisely its environmental conditions. For the first time, several lines of evidence indicate that this fossil forest instantaneously preserved by volcanic deposits, once received an annual precipitation of around 800-1100 mm, but grew on a nearly unweathered palaeosol. Although the composition of this rich and diverse T-0 assemblage suggests a hygrophilous, dense and multi-aged vegetation dominated by conservative lineages, the habitat was affected by environmental disturbances and pronounced seasonality. Repeated changes in local moisture availability are suggested by geochemical proxies, the co-occurrence to intergrowth of calcic and ferric glaebules in the palaeosol and developmental traits of perennial vegetational elements. Specific substrate adaptation is reflected by different root systems and cyclic growth interruptions recorded in the stems, branches and roots of long-lived woody plants. Many differentially adapted terrestrial animals complete the more comprehensive reconstruction of a late Sakmarian ecosystem and its climatic and preservational controls. Albeit spatially confined, this diverse in-situ record may contribute to understand wetland-dtyland dynamics of sub-tropical Northern Hemisphere Pangaea. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A high-performance and environmentally friendly shrimp shell catalyst for biodiesel production was prepared by incomplete carbonization of shrimp shell, loading KF on the resultant, and activation at a desired temperature. The dependence of catalytic activity on preparation conditions Such as carbonization temperature, loading, amount of KF, and activation temperature was investigated. The shrimp shell catalyst was characterized by the Hammett indicator method, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA). scanning electron microscope (SEM), N-2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). element analyzer, and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR). The catalytic performance was evaluated by the transesterification of rapeseed oil with Methanol. The results indicated that the optimum preparation conditions were carbonization at 450 degrees C. loading KF of 25 wt %. and activation at 250 degrees C. The conversion reached 89.1%, using the shrimp shell catalyst when the reaction was carried out at 65 degrees C with a catalyst amount 2.5 wt %. a methanol/rapeseed oil molar ratio 9: 1, and a reaction time of 3 h. The shrimp shell catalyst possesses it porous framework structure, and its catalytic activity for the transesterification came from the active sites formed by the reaction of incompletely carbonized shrimp shell with KF during the activation process. It was found that the shrimp shell catalyst shows high catalytic activity and ecologically friendly properties, having the potential opportunity to be used in biodiesel production process as heterogeneous base catalyst.

AB  - There is great concern for contamination of sensitive ecosystems in high latitudes by long-range transport of heavy metals and other pollutants derived from industrial areas in lower latitudes. Atmospheric pollution of heavy metals has a very long history, and since metals accumulate in the environment, understanding of present-day pollution conditions requires knowledge of past atmospheric deposition. We use analyses of lead concentrations and stable lead isotopes ((206)pb/(207)pb ratios) Of annually laminated sediments from four lakes in northern Sweden (similar to 65 degrees N) to provide a decadal record of atmospheric lead pollution far the last 3000 years. There is a clear signal in the sediments of airborne pollution from Greek and Roman cultures 2000 yea rs ago, followed by a period of "clean" conditions 400-900 A.D. From 900 A.D. there was a conspicuous, permanent increase in atmospheric lead pollution fallout. The sediments reveal peaks in atmospheric lead pollution at 1200 and 1530 A.D. comparable to present-day levels. These peaks match the history of metal production in Europe. This study indicates that the contemporary atmospheric pollution climate in northern Europe was established in Medieval time, rather than in the industrial period. Atmospheric lead pollution deposition did not, when seen in a historical perspective, increase as much as usually assumed with the Industrial Revolution (1800 A.D.).

AB  - Geochemical proxies such as the isotopic compositions and abundances of redox-sensitive metals, organic biomarkers, and sedimentological indicators can be used qualitatively and quantitatively to reconstruct marine redox landscapes through Earth history. Isotopic proxies with residence times longer than ocean mixing times, including uranium (U-238/U-235, commonly denoted as delta U-238), are a promising but still developing approach to constrain global changes in redox conditions. Our current understanding of the controls on delta U-238 variability and associated isotopic fractionations is limited, complicating the interpretation of delta U-238 records through Earth history. With these gaps in mind, we investigate the major controls on the expression of uranium (U) isotope fractionation within two basins of the Miocene Monterey Formation (ca. 18-6 Ma) that represent contemporaneous deposition under different environmental conditions. Our finding that the isotopic offset in the productive and anoxic Santa Barbara Basin is similar to that in modern euxinic settings suggests that highly productive settings without persistent euxinia can also exert significant leverage on seawater delta U-238. Distinct patterns in U concentrations and delta U-238 between basins demonstrate that local depositional controls can impart a strong influence on the U isotope offset in reducing settings, as has been observed in modern sediment datasets. High productivity and low sedimentation rates are predicted to result in a diagnostic inverse relationship between U enrichment and delta U-238 which can partially explain the overall weak negative correlation between [U] and delta U-238 in the distal Naples Beach section in the Santa Barbara Basin. In a core from a more restricted proximal setting in the San Joaquin Basin, we propose that changes in basin hydrography led to a potential relationship between [U] and delta U-238. These interpretations are consistent with the characteristic depositional conditions interpreted independently for each basin (e.g., persistence of anoxia, productivity, sedimentation rates, phosphate content, and basin hydrography) and are supported by modeling results of U enrichment and isotope fractionation under these conditions. In particular, our results suggest that the isotope offset of U in reducing sinks varies and has done so over Earth history and in different paleogeographic locations as a result of local productivity and basin restriction. These variations indicate the need to consider these uncertainties in quantitative models of global redox conditions from delta U-238 records and specifically in using delta U-238 to distinguish between euxinic and oxic redox states without considering other oxygen-depleted environments as part of a continuum of settings that can impact delta U-238 if spatially widespread. This study also highlights the utility of using different lithologies to evaluate global versus local controls on delta U-238 records as well as multi-proxy approaches to constrain ancient redox landscapes.

AB  - Ocean acidification (OA) studies to date have typically used stable open-ocean pH and CO2 values to predict the physiological responses of intertidal species to future climate scenarios, with few studies accounting for natural fluctuations of abiotic conditions or the alternating periods of emersion and immersion routinely experienced during tidal cycles. Here, we determine seawater carbonate chemistry and the corresponding in situ haemolymph acid-base responses over real time for two populations of mussel (Mytilus edulis) during tidal cycles, demonstrating that intertidal mussels experience daily acidosis during emersion. Using these field data to parameterize experimental work we demonstrate that air temperature and mussel size strongly influence this acidosis, with larger mussels at higher temperatures experiencing greater acidosis. There was a small inter-active effect of prior immersion in OA conditions (pH(NBS) 7.7/pCO(2) 930 mu atm) such that the haemolymph pH measured at the start of emersion was lower in large mussels exposed to OA. Critically, the acidosis induced in mussels during emersion in situ was greater (Delta pH approximately 0.8 units) than that induced by experimental OA (Delta pH approximately 0.1 units). Understanding how environmental fluctuations influence physiology under current scenarios is critical to our ability to predict the responses of key marine biota to future environmental changes.

AB  - The impact of floodplain hydrology on the in-stream dissolved oxygen dynamics and the relation between dissolved oxygen and water temperature are investigated. This has been done by examining the time series of dissolved oxygen and water temperature coupled with meteorological and hydrological data obtained from two lowland rivers having contrasting hydrological settings. Spectral analysis of long-term oxygen variations in a vegetated river revealed a distinct scaling regime with slope '-1' indicating a self-similar behaviour. Identical slopes were obtained for water temperature and water level. The same power-law behaviour was observed for an unvegetated river at small timescales revealing the underlying scaling behaviour of dissolved oxygen regime for different types of rivers and over various time scales. The results have shown that the oxygenation of a vegetated river is strongly related to its thermal regime and flow conditions. Moreover, analysis of short-term fluctuations in the unvegetated river demonstrated that physical factors such as rainfall and backwaters play a substantial role in the functioning of this ecosystem. Finally, the results show that the relation between water temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration at the diurnal timescale exhibits a looping behaviour on the variable plot. The findings of this study provide an insight into the sensitivity of rivers to changing hydro-physical conditions and can be useful in the assessment of environmental variability.

AB  - The distributions of culturable bacteria and functional bacteria associated with nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) in the backwater areas of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) were investigated. Results from seven locations in the TGR indicated that the abundance of total bacteria was high, with 8.12 x 10(6), 2.70 x 10(7), and 6.73 x 10(10) colony-forming units per milliliter or per gram dry weight in surface water, bottom water, and sediments, respectively. Aquatic environments with higher nutrient loadings possessed higher bacteria densities and lower bacteria community diversities. Eight kinds of functional bacteria ratios, including surface water to bottom water and ratios of water to sediments, were calculated, in which four kinds of functional bacteria, namely, nitrogen-fixing bacteria, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, and organophosphate-solubilizing bacteria, displayed obvious differences in different locations. Based on the functional bacteria ratios of water to sediments, it was found that the obtained result of location grouping from cluster analysis was similar to that based on the community-level physiological profiles studies. The above results showed that the ratios of functional bacteria could distinguish the aquatic environments with different trophic conditions in the TGR. This demonstrated that the distribution ratios of functional bacteria in aquatic environments could work as potential bioindicators to reflect the trophic condition of the water.

AB  - Studies on natural focality of tularemia in Slovakia revealed the role of different species of hosts and their ectoparasites, mainly ticks, in the circulation of Francisella tularensis in our ecological conditions. Foci with a complex structure of reservoirs and vectors, where transmission of the infection is possible via several tick species, have been considered the most important. Geographical distribution of ticks as surveyed in our field studies, as well as their bionomic characteristics were correlated with notified data on the incidence of tularemia in Slovakia. For the known endemic regions of tularemia, the March and the Danube river basin in the west, and the Latorica river basin in the east, the ubiquitary distributed tick Ixodes ricinus, occurring in synusia with Dermacentor reticulatus and Haemaphysalis concinna, was found to be characteristic. Vector competence of I. ricinus, D. reticulatus, D. marginatus and H. concinna was confirmed in our experiments on white mice as a model of hosts highly susceptible to F. tularensis. Surveillance of natural foci of tularemia has shown a long-term and relatively high prevalence of infected D. reticulatus ticks and apparently lower infestation of I. ricinus and H. concinna. Conclusion was made that ticks are important epidemiological markers of the activity of natural foci of tularemia and good indicators of their distribution and persistence. Systematic follow-up of their infestation with F. tularensis is an inevitable part of a modern epidemiological surveillance of the disease in ecological conditions of Slovakia.

AB  - The tradition of using medicinal and aromatic plants in Romania dates back to the year 1862. The purpose of the present paper is to identify the main medicinal and aromatic plants, as well as estimating the quantities that can be harvested from Dobrogea in 2018 from the forest fund managed by RNP - Romsilva, the National Forest Management Institute. As such, 21 medicinal plants were identified in the two forest districts (DS) from Constanta and Tulcea Counties. A quantity of 22 t of medicinal plants from 10 species was estimated for harvesting in DS Constanta, while in DS Tulcea the number reached 588 tones from 21 species. The largest quantities that can be harvested in DS Constanta are represented by locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) - 5 tones and elderberry (Sambucus nigra) - 5 tones, while for DS Tulcea they are represented by silver linden (Tilia tomentosa) - 180 tones, elderberry (Sambucus nigra) - 60t and nettle (Urtica dioica) - 50 tones. All the other species can be gathered in quantities ranging from 1 ton to 40 tones. Taking into account the natural conditions, Dobrogea region is characterised by a high potential of medicinal plants. The possibility that these natural resources are maintained and even developing future abundant populations is conditioned by the appliance of appropriate management measures that abide to the present laws, the species sustainability principle as well as the protection of endangered species.

AB  - Soil microorganisms are vital for ecosystem functioning because of the role they play in soil nutrient cycling. Agricultural practices and the intensification of land use have a negative effect on microbial activities and fungal biomass has been widely used as an indicator of soil health. The aim of this study was to analyze fungal biomass in soils from southwestern Buenos Aires province using direct fluorescent staining and to contribute to its use as an indicator of environmental changes in the ecosystem as well as to define its sensitivity to weather conditions. Soil samples were collected during two consecutive years. Soil smears were prepared and stained with two different concentrations of calcofluor, and the fungal biomass was estimated under an epifluorescence microscope. Soil fungal biomass varied between 2.23 and 26.89 mu g fungal C/g soil, being these values in the range expected for the studied soil type. The fungal biomass was positively related to temperature and precipitations. The methodology used was reliable, standardized and sensitive to weather conditions. The results of this study contribute information to evaluate fungal biomass in different soil types and support its use as an indicator of soil health for analyzing the impact of different agricultural practices.

AB  - Rumex crispus and R. obtusifolius are among the most important perennial weeds in agriculture throughout the world. This literature survey revealed that the majority of studies on Rumex ecology, which were conducted under field conditions are of a descriptive nature, while experimental studies mainly report data derived under laboratory or greenhouse conditions. Areas on Rumex ecology which deserve more research include: historical development of Rumex infestations, field studies on seed and root ecology, population ecology, Rumex longevity, and impacts of global climate change on the performance of these species. Although biological, mechanical and cultural control methods were often effective in controlling Rumex populations, they were rarely successful enough to eradicate the weeds. As both species are considered to be indicators of agricultural mismanagement, there is a definite need for well-replicated, full-factorial, long-term field experiments to assess the role of management factors most often stated to be responsible for Rumex infestation and distribution (e.g. high soil N and K levels, slurry and farmyard manure application, sward disturbance, cutting frequency, grazing management, ploughing, soil compaction). It is recommended that future research on non-chemical Rumex control should focus more on the efficacy of combined applications of biological, mechanical and cultural control methods.

AB  - Volume-changing clay soils constitute the most costly natural hazard to buildings on shallow foundations. With the existing expansive clays in Ankara, low-rise buildings at the southwest part of the city have shown damage resulting in considerable maintenance costs. This paper reports the findings of an experimental investigation emphasizing the swelling behavior of Ankara Clay and correlations between the swelling parameters and other soil properties, and present a synthesis of observed damage details. The poor performance of the affected light-weight structures is assessed in the light of environmental conditions. In addition, swelling maps for SW and central parts of the Ankara metropolitan area, based on measured and predicted swelling parameters, are constructed for the purposes of land-use planning and general assessment of environmental problems. The experimental results suggest that the clay has high-to-very high activity, depth of active zone generally ranges between 1-2 m, the use of remolded and desiccated specimens seems to be a better approach in swelling tests, and the empirical equations based on two or more index or physical properties are good predictors for the estimation of the swelling potential of the clay. High swelling pressures exerted by the soil, flat topography and poor drainage, climatic conditions and poor construction methods are the main reasons of the structural damage observed at the study site.

AB  - On-farm trials were used to evaluate the agro-economic feasibility of growing a second rice crop in Northwest Kampuchea in the dry season, and to calculate the costs and benefits of ecological inputs in agricultural production. A comparison of production and external input-use was made in two contrasting environmental conditions: lowland irrigation and water receding environment. Measurements were made in fields of 17 lowland and 33 water receding farmer cooperator fields in a single year. Results show that yields from water receding environments (3.94 t . ha(-1)) were significantly higher (27%) than those from lowland environments (3.10 t . ha(-1)). In addition, the external input costs per ha far the lowland environments were US$196.26, 65% higher than those for water receding environments (US$118.94). As a consequence, the gross margin per ha (US$431.06) and return per day of cultivation (US$3.92) were higher in water receding environments than those in irrigated lowland environments (US$270.25 per ha and US$2.46 per day). These differences in costs and bene fits under the two conditions gave a measure of ecological input-subsidy in the agricultural production process. In the absence of clear methodologies to measure ecological inputs and their productivity, we conclude that the: above measures can be used as indicators to assess agricultural development options in situations such as in Kampuchea.

AB  - Goldfish (Carassius auratus L.) were acclimated to three types of thermal regime: constant temperature (12, 28 degrees C), a diurnal sine-wave cycle (20 +/- 8 degrees C), and a randomly fluctuating pattern of +/-2 degrees C changes at 2-h intervals between 12 and 28 degrees C. Assessment of hematological response was based on determination of total red cell numbers and hematocrit values, and through characterization of circulating red cell populations in terms of absolute and relative abundances of juvenile, developing, mature, Trypan Blue-positive, karyorrhectic, dividing, and tailed or recently divided cells. While no significant differences in cell counts were observed, cell population composition was markedly affected by temperature regime. Variation during acclimation, particularly when this resembled that likely to be experienced under natural circumstances, was associated with significantly increased numbers of juvenile and developing cells, and thus with increased potential for reorganization of hemoglobin isomorph systems. The converse was true of mature cell abundances; these varied inversely with temperature and were significantly reduced under varying temperature conditions. It is concluded that studies involving constant acclimation temperatures are unlikely to provide valid information regarding functional hematological status, in this species at least. It is also concluded that the primary hematological indices and their derivatives (red cell numbers, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean erythrocytic volume, and hemoglobin) commonly used to monitor hematological response to environmental change are insufficiently sensitive for the purpose.

AB  - Urbanization creates environmental conditions that hinder the growth of natural vegetation. We surveyed the ruderal vegetation from a periurban university campus in west-central Mexico during the rainy seasons of 2008 and 2016-2018, time during which the campus underwent intensive construction. The built area grew from 4 ha in 2009 to 12.6 ha in 2017. We identified 234 different Angiosperms belonging to 165 genera and 43 families and the community composition changed over time. For example, Asteraceae was replaced by Poaceae as the richest family in 2018. Also, 16 native species found in 2008 disappeared from the study site, 9 of which have been related with low disturbance. In contrast, 98 new species were observed in the latter years, including some that are commonly found in cities. Overall, species richness increased with time, including that of exotic species that increased from 16 % of the total species in 2008 to 24 % in 2018. Thirteen of such exotic species are invasive in Mexico, including Digitaria velutina, Asphodelus fistulosus, Mercurialis annua, and Senecio inaequidens, for which this was their first record in the city of Morelia (population 849,053), where the campus is located. These results suggest that environmental conditions imposed by disturbance can favor the proliferation of various species, especially grasses and several exotic species of different families.

AB  - Although coastal zones occupy an important position in the world development, they face high risks and vulnerability to natural disasters because of their special locations and their high population density. In order to estimate their capability for crisis-response, various models have been established. However, those studies mainly focused on natural factors or conditions, which could not reflect the social vulnerability and regional disparities of coastal zones. Drawing lessons from the experiences of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), this paper presents a comprehensive assessment strategy based on the mechanism of Risk Matrix Approach (RMA), which includes two aspects that are further composed of five second-class indicators. The first aspect, the probability phase, consists of indicators of economic conditions, social development, and living standards, while the second one, the severity phase, is comprised of geographic exposure and natural disasters. After weighing all of the above indicators by applying the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Delphi Method, the paper uses the comprehensive assessment strategy to analyze the risk indices of 50 coastal cities in China. The analytical results are presented in ESR1 ArcGis10.1, which generates six different risk maps covering the aspects of economy, society, life, environment, disasters, and an overall assessment of the five areas. Furthermore, the study also investigates the spatial pattern of these risk maps, with detailed discussion and analysis of different risks in coastal cities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A new evaluation model for geo-environmental impact assessment of mining (GEIAM) is proposed. The evaluation framework in this model considers three groups of criteria, namely, geo-hazards risks, environmental risks, and resource damages. Fuzzy-analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to establish a multiple-criteria evaluation system and simultaneously command weighting to avoid vagueness and ambiguity in expert judgment. Membership function was employed to deal with the vagueness boundary problem of indices scoring and to help complete the ultimate fuzzy synthetic ranking. The model expresses the evaluation results with an integrated objective ranking and three criteria ranking. It was tentatively applied to assess an opencast limestone mine. The results indicated that the indices sequences were consistent with the mine background and the expert professional experience and better revealed the impact of geo-hazards risks. Specific assessment factors such as geo-hazards potential, engineering geological condition, and hydrogeological condition were prioritized for further improvement. Compared with existing GEIAM evaluation methods, the proposed assessment model focuses more on expert experience and judgment, breaks through the limitation of local estimation to variable attributes and, most importantly, satisfies the multi-purpose requirements to incorporate real considerations together for mining safety, geo-environmental protection, and natural resource conservation.

AB  - The effects of measurement errors on biological inferences of stream temperature and bedded fine sediment were investigated. Single variable and multivariate logistic regression models were used to relate the occurrences of different macroinvertebrate genera and observed temperature and fine sediment. Next, a simulation and extrapolation method (SIMEX) was used to adjust regression model coefficients for the effects of measurement errors in the temperature and fine-sediment observations. It was assumed that the persistence of different stream organisms was related to long-term average environmental conditions, so measurement error in this analysis was interpreted broadly as including all the variability associated with estimating long-term averages from single measurements. On average, correcting for measurement error narrowed the breadth of genus-environment relationships and shifted optimum values toward the mean of the observations. Accounting for measurement error also improved the predictive accuracy of some of the inference models. Inferences of temperature based on single-variable SIMEX models were 28% more accurate than inferences based on naive models that used uncorrected observations. However, inferences of fine sediment based on single-variable SIMEX models were only slightly more accurate than inferences based on naive models. Multivariate models, in which both stream temperature and fine sediment were modeled simultaneously, exhibited the strongest improvement in predictive performance when measurement error was taken into account. The accuracy of temperature inferences improved by 39%, whereas fine-sediment inferences improved by 8%.

AB  - In order to ensure high crop yield and good quality in greenhouse horticulture, the major environment control variables, such as temperature, humidity, and CO2 concentration, etc., need to be controlled properly, in order to reduce harmful effects on crop growth by minimizing the fluctuation of the thermal condition. Even though a hot water-based heating system is evidently superior to a hot air-based heating system, in terms of the thermally stable condition or energy saving, a hot air-based heating system has occupied the domestic market due to its economic efficiency from an initial investment cost saving. However, the intrinsic drawbacks of a hot air-based heating system, being more frequent variation of thermal variables and an inordinate disturbance on crops due to its convective heat delivery nature, are believed to be the main reasons for the insufficient crop yield and/or the quality deterioration. In addition, the current thermal environment monitoring system in a greenhouse, in which a sole sensor node usually covers a large part of cultivating area, seems to have a profound need of improvement in order to resolve those problems, in that the assumption of thermal uniform condition, which is adequate for a sole sensor node system, cannot be ensured in some cases. In this study, the qualitative concept of the new control variablethe degree of uniformityis suggested as an indicator to seek ways of enhancing the crop yield and its quality based on the multiple sensor nodes system with a wireless sensor network. In contrast to a conventional monitoring system, for which a newly suggested concept of qualitative variable cannot be estimated at all, the multiple sensor nodes-based thermal monitoring system can provide more accurate and precise sensing, which enables the degree of uniformity to be checked in real-time and thus more precise control becomes possible as a consequence. From the analysis of the results of the experiment and simulation, it is found that the crops in plastic vinyl houses can be exposed to a serious level of non-uniform thermal condition. For instance, the temperature difference in the longitudinal and widthwise direction is 3.0 degrees C and 6.5 degrees C, respectively for the case of 75 x 8 m dimension greenhouse during a typical winter season, and it can be hypothesized that this level of non-uniformity might cause considerable damage to crop growth. In this paper, several variants of control systems, within the framework of the multiple sensor nodes system, is proposed to provide a more thermally-stable cultivating environment and the experimental verification is carried out for different scales of test greenhouses. The results showed that a simple change of heating mode (i.e., from a hot air- to a hot water-based heating system) can bring about a significant improvement for the non-uniformity of temperature (more or less 80%), and an additional countermeasure, with local heat flux control, can lead to a supplementary cut of non-uniformity up to 90%. Among the several variants of local heat flux control systems, the hydraulic proportional mass flow control valve system was proven to represent the best performance, and it can be hypothesized that the newly suggested qualitative variablethe degree of uniformitywith the multiple sensor nodes system can be a good alternative for seeking enhanced cultivating performance, being higher crop yield and better quality along with energy cost saving.

AB  - Mercury (Hg) deposited from emissions or from local contamination, can have serious health effects on humans and wildlife. Traditionally, Hg has been seen as a threat to aquatic wildlife, because of its conversion in suboxic conditions into bioavailable methylmercury (MeHg), but it can also threaten contaminated terrestrial ecosystems. In Asia, rice paddies in particular may be sensitive ecosystems. Earthworms are soil-dwelling organisms that have been used as indicators of Hg bioavailability; however, the MeHg concentrations they accumulate in rice paddy environments are not well known. Earthworm and soil samples were collected from rice paddies at progressive distances from abandoned mercury mines in Guizhou, China, and at control sites without a history of Hg mining. Total Hg (THg) and MeHg concentrations declined in soil and earthworms as distance increased from the mines, but the percentage of THg that was MeHg, and the bioaccumulation factors in earthworms, increased over this gradient. This escalation in methylation and the incursion of MeHg into earthworms may be influenced by more acidic soil conditions and higher organic content further from the mines. In areas where the source of Hg is deposition, especially in water-logged and acidic rice paddy soil, earthworms may biomagnify MeHg more than was previously reported. It is emphasized that rice paddy environments affected by acidifying deposition may be widely dispersed throughout Asia. (C) 2016 SETAC

AB  - The use of bioindicators of habitat condition can help to better understand the effects of tropical forest degradation and the efficacy of strategies used in the restoration of these lands. The differences in feeding behavior of the ponerine ant Paraponera clavata may serve as such an indicator. The findings from the current study showed that P. clavata in an undisturbed primary forest returned to the nest with prey, nectar, and plant materials, while none of the ants within a 14 year old regenerating secondary forest returned with prey or nectar, few with plant materials, and most of the returns were unsuccessful in their foraging. This suggests a difference in P. clavata feeding behavior and/or food selection is occurring in the disturbed habitat; that P. clavata from the primary forest nest examined in the current study are feeding at a higher trophic level; and that the ants in the primary forest appeared to be more successful and efficient foragers than those in the secondary forest. Future studies should involve more comparisons of P. clavata foraging behavior in secondary to primary forests to determine if the patterns described in this current study are consistent with disturbance in these tropical forests in order to evaluate the possibility of this use of P. clavata as a valuable tool for bioindicators of habitat damage.

AB  - The enormity and complexity of problems like environmental degradation and biodiversity loss have led to the development of indicator species and other surrogate approaches to track changes in environments and/or in biodiversity. Under these approaches particular species or groups of species are used as proxies for other biota, particular environmental conditions, or for environmental change. The indicator species approach contrasts with a direct measurement approach in which the focus is on a single entity or a highly targeted subset of entities in a given ecosystem but no surrogacy relationships with unmeasured entities are assumed. Here, we present a broad philosophical discussion of the indicator species and direct measurement approaches because their relative advantages and disadvantages are not well understood by many researchers, resource managers and policy makers. A goal of the direct measurement approach is to demonstrate a causal relationship between key attributes of the target ecosystem system (for example, particular environmental conditions) and the entities selected for measurement. The key steps in the approach are based on the fundamental scientific principles of hypothesis testing and associated direct measurement that drive research activities, management activities and monitoring programs. The direct measurement approach is based on four critical assumptions:(1) the 'right' entities to measure have been selected, (2) these entities are well known, (3) there is sufficient understanding about key ecological processes and (4) the entities selected can be accurately measured. The direct measurement approach is reductionist and many elements of the biota, many biotic processes and environmental factors must be ignored because of practical considerations. The steps in applying the indicator species approach are broadly similar to the direct measurement approach, except surrogacy relationships also must be quantified between a supposed indicator species or indicator group and the factors for which it is purported to be a proxy. Such quantification needs to occur via: (1) determining the taxonomic, spatial and temporal bounds for which a surrogacy relationship does and does not hold. That is, the extent of transferability of a given surrogate such as an indicator species to other biotic groups, to landscapes, ecosystems, environmental circumstances or over time in the same location can be determined; and (2) determining the ecological mechanisms underpinning a surrogacy relationship (for example, through fundamental studies of community structure). Very few studies have rigorously addressed these two tasks, despite the extremely widespread use of the indicator species approach and similar kinds of surrogate schemes in virtually all fields of environmental, resource and conservation management. We argue that this has the potential to create significant problems; thus, the use of an indicator species approach needs to be better justified. Attempts to quantify surrogacy relationships may reveal that, in some circumstances, the alternative of direct measurement of particular entities of environmental or conservation interest will be the best option.

AB  - Competition for resources (e.g. mates or food) is the main evolutionary explanation for conspicuous ornaments in males, although this idea is not generalized in females. Whether or not the expression of melanic coloration is dependent on environmental conditions remains controversial. We studied three different melanin-based female traits in the Eurasian kestrel Falco tinnunculus, a sexually dichromatic species, for a period of 10 years: grey coloration in rump and tail and the width of the black subterminal tail band. We analysed these traits for within-individual variation among years, as well as their possible link with indices of quality, such as age, body size, and breeding performance. The results obtained demonstrate that female melanin-based coloration increased from yearlings to adults. In addition, the expression of female rump coloration covaried positively with the environmental conditions in the previous year (i.e. measured as clutch size at population level). Finally, we found a positive correlation between grey rump coloration and clutch size. These results suggest that the expression of rump coloration, a melanin-based trait, is environmentally constrained, and we propose that this character could function as an indicator of individual quality in female Eurasian kestrels.

AB  - Field parasitism of the egg parasitoid Trichogramma brassicae Bezdenko (Hymenoptera, Trichogrammatidae) (synonymous to T. maidis Pint. et Voegele) on Ostrinia nubilalis Hubner was compared to four single quality parameters (walking speed, fecundity on the factitious host Ephestia keuhniella Zeller, fecundity on the natural host O. nubilalis, and life span) previously measured in the laboratory and, a quality index calculated from three of the measured parameters. A single quality parameter (fecundity on E. keuhniella) and the calculated quality index showed a correlation to ?: brassicae field parasitism, for different T. brassicae populations. The number of female Trichogramma released clearly influenced parasitism but not in the same proportion for all populations tested, reflecting that numbers released can only to some extent compensate for low quality in Trichogramma. Variation indegree hours above 18 degrees C also influenced field parasitism. When incorporating degree hours to the quality index a significant correlation R(2) = 0.56 (P = 0.01) is obtained. In this work fecundity of T. brassicae on E. keuhniella can be as good an indicator for the potential field performance of T. brassicae, as the quality index which takes into account three quality parameters. Since environmental factors can obscure the potential performance of a population, i.e., one which under optimal laboratory conditions performs well, the quality index gives only a partial indication of how the released strains will perform in the field.

AB  - The long-term "Grain-to-Green Program" (GGP) on China's Loess Plateau is a major global ecological engineering project which has significantly boosted vegetation renewal. Some studies have found that the rate of restoration is quite rapid during the implementation of ecological engineering, however, the influence of multi-scale climatic conditions on the performance of ecological engineering is unclear. In this study, multiple sources of remote sensing data were used to estimate the dynamics of vegetation structural and functional indicators, water-related local climatic factors, and atmospheric circulation factors. These datasets were also used to detect possible causes for vegetation restoration on the Loess Plateau over the past 20 years. The results show that widespread increases in rates of normalized difference vegetation indexes (NDVI), leaf area indexes (LAI), gross primary production (GPP), and aboveground biomass carbon (ABC) during 2000-2016 were significantly higher than before 2000. GPP was significantly correlated with rainfall and surface runoff on a monthly scale, and there were significant positive correlations between GPP and atmospheric circulation. Our results demonstrate that both vegetation structural and functional indicators rapidly increase, and ecological engineering greatly accelerated vegetation restoration after 2000. Local climatic conditions and atmospheric circulation patterns enhance vegetation growth and impact of ecological engineering.

AB  - The protozoan community in eleven activated sludge wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the greater Dublin area has been investigated and correlated with key physio-chemical operational and effluent quality parameters. The plants represented various designs, including conventional and biological nutrient removal (BNR) systems. The aim of the study was to identify differences in ciliate community due to key design parameters including anoxic/anaerobic stages and to identify suitable bioindicator species for performance evaluation. BNR systems supported significantly different protozoan communities compared to conventional systems. Total protozoan abundance was reduced in plants with incorporated anoxic and anaerobic stages, whereas species diversity was either unaffected or increased. Plagiocampa rouxi and Holophrya discolor were tolerant to anoxic/anaerobic conditions and associated with high denitrification. Apart from process design, influent wastewater characteristics affect protozoan community structure. Aspidisca cicada was associated with low dissolved oxygen and low nitrate concentrations, while Trochilia minuta was indicative of good nitrifying conditions and good sludge settleability. Trithigmostoma cucullulus was sensitive to ammonia and phosphate and could be useful as an indicator of high effluent quality. The association rating assessment procedure of Curds and Cockburn failed to predict final effluent biological oxygen demand (BOD5) indicating the method might not be applicable to treatment systems of different designs.

AB  - Along the Pacific Northwest coast, much of the estuarine habitat has been lost over the last century to agricultural land use, residential and commercial development, and transportation corridors. As a result, many of the ecological processes and functions have been disrupted. To protect and improve these coastal habitats that are vital to aquatic species, many projects are currently underway to restore estuarine and coastal ecosystems through dike breaches, setbacks, and removals. Understanding site-specific information on physical processes is critical for improving the success of such restoration actions. In this study, a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model was developed to simulate estuarine processes in the Stillaguamish River estuary, where restoration of a 160-acre parcel through dike setback has been proposed. The model was calibrated to observed tide, current, and salinity data for existing conditions and applied to simulate the hydrodynamic responses to two restoration alternatives. Model results were then combined with biophysical data to predict habitat responses within the restoration footprint. Results showed that the proposed dike removal would result in desired tidal flushing and conditions that would support four habitat types on the restoration footprint. At the estuary scale, restoration would substantially increase the proportion of area flushed with freshwater (<5 ppt) at flood tide. Potential implications of predicted changes in salinity and flow dynamics are discussed relative to the distribution of tidal marsh habitat. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - H2O2 is an ubiquitous compound involved in signalling, metabolic control, stress responses and development. The compatibility of leaf tissue levels with these functions has, however, often been questioned. The objective here is to document H2O2 levels and variability under natural conditions, and their underlying causes. Using the FOX method, bulk H2O2 concentrations were analysed in leaf samples from 18 species of herbs and trees throughout the 2006 growing season. Sampling addressing targeted predictions was emphasised in 2007 and 2008. H2O2 levels varied 100-fold through the year, with a main peak in spring. Two hypotheses were examined: (H1) that H2O2 reflects seasonally variable responses to environmental stresses, and (H2) that it reflects metabolism associated with leaf development. Based on poor or inappropriate correlations between H2O2 and indicators of light, temperature or drought stress, support for H1 was minimal. H2 was supported both by seasonal patterns and by targeted analyses of concentration changes throughout leaf development. This study concludes that bulk tissue H2O2 concentrations are poor indicators of stress, and are generally too high to reflect either signalling or metabolic control networks. Instead, the linkage of H2O2 and leaf phenology appears to reflect the roles of H2O2 in cell expansion, lignification and wall cross-linking.

AB  - Invasive populations often shift phenotypically during introduction. Moreover, they are postulated to show an increased phenotypic plasticity compared with their native counterparts, which could be advantageous. However, less is known about trait selection across populations along the invasion gradient in response to environmental factors, such as increasing drought caused by climate change. In this study, we investigated the impacts of drought on growth, regrowth, and various leaf traits in plants of different origin. Therefore, seeds of 18 populations of the perennial Tanacetum vulgare were collected along the invasion gradient (North America, invasive; West Europe, archaeophyte; East Europe, native) and grown in competition with the grass Poa pratensis under control or dry conditions in a common garden. Above-ground biomass was cut once and the regrowth was measured as an indicator for tolerance over a second growth period. Initially, drought had little effects on growth of T. vulgare, but after cutting, plants grew more vigorously. Against expectations, phenotypic plasticity was not higher in invasive populations, but even reduced in one trait, which may be attributable to ecological constraints imposed by multiple stress conditions. Trait responses reflected the range expansion and invasion gradient and were influenced by the latitudinal origin of populations. Populations of invaded ranges may be subject to faster and more extensive genetic mixing or had less time to undergo and reflect selective processes.

AB  - Background: The distribution of refugial habitats is the main factor affecting the existence of cold-adapted species in the lowlands. In addition, regional climatic conditions could have an influence on relicts.
   Aims: Co-occurrence of environmental factors in the determination of the distribution of the glacial relict Festuca amethystina was examined in Poland.
   Methods: Climatic data, habitat indicator species, parent material of soils and range of glaciations were analysed, using ecological niche modelling. Prediction of Festuca amethystina occurrence for different sets of data - only climatic, only habitat and all data - was modelled.
   Results: The distribution of Festuca amethystina was related to the presence of oak forests (Potentillo albae-Quercetum), to moderate subcontinental climate, but not to the distribution of loess soils. In addition, variables related to temperature and precipitation in the driest quarter of the year, isothermality and a mean diurnal range had the strongest influence on the occurrence of F. amethystina within the Potentillo-Quercetum range.
   Conclusions: Climate acts as a regional filter and habitat availability as a local filter for distribution of the species. Therefore, the habitat can act as microrefugium in some parts of its range. In a flat landscape, relicts can persist where environmental conditions are simultaneously favourable for the persistence of refugial vegetation and relict populations.

AB  - Instituting water-saving crop planning (WSCP) is an effective way for the Heihe River basin to reverse its current growing scarcity of water resources and continuing environmental deterioration. However, because different areas of the river basin have different natural resources and diverse social and economic conditions, the planting structure for the region must be divided before the optimal adjustment of WSCP. The influencing factors for this division are chosen based on the analysis of the WSCP system. The appropriate indicators are selected from the overall influencing factors according to the existing hydro-meteorological, socio-economic and agricultural water conservancy conditions in each county in the river basin. Several unrelated main components that reflect most information from the original variables are extracted using factor analysis (FA) with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software and are then clustered using the K-means clustering algorithm (KMCA). Based on the clustering results, the basin is divided into six subzones: (1) Forage grass with dry farming, (2) grain and cash crops with rain-fed irrigation, (3) grain and cash crops with irrigation, (4) fruits and vegetables with irrigation, (5) cash crops with irrigation and (6) forage grass and cash crops with irrigation. Suitable development programs for each subzone were then drafted. This method avoids the overlap of related variables, reduces the difficulty of treatment and is convenient for indicator selection and information collection.

AB  - Tampa Bay is a large, urban estuary that is located in west central Florida. Although water quality conditions represent an important concern in this estuary, information from numerous sources indicates that sediment contamination also has the potential to adversely affect aquatic organisms, aquatic-dependent wildlife, and human health. As such, protecting relatively uncontaminated areas of the bay from contamination and reducing the amount of toxic chemicals in contaminated sediments have been identified as high-priority sediment management objectives for Tampa Bay. To address concerns related to sediment contamination in the bay, an ecosystem-based framework for assessing and managing sediment quality conditions was developed that included identification of sediment quality issues and concerns, development of ecosystem goals and objectives, selection of ecosystem health indicators, establishment of metrics and targets for key indicators, and incorporation of key indicators, metrics, and targets into watershed management plans and decision-making processes. This paper describes the process that was used to select and evaluate numerical sediment quality targets (SQTs) for assessing and managing contaminated sediments. These SQTs included measures of sediment chemistry, whole-sediment and pore-water toxicity, and benthic invertebrate community structure. In addition, the paper describes how the SQTs were used to develop site-specific concentration-response models that describe how the frequency of adverse biological effects changes with increasing concentrations of chemicals of potential concern. Finally, a key application of the SQTs for defining sediment management areas is discussed.

AB  - Background: A central question in evolutionary parasitology is to what extent ecology impacts patterns of parasitism in wild host populations. In this study, we aim to disentangle factors influencing the risk of parasite exposure by exploring the impact of sleeping site ecology on infection with ectoparasites and vector-borne hemoparasites in two sympatric primates endemic to Madagascar. Both species live in the same dry deciduous forest of northwestern Madagascar and cope with the same climatic constraints, they are arboreal, nocturnal, cat-sized and pair-living but differ prominently in sleeping site ecology. The Western woolly lemur (Avahi occidentalis) sleeps on open branches and frequently changes sleeping sites, whereas the Milne-Edward's sportive lemur (Lepilemur edwardsi) uses tree holes, displaying strong sleeping site fidelity. Sleeping in tree holes should confer protection from mosquito-borne hemoparasites, but should enhance the risk for ectoparasite infestation with mites and nest-adapted ticks. Sex may affect parasite risk in both species comparably, with males bearing a higher risk than females due to an immunosuppressive effect of higher testosterone levels in males or to sex-specific behavior. To explore these hypotheses, ectoparasites and blood samples were collected from 22 individuals of A. occidentalis and 26 individuals of L. edwardsi during the dry and rainy season.
   Results: L. edwardsi, but not A. occidentalis, harbored ectoparasites, namely ticks (Haemaphysalis lemuris [Ixodidae], Ornithodoros sp. [Argasidae]) and mites (Aetholaelaps trilyssa, [Laelapidae]), suggesting that sleeping in tree holes promotes infestation with ectoparasites. Interestingly, ectoparasites were found solely in the hot, rainy season with a prevalence of 75% (N = 16 animals). Blood smears were screened for the presence and infection intensity of hemoparasites. Microfilariae were detected in both species. Morphological characteristics suggested that each lemur species harbored two different filarial species. Prevalence of microfilarial infection was significantly lower in L. edwardsi than in A. occidentalis. No significant difference in infection intensity between the two host species, and no effect of season, daytime of sampling or sex on prevalence or infection intensity was found. In neither host species, parasite infection showed an influence on body weight as an indicator for body condition.
   Conclusions: Our findings support that sleeping site ecology affects ectoparasite infestation in nocturnal, arboreal mammalian hosts in the tropics, whereas there is no significant effect of host sex. The influence of sleeping site ecology to vector-borne hemoparasite risk is less pronounced. The observed parasite infections did not affect body condition and thus may be of minor importance for shaping reproductive fitness. Findings provide first evidence for the specific relevance of sleeping site ecology on parasitism in arboreal and social mammals. Further, our results increase the sparse knowledge on ecological drivers of primate host-parasite interactions and transmission pathways in natural tropical environments.

AB  - The purpose of this study is geoecological analysis of the risk of natural fires and other emergencies of an ecological nature based on the location of high-risk objects in the territory of the Kharkiv region. The following tasks were solved in the work: calculation of the risk of an ecologically dangerous event depending on the density of placement of objects of high danger in the region; Creation of a chart-map on the level of danger of environmental threat in the districts of the region; the search for the dependence of the area of forest fires on the density of the population, the number of high risk facilities, etc. An analysis of the influence of anthropogenic factors on the occurrence of natural fires on the example of the Kharkiv region was carried out. Distribution of potential risk and population density in the studied area allows us to obtain quantitative estimation of social risk for the population. Excessive population density in some areas of the region is one of the factors that increase the material and social risk of the territory and population of the region from natural disasters and man-made disasters. We created mapping zoning of multi-level districts of the region, the risk of an emergency reflects the patterns of spatial structure of potential sources of emergency situations and allows to increase the readiness of the executive and authorized services to act in the event of sudden emergencies and to act for their prevention. Available data allowed us to estimate the density of the placement of potential sources of man-made emergency situations for all districts of the region, which gives us the right, with a certain degree of conditionality, to speak about the extent of the technogenic danger of the territory of the studied areas of the Kharkiv region. We propose to apply a complex factor taking into account the population density, density of placement of objects of high danger and the proportion of high risk objects in the area of the forestry organization in comparison with the total number of objects in the region. For the simultaneous evaluation of both natural and anthropogenic conditions of forest fires in the region, we propose to use the methodology of scoring on which they are evaluated in a four-point system, taking into account the five main characterizing indicators : population density; forest area; the density of high risk facilities; climatic and weather conditions; the share of high risk facilities. Comparison of information on the average number of fires on the lands of the forest fund of Kharkiv region over the past ten years with the results of our typology of the areas shows some correlation. The results of studies on the assessment of the risks of the occurrence of fires depending on natural and anthropogenic factors can be used for zoning similar areas and forecasting the fire situation.

AB  - The area of Ucka Nature Park is comprised of the Ucka massif and part of Cicarija and is characterized by its specific position on the border of Continental and Mediterranean climatic influence. Such position is resulting in high richness and diversity of plant species and communities. One of the fundamental characteristics of this area are beech forests which can be classified as continental plant communities, but as a result of such specific position they are also characterized by many submediterranean elements.
   A total of 114 releves were made during the field research and description of habitats was done including geographical coordinates, slope estimation, aspect and vegetation layers cover. Numerical analyses of floristic composition were conducted using software packages SYN-TAX 2000 and PC-ORD. To determine vegetation types and their syntaxonomic status, releves from Ucka were compared to corresponding releves of beech forests of Aremonio-Fagion from the surrounding area of Croatia and Slovenia. In total, 1353 releves were analysed. Out of those releves, 982 were from the Slovenian database of releves, 184 from the Croatian database of releves of forest vegetation, 71 were personal unpublished releves form the area of Lika and Gorski kotar and, finally, 114 releves were from the area of Ucka Nature Park.
   Ordination analysis was conducted with the programme package CANOCO 4.5. For the description of ecological conditions we used ecological indicator values (EIV) according to the Pignatti. Descriptive statistics was calculated for environmental variables using software STATISTICA.
   During the phytosociological survey we recorded 203 species of vascular plants. After the classification of releves, as well as the camparison with the releves of corresponding vegetation types in the area of south Slovenia, Gorski kotar and Lika, we established that in the area of Ucka Nature Park the following plant associations of beech forests occure: Seslerio autumnali-Fagetum M. Wraber ex Borhidi 1963, Seslerio autumnali-Fagetum allietosum ursinii subass. nova hoc loco, Ranunculo platanifoliae-Fagetum Marincek et al. 1993. Seslerio autumnali-Fagetum is widely distributed across investigated area and forms a continuous vegetation belt from 800 to 1150 m. Here it occurs on all aspects and slopes. On lower altitudes (700-800 m) it occurs in separate stands on mesophilous habitats (ditches, karst depressions) surrounded by vegetation of Ostryo-Carpinion. Moreover, it is present in separate stands on altitudes up to 1350 m, on thermophilous habitats within ass. Ranunculo platanifoliae-Fagetum.
   They are typical stands of this association characterized by a large number of thermophilic species (Sesleria autumnalis, Ostrya carpinifolia, Sorbus aria, Acer obtusatum, Cornus mas etc.) but still with significant number of mesophilic species of beech forests such as-Acer pseudoplatanus, Daphne mezereum, Corylus avellana, Lonicera xylosteum, Cardamine enneaphyllos, C. bulbifera, Aremonia agriomonoides, Anemone nemorosa,Euphorbia amygdaloides (Trinajstic 1996, 2008; Vukelic et al. 2008).
   As opposed to stands of this association on other areas (Trinajstic 1996; Dakskobler 1990, 1996, 1997), stands from the investigated area are characterized by smaller number of species (26,1 on average). The primary reason for this is great abundance of Sesleria autumnalis which prevents the growth of other species. Furthermore forests of Ucka and Cicarija occure in a broad and continuous complex and the influence of neighboring vegetation types is weaker. On other areas this plant community often occurs in a narrow zone or is intermittent by other vegetation types, therefore species from neighbouring vegetation types to some extent enter in its floristic composition (Vukelic et al. 2008).
   Some releves of this association have significantly higher number and abundancy of thermophilic species such as Ostrya carpinifolia, Acer obtusatum, Sorbus aria, Tanacetum corymbosum, etc. These stands usually occure on lower altitudes, they have more open tree layer cover with higher average EIV values for temperature, light and soil reaction. They have developed due succession of ass. Seslerio-Ostryetum. It is a secondary association which has occupied large areas in the past. In the last decades on the area of Istria there have been great changes in management practices (absence of pasture and mowing) and different migration changes resulting in the secondary succession towards Seslerio-Fagetum or Ostryo-Quercetum pubescentis, depending on the habitat (Sugar 1992; Carni 1999; Marincek and Carni 2002; Trinajstic 2008). On such areas by termination of management activities tree layer cover gradually closes, which creates mesophilous conditions for occurrence of beech and progressively other mesophilous species of beech forests.
   In the southernmost part of the Ucka Nature Park (locality Bukovo) on a very small area specific stands of beech forest are developed surrounded by the thermophilous vegetation of Ostryo-Carpinion. This is a ditch protected from the sea by high ridge. These beech stands are situated on altitudes from 500 m up to 720 m. According to average EIV values these are the warmest habitats of beech forests in the investigated area with high moisture and nutrient content. Such specific habitat features as well as proximity of Ostryo-Carpinion vegetation lead to interesting combination of thermophilous (Ostryo-Carpinion) and mesophilous (Lamio orvalae-Fagenion) species. As a result of all the above-mentioned, a new subassociation is described (Seslerio autumnali-Fagetum allietosum ursinii subass. nova hoc loco). It is characterized by presence and high coverage of mesophilous differential species Allium ursinum, Daphne laureola, Corydalis cava, Ilex aquifolium and Leucojum vernum. Besides, it differs by high coverage of other mesophilous species such as - Lamium orvala, Erytronium dens-canis, Mercurialis perennis and others. Sesleria autumnalis as well as some other thermophilous species (Ostrya carpinifolia, Fraxinus ornus, Cornus mas and Acer obtusatum) acts as a connection towards the typical association.
   Ass. Ranunculo platanifolii-Fagetum is developed in the highest parts of the Park. On Vojak it forms more or less compact complex intermittent by patches of ass. Seslerio-Fagetum on thermophilous microlocalities, while on other sites it occurs in isolated stands with more humid and colder microclimate on higher altitudes within the ass. Seslerio-Fagetum (V. Planik, M. Planik), In general, this association occurs on the highest altitudes, largest terrain slopes and on the coldest habitats with high EIV values for humidity. Stands of the association on investigated area are very poor in their floristic composition (on average 18,2 species per releve) in comparison to other areas where this association occurs. This can be explained by the fact that Ucka is a mountain which rises directly from the sea and is subjected to influence of Mediterranean climate from almost all directions. Besides, mountain massif above 1100 m is very small and simply there is not enough space which could by its size support harsh climate conditions and longer snow maintenance and therefore creating by these means favourable conditions for growth of higher number of high-mountain species (sugar 1970).

AB  - Recent shifts in the ecological condition of Walden Pond, MA, are of potentially wide interest due to the lake's importance as a cultural, historical, and recreational resource in addition to its scientific value as an indicator of local and global environmental change. Algal microfossils in six sediment cores document changes in hydroclimate and trophic status of the lake during the last 1800 years and extend two previous sediment core records of shorter length. Low percentages of planktonic diatoms in the longest cores (WAL-3, WAL-15) indicate shallowing and/or greater water clarity associated with a relatively arid interval during the Medieval Climate Anomaly, ca. A.D. 1150-1300, Cultural eutrophication of the lake since the A.D. 1920s caused diatoms in the genera Asterionella and Synedra to increase in relative abundance at the expense of Cyclotella, Discostella, and the chrysophyte alga Mallomonas allorgel. Percentages of Asterionella and Synedra have remained fairly stable since A.D. 2000 when a previous sediment core study was conducted, but scaled chrysophytes have become more numerous. These findings suggest that, although mitigation efforts have curtailed anthropogenic nutrient inputs to Walden Pond, the lake has not returned to the pre-impact condition described by Henry David Thoreau and may become increasingly vulnerable to further changes in water quality in a warmer and possibly wetter future.

AB  - Studies that evaluate conservation status of ecosystems in Mexico often lack the integration of some theoretical bases as well as some methodological tools that landscape ecology offers. This situation imposes limitations for the implementation of more adequate management, restoration and conservation strategies. In this study we propose a four stage method in order to characterize the biophysical environment and to estimate the vegetation conservation status in a highly environmentally heterogeneous basin, under strong anthropogenic pressure. The stages were: 1) delimitation and characterization of environmental units based on biophysical conditions, 2) quantification of vegetation structure and composition, 3) classification of the species according to their functional responses, and 4) evaluation of the conservation status based on the community structure and composition. As a result, biophysical units showed differences in richness, diversity, and in the importance index values of native, weed and introduced species. Plant functional groups were identified; they comprised different environmental responses in a conservation gradient in the biophysical units. Through the canonical correspondence analysis, it was demonstrated that composition is mainly related to the light regime, temperature, humidity and some soil conditions. Significant differences in the conservation status of the biophysical units were found. Therefore vegetation composition is an important indicator of the conservation status; its definition helps to generate punctual strategies for conservation planning.

AB  - Macroinvertebrates are widely used as indicators to detect and assess anthropogenic impacts on freshwater ecosystems. However, despite being considered useful in indicating effects of environmental change in alpine catchments, little is known about species preferences for local conditions in such environments. In exploring the occurrence of 59 taxa within the dipteran family Chironomidae in relation to key-environmental variables in alpine and sub-alpine streams, we showed that sediment load, water temperature, periphyton density, and fine particulate organic matter mostly explain assemblage structures. Two-way-cluster analyses identified stream-type specific assemblages, indicator value analysis defined indicator species for glacial and non-glacial streams, and weighted averaging regression models confined preferences for local environmental conditions by summing their optima and tolerance widths regarding environmental key factors. The definition of habitat requirements identified stenoecious taxa with preferences for high and low values of respective variables thus identified most suitable indicators for future studies. Our work reveals manifold preferences within the dominant benthic invertebrate family, underlines their enormous potential for monitoring purposes, and is a step forward in better understanding ecosystem properties and biodiversity. Fundamental requirements for these kinds of indicative traits, essential to understand cause-effect relationships in environmental change issues, are a robust taxonomy and a comprehensive set of physical and chemical data.

Column selectivity towards HBCD diastereomers was evaluated for C-30 and C-18 stationary phases under different mobile phase conditions and column temperatures. The HBCD elution order was dependent on the shape selectivity of the stationary phase and the mobile phase composition. Greater resolution, on columns with reduced shape selectivity, of beta-HBCD and gamma-HBCD was achieved with the use of an acetonitrile/water (compared with a methanol/water) mobile phase composition. A liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESl-MS/MS) method for the analysis of HBCD in biological tissues was evaluated for potential matrix effects. The influence of extracted matrix components on HBCD diastereomer and enantiomer analysis was investigated using a postextraction addition approach. Although the analysis of HBCD diastereomers was relatively unaffected by the sample matrix, the responses of the HBCD enantiomers in tissue samples were significantly influenced by matrix effects and other changes to the ionization conditions. The use of racemic C-13-labeled HBCD diastereomers as internal standards for enantiomer fraction measurements corrected for the changes in the mass spectrometer response. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The role of palynology in paleoecological analyses of Tertiary coals
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL GEOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Pollen, spores, and other plant microfossils are important constituents of Tertiary coals, both as petrographic components (the maceral sporinite) and as distinctive indicators of the nature of the depositional environment in which the coal-forming Feat accumulated. Palynological analyses, which have been conducted on Tertiary coals since the 1930's, play an increasingly important role in modem paleoecological analyses of coals.
   Among the most important factors controlling the petrographic composition and facies characteristics of coal deposits are the types and relative abundances of plants that composed the peat. At present, wetland environments in which peat accumulates (mires) range from marshes and bogs to forested swamps; each is inhabited by distinctive plant communities. These plant communities are associated with varied conditions of climate, water depth, chemistry, and nutrient supply, and the floras can be indicative of these conditions. In the Tertiary Period, plant communities of mires were also highly diverse and specialized (especially as compared with those of the Carboniferous). The dominant species in some Paleocene mire floras were gymnosperms, but continuing a trend begun in Late Cretaceous time, angiosperms became increasingly prominent through the Tertiary. The diverse angiosperm-dominated mire floras produced coals that vary significantly in facies and hence in quality. Such contrasts are evident in contemporaneous coals from different paleolatitudes, as well as among coals of different ages within the Tertiary, as exemplified by selected deposits in the western United States. The palynofloras of these coals reflect the floristic composition of the plant communities of the ancient mires.

AB  - In recent years, there has been an intense desiccation of spruce forests in the Ukrainian Carpathians, where European spruce is the main forest-forming species. Over the recent years, desiccation has spread to the spruce forest stands which grow in the Carpathians at the height of over 1,000 m above the sea level. This process causes large economic losses, significant deterioration of the condition and productivity of the forests in the Carpathians, decrease in the level of provision of ecosystemic services by forests, functions they perform, therefore leading to dangerous exogenic processes (floods, freshets, erosion, mudflows, landslides). To determine the interaction between the radial increment and sanitary condition of the spruce stands and substantiate the measures of the use of drying spruce forests, in the Vysokohirsky forestry reserve district of the Ukrainian Carpathians in anti-erosion forests, in hotbeds of desiccation of spruce in 2018, dendrochronological surveys were undertaken in two monitoring plots in forests in weak and severely weakened condition. We collected cores from the model trees, measured width of the annual rings, and developed individual dendpochronologies according to the absolute values of the radial increments and generalized dendrochronologies according to the absolute values of the radial increments and increment indices of the duration of 97 (1921-2017) and 81 years (1937-2017). We conducted single-factor dispersion analysis, calculated the indices of abnormality of the radial increments and correlation coefficient. The results revealed that the lowest increments occurred in the years 1965-1990 in the weakened stand and in 1997-2017 in the severely weakened stand. The relative indices of the forests ranged 83.8-114.6%. The cycles of increment lasted 7-9 years. Over the last few decades, favourable conditions for the growth of the trees took place in 1991-2010, unfavourable in 2011-2017, very unfavourable in 1981-1990. Synchronicity of annual radial increments in the spruce of two monitoring plots equaled 49 years. Correlation coefficient indicates that the type of the conditions of growth location has a significant effect on its variability in the process of trees' life cycle. Average radial increment of the weakened stand of trees over the last 10 years decreased by 7.9%, while it declined by 54.9% in the severely weakened stand compared with the average increments of the tree stands for the surveyed periods, suggesting that the forests undergo different stages of succession: the weakened stand undergoes the stage of recovery after disturbance, severely weakened forest - stage of disturbance. The studies revealed the dependence of radial increment of spruce on the sanitary condition of the forests. The results of the studies may be used for the assessment of dynamic processes in forest ecosystems as a result of the impact of various factors and planning of the forestry measures.

AB  - Current standardized laboratory test protocols use model species that have limitations to accurately assess native species responses to stressors. We developed and tested a novel acute in situ protocol for testing field-collected organisms. We used Asellus aquaticus and NaCl as a reference toxicant to test for the effects of location (laboratory vs. in situ), medium (synthetic vs. field water), substrate (presence vs. absence), and protocol replicability. We further tested the protocol using groundwater-adapted isopods: Proasellus assaforensis for the effect of location, P. cavaticus of medium and P. lusitanicus of substrate. Our results showed that A. aquaticus' lethality obtained with the novel acute in situ protocol did not significantly differ from those from laboratory testing. However, laboratory tested P. assaforensis showed a higher sensitivity, suggesting that its acclimation to laboratory conditions might have pernicious effects. A. aquaticus and P. cavaticus showed a higher mortality using synthetic medium in situ and under laboratory conditions, which overestimated the stressor's effect. Besides, substrate use had no significant effect. The novel acute in situ protocol allows the use of native species under realistic scenarios. It is particularly well adapted for assessing the risk of groundwater ecosystems but it can be applied to a wide range of ecosystems.

AB  - Since the industrial revolution, anthropogenic CO2 emissions have caused ocean acidification, which particularly affects calcified organisms. Given the fan-like calcified fronds of the brown alga Padina pavonica, we evaluated the acute (short-term) effects of a sudden pH drop due to a submarine volcanic eruption (October 2011-early March 2012) affecting offshore waters around El Hierro Island (Canary Islands, Spain). We further studied the chronic (long-term) effects of the continuous decrease in pH in the last decades around the Canarian waters. In both the observational and retrospective studies (using herbarium collections of P. pavonica thalli from the overall Canarian Archipelago), the percent of surface calcium carbonate coverage of P. pavonica thalli were contrasted with oceanographic data collected either in situ (volcanic eruption event) or from the ESTOC marine observatory data series (herbarium study). Results showed that this calcified alga is sensitive to acute and chronic environmental pH changes. In both cases, pH changes predicted surface thallus calcification, including a progressive decalcification over the last three decades. This result concurs with previous studies where calcareous organisms decalcify under more acidic conditions. Hence, Padina pavonica can be implemented as a bio-indicator of ocean acidification (at short and long time scales) for monitoring purposes over wide geographic ranges, as this macroalga is affected and thrives (unlike strict calcifiers) under more acidic conditions.

AB  - The Chalkhill Blue Polyommatus coridon is a widespread butterfly of lowland calcareous grassland in southern Britain and is considered a good indicator of habitat condition. Polyommatus coridon has been identified as a Species of Conservation Concern in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan due to a greater than 25% decline in range size since the 1950s, with losses due to the combined effects of habitat destruction, agricultural intensification and neglect. Analysis of annual butterfly monitoring data (transects) collected at 161 sites from 1981 to 2000 show a three-fold population recovery had occurred. The increases were at established sites, with no re-colonisations or range expansion detected. The 1980s population increase coincided with increases across the species range in stock and rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus grazing, as well as greater protection and management of sites through protected areas and nature reserves. During the 1990s agri-environment schemes were thought to be the main conservation and policy mechanism driving the favourable conservation status of P. coridon, by facilitating appropriate habitat restoration and management. Weather played a part in the species recovery, with warm, but wet summers associated with increases in abundance. The research provides strong evidence of an important conservation success with the UK Biodiversity Action Plan, with implications for other specialist biodiversity.

AB  - Genetic markers provide potentially sensitive indicators of changes in environmental conditions because the genetic constitution of populations is normally altered well before populations become extinct. Genetic indicators in populations include overall genetic diversity, genetic changes in traits measured at the phenotypic level, and evolution at specific loci under selection. While overall genetic diversity has rarely been successfully related to environmental conditions, genetically based changes in traits have now been linked to the presence of toxins and both local and global temperature shifts. Candidate loci for monitoring stressors are emerging from information on how specific genes influence traits, and from screens of random loci across environmental gradients. Drosophila research suggests that chromosomal regions under recent intense selection can be identified from patterns of molecular variation and a high frequency of transposable element insertions. Allele frequency changes at candidate loci have been linked to pesticides, pollutants and climate change. Nevertheless, there are challenges in interpreting allele frequencies in populations, particularly when a large number of loci control a trait and when interactions between alleles influence trait expression. To meet these challenges, population samples should be collected for longitudinal studies, and experimental programmes should be undertaken to link variation at candidate genes to ecological processes.

AB  - The early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic happened to be the flu season. Since some symptoms of influenza and COVID-19 are similar, symptomatic patients flocked to fever clinics and emergency departments. Meanwhile, asymptomatic COVID-19 patients attending other departments in general hospitals made things worse. Lack of knowledge of the pathogen, absence of awareness and short of personal protective equipment all posed threat to healthcare workers as well as other patients. As SARS-CoV-2 can be spread via droplets, direct contacts and potentially aerosols, the indoor air environment of hospitals, especially fever clinics, must have strict measures to prevent hospital-acquired infection.
   Thirty-two sensors were deployed in the Tsinghua University Affiliated Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital (mentioned as Changgung Hospital hereinafter) from January 30, 2020, in order to monitor high-resolution real-time indoor environmental parameters at its fever clinic, isolation wards and other departments. One sensor monitors and records CO2 concentration, PM2.5 mass concentration, relative humidity, temperature and illuminance every 5 minutes. Six sensors were located at the fever clinic, where all patients with fever and/or other COVID-19 related symptoms firstly attended after arriving at the hospital. The clinic has two parts, one for diagnosis and the other for quarantine. Three sensors were placed in doctor's office, nursing station and waiting area in the diagnosis part, respectively. Natural ventilation was chosen to dilute the environment, as the flowrate of outdoor airflow was abundant in Beijing's winter.
   Atmospheric CO2 concentration surrounding Changgung Hospital was stable, and the rise of indoor CO2 concentration was caused by human exhalation. During this pandemic, CO2 concentration can be regarded as an indicator of room ventilation condition and hospital congestion, if all the people in hospital were regarded as potential infector of SARS-CoV-2. According to the usage pattern of the fever clinic, the maximum number of patients in each functional area was set as 4 for doctor's office, 4 for nursing station and 11 for waiting area. According to the ventilation regulation of infectious disease hospital, the air change rate at fever clinics should be at least 6 h(-1). In addition, the outdoor CO2 concentration was assumed to be 400 ppm. Based on these conditions, the upper limits of indoor CO2 concentration were 902, 864 and 867 ppm for doctor's office, nursing station and waiting area at the Changgung Hospital's fever clinic, respectively. Indoor CO2 concentration exceeding these thresholds stands for poor ventilation or overcrowds. Fortunately, this didn't happen during the monitoring period and indoor CO2 concentration didn't exceed 609-711 ppm. In another word, natural ventilation was sufficient and effective in this specific case at the Changgung Hospital's fever clinic. Moreover, together with environment disinfection and personal protective measures, good ventilation condition led to no COVID-19 hospitalacquired infection.
   To conclude, this article introduced a real-time environmental monitoring campaign at the Changgung Hospital's fever clinic. Similar methodology can help assess ventilation conditions and risk of hospital-acquired infection at the fever clinic during and after COVID-19 pandemic. Once indoor CO2 concentration exceeds the set thresholds, areas with high infection risk can be identified rapidly and timely, so that prevention measures can be taken in time.

AB  - Periosteal new bone formation (PNBF) is a common finding in a large spectrum of diseases. In clinical practice, the morphology and location of periosteal lesions are frequently used to assist in the differential diagnosis of distinct bone conditions. Less commonly reported is the presence of PNBF on the ribs. This contrasts with the data retrieved from the study of skeletonized human remains that shows a high frequency of cases and a strong, albeit not specific, association between periosteal rib lesions and pulmonary conditions (e.g. tuberculosis). Despite that, an overall disagreement regarding the specificity and non-specificity of periosteal reactions exists in the study of dry bone remains. The insufficient number of clinical models exploring the morphology and the pathophysiology of PNBF's and the lack of systematic studies of pathological samples with a known diagnosis are claimed as major reasons for the disagreements. This study aimed to describe and compare the macroscopic and the histomorphologic appearance of periosteal rib lesions and to discuss their usefulness as diagnostic indicators. To pursue this goal, an assemblage of 13 rib samples (males = 11, females = 2, mean age-at-death = 36.6 years old) was collected from the Luis Lopes Skeletal Collection (Museu Nacional de Historia Natural e da Ciencia, Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal). The assemblage belongs to individuals who died from pulmonary-TB (group 1), non-TB pulmonary infections (group 2) and other conditions (group 3). Prior to sample preparation, the ribs were visually inspected and the PNBF described according to its thickness, the degree of cortical integration and the type of new bone formed (e.g. woven, lamellar or both). After sampling, each bone sample was prepared for histological analysis under plane and polarized light microscopy. Macroscopically, the results showed no differences in the new bone composition between cause-of-death groups. Only slight differences in the degree of cortical integration, which was most frequently classified as mild to high in the pulmonary-TB group, were observed. Histologically, no distinguishing features were identified by pathological group. However, new bone microarchitectures were observed compatible with (1) acute, fast-growing processes (e.g. spiculated reactions), (2) long-standing processes with a rapid bone formation (e.g. appositional layering of bone) and/or (3) chronic, slow-growing processes (e.g. layers of compact lamellae). To some extent, these distinct rates of disease progression resonate with the cause-of-death listed for some individuals. Despite the small sample size, the results of this investigation are in agreement with previous studies, according to which the macroscopic and histological appearance of periosteal formations are not specific for a particular pathological conditions. Nevertheless, the results support the conclusion that the morphology of periosteal lesions is a good biological indicator for inferring the rate of progression and duration of pathological processes. This study provides important reference data regarding the histomorphology of periosteal lesions that can be used for comparative purposes, as well as to narrow down the differential diagnosis in unidentified skeletal remains.

AB  - Oral lichenoid conditions (OLC), including oral lichen planus (OLP), oral lichenoid lesions and oral lichenoid dysplasia, differ in pathogenesis and biological malignancy. However, distinguishing them based on clinical or histological features is difficult. It is well known that CD163(+)macrophages are associated with oral cancer aggressiveness. We recently demonstrated that CD163(+)macrophages of noncancerous lesions infiltrate the stroma, not the intraepithelial area. In this report, we describe a case of OLC that was not detected as malignant by the first local biopsy. Furthermore, we evaluated the malignant potency of OLC by retrospectively comparing the histological findings between local biopsy and resected specimens focusing on CD163(+)macrophages. A 72-year-old man with a white lesion in the unilateral buccal mucosa was diagnosed with OLP through the biopsy although invasive cancer was detected two years later. Intraepithelial CD163(+)macrophages were found not only on the resected specimen but also biopsy. This is the first report to demonstrate that intraepithelial CD163(+)macrophages may be noteworthy indicators to identify the malignant potency of OLC.

AB  - The contents of free sulphydryl groups (SH), disulphide bonds (SS), and free amino groups (NH2) were determined in order to estimate the extent of climatic condition influence on gluten quality. The analysis included four bread wheat varieties grown in two production years (2011 and 2012) with different climatic conditions in different locations. According to our previously reported results, the working hypothesis was that enzyme activity for breadmaking purpose was insufficient. The aim of this paper was to study the influence of naturally present enzymes on the bread quality by the addition of previously extracted and freeze-dried albumins to the base flour as an additive. The selection of samples was made on the basis of different combinations of proteolytic and alpha-amylolytic enzymes activity levels. For samples from 2012 production year, the content of SH groups was significantly higher. Regarding the SS content, the obtained results exhibited the opposite trend. Variations in NH2 content were dominantly caused by temperature treatment of tested samples. The addition of freeze-dried albumins to bread improved its specific volume in a lesser extent, while bread crumb texture was significantly improved.

AB  - Brazil is the world leader in broiler production and export. It achieved this position mainly to its excellent supply chain structure and climate, which favor poultry and grain production throughout its territory. Although Brazilian egg production is not as important as broiler production, this segment presents great potential of increasing its share in the global market. However, as elsewhere in the world, Brazilian poultry production faces the challenge to balance two elements within its supply chain: cruelty and productivity. The consumers of the European Union (EU) are very concerned with animal welfare issues. In order to increase its share in the European market, and eventually in the world market, Brazilian poultry producers must understand the effects of production systems on poultry welfare, and try to develop systems that are suited for its climate and other production conditions. There is a consensus that the natural behaviors performed by poultry in intensive production systems allow better welfare. This objective of this review is to present scientific research studies that relate different behaviors to chicken welfare. Poultry behavior is a reflex of their welfare status at a particular moment, and it is related to internal (physiological) and external (environmental) factors. Several natural behaviors that favor welfare, as well as undesirable behaviors, may be stimulated by environmental enrichment. The correct interpretation of the behaviors expressed by poultry, including their frequency, duration, and sequence, may be used to estimate their welfare.
   Animal production is an import sector of Brazilian economy. It significantly contributes to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), in terms of products destined both to domestic consumption and exports. New technologies applied to products and management practices have been developed for field application, aiming at improving producers' productivity and profitability. In order to comply with the European Union's (EU) guidelines for animal protein production, Brazilian poultry production needs to undergo a process of adaptation.
   In May, 2007, the EU Commission established its new guidelines for animal welfare in poultry production, pressured by consumer demand. In the EU, there is a growing concern among consumers as to how poultry are reared and slaughtered. European consumers are in the fore front of the demand of high quality products produced with under better welfare conditions, and have spread this concern throughout the world. Beaumont et al. (2010) mentioned that European consumers frequently perceive that standard commercial poultry production has poor animal welfare practices.
   According to Naas et al. (2008), Brazilian poultry production today needs to find a balance between cruelty and productivity. In fact, ensuring animal welfare may provide better financial results, as it increases the producer's profit margins and allows maintaining Brazilian chicken export quotas to the EU. Franca (2008) noted that biological studies that define ethical limits and guidelines for poultry production foster the development of new production practices that may ensure good product quality and productivity without putting bird welfare at risk.
   Gonyou (1994) states that, when animal welfare started to be studied, the only behavioral factors considered were those related to feeding and reproduction. These first studies used as indicators of animal welfare reduced life expectancy, impaired growth, impaired reproduction, body damage, disease, immunosuppression, adrenal activity, behavior anomalies, and self-narcotization (Broom, 1991). However, current studies evaluate additional indicators, such as natural behaviors, behavioral needs, preferences, behavioral problems, emotional state, cognitive abilities, etc.
   In the field of ethology, the expression of natural behavior is a frequently used tool used to estimate the welfare of poultry destined to human consumption. According to Bracke & Hopster (2006), natural behavior can be defined as the behavior the animal normally presents when exposed to conditions similar to its natural habitat. Natural behaviors are pleasurable and promote biological functions that are meaningful to the animal's welfare. The definition of natural behavior, though, does not include the bird's behavior when sick, in flight or during aggression, since these are not considered pleasurable situations.
   Considering layer behavioral needs in the design of housing facilities optimize their welfare. Mishra et al. (2005) verified that ISA Brown layers spent, during 24 hours, around 97% of the time in the nest, feeding, walking, resting, or dust bathing, and that 57% of these behaviors did not depend on environmental enrichment. It was also observed that hens had preferred behavioral sequences, which included foraging and comfort behaviors, such as wing-stretching and preening.
   The present review aims at discussing, albeit not exhaustively, scientific research studies on the behavior of Gallusgallus domesticus and its relationship to welfare. The following behaviors are reviewed: feather pecking, scratching, dust bathing, nesting, locomotion activities, and aggressive behaviors. These behaviors are the most frequently observed in commercial broiler, broiler breeder, and layer farming, and therefore, monitoring their incidence may contribute to measure poultry welfare.

AB  - Eutrophication, climate change, and river flow fragmentation are the main cause of nuisance algal blooms worldwide. This study evaluated the conditions that trigger the growth and occurrence of nuisance phytoplankton in the Santa Lucia River, a subtropical floodplain lotic system that supplies drinking water to 60% of the population of Uruguay. The main variables that explained phytoplankton biovolume were extracted from generalized linear models (GLM). The potential impact of nuisance organism advection on water utility was estimated by the phytoplankton biovolume transport (BVTR, m(3) day(-1)), an indicator of biomass load. Santa Lucia River had a wide flow range (0.7x10(5)-1438x10(5) m(3) day(-1)) and eutrophic conditions (median, TP: 0.139 mg L-1; TN: 0.589 mg L-1). GLMs indicated that phytoplankton biomass increased with temperature and soluble reactive phosphorus. Contrary to expectations, the presence of cyanobacteria was positively associated with periods of high flow that result in high cyanobacterial biovolume transport, with a probability of 3.35 times higher when flow increased by one standard deviation. The cyanobacterial biovolume transported (max: 9.5 m(3) day(-1)) suggests that biomass was subsidized by allochthonous inocula. Biovolume from other nuisance groups (diatoms, cryptophytes, and euglenophytes) was positively associated with low-flow conditions and high nutrient concentrations in the main river channel, thereby indicating that these conditions boost eukaryote blooms. The evaluation of BVTR allows a better understanding of the dynamics of fluvial phytoplankton and can help to anticipate scenarios of nuisance species transport.

AB  - The conventional condition monitoring systems for rotating electrical machines are predominantly based on externally available signals, while the internal signals, especially on the rotor, remain relatively unexplored. To access these internal signals, wireless sensors offer an effective solution in terms of cost and ease of deployment. However, the environment inside an electrical machine deviates from a typical wireless RF application and communication link reliability under such scenarios needs to be assessed. This paper explores the feasibility of utilizing the ubiquitous IEEE 802.15.4-2.4 GHz compliant radios for wireless sensor deployment inside an electrical machine. A series of measurements are made to experimentally investigate the link quality characteristics under the prominent environmental factors such as the multipath effect, Doppler shift, magnetic field interference, and shielding effect of the enclosure. Packet reception rate, received signal strength and link quality indicator are used as the metrics to quantify the link performance. It is observed that contrary to popular belief, the link quality between nodes inside the machine is not deteriorated and in fact is found to be enhanced. A poor link quality is observed for the connection between nodes placed inside and outside the machine. Moreover, the link quality is highly dependent on spatial position and prone to interference. However, a sufficiently stable link can be established at the expense of high transmit power. These experimental findings indicate that wireless RF-based sensor nodes can be deployed inside an electrical machine and it opens an opportunity to explore invasive condition monitoring systems.

AB  - With growing accessibility to remote sensing (RS) data, field surveys (FS) are no longer the only tool for obtaining information on river hydromorphology. The current study addresses the question of comparability between RS- and FS-based assessments of large river hydromorphological (HM) characteristics, using the Slovenian hydromorphological assessment method as a comparison tool. The applied RS approach was based on manual digitalization and free-available RS imagery, while FS were conducted using the River habitat survey. FS and RS data were obtained for 73 sites, covering a broad gradient of large river conditions, from nearly natural to severely modified. To account for natural diversity, sites were grouped into simple and complex channel sites. Furthermore, the RS approach was tested for its ability to trace changes in HM conditions along the river continuum (1,144 sites) and to detect factors of major HM change. Our research showed that FS- and RS-based approaches can give very similar outcomes in large river HM assessment, especially when assessing general HM conditions, as the high correlations of the final indices of the Slovenian hydromorphological assessment method illustrate. Stronger relationships were recognized for simple compared to complex channel sites. The applied RS approach proved its viability in tracing habitat conditions along the river continuum, exposing hydro-dams and urbanization as the main drivers of habitat change. Overall, our findings support a stronger integration of RS into HM assessments, although caution is recommended when applied on complex systems. In order to capture the whole HM diversity of large rivers, FS are still needed.

AB  - Background: The SCN5A encoded sodium current (I-Na) generates the action potential (AP) upstroke and is a major determinant of AP characteristics and AP propagation in cardiac myocytes. Unfortunately, in cardiac myocytes, investigation of kinetic properties of I-Na with near-physiological ion concentrations and temperature is technically challenging due to the large amplitude and rapidly activating nature of I-Na, which may seriously hamper the quality of voltage control over the membrane. We hypothesized that the alternating voltage clamp-current clamp (VC/CC) technique might provide an alternative to traditional voltage clamp (VC) technique for the determination of I-Na properties under physiological conditions.
   Principal Findings: We studied I-Na under close-to-physiological conditions by VC technique in SCN5A cDNA-transfected HEK cells or by alternating VC/CC technique in both SCN5A cDNA-transfected HEK cells and rabbit left ventricular myocytes. In these experiments, peak I-Na during a depolarizing VC step or maximal upstroke velocity, dV/dt(max), during VC/CC served as an indicator of available I-Na. In HEK cells, biophysical properties of I-Na, including current density, voltage dependent (in) activation, development of inactivation, and recovery from inactivation, were highly similar in VC and VC/CC experiments. As an application of the VC/CC technique we studied I-Na in left ventricular myocytes isolated from control or failing rabbit hearts.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that the alternating VC/CC technique is a valuable experimental tool for I-Na measurements under close-to-physiological conditions in cardiac myocytes.

AB  - Post-normal science (PNS) has long advocated the inclusion of stakeholders in scientific processes where there is uncertainty, urgency and high stakes. Increasingly, however, such conditions have become recognised as the norm. Using the theoretical perspective of PNS, we examine the interactions between public objection, unstable coalition politics and uncertain environmental assessment knowledge to understand the case study of a Danish near-shore wind farm tender. In this case the original distinction made by PNS between facts, judgements, politics and science are confirmed as difficult to separate in what has been described as a condition of post-normal politics. The case, taking place within Denmark's relatively transparent and inclusive wind power governance system, offers insights into the challenges of managing long-term environmental and energy policy objectives. However the case also demonstrates the challenges to the policy prescriptions of PNS, specifically regarding the notion of extended peer review communities (EPCs). Here we propose that the de facto condition for energy siting controversies is one of multiple, often self-organised EPCs.

AB  - Due to rapid development in mobile communication technology in recent years, the demand for high quality and high capacity networks with thorough coverage has become a major necessity. Several models have been developed for predicting wireless signal coverage in urban areas, but these models suffer from inadequately calculating certain conditions, such as weather and building materials, especially window size. In this paper, we propose a new path loss prediction model based on the measurement of new indicators, such as window size, temperature, and humidity conditions, after which an extensive statistical analysis using a linear regression technique was implemented in order to validate the new indicators. As the new indicators were incorporated into the Okumura model to derive a new path loss model, the results showed that the proposed model provides an accurate prediction of the received signal strength in a given propagation environment. Our model enhanced the prediction of path loss by 10% when compared to the Okumura and by 15% when compared to the COST-Hata.

AB  - Non-specific stress markers such as linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH) have been associated in the literature with a large number of possible conditions disrupting the individual's homeostasis, though metabolic strain originating synergistically by disease and Malnutrition has been held to be the main cause behind enamel disruption. The analysis of LEH in the Maya Classic period site of Xcambo, located along the northern coast of the Yucatan peninsula, reveals high exposure to stressful conditions during infancy regardless of age and sex. Yet, the inhabitants of the site were of a medium to high social and economic status, with access to balanced and protein-rich nutritional resources, which should have functioned as a cultural buffer to the impact of stress. In the light of this apparent contradiction, this paper discusses the impact of environmental conditions on the record of metabolic stress. Our conclusions pose a cautionary caveat for inferring nutrition and status in ancient pre-antibiotic Populations solely from the occurrence of linear enamel hypoplasia. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - Thecamoebian species and assemblages reported from various limnological environments in North America are not appreciably different across a climatic gradient ranging from semi-tropical to Arctic latitudes. However, certain morphological characteristics of individual species referred to as "strains" do appear to be very sensitive to changing environmental conditions. Thus, the identification of strains is a useful technique in the interpretation of paleoenvironmental conditions. Other features considered diagnostic of Arctic conditions in particular, are assemblages dominated by one or two species, and large and coarse tests.
   Some thecamoebian specimens found in lakes on Richards Island, Northwest Territories, Canada, are two to three times larger than those reported from temperate locations. These "giant" specimens are perhaps related to very short periods of warm water temperatures which appear to be favorable for reproduction. Tests grow to a large size after extended feeding periods during the short Arctic summers. For the first time, continuous annual lake temperature data confirm the hypothesis that the presence of abundant large tests in an assemblage may be indicative of cold climates, due to a short reproductive season.

AB  - Photographs have long been used to represent environmental conditions in the context of landscape quality assessments and environmental perception research. Representational options have been significantly expanded by applications of computer modeling and computer graphic technologies that can provide precise visualizations based on inventoried or model-projected biophysical data. Final graphic displays from computer visualization systems can range from very abstract 'wire-frame' models to high resolution, photorealistic video images. An important assumption underlying the use of both photographic and computer rendered visualizations is that human viewers' responses to these representations provide valid indications of perceptions and judgments made in response to direct experience with the landscape conditions nominally represented. In this study the same set of forest landscape scenes was represented by visualizations rendered at four different levels of realism-abstraction. Each representation was shown to separate groups of observers who rated the perceived scenic beauty of the common set of forest landscape scenes. Correlations between the ratings of the same scenes in the different visualization conditions were very low, raising important questions about the representational validity of computer-generated landscape visualizations.

AB  - Abdominal pain in the elderly can be a challenging and difficult condition to diagnose and treat. The geriatric population has significant comorbidities and often takes polypharmacy that can mask symptoms. The presentation of common conditions can be different than that in the younger population, often lacking the traditional indicators of disease, making it of pivotal importance for the clinician to consider a wide differential during their workup. It is also important to consider extra-abdominal abnormality that may manifest as abdominal pain.

To face up to this, and looking for a management taking into account the sustainable development, the E.U. has set an objective to reach, for 2015, a "good ecological and chemical condition of waters". In France, an inventory of fixtures has been drawn up, but following aberrant procedures from a scientific point of view, and maps without much sense have been published. The aim of this paper is to highlight these facts for the purpose of making everyone aware of the seriousness of the situation.

However, the application of this technology in industry is slowed down due to cyber security policies, the coexistence of old manufacturing systems, with limited monitoring capabilities, with newer and fully monitored ones, and the lack of application-oriented functionalities. In this paper, a fast and automated machine tool characterization procedure, called Fingerprint, is presented, that allows determining useful Key Performance Indicators of the status of machine tools based on IoT technologies. The paper also presents the implementation of this technology in industrial environment.

AB  - For Lotka-Volterra population systems, a general model ofstate monitoringis presented. The model includes time-dependent environmental effects or direct human intervention ("treatment") as control functions and, instead of the whole state vector, the densities of certain indicator species (distinguished or lumped together) are observed.Mathematical systems theoryoffers a sufficient condition for local observability in such systems. The latter means that, based on the above (dynamic) partial observation, the state of the population can be recovered, at least near equilibrium. The application of this sufficient condition is illustrated by three-species examples such as a one-predator two-prey system and a simple food chain.

AB  - The ability of the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans to disseminate into tissues is promoted by a switch from budding to invasive hyphal growth. This morphological transition is stimulated by multiple environmental factors that can vary at different sites of infection. To identify genes that promote invasive growth, C. albicans mutants can be screened for defects in growing invasively into solid agar medium as a substitute for studying tissue invasion. This in vitro approach has advantages in that it permits the media conditions to be varied to mimic different host environments. In addition, the concentration of agar can be varied to determine the effects of altering the rigidity of the matrix into which the cells invade, as this provides a better indicator of invasive growth than the ability to form hyphae in a liquid culture. Testing under multiple conditions can be used to identify mutant cells with the strongest defects. Therefore, protocols and media for analyzing invasive growth of C. albicans under different conditions will be described that are appropriate for testing a single strain or high-throughput analysis of a collection of mutant C. albicans strains.

The distribution of lanthanides was investigated in phosphorites and sedimentary rocks from the cover of the East European platform, and published data on the geochemistry of phosphorites from Eurasia were analyzed. Indicator lanthanide ratios were established for the determination of the climate and depth of sedimentation, and the possibility of the use of rare earth elements for the facies settings and transgression-regression cycles of sedimentation was demonstrated. The sedimentation conditions of the iron formations of the Proterozoic Kursk and Krivoi Rog sedimentary groups were inferred from the distribution of lanthanides: the hematite and magnetite quartzites are the deepest water complexes of the sedimentation profile; the climatic conditions of sedimentation were estimated as humid for shale subformations and humid-semihumid for iron formations; the depths of sedimentation in the Kursk basin was 50-300 m; the sources of iron were the material of weathering profiles and endogenous influx.

AB  - Hypolimnetic oxygen depletion has been accelerated in many lakes due to cultural eutrophication. However, the extent and magnitude of environmental change is difficult to ascertain due to the lack of historical records. Larval Chironomidae (Diptera) are useful proxy indicators of oxygen, as they show a wide range of tolerances to oxygen conditions and their chitinous head capsules preserve well in lake sediments. Using paleolimnological techniques, chironomid assemblages from the surface sediments of 42 southeastern Ontario lakes were related to environmental conditions. Hypolimnetic oxygen conditions, measured as the average end-of-summer hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (AvgDO((Summ))), explained the most variation in the chironomid assemblages, whereas dissolved inorganic carbon, the Anoxic Factor, max. depth and total phosphorus concentrations were also correlated with assemblage composition. Based on the relative abundances of 45 chironomid taxa, a robust, partial least squares (PLS) regression transfer function for AvgDO((Summ)) was constructed (r(2) = 0.74, r((jack))(2) = 0.58, n = 40). This new transfer function should allow paleolimnologists to directly track past trends in hypolimnetic oxygen levels.

AB  - Coastal resource management (CRM) programs have been implemented in the Philippines since the 1980s with the specific intent to protect and rehabilitate coastal habitats and enhance the sustainability of coastal communities. However, the implementation of these programs alone does not guarantee the success of program objectives. Monitoring and evaluation of program outcomes is essential for determining if programs are effective in reaching management goals. The purpose of this research was to evaluate long-term CRM programs using community perceptions of coastal resource condition, management practices, and program outcomes. Coastal residents in Baybay City, Leyte were surveyed and asked to rank a series of questions related to resource condition and 20 previously described management performance indicators. Respondents reported a decline in coastal resource condition over the past decade, even though they perceive positive outcomes of management programs aimed at enhancing resource condition. The sustainability and efficiency of management outcomes were perceived positively, with mixed views on equity outcomes. Results suggest that lack of full inclusion, low management oversight, and threat to coastal resources are concerns of the coastal community. Socioeconomic data collected from respondents, yielded a pattern indicating that gender, self-reported level of environmental knowledge, and management cluster were significant contextual variables associated with perceptions of respondents. Overall, CRM programs are perceived to have a positive impact and there is a high level of interest for participating in future management activities. This study exemplifies how perceptions and associated contextual information of the community provides invaluable insights into the effectiveness of coastal resource management and be incorporated into the adaptive management cycle.

AB  - Land management to protect streams requires knowing which parts of the landscape most strongly influence stream condition. Understanding how flow through landscapes and along streams affects such land-use impacts requires knowing the period of antecedent discharge that most strongly influences condition. Both considerations require determination of optimal weighting schemes for predictors of stream condition. We calculated forest cover weighted by flow-path distance to 572 urban, peri-urban, and rural sites-in the Melbourne, Australia, region-sampled for macroinvertebrates, and antecedent discharge weighted by time preceding each of 1,723 samples. Using mixed linear models that accounted for spatial dependence, we aimed to determine the weighting curve shape and length that best predicted macroinvertebrate assemblage composition. The best model was a function of mean annual discharge, weighted forest cover, weighted imperviousness, weighted antecedent discharge, and their interactions. Optimal weightings were exponential-half-decay distance 35 m overland (plausible range 26-50 m), and 1.0 km in-stream (0.75-1.3 km) for forest cover-, and linear over a parts per thousand yen4 year for antecedent discharge. Model plausibility was more affected by weighting distance than the shape of the weighting function. Regardless of weighting curve shape, riparian forest effects on macroinvertebrate assemblages are strongest within 10(1)-10(2) m from the stream, and 10(3) m upstream. Although exponential weightings are only marginally more plausible, they are the most realistic representation of physical processes. While our conclusions should not be interpreted as recommendations for buffer widths, they provide valuable insight into the scales of influence in the region and could be used to inform management decisions.

AB  - Small seabirds are very sensitive to changes in the availability of prey and thus may be good indicators of changes in species composition and availability of prey. However, long-term data on dietary variation is scarce for tropical tern species. This paper assembles 9 years of data on deliveries of fish prey to Roseate Tern chicks of known-age on Aride Island, the Seychelles, in the western Indian Ocean, to examine: (1) the role of intrinsic (age of chicks) and extrinsic (local oceanographic conditions) factors on chick food provisioning, and (2) the temporal variation in intake rate of chicks. Our results show low annual variability in dietary composition: 75-97% of all ingested items were goatfish (Mullidae), which agrees with previous studies showing that these form the main prey fish for the Seychelles seabird community. Intake rate of chicks varied considerably among years, from 0.86 g fish ingested chick-1 h(-1) in 1997 to 3.12 g chick(-1) h(-1) in 2005, with poor years showing a much higher coefficient of variation than good years. Intake rate of chicks was significantly correlated with local chlorophyll-a concentration and sea-surface temperature of the preceding 2 weeks. This suggests that food provisioning of tropical Roseate Tern chicks is sensitive to fluctuations in local oceanographic conditions that affect the availability of prey fish at a short temporal scale, and that Roseate Terns are suitable sentinel organisms to indicate local changes in environmental conditions.

AB  - One of the major challenges faced by pollinators worldwide is the reduction in their food supply, nectar, and pollen. Given the considerable seasonal variation in the abundance of both floral resources and flower-visiting insects, conservation initiatives aiming to help pollinators through floral resource supplementation could increase their impacts by targeting periods when the foraging conditions are most difficult. Direct assessment of foraging conditions, however, is extremely labour-intensive.
   Here, we compared eight practical measures expected to reflect the foraging difficulty for nectar in the environment. Five measures involved Apis mellifera - an indicator species for the flower-visitor guild due to its generalist, energetically optimal, and long-distance foraging habit. These included (i) visitation at feeders with a range of sucrose concentrations, (ii) guarding and (iii) fighting levels at hive entrances, (iv) rates of hive weight changes, and (v) foraging distances encoded in waggle dances. The other measures were (vi-viii) counts of flower-visiting insects in relation to the rate of nectar sugar secretion in three plant species attractive to flower-visiting insects.
   There was considerable, although not complete agreement among the eight measures. Eleven of 28 pairwise correlations were statistically significant. Guarding and fighting correlated with most (five) other measures. We conclude that seven of the eight measures could be potentially useful in gauging seasonal patterns in local foraging conditions, which could help guide targeted conservation initiatives. Assessment of guarding and fighting levels at A. mellifera hive entrances is recommended, as these correlated significantly with most other measures and are easy to obtain in practice.

AB  - In the game with nature, the synthetic Wald-Savage criterion is defined as the principle of optimality, which makes possible to evaluate the optimality of strategies from a synthetic (joint) point of view of wins and risks. The definition of the synthesized strategy is given, i.e. a strategy that is optimal by the Wald- Savage criterion and is not optimal by either the Wald criterion or the Savage criterion. Introduced into the property of synthesizing, which consists in the existence of a synthesized strategy. Scientific novelty consists in solving the formulated problem of synthesizing, which consists in finding the necessary and sufficient conditions for the Wald-Savage criterion to have no synthesizing properties. Sufficient conditions are also of practical importance in analyzing the problems of making optimal economic decisions, since the fulfillment of these conditions means that it does not make sense to use the Wald-Savage criterion to find synthesized strategies. Moreover, the verification of sufficient conditions does not require reference to the Wald Savage criterion itself, but is based only on the component criteria. However, the exploitation of the Wald-Savage criterion in the absence of its synthesis properties is not absolutely useless, since it reveals the dependence of the application of the Wald and Savage criteria on the determined payoff indicator. The application of the obtained results is illustrated on the solution of the problem of economic content on the optimal choice of the technological mode of production.

AB  - Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the most important staple foods in the world, however most improved rice varieties are susceptible to drought stress. A two-year study was conducted to explore the effects of various drought stresses and subsequent recovery on the accumulation and degradation of proline, total soluble sugar and starch in different rice varieties at vegetative stage. The results showed that relative water content in the leaves and sheaths of rice varieties significantly decreased under drought stresses, but not at the same rate. Under control and drought conditions, the water content in sheaths was higher than that in leaves. Interestingly, under severe drought stress in 2015, the leaf water content was higher than the sheath water content. The water distribution between leaves and sheaths might be a response of plants to protect leaf system from devastation by drought. Proline was highly accumulated under drought stress but rapidly decreased after re-watering. The drought tolerant variety DA8 expressed higher ability in accumulation of proline than susceptible varieties. In general, total soluble sugar and starch contents in leaves and sheaths of varieties decreased under drought stress conditions. Total soluble sugar and starch content of DA8 were less affected than other varieties under drought conditions. Our study indicated that metabolisms of total soluble sugar and starch in rice were affected by both environmental conditions and characteristics of varieties. Proline accumulation ability of varieties can be used as a useful indicator for drought tolerant potential in rice breeding for water-limited environments.

AB  - The Port of Brisbane disturbance of the sedimentary environment at the mouth of the Brisbane River was assessed at the inner and outer river and in two periods following disturbance: 2 weeks (March) and 8 months (November) after dredging. Sediments in the inner river were dominated by silt, while in the outer river sediment were sandier. Total and organic carbon (TC and Corg) and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) were higher in the inner river, which could be an indication of higher organic loads. Ammonia (NH4-N) and nitrate (NO3-N) sediment profiles indicated suboxic conditions and denitrification in the inner river, as well as oxic conditions and nitrification at the outer river. Total meiofauna abundance and taxa composition was similar in both, the inner and outer river locations. For some individual taxa however, the suboxic sedimentary conditions in the inner river were adverse. Copepods, polychaetes and sipunculids abundance were lower in the inner river, and negatively correlated with fine sediments and high organic loads, and positively correlated with oxic conditions. Furthermore, the port strategic dredging operations had negative effects on the meiofauna of both locations. The abundance of most of the taxa in both the inner and outer river locations during March was lower at sites inside the dredged navigational channel than at the sites outside the channel. The meiofauna rapidly re-colonise the disturbed sediments as by November the abundances inside the channel considerably increased. The composition of the meiofaunal and nematode assemblage from different sites and months showed significant differences. The nematode assemblage at the mouth of the Brisbane River dominated by Sabatieria and Metalinhomoeus was characteristic of disturbed sediments.

AB  - A generalized inverse is presented for the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, an initial condition and data from synthetic but realistic solitary internal waves. The synthetic data are statistically consistent with hypothesized levels of error in the KdV equation, initial condition and observing system. The observing system consists of point-wise measurements of the pycnocline displacement, either at fixed locations or from a ship drifting in the soliton current. These synthetic inversions are designed using the environmental conditions and disturbances observed by Pinkel [J. Phys. Oceanogr. 30 (2000) 2906]. The inverse solution is found by minimizing a quadratic cost functional, which yields a weighted least-squares best-fit to the KdV equation, the initial condition and the data. The weight for each squared residual is derived from its hypothesized covariance.
   The minimal value of the least-squares estimator (or cost function) is the test statistic for the error hypotheses and is shown here to be a reliable indicator of grossly incorrect hypotheses. In particular, it will be shown that even with just a single ship survey, the method does lead to decisive tests of hypotheses concerning the level of error in the model. Also, neglect of ship drift is found to be less deleterious to the inversion than is neglect of error in the KdV dynamics.
   The inverse is calculated by the iterated, direct representer algorithm [Ocean Model. 3 (2001) 137], which is readily extended to include parameter estimation. Significant skill is found for estimating the linear phase speed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - One of the most critical problems in human efforts to combat consequences of pollution is the proper identification of the initial phases of ecosystem disturbance. Investigation of hydrographic conditions and medusan species composition in the Northern Adriatic region from 1992 to 1997 showed persistence of hypoxic conditions and low numbers of meroplanktonic hydromedusae. The changes observed in the hydromedusan fauna demonstrate one aspect of the long-term consequences of oxygen deficiencies in marine ecosystems: decreased biodiversity. We suggest that the species composition of meroplanktonic hydromedusae may be a useful indicator of the early phase of such changes.

AB  - Decomposition is degradation process of a corpse into basic respective constituents macroscopically and microscopically by action of microorganisms, arthropods and scavengers. Post mortem changes could be separated into early post mortem changes (i. e. algor mortis, rigor mortis and livor mortis) and putrefaction stages of corpse. These changes function as suitable indicators for determination of post mortem interval (PMI). In this paper, different stages of post mortem changes, possible variations such as mummification and formation of adipocere and special circumstances such as burial condition is discussed. This article also refers to several arguments in the different texture of adipocere and the influence of different types of fabric in affecting the post mortem changes and formation of adipocere. This is largely due to the property of permeability and resistance of material against degradation process. Undeniably, decomposition process involves numerous potential variables including burial condition, presence of clothing, potential formation of adipocere and mummification. Hence, studies in forensic taphonomy combined with real case scenario are crucial in understanding the nature of decomposition and estimation of PMI with higher accuracy.

AB  - Individual correlations between radial increments of trees and meteorological environmental factors were investigated in 28-year-old clone cultures of Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) growing at an experimental site of Forestry Institute, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, in the Sredneobskiy pine forest. Significant genotypic differences were revealed between the clones in the correlation coefficients of the indices of annual increments and the indices of increments of early and late wood with indicators of heat and moisture availability for trees in 1986-2007. Autocorrelation established a significant genetic differentiation of clones from one to three orders of magnitude.

AB  - Aquaculture production is continuously growing worldwide, and marine fish farming in Brazil is still in its infancy. Intensive farming conditions may cause physiological stress to the cultured organism, which can be evaluated by citogenotoxic biomarkers. The aim of this study was to assess the genotoxic effect of the rearing conditions in red blood cells of juvenile cobia Rachycentron canadum by using comet assay and micronucleus and other nuclear abnormalities assay. Juvenile cobia were reared for 13 weeks in indoor tank with open water circulation and in near shore cage. The comet assay and the nuclear abnormalities assay detected higher DNA damage and higher nuclear abnormalities frequency in erythrocytes of fish reared in the indoor tank. Results showed that two methods are complementary. Additionally, cobia were injected with (beta-naphthoflavone (BNF) at concentrations of 2mgkg(-1) and 10mgkg(-1) in laboratory controlled conditions, and maintained for 7 days in separate tanks to better understand the response mechanisms of this species to a toxic substance. The comet assay did not detect any significant differences between BNF injected and control fish, whereas nuclear abnormalities assay showed significant differences between BNF injected and the control groups. The damages identified by the comet assay are repairable breaks in the DNA strands, whereas nuclear abnormalities may be permanent. Possibly the period of maintenance after injection was enough to clean BNF from the oiganisms and to repair the breaks in the DNA strands. As cobia seems to respond very well to genotoxic elements, comet assay and nuclear abnormalities assay would be useful tools to monitor farming conditions.

AB  - The paper presents major tendencies in the distribution of potassium, uranium, thorium, and Th/U ratio throughout the facies profiles of the main Mesozoic sedimentation basins of the West Siberian plate. The potassium and thorium behavior is determined by the number and position of source areas and the degree of their tectonic activity. The uranium distribution is controlled by the accumulation level and the type of organic matter as well as by redox potential. Under conditions of primary sedimentation scattering of uranium, the Th/U ratio is not statistically significant indicator of sedimentation settings.

AB  - Targeting assistance to the poor is a central problem in development. We study the problem of designing a proxy means test when the implementing agent is corruptible. Conditioning on more poverty indicators may worsen targeting in this environment because of a novel tradeoff between statistical accuracy and enforceability. We then test necessary conditions for this tradeoff using data on Below Poverty Line card allocation in India. Less eligible households pay larger bribes and are less likely to obtain cards, but widespread rule violations yield a de facto allocation much less progressive than the de jure one. Enforceability appears to matter. (JEL D12, I32, I38, O12, O15)

AB  - Background: The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has had major consequences in the workplace, both in terms of the number of cases among the working population and the enormous changes made to cope with it. The objective of this study is to describe the impact of COVID-19 on the working conditions and health of wage-earners in Spain.
   Methods: Cross-sectional study carried out between the end of April and the end of May 2020 among the wage-earning population. Sample included n = 20,328 participants obtained through an online survey.
   Results: A situation of high-strain was reported by 44.3% of workers, 42.6% were concerned about possible job loss, 75.6% about finding a new job if they lost the present one, 69.7% were worried about salary reduction, 68% about becoming infected at work and 72.3% of being a transmitter of the virus. Among those who regularly went to work, 13.1% did so with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and 71.2% stated that they had done so without adequate protection measures. 36.7% of workers believe that their health worsened, 41.6% had severe trouble sleeping during the last month, 55.1% were at risk of poor mental health and consumption more than doubled of tranquilisers and opioid analgesics, compared to the pre-pandemic situation.
   Conclusion: The impact of COVID-19 on the wage-earning population has been enormous, with high exposures to harmful working conditions and very poor health indicators, which, compared to the pre-pandemic situation, means significant deterioration. Important inequalities are observed according to class, gender, age and wage.

AB  - While much progress has been made in the last two decades in the treatment and the management of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)-both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD)-as of today these conditions are still diagnosed only after they have become symptomatic. This is a major drawback since by then the inflammatory process has often already caused considerable damage and the disease might have become partially or totally unresponsive to medical therapy. Late diagnosis in IBD is due to the lack of accurate, non-invasive indicators that would allow disease identification during the pre-clinical stage-as it is often done in many other medical conditions. Here, we will discuss what is known about the biologic onset and pre-clinical CD with an emphasis on studies conducted in patients' first degree relatives. We will then review the possible strategies to diagnose IBD very early in time including screening, available disease markers and imaging, and the possible clinical implications of treating these conditions at or close to their biologic onset. Later, we will review the potential impact of conducting translational research in IBD during the pre-clinical stage, especially focusing on the role of the microbiome in disease etiology and pathogenesis. Finally, we will highlight possible future developments in the field and how they can impact IBD management and our scientific knowledge of these conditions.

AB  - An experimental study of the effects of hydrogen and methane proportions, Compression Ratio (CR) and equivalence ratio (empty set) on the Knock Occurrence Crank Angle (KOCA), the Combustion Duration (Delta theta(CD)) and the compression Polytropic coefficient (n) is carried out in this paper. These parameters were estimated through an alternative method that uses the average engine indicator diagram and the first derivative concept. The tests were conducted in a 2 kW Cooperative Fuel Research Engine (CFR) wherein the effect of inlet pressure on KOCA was also studied. To evaluate these effects, a factorial design of experiment and an one-factor Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) were conducted. According to the statistical analysis the evaluated engine operating conditions significantly influence the combustion parameters; however, the analysis revealed that the inlet pressure does not influence KOCA. Moreover, validated empirical correlations to estimate KOCA, Delta theta(CD) and Critical Compression Ratio (CCR) as a function of engine operating conditions were proposed. It was demonstrated that actual Mass Fraction Burned (MFB) curves can be fitted with a = 2.8 and m = 2.4 which are the so-called efficiency and form factors of the Wiebe function, respectively. These values for hydrogen and methane mixtures are different from the values widely used for conventional fuels, i.e. a = 5.0 and m = 2.0. In the present study, the compression polytropic coefficients as a function of engine operating conditions were reported and were found to be ranging from 1.21 to 1.25.

AB  - The conditions and characteristics of ignition of bituminous and brown coal widely used in thermal power engineering as the main fuel have been studied experimentally. The studies were carried out under the heating of fine coal particles in the muffle furnace. Such conditions are similar to those of coal dust ignition in muffle burners used in the implementation of advanced technology of oil-free start-up of coal-fired boilers. This technology is characterized by positive economic and environmental indicators in comparison with the widespread technology of coal-fired boilers start-up by liquid fuel combustion. Processes of ignition were studied in a wide range of temperature variation (400-1000 degrees C) for several grades of coal with various combustion heats and volatile matter content and different particle sizes: 40, 140, 250 mu m. Minimum air temperatures necessary for ignition of fine particles of coal, as well as dependences of the main characteristic of the process, i.e. ignition delay time, on ambient temperature have been determined. The ambient temperature required to ignite coal particles with the sizes of about 100 mu m is 500 degrees C for coals with relatively high volatile content (more than 30%) and 600 degrees C for coals with low volatile content (less than 30%). Approximation expressions are given for the obtained dependences. The results of the experiments serve as a basis for predicting the conditions and characteristics of coal dust ignition instead of liquid fuel and for justifying the size of the muffle burners for the development works and for optimization of their operation modes in the conditions of coal-fired boiler start-up.

AB  - Experiments have been performed to investigate the effects of primary chamber preheating temperature and batch size of the waste feed on the combustion of medical waste in a two chamber controlled air incinerator of 50 kg/h nominal capacity. The primary purpose is to determine qualitatively the functional relationships between the key incinerator performance indicators and the above two parameters so that optimum preheating conditions of a pilot incinerator, which has been in trial use at a hospital, may be defined. Three batch sizes were used, namely: 5, 7.5 and 10 kg, with the primary chamber preheating temperature varied from 500 to 800 degrees C at 100 degrees C intervals for each batch. The secondary chamber temperature control was set at 900 degrees C. The results showed that increasing the waste charging temperature and the weight of charge tend to accelerate the rate of volatile gas release, causing a "bottleneck effect" in the secondary chamber and, hence, a negative effect on the overall performance of the incinerator, as reflected in the residual unburned CO in the gases leaving the chamber. Higher charging rates could have been achieved by increasing the combustion air supplied to the chambers. Using CO measurement as a criterion for good combustion makes it possible to determine the optimum incinerator temperature control settings and operating conditions, as well as to assure continuous, efficient, environmentally satisfactory operation. The optimum operating condition for the range of experiments tested appears to be a batch size of 5 kg and a primary chamber preheating temperature in the vicinity of 700 degrees C.

AB  - Schemes for on-farm welfare assessment in sheep and goats are not yet available. Factors responsible for this lack of availability are discussed in the first part of this review. Requisites for reliable methods of welfare assessment to be used in sheep and goat farms are discussed, taking into account the peculiarities of the small ruminant production systems in terms of flock management and farm location. Some housing parameters related to structures, design and micro-environment are reviewed and could be included in schemes of welfare assessment on farm. Human-animal interaction, health status of the animals in terms of body condition scoring, skin and hair conditions, lameness and injuries, and management practices in relation to cleanliness, animal handling and moving, milking procedures and abnormal behaviours, are proposed as potential animal-based indicators. When available, validity, reliability and feasibility of the proposed parameters are discussed. The voluntary adhesion to welfare standards in Sardinia and the application of a scientifically validated protocol in Basilicata are reported as examples of practical experiences.

AB  - Male Betta splendens are known to be highly territorial and aggressive towards conspecifics. The influence of two metal pollutants, mercuric chloride (HgCl2) and sodium azide (NaN3) on specific aggressive behaviours of the male Betta species was investigated. The aim was to determine if aggressive behaviour can be used as a metal pollution bio-indicator. For this purpose, two males were placed in an aquarium (60 x 25 x 25 cm) that was divided into two equal compartments by a clear, perforated Plexiglas wall. The aquarium was filled with untreated water as control, and with polluted water under experimental conditions. After 24 h, one male (intruder) was placed in the other male's (resident) half of the aquarium. The behaviour of both males, particularly, air gulping rate, latency to first bite and to first opercular expansion, were recorded. The results indicate that the males under treatment conditions were less aggressive than those under control conditions. Thus, the male Betta splendens aggressive behaviour can be potentially used as a biological indicator of pollutants in freshwater.

AB  - Based on observation data the spatial variability and long-term trends of snow depth, snow water equivalent and number of days with snow coverage >= 50% for Northern Eurasia are estimated. The significance of continental snow cover variability over Northern Eurasia is illustrated by comparison with snow cover variability of the northern part of North America (Canada). The fundamental scientific problem of our investigations is revealing spatial and temporal changes of snow cover under the present climate conditions. The snow cover depends on a climate on the one hand and appreciably defines a hydrological regime on the other hand and, thus, the snow cover is a good indicator of changes in the condition of an environment. In this case the condition of the snow cover of the Northern hemisphere on an example of Northern Eurasia within the boundaries of the NIS and the northern part of North America within the boundaries of Canada is investigated. The novelty of the work, in particular, consists in the attraction to the analysis of a lot of long-term data on the snow cover of two continents. As a result the general regularity of spatial heterogeneity and the long-term variability of snow stocks were revealed.

AB  - The environmental status of the marine environment in the NE Adriatic Sea was assessed, using as a bioindicator species the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis Lamarck, 1819. Samples were collected seasonally from mariculture sites and from major Istrian ports between the years 2010 and 2013. The condition indices of mussels ranged from 13.3 to 20.9% at mariculture sites and from 14.3 to 23.3% at port locations. The seasonally delta C-13(DIC) values of seawater varied between -10.9 to 0.7%o. Pollution by sewage sludge (based on delta N-15 values) was confirmed only in two ports. Tissue concentrations of Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Se, Cd, and Pb were significantly higher in the tissue of the mussels collected from the ports (polluted sites). Arsenobetaine was the major As compound present in the samples and there was no significant difference in the levels of total As in mussel tissues from mariculture and port sites.

AB  - Numerous headshields of ephippial Chydorus piger (currently called Paralona pigra) females were found from the Holocene sediments of Aitajarvi Lake, northern Finnish Lapland (69 degrees 08' N, 27 degrees 14' E). Headshields of ephippial females of the genus Chydorus s.l. can be easily identified since their posterior margin is elongated and pointed. According to analysis of fossil cladoceran remains, Chydorus piger lived in the lake throughout the Holocene but was never very common (less than 10% of preserved cladoceran remains). Headshields of ephippial females were found in most samples and they comprised ca 10-30% of all Chydorus piger headshields. No similar phenomenon was met in Chydorus cf. sphaericus which is common up to the most severe arctic conditions. Aitajarvi is situated north of the modern distribution area of Chydorus piger. I suggest that this species reacted to the stress of harsh climatic conditions outside of its distribution area by being gamogenetic during most of the ice-free period. The ephippial headshields could be valuable indicators of severe climatic conditions in pre-Holocene sedimentary environments.

AB  - A folded layer of iron ore from a Brazilian mine was taken as a structural domain to investigate the degree of interdependence of mineral preferred orientation, magnetic properties and varying strain conditions. Hematite (alpha-Fe2O3, rhombohedral) pole figures measured by means of neutron diffraction were recalculated by reducing the orientation distribution function (ODF) into a set of texture components. The degree of preferred orientation increases considerably from the limbs towards the core of the fold. Corresponding changes of magnetic susceptibility, its anisotropy and its hysteresis parameters (e.g. saturation magnetisation, saturation remanence, coercivity) indicate larger grains in the fold's nucleus due to varying deformational and texture modifying processes.

AB  - The sound transmission loss of a stiffened window was investigated using a coupled finite element and boundary element method. This approach allowed the window to have arbitrary elastic boundary conditions and the stiffeners to be located at arbitrary positions inside the window. The in-plane deformation of the window was also taken into account. The natural frequencies predicted by the present approach showed good agreement with earlier published results. The prediction method was subsequently applied to parametric studies examining the effects of stiffeners on the sound transmission loss of a window. The results showed that the stiffeners (or their locations) notably influenced the window's sound transmission loss values, thereby demonstrating the possibility of using stiffeners to improve the sound insulation of a practical window. Practical applications: This study provides an approach that can be used to predict the sound insulation of a window with arbitrary elastic boundary conditions and with any-shape stiffeners lying anywhere inside the window. This approach can also be used to guide the design of windows (or other plate-like building structures) with better sound insulation.

AB  - This research was performed for a period of three years to determine the effect of natural seed ageing on different physiological and biochemical changes in three extensively cultivated onion cultivars in Northern India. Seed storage studies showed that germination percent, seed viability and other seed quality parameters decreased significantly with increasing storage time. The onion seed can be stored for a maximum period of one year under ambient conditions to maintain required germination percentage (>70%). Overall, Hisar Onion-4 stored better when compared to Hisar Onion-3 and Hisar-2. As the ageing progressed the seed antioxidants, namely superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), dehydrogenase (DHA) and peroxidase (POD) decreased significantly (p < 0.05) in all cultivars whereas, the electrical conductivity (EC) of seed leachates increased significantly. Under the field conditions, seedling establishment percent (SE) onion seed was positively correlated (R-2 = 0.98; p < 0.05) with germination percent (GP). Overall, more than one year period of seed storage was associated with poor germination and seedling establishment potential in onion.

AB  - Protein stability in detergent or membrane-like environments is the bottleneck for structural studies on integral membrane proteins (IMP). Irrespective of the method to study the structure of an IMP, detergent solubilization from the membrane is usually the first step in the workflow. Here, we establish a simple, high-throughput screening method to identify optimal detergent conditions for membrane protein stabilization. We apply differential scanning fluorimetry in combination with scattering upon thermal denaturation to study the unfolding of integral membrane proteins. Nine different prokaryotic and eukaryotic membrane proteins were used as test cases to benchmark our detergent screening method. Our results show that it is possible to measure the stability and solubility of IMPs by diluting them from their initial solubilization condition into different detergents. We were able to identify groups of detergents with characteristic stabilization and destabilization effects for selected targets. We further show that fos-choline and PEG family detergents may lead to membrane protein destabilization and unfolding. Finally, we determined thenmodynamic parameters that are important indicators of IMP stability. The described protocol allows the identification of conditions that are suitable for downstream handling of membrane proteins during purification.

AB  - Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), with high unsaturation degree (oleic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid), is prone to oxidation during production and storage even with the presence of abundant antioxidants (e.g., phenolic compounds, alpha-tocopherol, and chlorophyll). The level of oxidation degradation is greatly affected by the EVOO chemical composition (free fatty acids, saturated and unsaturated fat ratio, total phenol content, etc.) and storage conditions (packaging material, oxygen, temperature, and light). With the increasing demand on qualitative acceptability and food safety of an EVOO product, consumers rely heavily on "shelf life" as a good indicator. Hence, it is critical for olive oil producers to provide accurate and practical information on shelf-life prediction. This review analyzes ten shelf-life prediction models that used various parameters and approaches for model establishment. Due to the complexity of chemical interactions between oil phase and environment under real-time storage and rapid accelerated testing conditions, further investigation is needed to scrutinize and minimize the discrepancies between real-time shelf life and predicted shelf life of EVOO products.

AB  - The grinding wheel active surface (GWAS) condition assessment after the grinding processes is one of the crucial elements of diagnostics of abrasive tools used in modern production industry. At present there exist a number of measurement methods which facilitate such evaluation (e.g. stylus, optical, pneumatic). These may include also imaging methods using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This paper presents and discusses a proposal for obtaining additional information concerning the GWAS condition based on the acquired, properly processed, and computer-analyzed SEM micrographs. In the experimental investigations SEM micrographs of the selected GWAS areas with abraded vertexes and microsmearings of the abrasive grains active vertexes, macrosmearings of grains and intergranular spaces, as well as intergranular spaces filled with sulfur introduced during the impregnation process were acquired. For acquisition the scanning electron microscope JSM-5500LV by JEOL Ltd. (Japan) was used. Image analysis of selected GWAS areas was carried out by specialized research environment Image-Pro(A (R)) Plus 5.1. It was concluded that the applied techniques were highly useful and could complement the typically used ones, especially in complex tests.

AB  - In this study, the general condition, swimming capacities, and tissue metabolic capacities and metal concentrations in wild yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were examined from a range of metal-contaminated lakes near Sudbury, Ontario. Fish exposed to elevated environmental cadmium and copper concentrations showed higher liver concentrations of these metals and lower condition indices. Because growth rate appeared lower in the most metal-contaminated fish, the high tissue activities of nucleoside diphosphate kinase, an indicator of biosynthesis, in these fish indicated an increased rate of protein turnover and suggested a bioenergetic cost of metal exposure. Yellow perch from the most metal-contaminated lakes exhibited lower aerobic capacities, as indicated by citrate synthase and P-hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase activities, two mitochondrial enzymes involved in aerobic adenosine triphosphate production, and by critical swimming speed. There was no evidence from our data that environmental metal exposure affected anaerobic capacities of tissues as measured by lactate dehydrogenase activities or anaerobic fast-start swimming performance. Overall, these data show that metal exposure leads to measurable effects on metabolic capacities in wild yellow perch.

AB  - In view of the importance of female reproductive traits as a key profit indicator in beef-cattle production systems, the objective of the present study was to explore the relationships between female sexual precocity and potential predictive traits of easy and early measurement, related to the productive and reproductive efficiency. Heifers born in 2011 and 2012 (n = 132) from five genetic groups (Angus, Hereford, Angus-Hereford, Hereford-Angus and Argentine Creole) in 2 years (Trial 1 and Trial 2) under grazing conditions were evaluated. After weaning, the presence of corpus luteum, liveweight, body condition score, hip height, rump fat thickness and rib fat thickness were recorded every 28 days, and Longissimus muscle area at 15 months of age. Also, to evaluate the relationships between age at puberty and the subsequent production efficiency, the annual records of 895 cows (217 Angus, 253 Hereford, 125 Creole, 116 Angus-Hereford and 184 Hereford-Angus) born between 1986 and 2009 were studied to estimate the average annual productivity of cows, and its components of (Co)variance, heritability and breeding values. Nutritional conditions immediately after weaning were determinants in reaching puberty. The univariate animal model for average annual productivity showed a heritability of 0.14 +/- 0.05. Regression multiple and covariance analyses revealed that the rib fat thickness at 450 days of age was a good predictor of age at puberty, but lose some relevance as early selection criterion. Finally, it is important for future studies to analyse in more detail the existence of critical thresholds of fat deposition for the onset of reproductive activity.

AB  - The GMZ bentonite/additive mixtures have been proposed as the buffer/backfill media for the high-level radioactive waste geological disposal in China. In this study, two types of mixtures were prepared by mixing variable amounts of crushed granite powder or quartz sand (a range of 10% to 50% by dry mass of aggregate addition) with pure GMZ bentonite. To investigate the volumetric deformation characteristics of the bentonite/additive mixtures under coupled hydro-mechanical conditions, sequential oedometer tests comprising four phases were carried out, including preliminary compression, swelling under constant vertical stress, re-compression, and unloading-rebounding. Experimental results indicate that the volumetric deformation characteristics of the mixture largely depend on the initial condition, additive content and type. The evolutions of compression index and swelling index are governed by the degree of saturation and the state of soil matrix during different loading phases. During the compression phase, the soil compressibility relates to the formation of additive skeletal structure, while the rebound behavior during the unloading phase is determined by the competing mechanical and physico-chemical effects. The correlation between swelling index and bentonite dry density is not unique and dependent on the nature of the additive. The impact of additive properties on the volumetric behavior is further confirmed through tracking swelling indicators including final swelling strain and swelling pressure. This study provides an improved fundamental understanding of the mechanical behavior of GMZ bentonite/additive mixture under coupled conditions and optimizes their engineering applications for nuclear waste disposal.

AB  - Continuous condition monitoring and inspection of traffic signs are essential to ensure that safety and performance criteria are met. The use of 3D point cloud modeling by the construction industry has been significantly increased in recent years especially for recording the as-is conditions of facilities. The high precision and dense 3D point clouds generated by photogrammetry can facilitate the process of asset condition assessment. This paper presents an automated computer-vision based method that detects, classifies, and localizes traffic signs via street-level image-based 3D point cloud models. The proposed pipeline integrates 3D object detection algorithm. An improved Structure-from-Motion (SfM) procedure is developed to create a 3D point cloud of roadway assets from the street level imagery. In order to assist with accurate 3D recognition and localization by color and texture features extraction, an automated process of point cloud cleaning and noise removal is proposed. Using camera pose information from SfM, the points within the bounding box of detected traffic signs are then projected into the cleaned point cloud by using the triangulation method (linear and non-linear) and the 3D points corresponding to the traffic sign in question are labeled and visualized in 3D. The proposed framework is validated using real-life data, which represent the most common types of traffic signs. The robustness of the proposed pipeline is evaluated by analyzing the accuracy in detection of traffic signs as well as the accuracy in localization in 3D point cloud model. The results promise to better and more accurate visualize the location of the traffic signs with respect to other roadway assets in 3D environment. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - As the northern fringe of the Asian summer monsoon region, north-central China (hereafter NCC) is highly sensitive to climate change. It is important to understand drought variability and the associated mechanisms in this region since precipitation changes have direct impacts on human society in this semiarid-arid area. In this study, a new tree ring-width based drought reconstruction (AD 1804-2010) was established in the Songmingyan Nature Reserve, which lies in NCC. This reconstruction illustrates the severe drought periods occurring in the 1860s, 1928-1932 and 1991-2000, with recurring drought intervals being about 60 years. The first principal component of the five chronologies from NCC shows strongly coherent drought variability with the other single-site records and can thus be used as an indicator of regional moisture variations. Combining the Monsoon Asia Drought Atlas (hereafter MADA) dataset and the dry-wet index (hereafter DWI) dataset from eastern China, the spatial distribution of moisture variability for three selected drought events is mapped. It is found that northern China and Mongolia experienced dry conditions during the three severe drought periods, whereas wet conditions prevailed in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (hereafter PDO) might have been one of the possible causes responsible for multi-decadal drought variability over NCC, with the PDO warm phases being associated with drought conditions and the cold phases corresponding to wet conditions over NCC.

AB  - The Svalbard-breeding population of pink-footed geese Anser brachyrhynchus has increased during the last decades and is giving rise to agricultural conflicts along their migration route, as well as causing grazing impacts on tundra vegetation. An adaptive flyway management plan has been implemented, which will be based on predictive population models including environmental variables expected to affect goose population development, such as weather conditions on the breeding grounds. A local study in Svalbard showed that snow cover prior to egg laying is a crucial factor for the reproductive output of pink-footed geese, and MODIS satellite images provided a useful estimator of snow cover. In this study, we up-scaled the analysis to the population level by examining various measures of snow conditions and compared them with the overall breeding success of the population as indexed by the proportion of juveniles in the autumn population. As explanatory variables, we explored MODIS images, satellite-based radar measures of onset of snow melt, winter NAO index, and the May temperature sum and May thaw days. To test for the presence of density dependence, we included the number of adults in the population. For 2000-2011, MODIS-derived snow cover (available since 2000) was the strongest indicator of breeding conditions. For 1981-2011, winter NAO and May thaw days had equal weight. Interestingly, there appears to have been a phase shift from density-dependent to density-independent reproduction, which is consistent with a hypothesis of released breeding potential due to the recent advancement of spring in Svalbard.

AB  - Plants often react to various kinds of stress by changes in their organic composition as the result of defense or stress-induced metabolism. This study investigated the use of lichens as stress monitors by examining changes in their chemistry under various environmental conditions. A micro-scale acetone extraction of dried and ground lichen sample was necessary to observe significant compositional differences in lichen extractives compared to no extraction. The extract was dissolved in solvent and treated with 10% methanolic TMAH. The sample was pyrolyzed and the products identified by GC/MS. A GG-FID was used for quantitative analysis. The lichens Cladina mitis and Cladina rangiferina exposed to laboratory conditions (3 days) of visible and/or UV light were examined. Small differences in total unsaturated fatty acid, and atranorin and rangiformic acid composition were observed according to conditions. Usnea dasypoga samples were collected from sites of various ground-level ozone conditions in New Brunswick, Canada. Reduction in unique lichen acid, salazinic acid, was detected in sites having higher cumulative ozone exposure. Alectoria sarmentosa was collected from sites of varying sulfur dioxide exposure (from oil refinery) in Newfoundland, Canada. In general, lichen acids decreased with increased levels of stress exposure except for Usnea dasypoga which showed increased concentrations of salazinic acid at the highest level of ozone measured indicating a defensive biochemical response. Unsaturated fatty acid markers decreased in lichens collected close to the refinery (SO,) and increased for those exposed to higher levels of ozone. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The study attempted to develop an instrument to measure the quality of the physical structure of the public Mental Hospitals, in Greece.
   The instrument "The Conditions of Nursing: Dimensions of Inpatient Treatment" Schedule (CONDIT) is original, culturally responsive to local conditions and consists of two parts: the Department, and ward sections. The scale items record qualitative judgements on the general physical condition of the setting and its various components by the rater. The schedule was tested for its reliability and validity in 110 Departments (90% of the total), and a sample of 121 wards of the nine public Mental Hospitals. Inter-rater reliability study has shown statistically significant K coefficient of agreement (0.82). Internal consistency estimated by Cronbach's a and concurrent vadility of the CONDIT schedule were found to be very satisfactory. The application of the CONDIT schedule revealed a significant variability in levels of quality of physical structure among the public Mental Hospitals. The overall profile of the physical environment of the public psychiatric institutions was found to meet the criteria rated as "satisfactory".

AB  - Sexually selected ornaments often function as condition-dependent signals of quality (or 'indicators'). When ornamentation is costly only high-quality individuals can afford to produce the most elaborate signals. The plumage ornamentation of male red-billed queleas, Quelea quelea, is an ideal candidate for an indicator because it is continuously variable, conspicuous, sexually dimorphic, is displayed only during breeding and is partially based, on carotenoid pigmentation. However, I show here that quelea plumage is not an indicator be,cause first, plumage colour is not correlated with physical condition or age; second, plumage colour is a genitically determined phenotype that is unresponsive to environmental variation; third, different plumage characters have bimodal distributions; fourth, plumage characters vary indepen- dently of one another; and finally plumage colour is not correlated with reproductive success. To my knowledge, this is the first demonstration of non-condition dependence in colourful and sexually dimorphic breeding ornamentation. Instead, plumage variation may function as a sexually selected signal of individual identity among territorial males that nest in huge, densely packed and highly synchronized colonies.

AB  - Our laboratory studies show that brown lemmings (Lemmus sibiricus) have the capacity to store large amounts of fat (>40% of body mass) and that the amount of fat stored is directly related to food intake. Nevertheless, lemmings and other microtine rodents maintain relatively low fat deposits in the field (often less-than-or-equal-to 5% of body mass). Apparently, they have not evolved to allocate much energy to fat reserves under natural conditions. Fat content of microtine rodents generally differs little between sexes, but in the field it does differ between seasons. Fat deposits tend to increase during the nonbreeding season, which is generally a time with low availability of high-quality food. Thus, body fat is not clearly related to nutritional condition in the field, except that starved animals have low fat reserves at death (<3% of wet body mass). Our experimental results indicated that high body fat in the laboratory can be accounted for by higher digestibility of energy in laboratory diets and lower levels of activity in cages.

AB  - Lipid biomarker abundances and delta C-13 values were determined across the Permian-Triassic (P-Tr) boundary at Meishan of southern China. The delta C-13 values of n-alkanes showed large (similar to 9 parts per thousand) fluctuations, which suggest major episodic changes in oceanographic conditions during faunal mass extinctions. Enviromnent-related biomarker ratios, including pristane to phytane ratios (Pr/Ph), gammacerane to C-31 homohopane ratios (gamma/C31HP) and C-27 18 alpha(H)-22,29,30-trinorneohopane to C-27 17 alpha(H)22,29,30-trinorhopane ratios (Ts/Tm), vary extensively throughout the section, with values typically associated with anoxic conditions coinciding with maximum delta C-13 values. In particular, both faunal mass extinction horizons (beds 25 and 28) are characterised by biomarker ratios consistent with anoxic conditions and elevated n-alkane delta C-13 values. The records of environment-related biomarkers and n-alkane delta C-13 values clearly signify multiple environmental perturbations in association with faunal mass extinctions. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Laboratory studies conducted with surface water sediment from a methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE)-contaminated site in South Carolina demonstrated that, under methanogenic conditions, [U-C-14] MTBE was transformed to C-14 tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) with no measurable production of (CO2)-C-14. Production of TBA was not attributed to the activity of methanogenic microorganisms, however, because comparable transformation of [U-C-14] MTBE to C-14-TBA also was observed in heat-sterilized controls with dissolved H-2 concentrations > 5 nM. The results suggest that the transformation of MTBE to TBA may be an abiotic process that is driven by biologically produced H-2 under in situ conditions. In contrast, mineralization of [U-C-14] MTBE to (CO2)-C-14 was completely inhibited by heat sterilization and only observed in treatments characterized by dissolved H-2 concentrations < 2 nM. These results suggest that the pathway of MTBE transformation is influenced by in situ H-2 concentrations and that in situ H-2 concentrations may be an useful indicator of MTBE transformation pathways in ground water systems.

AB  - This work characterized the zooplankton and the environmental variables of the Canoas reservoir (Assare, Ceara, Brazil) through eight consecutive monthly collections during a period of intense drought. Zooplankton samples were collected by vertical plots of 50 gm plankton net at three longitudinally distributed points. Five species were found: Brachionus calicyflorus Pallas, 1938 (Brachionidae: Rotifera), Diaphanosoma spinulosum Herbst, 1967 (Sididae: Cladocera), Thermocyclops decipiens Kiefer, 1929 and T. inversus Kiefer, 1936 (Cyclopoida: Copepoda), and Notodiaptomus cearensis Wright, 1936 (Calanoida: Copepoda). Thermocyclops decipiens had the highest relative abundance, followed by N. cearensis and B. calicyflorus. The spatial and temporal variation of the zooplankton community can be explained by most of the environmental variables associated with N. cearensis and B. calicyflorus, while T. decipiens was not associated with any of them. The low species richness and dominance of T. decipiens and B. calicyflorus may be a reflection of the high trophic condition of the reservoir during severe drought, and N. cearensis is also associated with these more adverse conditions.

AB  - This paper develops a model that correlates the amount of surface deterioration to the remaining strength of rectangular Douglas-fir cross-arms used in a 115-kV transmission line. One challenge that utility companies face today is to develop effective strategies to replace cross-arms that are potentially detrimental to the transmission-line system. Inservice cross-arms are continuously exposed to the environment and experience wide ranging temperatures and moisture conditions. Furthermore, rainwater entrapment on surface and bolt holes causes rotting and decay of wood, resulting in gradual loss of strength. The evaluation of the remaining strength of inservice cross-arms is complicated further by a large variability associated with the wood microstructure, the decay process, defects, and environmental conditions. To understand the effects of surface decay on the strength of wood cross-arms, an image-processing technique is employed to accurately quantify the amount of deterioration and examine the effects of decay location. Full-scale bending tests are used to assess the remaining strength. Statistical models have shown that surface decay, depending on its location, has a direct linear relationship with the strength loss for wood cross-arms in bending.

AB  - The Fennoscandian Shield has been subjected to several glaciations over the past million years, the last of which (Weichselian Ice Age) ended only at about 10 Ka. Here we used boron isotopes and B contents to (a) establish the degree of water-rock interaction (WRI) and (b) clarify freezing processes within groundwaters from the Aspo site in Sweden and from various sites in Finland. The high delta(11) B values recorded by all groundwaters (up to 51.9parts per thousand) including diluted, boron-poor, inland groundwaters suggest selective uptake of B-10 into ice related to freezing processes under permafrost conditions. According to co-existing ice and residual brines in a Canadian frozen mine, this fractionation process, enhanced by Rayleigh fractionation, can generate a natural field of isotopic variation around 60parts per thousand and provides a new application of B isotope that makes possible to easily characterise groundwaters that underwent past permafrost conditions.

AB  - We studied the trophic conditions of a small, urban, lentic water-body, under the influence of domestic waste as a result of urbanization. This Pushan lake was found to be in beta mesotrophic state, according to the saprobic index system proposed by Dresscher and Mark (1976). The results of this saprobial system when compared with the nutrient levels, also indicated the trend towards progressive enrichment of nutrients. This system has been found to be convenient as a large number of samples can be analyzed in a comparatively short time and can be used by biologists without having to go for taxonomic identification of the species involved.

AB  - Long-term (1992-1995) monitoring data from a petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated aquifer were used to examine the hypothesis that concentrations of low molecular weight (LMW) aliphatic organic acids reflect terminal electron-accepting processes. During the period of study, concentrations of dissolved hydrogen (H-2) indicated that methanogenic, sulfate-reducing, and iron(III)-reducing conditions predominated at the site. However, there was no correlation between LMW organic acid concentrations and concentrations of dissolved H-2. These results indicate that organic acid concentrations are not a reliable indicator of local redox conditions at this site.

AB  - Based on the sedimentological and geochemical analysis of total organic carbon (TOC) and major and trace elements in the marine Upper Ordovician-Lower Silurian Wufeng-Longmaxi Formations in Yichang, Central Yangtze area, paleoredox conditions (indicated by U/Th, V/Cr, Ni/Co, TOC-TS-Fe diagram, and Mo-U covariations), paleoproductivity (indicated by Ba-bio, Ba/Al, P/Ti, Ni/Al, Cu/Al, and Zn/Al), terrestrial detrital influx (indicated by Ti and Al), paleoclimate (indicated by chemical index of alteration and Rb/Sr), and upwelling (indicated by Co x Mn) are revealed within the framework of sea-level changes. The influences of these factors on organic matter enrichment are also discussed. The results identify four third-order sequence boundaries in the Wufeng-Longmaxi Formations; each sequence can be divided into one transgressive systems tract (TST) and one regressive systems tract (RST) according to sea-level changes. The high-TOC interval mainly developed in TST1 (average 3.44%) and TST2 (average 3.68%). The analysis of geochemical indicators shows that during the TST1 depositional stage, the climate was dry and cold, the bottom water was in a stable anoxic condition accompanied by rising sea level, and the seawater had moderate-high paleoproductivity. In the RST1 stage, extensive sea-level fall occurred, and the water was anoxic, with decreased productivity and weakened organic matter accumulation. In the TST2 stage, the sea level rise rapidly, extensive anoxicity and high productivity of the water produced the most ideal environment for organic matter enrichment and the highest TOC. In the RST2 stage, sea level slowly fell, the water column gradually became a stable oxidized environment, productivity was low, the terrestrial detrital influx increased and tended to stabilize, and the climate gradually changed to warm and humid conditions, forming relatively organic-poor shale. The upwelling mainly developed during the period of TST1 to TST2, and ceased in the RST2. The correlation analysis between TOC and the above indicators and the Co x Mn versus Cd/Mo diagram show that TOC is chiefly controlled by paleoredox, paleoproductivity, climatic conditions, and terrestrial detrital influx, indicating that preservation conditions are the crucial factor. Sea-level change played a key role in preservation conditions. In the transgression stages, sea-level rise led to the enhancement of reducing water, which controlled the organic matter enrichment in shale.

AB  - Biotic resources are considered a key element of bio-economy. In the present study we focus on the forest supply industry, assessing environmental sustainability through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. We explored and evaluated forestry operations in order to support decision-makers in choosing the best operational modes for site-specific conditions. Main aims of the study are: 1) a LCA-based systematic comparative analysis of different operational modes and technological options associated with wood extraction considering site-specific conditions; 2) the quantification of impacts associated with transport of wood material.
   A case study on the alpine region of Italy (Intelvi Valley) is presented and discussed. Different forestry activities were investigated, comparing the traditional operational method with a more mechanized one (advanced mechanization). All operations were included within the system boundaries, from felling to transport to sawmill. Regarding the traditional operational method, different options were evaluated, considering that: 1) the extraction could be performed by cable-yard or winch; and 2) the delimbing phase could be performed before or after extraction phase. Each activity was modeled using primary data, assuring that real forest conditions are taken into account and assessed.
   In spite of the expectations associated with advanced mechanization, the hypothesis to choose traditional mechanization was preferable for Intelvi Valley conditions. Fuel consumption and related emissions proved to be the main source of impacts. Sensitivity analyses highlighted that advanced mechanization could be the best method to perform forestry operations, if used in proper conditions (i.e. at the top productivity rate) and that the choice of a short supply chain drastically reduces the impacts induced by long distance transportation.
   The choice of the best technological options should be based on a site-specific and context- related assessment. It is very important to give priority to the operational mode which minimizes the hours necessary to perform each operation. It was also found that the technological option should be chosen according to the geomorphology and topography and the site-specific characteristics of the area investigated, and no one option can be considered as the most suitable for all conditions.Furthermore, current impact assessment methods are still lacking in the evaluation of potential impact to biodiversity in the specific context were the extraction takes place. Further investigations related to the environmental profile of a product will be object of a second study that will concern the design of green furniture pieces, starting from certified wood as raw material.

AB  - Field investigations of silicone rubber (SiR) insulators provide useful information about their performance. The field performance of SiR insulators depends on many factors, including electrical stress, and environmental and service conditions experienced. This paper provides a condition assessment of the housing material of five different types of 20 kV field-aged SiR insulators from the same manufacturer with different operating years and states. The assessment was performed through mechanical, electrical, and material techniques. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the aging behavior of SiR insulators, in order to predict their lifetimes. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were utilized to quantify the degree of degradation. The mechanisms of the variations in mechanical properties for aged samples were also discussed. In a tensile test, the reduction of strain-to-break to 50% and in other tests the failure of insulators in salt fog chamber were used as the end of life criterion. Finally, the lifetime of the tested insulators was predicted based on the various aforementioned tests.

AB  - Lead (Pb) from spent gunshot and fishing sinkers is recognized as the main source of Pb poisoning among waterfowl. It is also suspected to directly pollute water and sediments, but no appropriate, comprehensive evaluation of this issue has so far been carried out. An experiment on Pb pellets in microcosms (n = 160) with two sediment types (mud and gravel), three water pH values (4, 7 and 9) and two wind levels (wind and windless simulation) was therefore run. Substantial differences in Pb transfer (measured with ICP-OES) between sediment types and pH levels of water were observed. Simulated wind conditions were a significant factor only for some variables and circumstances. The strongest Pb deposit to water and sediments occurred in mud microcosms with water of pH value of 4. Median pellet erosion during the experiment differed little between sediment types. The experiment revealed that Pb transfer from spent gunshot to the environment occurs only in specific environmental conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The survival, persistence, and dispersal of bacteria in soil raises serious water quality questions for rural areas of the world especially where podzol-type soils dominate. To determine survival characteristics of an environmentally derived multiple-antibiotic resistant E coli, it was added to laboratory containers containing sandy-loam podzol soils taken from two different locations ('Webb', pH 6.8-8.3 and 'Rich', pH 5.5-7.2). This was done in order to study the stability of the tracer bacterium under conditions designed to mimic those that might be encountered during subsequent field mini-plot studies. Sets of microcosms consisting of three replicates of each soil received 10(12) or 10(13) colony forming units per g of soil and were incubated at four temperatures (5, 10, 20, and 37-degrees-C) and two moisture levels (15% i.e. average field capacity and saturation) for 160 days. The microcosm data gave estimated maximum survical times for the 'Webb' soil of 23.3 months at 5-degrees-C under saturating moisture conditions and 20.7 months for the 'Rich' soil under the same conditions using exponential regression analysis of the data.

AB  - Drought and heat stress are major indicators of global climate change and yield-limiting factors in wheat. Moreover, simultaneous occurrence of both factors could increase the injuries and greater yield losses in wheat species. In this scenario, there is need to screen germplasm and develop breeding lines which may show better resistance under the targeted condition. A germplasm comprising of 17 advanced lines, 4 elite checks and 79 accessions was compared to determine their resistance under controlled osmotic (- 0.9 MPa) and heat stress (40 degrees C) on the basis of various seedling traits. Heat and drought resistance index showed significant positive relationship with root mass showing the importance of this trait for selection under stress condition. Germplasm accession such as NARC-11022 possessed the highest drought and heat resistance index while standard check such as FSD-08 had the highest drought resistance index. These accessions may be exploited in breeding cultivars for multiple stress condition. Some advanced lines such as SU-100, SU-159 showed promising results under both types of stress, and these lines may be recommended for stress-prone environment.

AB  - The incidence of adverse reactions in food is very low, however, some food products contain toxins formed naturally due to their handling, processing and storage conditions. 5-(Hydroxymethyl)-2-furfural (HMF) can be formed by hydrogenation of sugar substances in some of manufactured foodstuffs and honey under elevated temperatures and reduced pH conditions following Maillard reactions. In previous studies, it was found that HMF was responsible for harmful (mutagenic, genotoxic, cytotoxic and enzyme inhibitory) effects on human health. HMF occurs in a wide variety of food products like dried fruit, juice, caramel products, coffee, bakery, malt and vinegar. The formation of HMF is not only an indicator of food storage conditions and quality, but HMF could also be used as an indicator of the potential occurrence of contamination during heat-processing of some food products such as coffee, milk, honey and processed fruits. This review focuses on HMF formation and summarizes the adverse effects of HMF on human health.

AB  - Tropospheric ozone concentrations (O-3) are continuously increasing with harmful effects on vegetation. Ozone uptake triggers oxidative stress that may promote adverse changes in various plant physiological processes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between meteorological conditions and O-3 exposure in foliar injuries, gas exchanges and antioxidant enzyme activity in Psidium guajava Paluma. Saplings of Paluma were exposed in a site contaminated by O-3, Foliar injuries, gas exchanges, and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) were evaluated weekly. Results were analyzed by multivariate analysis. The O-3 exposure reduced carbon assimilation and induced the onset of foliar injuries. The enzymatic activities were more related to meteorological conditions than to O-3 exposure, indicating that these enzymes are not this species' first line of defense. However, our finding indicates that Paluma may be considered a response indicator, given its presentation of foliar injuries even at low O-3 concentrations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The assessment methodology for the sustainability of buildings is based on the analysis of environmental, social and economic performance. The main purpose of the paper is the presentation of energy-related conditions and envelope properties as well as methodology aspects. The first part of the paper presents the literature review on sustainability and zero-energy buildings. The second part is devoted to describe different energy indicators for the evaluation of primary energy requirements and energy characteristic. The last section describes the general methodology for characterization of energetic properties of the building envelope and gives examples from literature of the effect of applications in a building's envelope an aerogel based thermal insulation for higher thermal transmittance and a PCM for higher latent heat capacity with general description of results obtained by other authors. The crucial measure is the use of high thermal performance components for the building's envelopes combined with the heat storage potential. In the context of sustainability, energy related conditions constitute a new set of indicators for identifying the usefulness and the efficiency of new technologies.

AB  - The aim of this study is to establish pre-impact baseline conditions for an Arctic region where petroleum activities are projected to increase in the coming decades. We characterize the spatial distribution of living benthic foraminifera in the Tromsoflaket-Ingoydjupet region of the Barents Sea and relate this to sediment properties and their associated metal concentrations. Metal concentrations of the sediments did not exceed threshold levels of harmful environmental effects, indicating that the area exhibits pre-impact baseline conditions. Foraminiferal assemblages reflect the pristine environment. Epifaunal species dominate in Tromsoflaket, a high energy environment characterized by coarse grained sediments. Infaunal species dominate in Ingoydjupet, a low energy environment characterized by fine grained sediments. Metal concentrations were slightly elevated in the fine grained sediments from Ingoydjupet which suggest that these areas may in the future serve as trapping zones for contaminants associated with discharges from nearby petroleum sites.

AB  - Here we revisit whether the common mixed-valent Fe mineral, magnetite, is a viable reductant for the abiotic natural attenuation of perchloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE) in anoxic groundwater plumes. We measured PCE and TCE reduction by stoichiometric magnetite as a function of pH and Fe(ii) concentration. In the absence of added Fe(ii), stoichiometric magnetite does not reduce PCE and TCE over a three month period under anoxic conditions. When Fe(ii) is added to magnetite suspensions, PCE and TCE are reduced under Fe(ii) and pH conditions that appear to be controlled by the solubility of ferrous hydroxide, Fe(OH)(2)(s). Reduction rates are slow with only 1 to 30% carbon products (primarily acetylene) accumulating over several months. We conducted a similar set of experiments with Fe(OH)(2)(s) alone and found that, compared to in the presence of magnetite, Fe(OH)(2)(s) reduces PCE and TCE only at Fe(ii) concentrations that are too high (13 mM, 726 mg L-1) to be representative of natural aquifer conditions. Our results suggest that magnetite present in aquifer sediments alone is unlikely to reduce PCE and TCE sufficiently fast to contribute to natural attenuation of PCE and TCE. The lack of compelling evidence for PCE and TCE reduction by magnetite raises important questions regarding the current application of using magnetic susceptibility as a potential indicator for abiotic natural attenuation. Dynamic conditions and high Fe(ii) concentrations that favor active precipitation of minerals, such as Fe(OH)(2)(s) in the presence of magnetite (or other Fe minerals), however, may lead to PCE and TCE reduction that could help attenuate PCE and TCE plumes.

AB  - We investigated the applicability of Ellenberg's indicator values (EIVs) on coarse woody debris (CWD). Given that a small number of vascular plant species forms the pool of potential colonizers, we wanted to examine whether the properties of decaying logs and site characteristics can be predicted using EIVs. A comparison was made between the EIVs of the flora inhabiting mineral soil and plants colonizing 364 decaying logs of Picea abies and Fagus sylvatica in the Karkonosze Mts., southern Poland. We used correlation tests to assess the relationships between the mean and weighted EIVs and the decomposition stage of a decaying log, light conditions and moisture as well as the altitude at which the dead logs were lying. There were no significant differences in the mean EIVs between the species growing on mineral soil and CWD, except for the soil reaction, which was higher on the spruce logs. The plants colonizing decaying downed trees reflect the climatic conditions and altitude, i.e. elevation index, approximated heat load and vegetational gradient better than the edaphic conditions, i.e. the properties of dead wood such as its decomposition and moisture. We concluded that, in spite of the fact that in terms of biotopes fallen trees can be treated as synusia in forest communities, bioindication using the EIVs is not only possible but also predictable. Species that are present on CWD thus should be included in assessments of forest habitat conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Effective ecosystem-based management requires a comprehensive understanding of the functional links in the system. In many marine systems, forage species constitute a critical link between primary production and upper trophic level marine predators. As top predators, seabirds can be indicators of the forage species they consume and the ocean processes that influence these populations. We analyzed the diet and breeding success for the years 1994, 2003, 2005, and 2007-2012 of the Brandt's cormorant (Phalacrocorax penicillatus), a piscivorous diving seabird, breeding in central California, to evaluate the extent to which cormorant diet composition relates to prey availability, and how diet composition relates to breeding success and ocean conditions. Cormorant diet was primarily composed of young-of-the-year (YOY) northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), YOY rockfish (Sebastes spp.), and several species of small flatfish (order Pleuronectiformes). YOY rockfish consumption was positively related to their abundance as measured in a late spring pelagic midwater trawl survey. Northern anchovy appeared to be the most important prey as its consumption was positively related to cormorant breeding success. More northern anchovy were consumed in years where warm-water conditions prevailed in the fall season before cormorant breeding. Thus, warm ocean conditions in the fall appear to be an important contributing factor in producing a strong year-class of northern anchovy in central California and consequently a strong-year class of Brandt's cormorant on the Farallon Islands.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of serum total proteins and their electrophoretic fractions as well as white blood cells count in Cinisara dairy cows under two different management and environmental conditions. Twenty-five Cinisara dairy cows, from two dairy farms at two levels above the sea level, were selected. Ambient temperature and relative humidity were recorded by means of a data logger. The temperature-humidity index (THI) was also calculated as indicator of thermal comfort for animals. From each animal blood samples were collected every two days for eight days to assess WBC count, serum total proteins and electrophoresis. The obtained data were expressed as Mean +/- Standard Deviation (SD). Two-way repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied. The application of ANOVA showed significant differences between Group A and Group B in alpha 1-, alpha 2-, beta-, gamma-globulin and WBC concentrations (P<0.05). During the experimental period, alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-globulins concentration showed lower values in Group A respect Group B. Whereas, gamma-globulin and WBC concentrations showed higher values in Group A respect Group B. The results obtained in the present study showed that the serum protein electrophoretic patterns along with WBC count are significantly influenced by the different management and environmental conditions and this must be taken as a very important factor in determining the levels of some acute phase markers in dairy cows. Moreover they may be useful indicators of animal health and welfare and good predictors of risk in dairy cows.

AB  - Post-mining restoration of heathland habitats has met with mixed success. Failures are often ascribed to the complexity of replicating soil conditions: a scarcity of organic matter and microbial symbionts in stored overburden used for restoration is frequently implicated. Nonetheless, systematic investigation of the role of both interventions is lacking. Using a greenhouse trial and a large-scale field experiment within a commercial kaolinite mine site, we explored how the addition of ericoid mycorrhizal fungi (ErMF) and organic matter influenced the establishment of dwarf ericoid species that characterize NW European Atlantic lowland heaths. Neither intervention had any positive effect on ericoid establishment in field or greenhouse conditions. In the greenhouse experiment, organic matter (from commercial refuse) increased heather (Calluna vulgaris) cuttings mortality, although surviving plants showed enhanced shoot growth when ErMF were added. All field plots were dominated by combinations of grasses, gorse (Ulex europaeus), and bare ground. Establishment of ericaceous plants was remarkably low (<4%) after 3 years and Erica tetralix and C. vulgaris abundance in organic matter (which increased pH) or ErMF treatments was reduced compared to untreated control. Although our experiments suggest that research on soil manipulation treatments is required to elucidate the conditions necessary for heathland establishment, corroboration of our greenhouse trial results in field conditions highlights the value of the former in informing the latter. We identify low pH, high lignin (e.g. pine) litter as one potentially worthwhile soil amelioration treatment and suggest how the use of naturally colonized/preinoculated "nursemaid" plants could facilitate heathland restoration.

AB  - The emergent aquatic plant, Sagittaria cuneata, is an easily-identified and commonly-found species in the Great Plains region of North America and has the potential to be a bioindicator of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) because of its previously-identified leaf plasticity in response to nutrient conditions. To identify associations between leaf morphology and soil and water nutrients, we conducted: (1) a 10-week controlled experiment in which plants were grown in nutrient-enriched sediment, nutrient-enriched water, or unamended control trials, and (2) a field study where emergent leaves were collected from 15 streams of varying nutrient concentrations. Plants grown in experimentally enriched sediment were more productive than those grown in enriched water or control conditions: they produced more emergent leaves and tubers, had a larger final biomass and height, and developed emergent leaves that showed a consistent increase in size and unique change in shape over time. Emergent leaves collected from field plants also showed significant variability of leaf traits; however, this variability occurred at all scales of replication (leaf, plant, quadrat, and site), with linear mixed effects modelling indicating that random chance was likely driving this variability. Although sediment nutrients were crucial to successful growth of S. cuneata under controlled conditions, the high variability in leaf morphology under field conditions (likely due to large natural variability at the species, population, and individual scale) make leaf plasticity of S. cuneata unsuitable as a bioindicator. Our results emphasize the need to quantify within and among plant variation in leaf morphology (and to clarify sampling methods) for the many taxa of aquatic macrophytes that are phenotypically plastic and notoriously difficult to classify.

AB  - The Permian-Triassic Boundary interval was identified in an outcrop in central Saudi Arabia, within a 32 m-thick succession of mixed carbonate and siliciclastic sediments. This stratigraphic section was deposited in a coastal to shallow marine environment on the southern margin of the Tethys Ocean, an area that has not previously been the focus of rare earth element (REE) and redox-sensitive trace element studies. Geochemical data from this region may potentially inform ongoing discussions about redox conditions along the Tethys margin during the Permian-Triassic transition. To better understand redox conditions on the southern Tethyan margin, we analyzed a total of 33 samples from the PTB interval in the upper part of the Khuff Formation, for major and trace elements and REEs. The thorium-uranium ratio (Th/U), uranium (U) and vanadium (V) content, and cerium (Ce) anomaly all serve as potential redox indicators. Multivariate analysis (principal component analysis and linear regression) of the elemental composition of the samples suggests that these redox indicators are predominantly associated with the detrital fraction. Th/U ratios were generally >2, U and V concentrations do not show any significant authigenic enrichment, and Ce anomalies fluctuates around 1.0. Collectively, these results indicate that the distribution of redox indicators in this section is mainly controlled by the detrital composition, and that shallow marine waters at the time of deposition were oxic. Comparing our results with data from other Tethys sections reveals that redox conditions in shallow marine environments were heterogeneous in the aftermath of the Permian-Triassic extinction, and may reflect primarily local controls.

AB  - Impaired response inhibition plays a major role in many addictive behaviors. However, in studies using go/no-go tasks, findings regarding the presence of response inhibition deficits in nicotine-dependent individuals are mixed. This might be due to differences between studies on a number of task parameters. Here we aimed to identify task conditions under which go/no-go task performance deficits can be observed in smokers and to characterize the nature of such deficits. Sixty-one male students (30 smokers, 31 non-smokers) performed a go/no-go task while independently manipulating three task parameters: (1) percentage no-go trials (50% or 25%), (2) stimulus presentation time (600 ms or 200 ms), and (3) nature of no-go stimuli (cigarette related or cigarette unrelated). Three measures, reaction time on go trials and percentage correct responses on go and no-go trials, served as performance indicators. Under 200-ms but not 600-ms stimulus presentation conditions, the smokers responded faster on go trials and made more errors on both go and no-go trials than the non-smokers did. These differences occurred irrespective of the percentage of no-go trials and nature of no-go stimuli. The accuracy differences disappeared after controlling for the response time differences, suggesting a strong speed-accuracy trade-off. This study contributes to unraveling the conditions under which smokers display impaired inhibition performance and helps to characterize the nature of this impairment. Under task conditions prompting fast responding, smokers are more prone to increase response speed and to make more errors than non-smokers.

AB  - Wine strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have no to weak natural pectinase activity, despite their genetic ability to secrete an endo-polygalacturonase. The addition of external pectinase of fungal origin has therefore become a common step of winemaking in order to enhance the extraction of compounds located in the grape berry skins during maceration and to ease wine clarification after maturation. Recently, the strong pectinase activity of a wine strain of Saccharomyces paradoxus has been reported. In this study, the endo-polygalacturonase-encoding gene of S. paradoxus was sequenced and its activity was characterised, compared with that of S. cerevisiae and tested under winemaking conditions through overexpression of both genes individually in S. cerevisiae. A few differences in the amino acids sequences between the two proteins were revealed and the activity of the Pgu1 enzyme of S. paradoxus was shown to be weaker under winemaking conditions. Clear indicators of extracellular activity were observed in the wines made with both recombinant strains (i.e. enzyme activity in cell-free wine, higher methanol concentration and higher free-run wine), but the actual composition of the wines fermented with the mutants was only sparingly altered. Although unexpectedly found in lower concentrations in the latter wines, phenolic compounds were shown to be the most discriminatory components. Overexpressing the PGU1 gene of S. paradoxus or that of S. cerevisiae did not make much difference, showing that the higher activity of S. paradoxus strains under laboratory conditions could be due to a different regulation mechanism rather than to a different sequence of PGU1.

AB  - Specific visible foliar injuries were demonstrated to occur on plants of Viburnum lantana L. (wayfaring tree) when exposed to ozone in open-top chamber experiments. However, although evidence of visible injury was reported even for native plants, no comprehensive testing has been carried out under real field conditions. Thus, the extent to which V. lantana may match the requirements to be used as an in situ bioindicator is not fully known. To investigate the actual responsiveness of native V. lantana plants to ozone under field condition, two 1 x 1 km quadrates (named "Margone" and "Lasino"), for which the occurrence of different ozone levels was known, were considered. There, a fully randomized design was adopted to ensure within-quadrate replications and to select V. lantana plants. Measurements confirmed different exposure levels (Margone, Accumulated ozone concentrations Over a Threshold of 40 ppb h (AOT40): 31 952 ppb h; Lasino, AOT40: 23 259 ppb h). Ozone visible foliar symptoms (i) matched the known symptomatology, (ii) were easy to be identified, (iii) confirmed by microscopical validation, and (iv) observed at both quadrates. However, higher frequency of symptoms, earlier date of onset and faster development occurred at the quadrate with the highest ozone exposure (Margone), although not always proportionally with the difference in ozone exposure. This may be partly due to inherent covariation of environmental variables (higher ozone exposure occurred at the sites with higher relative humidity and cooler air temperature, a set of conditions that may promote ozone uptake), and partly due to a set of (unmeasured) other factors that may cause additional oxidative stress to plants. Implications for biomonitoring are discussed.

AB  - A real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) method and a modification of this method incorporating pretreatment of samples with propidium monoazide (PMA) were evaluated for respective analyses of total and presumptively viable Enterococcus and Bacteroidales fecal indicator bacteria. These methods were used in the analyses of wastewater samples to investigate their feasibility as alternatives to current fecal indicator bacteria culture methods for predicting the efficiency of viral pathogen removal by standard treatment processes. PMA treatment was effective in preventing qPCR detection of target sequences from non-viable cells. Concentrates of small volume, secondary-treated wastewater samples, collected from a publicly owned treatment works (POTW) under normal operating conditions, had little influence on this effectiveness. Higher levels of total suspended solids, such as those associated with normal primary treatment and all treatment stages during storm flow events, appeared to interfere with PMA effectiveness under the sample preparation conditions employed. During normal operating conditions at three different POTWs, greater reductions were observed in PMA-qPCR detectable target sequences of both Enterococcus and Bacteroidales than in total qPCR detectable sequences. These reductions were not as great as those observed for cultivable fecal indicator bacteria in response to wastewater disinfection. Reductions of PMA-qPCR as well as total qPCR detectable target sequences from enterococci and, to a lesser extent, Bacteroidales correlated well with reductions in infectious viruses during both normal and storm flow operating conditions and therefore may have predictive value in determining the efficiency at which these pathogens are removed.

AB  - Footpad dermatitis and lameness are a major welfare concern in broiler chicken farming. In general, footpad lesions are linked to poor environmental conditions. Ulcers that arise from advanced lesions can negatively affect the gait of the birds, with effects on the animal welfare, including, in the worst cases, inability to reach the feed or water. In this study, the degree of footpad dermatitis and lameness was manually scored on 4 broiler farms across Europe, as part of an EU-wide welfare assessment program. The welfare of the chickens was assessed 3 times per production cycle (at wk 3, 4, and 5), scoring footpad dermatitis, lameness, and litter quality. In the same broiler farms, variables such as air temperature and relative humidity were automatically measured over the same period. These variables were combined into a widely accepted thermal comfort index and associated to upper and lower thresholds, which made it possible to quantify the percentage of time the birds spent out of the thermal comfort zone (POOC). The data was analyzed by combining data from the welfare assessments with environmental data collected by the automated monitoring systems. Considering the comparison between POOC classes, the highest probabilities of footpad dermatitis and lameness were obtained when POOC values exceeded the 70% threshold. Therefore, the analysis showed that footpad dermatitis and lameness were more frequent when the flock was exposed to poor environmental conditions for prolonged periods (P < 0.001). Since environmental conditions can be continuously measured, and the risk factor for footpad dermatitis and lameness increases with poor environmental conditions, there is the possibility to develop a detection and control system of severe lesions.

AB  - The Upper Triassic to Lower Jurassic Kapp Toscana Group of Spitsbergen consists of mudstones, sandstones and shales deposited in offshore marine to paralic conditions in an extensive shelf embayment The study focuses on microfossil-based biofacies features (mainly foraminifera, but also palynomorphs) combined with sedimentary and selected geochemical data, in relation to transgressive-regressive developments. The analysed material includes field logs and sediment samples originating from the Juvdalskampen section, central Spitsbergen.
   The benthic foraminiferal succession reveals three principal associations: 1) assemblages of mixed agglutinated and calcareous components, typified by medium to high diversities, indicating offshore shelf conditions; 2) assemblages consisting dominantly or entirely of agglutinated forms with low diversity, attributed to hyposaline conditions; 3) highly impoverished agglutinated assemblages or barren samples suggesting extremely brackish to freshwater environments. The marine influence is highest in the lower and upper parts, and lowest in the middle part of the Kapp Toscana Group, as indicated both by foraminiferal and palynomorph proxies. The potential of the boron concentration as a salinity indicator is demonstrated by its co-variance with biofacies features: the boron content increases with increasing salinity.
   The Kapp Toscana Group consists of two depositional sequences. The Storfjorden sequence (Carnian to Early Norian) starts with a transgressive systems tract formed in offshore shelf conditions with normal marine salinity and terminates at the maximum flooding event, which is succeeded by a highstand systems tract deposited in paralic (hyposaline to freshwater), prodelta to delta plain environments. The overlying Wilhelmoya sequence (Middle Norian to Bajocian) is punctuated by several hiatuses, and was deposited in hyposaline waters on a sediment-starved, prodelta shelf platform.

AB  - To test which variables may be important for weathering on Mars, the effects of temperature (22 degrees C, 6 degrees C, and -19 degrees C), high ionic strength, and oxygen concentrations were investigated in batch dissolution experiments containing forsterite, fayalite, and basalt glass. CaCl2-NaCl-H2O brine can remain liquid to temperatures of -55 degrees C and thus may be liquid in the cold, dry climate that currently characterizes Mars. To understand weathering under such conditions, dissolution rates were measured in experiments in distilled water with and without CaCl2 and NaCl. As observed by others, dissolution rates increased with temperature, and only fayalite dissolution was significantly affected by the presence or absence of oxygen. Enhanced fayalite dissolution under anoxic conditions suggests that Fe-rich olivine would dissolve more rapidly than Mg-rich olivine on Mars. Dissolution in the two most dilute experimental solutions (deionized water and CaCl2-NaCl-H2O solution of ionic strength = 0.7 m) were the same within uncertainty, but apparent dissolution rate constants in CaCl2-NaCl-H2O brines were significantly slower. Steady silica concentrations are decreased in the brines, consistent with other work, and precipitation rates of silica decrease with decreasing temperatures. These results suggest that enhanced silica precipitation could be an indicator of high ionic strength solutions on Mars. Consistent with these observations, weathering of basalt has been observed to sometimes be accompanied by precipitated layers of silica in cold, dry environments on Earth. If dissolution on Mars occurs or occurred under conditions similar to our experiments, cation leaching would be expected to be accompanied by silica precipitates on weathering surfaces.

AB  - During winter, boreal forest herbivores have access to only poor-quality forage. On Anticosti Island (Quebec, Canada), the ongoing reduction of balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) P. Mill.) owing to overbrowsing by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmermann, 1780)) may force deer to include a higher proportion of white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss), a browse normally avoided, in their winter diet. We tested the hypotheses that (i) deer body condition during winter and (ii) the costs of detoxification of plant secondary metabolites in the winter diet could be estimated by monitoring the 3-methylhistidine/creatinine and glucuronic acid/creatinine ratios, respectively, in urine collected in snow from white-tailed deer fawns. Doubling the amount of white spruce in the winter diet of deer (from the current 20% under natural conditions to 40%) did not increase 3-methylhistidine/creatinine ratios but increased the glucuronic acid/creatinine ratio in urine, suggesting that a diet containing more spruce was more toxic. A weak positive relationship was observed between 3-methylhistidine and percent cumulative mass loss. There was no relationship between the 3-methylhistidine/creatinine ratio and the number of days left before death, as well as no relationship between the ratio of glucuronic acid/creatinine and percent cumulative mass loss. We conclude that the costs of detoxification of plant secondary metabolites in the winter diet of white-tailed deer in boreal forests could be monitored with glucuronic acid/creatinine ratios, but that 3-methylhistidine/creatinine ratios were weak indicators of deer body condition in winter.

AB  - The paper shows that Russian gas distribution organizations use approximate formulas to calculate the dynamic viscosity factor and adiabatic exponent of natural gas as a function of just the operating temperature and pressure of the gas and not its composition. Corrections specific to the accounting period must thus be introduced into the results of measurements. The error of the natural gas accounting unit under real conditions can be determined only by performing a metrological evaluation based on the data about the ranges of variation of the absolute pressure, temperatures and density under standard conditions and of errors in the measurements by the supplier.

AB  - Phenotypically plastic signals that can be altered in response to changing environmental conditions provide animals with the ability to dynamically signal their current condition or status. Such flexibility might also provide a means of avoiding potential trade-offs between signal components. Among birds, for example, both the timing of expression and the coloration of nuptial plumage are often thought to be honest signals of condition. However, because plumage is a relatively static signal type, birds that express condition-dependent plumage signals may face a trade-off between timing of signal production and signal quality, in that signals produced relatively early may be of lower quality because of seasonal constraints. A related cost may be increased fading or wear of plumage associated with extended duration of signal expression. Male Red-backed Fairywrens (Malurus melanocephalus) exhibit asynchronous development of nuptial red-black plumage, with some individuals molting into nuptial plumage months earlier than others. We report that male Red-backed Fairywrens that molt into nuptial red-black plumage early during the nonbreeding season appear to increase their plumage coloration by replacing feathers outside of normal molt periods (i.e. adventitious molt). In this way, some male Red-backed Fairywrens may be able to molt into nuptial plumage in the nonbreeding season, which is likely to increase access to mates or resources, and to subsequently enhance the red hue of a plumage-based sexual signal to a putatively more attractive state. We suggest that adventitious molt may be a currently underappreciated mechanism that birds use to improve or maintain the quality of plumage-based signals over time, between periodic full-body molts.

AB  - YvgO is a recently characterized antifungal protein isolated from Bacillus thuringiensis SF361 that exhibits a broad spectrum of activity and pH stability. Customized colorimetric metabolic assays based on standard broth microdilution techniques were used to determine the variable tolerance of Byssochlamys fulva H25 and Candida albicans 3153A to YvgO exposure under select matrix conditions impacting cellular proliferation. Normalization of the solution pH after antifungal challenge expanded the available pH range under consideration allowing for a comprehensive in vitro assessment of YvgO efficacy. Indicator susceptibility was examined across an array of elementary growth-modifying conditions, including media pH, incubation temperature, ionic strength, and carbohydrate supplementation. Under suboptimal temperature and pH conditions, the indicator growth rate reduced, and YvgO-mediated susceptibility was attenuated. While YvgO association but not efficacy was somewhat influenced by solution ionic strength, carbohydrate supplementation was shown to be the most influential susceptibility factor, particularly for C. albicans. Although the specific choice of carbohydrate/nutrient supplement dictated the extent of enhanced YvgO efficacy, D-glucose additionally improved the association between antifungal and target. Indeed, when exposed to YvgO under conditions that lead to increased cellular proliferation, both indicators displayed a stronger association and susceptibility to YvgO when compared to carbohydrate-deprived media or suboptimal incubation environments. With further study, YvgO may have the capacity to function as a prophylaxis for food safety and preservation, as well as a pharmaceutical agent against opportunistic fungal pathogens either independently or in combination with other established treatments applied to both livestock and human health concerns.

AB  - This paper investigates the high-solution of Mo isotopes and uses trace-element analyses for fresh and representative black shales and siliceous shales collected from the transition between the Late Ordovician and the Early Silurian at the Wangjiawan section in Yichang and the Late Permian Dalong Formation in the Shangsi Section of Sichuan. The applicability of different geochemical parameters used as paleo-oxygenation indices are also compared. The preliminary results show that V/(V+Ni), U-auth (auth U), V/Cr, Ce-anom and U/Th have a scattered variation range, but most samples plot within the suboxic-anoxic fields. The suboxic-anoxic environment was dominant during the deposition and formation of the two anoxic facies. These redox indicators show little correspondence to the delta Mo-98 values. The U/Mo ratio can be used as a potential proxy for the paleo-redox conditions due to the possibility that Mo is enriched relative to U at different redox gradients during early diagenesis. This evidence is more significant for the euxinicity condition and corresponds to positive delta Mo-98 (> 1.5 parts per thousand) values with low U/Mo ratios. This evidence is likely related to the depositional conditions near the boundary between anoxic and euxinic environments, which are characterised by low bioturbation or water circulation. Other samples reveal a wide scatter of U/Mo ratios and delta Mo-98 < 1.5 parts per thousand. These results are likely due to punctuated improvements in oxygenation with intense bioturbation or water circulation, which led to the redistribution of trace element.

AB  - This baseline paper discusses the distribution and abundance of living benthic foraminifera in relation to Potentially Toxic Elements (PTEs) such as As, Al, Fe Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, V, Ni, Hg, Pb, and Zn in marine sediments collected from 30 stations in the offshore Arabian Gulf to define baseline environmental conditions for the implementation of future biomonitoring programs. A total of 271 living benthic foraminiferal species were identified belonging to 66 genera, 37 families and 6 orders. Data from this work suggest that PTEs are within the range of background values, and the sediments support highly diversified and stable benthic foraminiferal communities adapted to the unique environmental conditions in the Gulf. Thus, the effect of anthropogenic activities is deemed negligible. This study is expected to provide a baseline dataset for PTE levels in sediment, benthic foraminiferal communities, and identify endemic species adapted to extremes of temperature and saline conditions typical of the Gulf.

AB  - A 96-condition initial screen for protein crystallization, called MORPHEUS, has been developed at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, England (MRC-LMB). The concept integrates several innovative approaches, such as chemically compatible mixes of potential ligands, new buffer systems and precipitant mixes that also act as cryoprotectants. Instead of gathering a set of crystallization conditions that have already been successful, a selection of molecules frequently observed in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) to co-crystallize with proteins has been made. These have been put together in mixes of similar chemical behaviour and structure, and combined with buffers and precipitant mixes that were also derived from PDB searches, to build the screen de novo. Observations made at the MRC-LMB and many practical aspects were also taken into account when formulating the screen. The resulting screen is easy to use, comprehensive yet small, and has already yielded a list of crystallization hits using both known and novel samples. As an indicator of success, the screen has now become one of the standard screens used routinely at the MRC-LMB when searching initial crystallization conditions for biological macromolecules.

T2  - PLANT PATHOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - CULTIVARS
AB  - Different criteria were compared for assessing bacterial wilt resistance in 13 tomato genotypes varying in disease susceptibility. Will severity and bacterial invasiveness at collar and midstem were compared in the field under cooler (March to May, 20-28 degrees C) and warmer months (June to August, 23-29 degrees C), which were unfavourable and favourable to wilt symptom expression, respectively. A model was proposed for determining resistance regardless of climatic conditions prevalent during field experimentation. This model was based on an estimate of bacterial invasiveness termed the colonization index. Using a qualitative imprint method we confirmed that the more resistant the genotype, the lower the bacterial colonization of the stem. The colonization index accounted both for wilted plants and for infected asymptomatic plants in which Pseudomonas solanacearum populations failed to produce wilt. The colonization index at midstem was the more useful indicator of resistance under favourable conditions. When environmental conditions were unfavourable to wilt, colonization index at collar level discerned resistant genotypes more clearly. The results formed the basis for a model for predicting the degree and stability of resistance in tomato.

AB  - The authors present a scheme thar combines original and literature data on hormonal control of shoot/root biomass rate. Accumulation of ABK - well-known response on unfavourable influence - can play role of initiator or at least an indicator of processes lead to the decrease of cytokinin concentration. The latter can result the changes in auxin supply. Realization of this hormonal reaction under stress condition can be a reason of biomass redistribution for roots, that is important compensate reaction that determines the survival of organism in unfavourable environment. Presented scheme is an attempt to integrate separate data on participation of different hormones in regulation of stress reaction in plant.

AB  - Occupational heat stress could impose a greater risk of heat-related morbidities among the exposed users, declining their work productivity and contributing to a financial burden. This necessitate the implementation of adequate preventive measures and control policies to improve the users' well-being and productive capacity. The emergence of modernistic sensors gives rise to workplace heat stress monitoring at a substantially lower cost than expensive conventional equipment. Present work unveils the productive role of sensor-based safety helmet, which could monitor the environmental variables, heat stress indices, and users' physiological variables as an indicator of heat strain. The proposed safety helmet was tested under three different work environments with users' engaged in specific work activities. Notable variations were perceived among the measured data under respective work conditions and physical activity performed. Higher heat risk exposures were attributable to the outdoor condition compared to indoor work conditions. For wet bulb globe temperature index, strong association (p-value < 0.01) was observed with fighter index of thermal stress (R-2-value = 0.959) followed by discomfort index (R-2-value = 0.899) and heat index (R-2-value = 0.867). Results revealed a rise in measured physiological parameters under the heavy workload activity (shoveling task; outdoor location) followed by hacksaw cutting task (indoor location), while least values were associated with light workload activity (drilling task; indoor location). The proposed design intervention could be considered an effective site-specific solution for monitoring heat stress exposures and keeping exposed users well aware of the prevalent thermal work conditions at the individual level.

AB  - Photodermatoses are a group of skin disorders caused or exacerbated by ultraviolet and/or visible radiation, which collectively affect a high proportion of the population and substantially affect quality of life (QoL). Our objective was to assess the psychological impact of these conditions. Patients with a range of photodermatoses diagnosed at a specialist investigation centre in the UK completed questionnaires evaluating (i) anxiety and (ii) depression, using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), (iii) social anxiety, using the Fear of Negative Evaluation measure (FNE), (iv) coping strategies (brief COPE) and (v) QoL, using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Questionnaires were returned by 185 of 260 patients (71.1% response rate). Mean age was 50.2 years (SD 14.5, range 20-85), 80.3% female. Polymorphic light eruption was the most common diagnosis, followed by photoaggravated eczema, other photoaggravated dermatological conditions and solar urticaria. Across the sample, high percentages, i.e. 23% and 7.9% of individuals, showed scores indicating clinical levels of anxiety and depression, respectively. Facial involvement was a strong indicator for depression (t = 2.7, p < 0.01). In regression analyses psychological factors (particularly depression and adaptive coping) were the principle predictors of QoL, accounting for 17.7% of the variance (F = 7.61, p < 0.01), while clinical variables accounted for an additional 10.1% (F = 8.96, p < 0.01), with number of months/year affected exerting a significant effect (p < 0.01). This study demonstrates the high psychological comorbidity of these conditions; more awareness of this is required, with adoption of a biopsychosocial approach to their management.

AB  - Indirect benefits derived by females that mate with males that express preferred traits are important to our understanding of 'good genes' models of sexual selection. However, few studies have explored male courtship behaviours with potential indirect benefits conferred to females in order to ascertain whether these behaviours serve as honest indicators of male quality. Using a common species of wolf spider, Pardosa milvina, we addressed the honesty of male courtship behaviours in two laboratory experiments. In our first experiment, we quantified the repeatability of courtship rate in adult males that were manipulated to be in high or low condition and were sequentially presented with adult virgin females that similarly differed in body condition. In our second experiment, we explored the effect of male courtship rate on several measures of fitness: number of offspring produced, days until offspring emerged and offspring viability measured as offspring survival. Our experiments show that male courtship rate is statistically significantly repeatable except when males in high condition have repeated encounters with females in low condition. Our results also reveal that females have the potential to gain indirect genetic benefits by mating with males that naturally court at high rates: females produced more offspring that emerged from eggsacs sooner and survived starvation better compared to females that mated with males that naturally courted at low rates. Our study provides additional support that male courtship rate is an honest indicator of quality, and it makes the novel finding that the repeatability of courtship rate is context sensitive.

AB  - Protein content was used as an indicator of environmental conditions for a study on varietal and environmental variation in proximate composition, minerals, amino acids and certain antinutrients of field peas. Four field pea varieties, each with three levels of protein content, were selected. Crude protein content overall ranged from 20.2 to 26.7%. Analysis of variance showed that both variety and environmental conditions had a significant effect on starch, acid detergent fibre (ADF), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and fat content, but ash content was only affected by variety. Significant varietal and environmental differences in potassium (K), manganese (Mn) and phosphorus (P) were noted. Calcium (Ca) and copper (Cu) showed significant varietal differences, while iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg) and zinc (Zn) had significant environmental differences. Environmental conditions showed significant effects on alanine, glycine, isoleucine, lysine and threonine content. Variety had a significant effect on sucrose, raffinose and phytic acid content, whereas environmental conditions had an influence on trypsin inhibitor activity (TIA). The major pea components protein and starch were inversely correlated. ADF, NDF, Fe, Mg, Zn and the amino acid arginine were positively correlated with protein content. The amino acids glycine, histidine, isoleucine, lysine and threonine were negatively correlated with protein content. It was found that tryptophan was the most deficient amino acid and the sulphur-containing amino acids were the second limiting amino acids in peas. Raffinose was positively correlated with sucrose but negatively correlated with verbascose. There were significant correlations between mineral contents and some of the proximate components.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between the serum level of C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactation and health status. Blood samples were collected every 2 wk for 12 mo from 29 randomly selected dairy cattle on 3 farms. At the time the blood samples were collected, the stage of pregnancy, lactation status, breeding records, general health condition, reproductive status, and body condition score were recorded for each cow. Serum CRP was detected with sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western immunoblotting. C-reactive protein levels were measured with a densitometer and expressed as an optimal dose value. C-reactive protein levels were correlated with the body condition score, lactation status, and animal health (P < 0.05), but not with ambient temperature, animal age, or parity. C-reactive protein levels increased with milk production, peaking during high lactation (2 to 4 mo of pregnancy), and decreased when lactation ceased. In addition, the CRP level was highest during naturally occurring infections, such as mastitis and other tissue inflammation. Thus, the CRP level can confirm the presence of inflammation. The stress effect of taking blood samples as measured by the CRP level, was also examined. The CRP level became rapidly elevated 12 h after the blood samples were taken but returned to normal 36 h later. In conclusion, the stresses resulting from overall poor health, heavy lactation, and blood sampling caused the elevation of serum CRP. C-reactive protein is a marker or tool for evaluating the health status of a herd. C-reactive protein should also be considered as a useful criteria to assess the stress levels and may be useful in early surveillance of disease conditions in a dairy herd.

Currently, most activity sensors established in livestock farming are optical or animal-attached sensors. Animal-attached sensors are hard to manage especially with smaller species. Optical sensors are susceptible to reduced sensitivity from dirt and to effects of changing light conditions. In scenarios where the spatial distribution of the activity is not relevant, simple stationary sensors which directly measure activity in an area may be beneficial as the signals are easy to interpret and hence require little computational power. The present work describes a proof of concept study for the utilisation of radar sensors for this purpose. In order to assess the effective sensitivity of the sensors under practical conditions, detecting the parturition-related activity increase in sows was chosen as benchmark. A simple classifier was implemented, detecting deviation in activity based on data from 15 sows, using day-to-day activity differences and the cumulative sum technique. This classifier achieved 92% sensitivity with 80% specificity and had a receiver operating characteristic with 95% area under the curve. This is comparable to the classification performance that has been achieved with animal-attached accelerometers and stationary light barriers. No negative effects from dust or other environmental conditions were observed. Additional studies will be necessary to verify this result and to show the suitability of radar sensors for additional application scenarios and other species. (C) 2019 IAgrE.

AB  - The stress conditions of the ductile-to-brittle regime have been assessed along the Asuke Shear Zone (ASZ), which strikes NE-SW in the Cretaceous Ryoke granite terrain in SW Japan. Along the ASZ, pseudotachylyte and mylonitized pseudotachylyte are locally developed together with cataclasite. The simultaneous operation of dislocation creep and grain-size-sensitive creep, as indicated by the coexistence of the Z-maximum and relatively random c-axis lattice preferred orientations as well as the sizes of dynamically recrystallized quartz grains (6.40-7.79 mu m) in the mylonitized pseudotachylyte, suggest differential stresses of 110-130 MPa at similar to 300 degrees C. The e-twin morphology, twinning ratio, and distribution of the glide direction on the e-twin plane of the twinned calcite in the amygdules of the pseudotachylyte suggest the stress conditions of the sigma(1) and sigma(3) axes trend 228 degrees and 320 degrees and plunge 55 degrees and 1 degrees, respectively, and indicate differential stresses of 40-80 MPa at 150-200 degrees C. Based on kinematic indicators in the fault rocks, the stress conditions estimated from calcite twins, and the cooling history of the granitic protolith, the ASZ is inferred to have been activated under a stress state that caused sinistral normal movements before and after pseudotachylyte formation at 70-50 Ma.

AB  - In this paper, we characterize the most common coupled point defects in the olivine structure of the hydrous olivine {v(Me), 2OH(-)}, humite {v(Si), 4OH(-)}, laihunite {v(Me), 2Fe(3+)}, hydroxyl {v(Me), Fe3+, OH-}, and Schottky {v(Me), v(O)} types, where v is a vacancy. Their segregation and evolution under changing physicochemical conditions were considered. During the development of deformation textures, the segregation of {v(Me), 2OH(-)} and {v(Si), 4OH(-)} defects is accompanied by the formation of planar features in olivine consisting of hydrous olivine, n(Mg,Fe)(2)SiO4 center dot MgH2SiO4, and humite-like layers, n(Mg,Fe)(2)SiO4 center dot Mg(OH)(2), respectively. Under the conditions of low-temperature oxidation, the segregation of {v(Me), 2Fe(3+)} defects in anhydrous olivine results in the formation of planar laihunite-type defects. The OH-bearing defects undergo dehydrogenation and oxidation during heating with decompression, which results in the transformation of hydrous olivine-type defects into laihunite-type {v(Me), 2Fe(3+)} or hydroxyl-type {v(Me), Fe3+, OH-} defects. The mobility of coupled point defects and their ability to segregate and form new phases in the host olivine, the possibility of releasing a proton with transformation into defects of a different type, and potential role as an oxidizer in dehydrogenation processes are manifested upon changes in physicochemical conditions and can be considered as indicators of geologic processes accompanied by variations in P, fO(2), and aH(2)O.

AB  - Soil condition is commonly assessed by using soil organic carbon (SOC) as an indicator; however, a large proportion of the world's soils can contain charcoal, a biologically-inert form of organic carbon. We investigated whether the presence of charcoal in soil could lead to an inaccurate assessment of soil condition when using SOC as an indicator. We sampled topsoil in a south-east Australian catchment affected by severe fires in 2003. Samples (n = 100) were analysed for two SOC fractions: (i) total SOC (t-SOC, loss on ignition), which included charcoal, and (ii) biologically-active SOC (a-SOC, persulphate-oxidation), which did not contain charcoal. Using novel (boosted regression trees) and traditional (linear regression) modelling methods we compared the relative importance of abiotic (slope, aspect, elevation and soil texture) and biotic (land use and vegetation structure) factors as predictors of t-SOC and a-SOC concentration. A major difference between the two response variables was less relative importance of land use as a predictor when using t-SOC as a response variable. Therefore, ignoring the presence of charcoal would have led to an under-estimation of the effect of land-use conversion on the biologically-available SOC fraction. The presence of charcoal has important ramifications for routine assessments of soil condition given that (i) SOC is a commonly used indicator and charcoal and biologically-active SOC differ in their effects on soil properties, (ii) fires historically occur on a large area of land, (iii) charcoal is a long-lasting consequence of fires and (iv) charcoal can account for a large proportion of SOC and yet be unnoticed during sample preparation.

AB  - This paper describes a procedure to assimilate Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS)-retrieved thermodynamic profiles into a regional configuration of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and validates subsequent precipitation forecasts over the eastern half of the continental U. S. Quality indicators were used to select the highest quality temperature and moisture profiles for assimilation throughout the entire atmosphere in clear and partly cloudy regions and above cloud top in cloudy regions. Separate error characteristics for land and water profiles were also used in the assimilation process. Assimilation of AIRS profiles produced analyses with a better validation to in situ observations than the short-term WRF forecast first-guess field. The AIRS-enhanced initial conditions improved simulation of a severe weather event over Texas and Louisiana from February 12-13, 2007. For this event, assimilation of AIRS profiles produced a more unstable boundary-layer air mass in the warm sector ahead of an advancing midlatitude cyclone, resulting in enhanced convective available potential energy in the model. The simulated squall line and precipitation totals from a forecast initialized with AIRS-enhanced initial conditions more closely reflected ground-based observations than one initialized with a no-AIRS control forecast. The impact of the improved initial conditions through the assimilation of AIRS profiles was further demonstrated through an evaluation of a 37-day period from the winter of 2007. The unstable environment over the Gulf of Mexico and coastal region with the AIRS-enhanced initial conditions resulted in 20%+ improvements in the 6-h accumulated precipitation forecasts out to 48 h over that period.

AB  - Over the last several decades, increased agricultural production has been driven by improved agronomic practices and a dramatic increase in the use of nitrogen-containing fertilizers to maximize the yield potential of crops. To reduce input costs and to minimize the potential environmental impacts of nitrogen fertilizer that has been used to optimize yield, an increased understanding of the molecular responses to nitrogen under field conditions is critical for our ability to further improve agricultural sustainability. Using maize (Zea mays) as a model, we have characterized the transcriptional response of plants grown under limiting and sufficient nitrogen conditions and during the recovery of nitrogen-starved plants. We show that a large percentage (approximately 7%) of the maize transcriptome is nitrogen responsive, similar to previous observations in other plant species. Furthermore, we have used statistical approaches to identify a small set of genes whose expression profiles can quantitatively assess the response of plants to varying nitrogen conditions. Using a composite gene expression scoring system, this single set of biomarker genes can accurately assess nitrogen responses independently of genotype, developmental stage, tissue type, or environment, including in plants grown under controlled environments or in the field. Importantly, the biomarker composite expression response is much more rapid and quantitative than phenotypic observations. Consequently, we have successfully used these biomarkers to monitor nitrogen status in real-time assays of field-grown maize plants under typical production conditions. Our results suggest that biomarkers have the potential to be used as agronomic tools to monitor and optimize nitrogen fertilizer usage to help achieve maximal crop yields.

AB  - Risk management due to natural hazards is a multidimensional and complex problem since it requires the knowledge and experience of several disciplines. The effectiveness of risk management can be analyzed, inviting to the action through weakness identification of the urban area. This article proposes a methodology based on the morphological analysis to support the decision-making on disaster risk management, taking as a starting point the results of a holistic evaluation of the seismic risk. The results of the holistic evaluation of risk are achieved aggravating the physical risk using the contextual conditions, such as the socio-economic fragility and the lack of resilience. In consequence, the risk mitigation can be performed through the reduction of the potential damage and consequences involved; and the improvement of social conditions.
   The proposed methodology allows prioritizing the risk reduction strategies according to i) performance level of component indicators involved into the Disaster Risk Management index, DRMi; ii) physical risk factors dependent from the potential damages, and iii) aggravating factors involved in the aggravating coefficient. Moreover, it involves 35 strategies to reduce the physical risk and the aggravating social conditions of the urban area.
   The proposed methodology has been applied to the city of Merida (Venezuela), located within an area of high seismic activity. The performance level of the indicators involved in the DRMi was evaluated by a survey to local experts. As a result, eleven strategies have been identified to reduce the potential damage and to improve the social conditions of this city.

AB  - Manganese (Mn) in lake sediments reacts strongly to changes of redox conditions. This study analyzed Mn concentrations in oxides, carbonates, and bulk phases of the calcareous lacustrine sediments of a 938.5-m-long core (SG-1) taken from the western Qaidam Basin, well dated from 2.77 Ma to 0.1 Ma. Comparisons of extractions from diluted hydrochloric acid, acetic acid and citrate-bicarbonate-dithionite demonstrate that variations of Mn concentrations from acetic acid leaching (Mn-HOAc) are mostly responsible for Mn (II) fluctuations in the carbonate phase. Taking into account the relevant processes during weathering, transportation, deposition and post-deposition of Mn-bearing rocks, we conclude that Mn input from catchment weathering and paleolake redox condition provide the primary controls on variations in the Mn records of carbonate and oxide phases. We propose Mn-HOAC as a new sensitive indicator of paleolake redox evolution and catchment-scale climate change. The Mn-HOAC variations show a long-term upward decreasing trend, indicating a long-term decrease of Mn input from catchment weathering associated with increasing oxygen content in the paleolake bottom water. The great similarities of the Mn-HOAC record with other regional and global records suggest that paleolake redox changes and climatic drying in the Qaidam Basin may be largely related to global cooling.

AB  - Aluminum-and Fe/Mg-phyllosilicates are considered important geochemical indicators in terrestrial and Martian sedimentary systems. Traditionally, Al-phyllosilicates are characterized as forming and remaining stable under conditions of low to moderate pH, while Fe/Mg-phyllosilicates are considered representative of only dilute and moderate to high pH conditions. However, we have observed Al- and Fe/Mg-phyllosilicates in acid saline lake sediments in Western Australia. Phyllosilicate formation mechanisms in these lake systems include direct precipitation from lake waters, early diagenetic precipitation from shallow groundwaters, and deposition/alteration of detrital grains. X-ray diffraction analysis of silt-and clay-size sediments from two acid saline lakes in Western Australia indicates the presence of several complex mineral assemblages with extreme spatial heterogeneity that reflects the complex geochemistry of these lakes. These assemblages include unique combinations of authigenic and/or detrital phyllosilicates (e. g., kaolinite, smectite, and palygorskite-sepiolite), sulfates (e. g., alunite, jarosite, and gypsum), Fe-oxides (e. g., hematite and goethite), and other silicates (e. g., mullite and heulandite-clinoptilolite). Observations of Fe/Mg-phyllosilicates found in acid saline sediments in southern Western Australia suggest their degradation under conditions of low pH (2.5-5.4) is slowed by the high salinity (5-25%) of the lake and shallow groundwaters. The occurrence of both Al- and Fe/Mg-phyllosilicates in these acid saline lake sediments suggests that environmental interpretations based on the occurrence of phyllosilicates require additional consideration of their spatial distribution and association with other minerals. Moreover, the similarity between the diverse mineral assemblages in these terrestrial acid saline systems and those on Mars indicates similar conditions may have existed on Mars.

AB  - The influence of turbulence conditions on the design loads for wind turbines is investigated by using inverse reliability techniques. Alternative modeling assumptions for randomness in the gross wind environment and in the extreme response given wind conditions to establish nominal design loads are studied. Accuracy in design load predictions based on use of the inverse first-order reliability method (that assumes a linearized limit state surface) is also investigated. An example is presented where three alternative nominal load definitions are used to estimate extreme flapwise bending loads at a blade root for a 600 kW three-bladed, stall-regulated horizontal-axis wind turbine located at onshore and offshore sites that were assumed to experience the same mean wind speed but different turbulence intensities. It is found that second-order (curvature-type) corrections to the linearized limit state function assumption inherent in the inverse first-order reliability approach are insignificant. Thus, we suggest that the inverse first-order reliability method is an efficient and accurate technique of predicting extreme loads. Design loads derived from a full random characterization of wind conditions as well as short-term maximum response (given wind conditions) may be approximated reasonably well by simpler models that include only the randomness in the wind environment but account for response variability by employing appropriately derived "higher-than-median" fractiles of the extreme bending loads conditional on specified inflow parameters. In the various results discussed, it is found that the higher relative turbulence at the onshore site leads to larger blade bending design loads there than at the offshore site. Also, for both onshore and offshore environments accounting for response variability is found to be slightly more important at longer return periods (i.e., safer designs).

AB  - Leaching tests are essential in the environmental assessment of stabilized wastes. Research programmes were conducted on their interpretation in order to develop tools for the evaluation of long term release of pollutants contained in solidified wastes. Models for the leaching of porous materials are discussed in this paper according to the specificity of the chemical species (i.e. transport model with total dissolution of species-diffusional model; transport model with progressive dissolution of species due to limitation of solubility-shrinking core model; and the model coupling transport and chemical phenomena). The leaching behaviour of pollutants (i.e. lead) solidified in a cement matrix was studied under different chemical conditions. Results have shown that the release of species whose solubilities depend on the physico-chemical conditions, and especially the pH (e.g. amphoteric metals), is governed by the solubility of the species in the pore water at local conditions and by the pH evolution within the matrix. A coupled dissolution/diffusion model was developed to describe the release of chemically complex species contained in a porous medium in contact with water. Leaching tests of cement matrices and artificial porous matrices containing calcium hydroxide and pollutants were conducted in order to validate the coupled dissolution/diffusion model. A good assessment of the retention of some pollutants contained in cement matrices could then be obtained by the association of two tests: solubilization of the pollutants related to the chemical context (pH) under steady state conditions and monolithic long term dynamic leaching tests in order to characterize the evolution of the chemical context (pH) and consequently the release of pollutants. The objective is to integrate this approach in the standardization process (CEN TC 292- WG 6, in progress). (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bivalves have proved to be useful bioindicators for environmental pollution. In the present study, mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis), cockles (Cerastoderma edule), and razor shells (Solen marginatus) were collected in the Ebro Delta, an extensive area devoted to rice farming and affected by pesticide pollution, from April to July, the heaviest rice field treatment period. Possible effects of pollution were assessed through biochemical markers (carboxylesterase (CE), antioxidant and neurotoxicity-related enzymes, and lipid peroxidation levels). Data on environmental variables, bivalve reproductive condition, and presence of organic pollutants, marine phycotoxins, pathogens, or histopathological conditions in bivalve's tissues were also evaluated. Although the bioaccumulated pesticides did not explain the patterns observed for biochemical responses, the obtained results point to an effect of environmental pesticide pollution on enzymatic markers, with a prominent contribution of CE to such changes. Mussels and razor shells provided a more sensitive biochemical response to pollution than cockles. Environmental variables, bivalve reproductive condition, and marine phycotoxins did not seem to have a relevant effect on the biomarkers assessed.

AB  - Salmonella is a microorganism of concern on a global basis for raw shrimp. This research modeled the impact of vapor thymol concentration (0, 0.8, and 1.6 mg/liter), storage temperature (8, 12, and 16 degrees C), and modified atmosphere condition (0.04 as in the natural atmosphere and 59.5% CO2) against the growth behavior of a Salmonella cocktail (six strains) on raw shrimp. Lag time (hour) and maximum growth rate (log CFU per gram per hour), chosen as two growth indicators, were obtained through DMFit software and then developed into polynomial as well as nonlinear modified secondary models (dimensional and/or dimensionless), consisting of two or even three impact factors in the equations. The models were validated, and results showed that the predictive values from both models demonstrated good matches to the observed experimental values, yet the prediction based on lag time was more accurate than maximum growth rate. The information will provide the food industry with insight into the potential safety risk of Salmonella growth on raw shrimp under stressed conditions.

AB  - Icing on transmission lines might lead to ice flashovers of insulators, collapse of towers, tripping faults of transmission lines, and other accidents. Shed spacing and shed overhang of insulators are clues for evaluating the probability of ice flashover. This paper researches image-processing methods for the natural icing of in-service glass insulators. Calculation methods of graphical shed spacing and graphical shed overhang are proposed via recognizing the convexity defects of the contours of an icing insulator string based on the GrabCut segmentation algorithm. The experiments are carried out with image data from our climatic chamber and the China Southern Power Grid Disaster (Icing) Warning System of Transmission Lines. The results show that the graphical shed overhang of insulators show evident change due to icing. This method can recognize the most serious icing conditions where the insulator sheds are completely bridged. Also, it can detect bridging positions including the left side, right side, or both sides of the insulator strings in the images.

AB  - Many plants deposit the soluble silica absorbed from the soil as monosilicic acid (H4SiO4) in and between their cells, generating bodies of opal silica (SiO2 center dot nH(2)O) called phytoliths. Although phytoliths are susceptible to dissolution under extreme pH conditions, they generally do remain in the soil for long periods of time and can help in the reconstruction of past vegetation and climates. In the present study, phytolith analysis was used to reconstruct the palaeoenvironmental conditions that contributed to the pedogenetic processes, the deposition of organic matter and its stabilization in a very thick (>1 m) umbric epipedon of a Humic Hapludox profile from Minas Gerais State (Brazil). The results from the phytolith assemblages were also compared to the fractions and isotopic data of soil carbon of the same profile. The result from studying these two palaeoenvironmental proxies together has shown that the environment under which the umbric epipedon was formed was a mixture of vegetation with predominance of C-3 plants in mesothermic conditions and with little variation in humidity since Middle Holocene.

AB  - Among 21 whole-rock samples of the Upper Cretaceous Niobrara Formation from Colorado, the abundance of cerium relative to other rare earth elements (Ce anomaly), the weight percent organic carbon (%C-org), and the intensity of bioturbation all covary. This covariation is provocative because %C-org and intensity of bioturbation track changes in the concentration of oxygen in the local water column at the time of deposition (Savrda and Bottjer 1989). Ce anomalies in apatite-rich fractions of the Maastrichtian Zumaya-Algorta Formation from France and Spain and the Miocene Monterey Formation from California show changes that also may coincide with changes in ancient oxygen levels, Our results for the Niobrara samples are the closest correspondence demonstrated between paleo-redox conditions and Ce anomalies, but we cannot yet determine whether the correspondence reflects a cause-and effect relationship, Variation in Ce anomalies is influenced by a number of factors, including terrigenous input, depositional environment, and diagenetic conditions. Potential interplay of these factors prevents a unique interpretation of our whole-rock data; dissecting whole-rock Ce anomalies through analysis of isolated sedimentary components, though, is a promising avenue of research.

AB  - The Upper Cretaceous Eagle Ford Group displays significant lateral and vertical geochemical variability. Much of the work on the Eagle Ford Group has been focused southwest of the San Marcos arch. To more fully characterize the Eagle Ford across the entire region, a thermally immature drill core was acquired north of the San Marcos arch that recovered the Pepper Shale and the Eagle Ford Group. Molecular and isotopic analyses of rock extracts were combined with bulk organic and inorganic geochemistry and mineralogy to track the variability in organic matter source and depositional environment, as well as to identify drivers of organic enrichment.
   The Pepper Shale received significant terrigenous organic matter in its distal deltaic or prodeltaic setting compared to the more distally deposited Eagle Ford Group that primarily hosts marine organic matter. The upper Eagle Ford contains two chemofacies. The older upper Eagle Ford chemofacies has similar mineralogy and organic matter to the underlying lower Eagle Ford, and both intervals display good to excellent source rock potential. In contrast, the younger upper Eagle Ford chemofacies has a different sterane assemblage, a larger terrigenous component, and a higher clay mineral abundance. However, anoxic to euxinic depositional conditions distinguish the lower Eagle Ford from the upper Eagle Ford, which was deposited under oxic to dysoxic conditions. Redox chemistry and organic matter source are two important variables that determine source rock quality, but they did not change in parallel during Eagle Ford deposition. Differences in organic facies explain the Tmax variability, and depositional redox conditions governed organic-richness in the Eagle Ford Group in central Texas. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) is an important fish species in Ontario, Canada, supporting recreational fisheries that contribute significantly to local economies. Hydroelectric dams disrupt the river continuum, altering downstream conditions and impacting riverine fish populations. Specifically, Brook Trout activity has been found to increase during hydropeaking periods, when dam operators rapidly increase river discharge to meet electricity demands. Higher energetic outputs driven by hydropeaking may decrease the energy available to allocate towards fish growth and condition, negatively impacting Brook Trout. We investigated the impact of two different hydropeaking regimes on resident Brook Trout populations downstream from a 15-MW dam used for hydropeaking, compared to a population in a nearby naturally flowing river. Length-at-age as determined by otolith back-calculations was higher in the regulated river relative to the naturally flowing river. Muscle tissue caloric content and weight-length relationships did not differ between rivers. Field metabolism, as inferred from fish otolith C-13 values, was higher in the regulated river relative to the naturally flowing river and was significantly positively related to time spent hydropeaking. Higher metabolic outputs in the regulated river were likely offset by an increased food supply, allowing for higher Brook Trout length-at-age. The opposing and complicated impacts of river regulation on Brook Trout highlight the need for studies to consider multiple indicators of fish health when characterising the response of fish populations to river regulation.

AB  - As modern engine designs target higher efficiencies through increased turbine inlet temperatures, critical turbine components are at increased risk of damage from conditions exceeding material melting temperatures. In particular, improperly designed underplatform hardware components are susceptible to damage when hot main gas path flow is ingested into the stator-rotor cavity. While all turbines inherently experience transients during operation, a majority of publicly available turbine studies have been executed using steady operating conditions or inherently transient "blowdown" rigs. For this reason, routine transient events are not well understood. To address this need, the present study utilized a combined experimental and computational approach. The test article is a continuous-duration, one-stage test turbine operating with true-scale engine hardware and seal geometries at engine-representative flow conditions. The nature of the continuous-duration facility uniquely supports the direct assessment of transient events through its ability to transition between steady-state operating conditions. The effects of a transient purge flow were investigated in this study to identify general trends for transient events in a full-scale engine. Results from multiple measurement techniques in the wheelspace region show an interdependence of transient purge flow with a thermal lag of the underplatform hardware. Through experiments conducted at different coolant-to-main gas path temperature ratios, the use of pressure measurements as an indicator of fully purged behavior was introduced, and a thermally driven influence on rim seal performance was quantified. The computational results show good agreement with experimental pressure measurements and provide insight into the physical mechanisms that drive the relationship between pressure and sealing effectiveness measurements observed for the tested geometry.

AB  - Compared to the Great Lakes, their connecting channels are relatively understudied and infrequently assessed. To address this gap, we conducted a spatially-explicit water quality assessment of two connecting channels, the St. Marys River and the Lake Huron-Lake Erie Corridor (HEC) in 2014-2016. We compared the condition of the channels to each other and to the up- and downriver Great Lakes with data from an assessment of the Great Lakes nearshore. In the absence of channel-specific thresholds, we assessed the condition of the area of each channel as good, fair, or poor by applying the most protective water quality thresholds for the downriver lake. Condition of the St. Marys River was rated mostly fair for total phosphorus (TP, 56% of the area) and mostly good (61% of the area) for chlorophyll a. Area-weighted mean concentrations of these parameters were intermediate to Lake Superior and Lake Huron. Unlike Lake Superior and Lake Huron, a large proportion (97%) of the area of the St. Marys River was in poor condition for water clarity based on Secchi depth. Area-weighted mean concentrations of TP and chlorophyll a in the HEC were more like lake Huron than Lake Erie. For these indicators, most of the area of the HEC was rated good (81% and 86%, respectively). Interpretation of assessment results is complicated by variation in thresholds among and within lakes. Appropriate thresholds should align with assessment objectives and in the case of connecting channels be at least as protective as thresholds for the downriver lake.

AB  - Light is one of the most important environmental factors influencing plant growth and development. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are are a promising alternative to conventional light sources for plant tissue cultures. Combined red (R) and blue (B) LEDs are suitable for the production of many plant species. However, few studies have examined the effects of different R:B ratios on Gerbera jamesonii under controlled conditions. G. jamesonii plantlets were grown in controlled conditions under different ratios of discreet and blue light wavelengths provided by programmable LEDs. The effects of the different LED treatments on various morphological indices, photosynthetic parameters, soluble sugar and protein contents, and antioxidant enzyme activities were analyzed. Growth under monochromatic red light resulted in the tallest plantlets and longest stomata, and most promoted soluble content and intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i). Growth under monochromatic blue light promoted the highest levels of soluble protein, chlorophyll a (chlorophyll a (Chl a), and chlorophyll b (chlorophyll b (Chl b). An R:B ratio of 6:4 was the ideal LED treatment for enhancing leaf length, root length, and peroxidase activity. Growth under R:B = 7:3 promoted the number of leaves, leaf width, number of roots, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities, chlorophyll synthesis, and the accumulation of Chl a and Chl b and led to the highest fluorescence parameters. With the exception of three physiological indicators, other indicators growth under R:B = 7:3 were better than under other tested ratios, implying that R:B = 7:3 represents the ideal LED treatment for improving G. jamesonii growth and photosynthetic activities under controlled conditions.

AB  - Nearly half of US lakes are impaired, primarily resulting from excessive nutrients and resultant eutrophication. The stability and recycling of sediment P results in differing degrees of internal P loading, which can alter lake water quality. In this study, we asked: (1) What are the underlying mechanisms controlling internal loading (net release) and retention of P? and (2) How does trophic state, specifically a hypereutrophic condition, affect internal P loading in agricultural reservoirs? We show that shifts in internal P loading are related to trophic-level indicators, including total P (TP) and chl-a concentrations. All study reservoirs were classified as hypereutrophic, and we grouped them as "less eutrophic" or "more eutrophic" based on TP and chl-a concentrations. In less eutrophic lakes, chemical variables (for example, oxygen) and sediment iron-bound P primarily controlled internal P loading under anaerobic conditions. However, in the more eutrophic lakes, biological variables, including phytoplankton biomass (as indicated by chl-a concentrations) and extracellular enzyme activity, drove internal P loading or reduced P retention under aerobic conditions. Biologically controlled aerobic internal P cycling was related to higher sediment organic P pools being broken down by enzymatic hydrolysis. Therefore, we theorize that as lakes become hypereutrophic, biological mechanisms begin to amplify internal P release by acting under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions, thus creating a perpetual cycle of internal P loading. Thus, the role of biological processes and oxygen availability should be considered in water quality management strategies aimed at alleviating eutrophication in lakes.

AB  - The dendrometer has been proposed as a sensitive plant water indicator based on stem growth. However, studies including dendrometers have been mainly focused on fruit trees and less attention has been paid to ornamental shrubs (small plants). In the study described here, stem dendrometers were used to ascertain whether there is any relationship between water status and dendrometric indices in potted ornamental shrubs (1 to 2 cm diameter). For this purpose, three Mediterranean shrubs (Pittosporum tobira, Callistemon thrums, and Rhamnus alaternus) were studied under water stress recovery conditions in winter, spring, and early summer. At the end of the experiment, an extreme water stress treatment, which resulted in plant death (August) was also studied. Stem diameter variations [maximum and minimum daily stem values (MXDS and MNDS, respectively), maximum daily shrinkage (MDS), and stem growth rate (SGR)], daily evapotranspiration (daily plant ET), and leaf water potential (Psi(leaf)) parameters were considered throughout the experiment. A regression analysis between dendrometric indices and daily plant ET showed that MXDS and MNDS were sensitive under water stress recovery conditions, especially in severe environmental conditions (spring and summer). The SGR in C. citrinus, the MDS in P. tobira, and both indices in R. alaternus were seen to be sensitive during the stress to death period. Although more studies are needed, the results confirm that the use of dendrometers in small plants may be useful to provide continuous and automated registers of the plant water status under different substrate water content and climatic conditions. However, the response of these indices may imply moderate water stress.

AB  - The metal component analysis of 20 spent automotive three-way catalysts (TWCs) in China was conducted to investigate the environmental risk during the recycling process. Compared to the reported values of platinum group metals (PGMs) contents, the average contents of PGMs in spent TWCs in China were relatively low (close to 0.1%). However, many toxic heavy metals (HMs) including Cr, Ni, Pb and As were determined in the spent TWCs and the total HMs contents of most TWCs were more than 1.0%. These HMs are from different sources including gasoline, lubricating oil, internal engine parts or TWCs itself. Most HMs in spent TWCs were quite stable under the weak acid condition according to leaching toxicity experiments. However, the result of environmental risk assessment shown the unacceptable risk level for all the HMs in TWCs at both leaching toxicity experimental condition or the extremely soluble condition (eg. with aqua regia in the hydrometallurgical recycling process). Therefore, the strict management measures should be taken in the recycling process of spent TWCs, especially for the Pb, As, Ni, Zn and Ba pollution control.

AB  - The environmental conditions of bottom sediments were estimated from the changes of the distribution and species composition of macrobenthos and meiobenthos in Hiuchi-Nada and Bingo-Nada five times from May 2002 to January 2003. The organic content of bottom sediments was as high as 20 years ago in eastern Hiuchi-Nada and Bingo-Nada. The dissolved oxygen Of bottom water in summer has fallen to 2.4 mg/L in part of eastern Hiuchi-Nada and Bingo-Nada. The acid volatile sulfide of the bottom sediments was low at all stations except one. The abundance of macrobenthos decreased in September, but the species diversity of macrobenthos was not related to the dissolved oxygen at bottom water of all stations. Sigambra tentaculata (Polychaeta) occurred at all stations. The nematode/copepod ratio, a pollution indicator, was low at less than 100 during the investigation period at almost all stations. It is suggested that the environment of the bottom sediment has improved in Hiuchi-Nada and Bingo-Nada in comparison with the bottom conditions of 20 years ago.

AB  - Redox potential (RP) is an easily measured soil characteristic which is affected by many of the chemical, physical and biological processes in the soil, but it has been largely ignored as a useful characteristics in arable soil. The influence of different sequences of crop rotation on RP and nitrification in the topsoil and the subsoil of a Luvic Chernozem were investigated during the vegetation season (April-July) of the years 1994-1999. RP was higher in the topsoil (0-30 cm) than in the subsoil (30-60 cm). In aerobic field conditions we found a significant difference in RP values between cropping sequences. The highest RP and lowest potential nitrification was under the cropping sequence of barley preceded by sugar beet and the lowest RP and highest potential nitrification was found under wheat after alfalfa. RP was negatively correlated with potential nitrification under all copping sequences in the topsoil. We assume that RP could be used as an important indicator of processes in the field, not only in anaerobic soil conditions but also in aerobic conditions. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Depositional environment highly affects the geochemical feature of sediments recording the information of paleoenvironment and its evolution. Geochemical data for Ordovician Wufeng Formation and Silurian Longmaxi Formation black shale deposition in the Sichuan Basin are presented and applied as proxies for deciphering paleoenvironment (detrital influx, redox conditions, paleoproductivity) and providing insight to paleoenvironmental conditions responsible for organic carbon accumulation. These data suggest that siliceous shale in the Wufeng and Longmaxi Formations reveals high TOC content, whereas silty, argillaceous, and limey shale display relatively low TOC contents. Major element and petrological evidences indicate that most of quartz in siliceous shales is biogenic origin (as shown by excess silica concentrations); therefore, Si is an unreliable indicator of detrital influx. The similar distribution of detrital influx proxies (Ti/Al, Ce, Hf, La, Nb Th and Zr) suggests a rather homogeneous coarse-grained detrital fraction supply. Redox proxies (Mo,Th/U, Ni/Co, V/Cr, and V/(V + Ni)) indicate that siliceous shales were deposited in a relatively dysoxic/anoxic environment, whereas the argillaceous, silty, and limey shales were deposited in a relatively oxic environment. Barium was solubilized under reducing conditions and cannot be applied confidently as a paleoproductivity indicator in high-TOC siliceous shales. Productivity proxies (Cu/Al, Ni/Al, excess Si) suggest that paleoproductivity was high during siliceous shales deposition, and weak during argillaceous and limey shales deposition. Our data suggests that high paleoproductivity and dysoxic/anoxic conditions controlled organic matter accumulation in Wufeng and Longmaxi shales. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Placebo analgesia is an indicator of how efficiently the brain translates psychological signals conveyed by a treatment procedure into pain relief. It has been demonstrated that functional connectivity between distributed brain regions predicts placebo analgesia in chronic back pain patients. Greater network efficiency in baseline brain networks may allow better information transfer and facilitate adaptive physiological responses to psychological aspects of treatment. Here, we theorized that topological network alignments in resting state scans predict psychologically conditioned analgesic responses to acupuncture treatment in chronic knee osteoarthritis pain patients (n = 45). Analgesia was induced by building positive expectations toward acupuncture treatment with verbal suggestion and heat pain conditioning on a test site of the arm. This procedure induced significantly more analgesia after sham or real acupuncture on the test site than in a control site. The psychologically conditioned analgesia was invariant to sham versus real treatment. Efficiency of information transfer within local networks calculated with graph-theoretic measures (local efficiency and clustering coefficients) significantly predicted conditioned analgesia. Clustering coefficients in regions associated with memory, motivation, and pain modulation were closely involved in predicting analgesia. Moreover, women showed higher clustering coefficients and marginally greater pain reduction than men. Overall, analgesic response to placebo cues can be predicted from a priori resting state data by observing local network topology. Such low-cost synchronizations may represent preparatory resources that facilitate subsequent performance of brain circuits in responding to adaptive environmental cues. This suggests a potential utility of network measures in predicting placebo response for clinical use.

AB  - The four stratigraphic units of the late Pleistocene (MIS 3) clay-rich deposit of La Chauverie (Charente, SW France) have been characterized for mineral composition. The lower part of this 75 cm-thick karst deposit preserves a mammal fauna typical of temperate climate, followed by an assemblage pointing to a colder phase. The clay fraction of both horizons mostly results from mineral transformations of the clays contained in the sediments of the Paleogene formation surrounding the cave. Because clay mineral properties and changes intimately depend on the physico-chemical conditions and reaction kinetics prevailing at a given time in the soils, they are highly temperature-related. Notably, changes are rapid under temperate conditions, but slow in tundra-like cold contexts. As shown by the altered inherited mica-illite, as well as by the increase of crystallinity of kaolinite particles, at La Chauverie these transformations were marked in the stratigraphically lower part of the deposit formed under temperate conditions. Conversely, as reflected by the reduction of the kaolinite/smectite ratio characterizing the sediments of the upper horizon, the pedological evolution was limited during the subsequent cold phase. Here, both illite/smectite and kaolinite/smectite mixed layers become smectite-richer than their equivalent in the Paleogene. The parallelism between paleontological evidence and mineral signature in recording a relatively rapid (millennial-scale) shift towards colder conditions suggests that clay mineral assemblages from cave deposits can be used to assess paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental dynamics at local scale. Nonetheless, future research should test this potential tool in more appropriate, thicker deposits investigated using other independent paleobiological and geochemical indicators.

AB  - The Late Cretaceous La Luna Formation is the main hydrocarbon source-rock formation in Venezuela. In the Lake Maracaibo area, the formation shows a steep maturation gradient affecting sedimentary organic matter (OM) and clay minerals, related to local burial history and thrusting events. The influence of the gradient is examined through geochemical (organic and inorganic) and mineralogical investigations carried out on samples from five cored boreholes in the Maracaibo Basin. The analytical procedure comprises Rock Eval pyrolysis, vitrinite reflectance measurement, palynofacies observation, major- and trace-element content determination, performed on bulk-rock samples or after a sequential leach protocol (DOP calculation) and the examination and analysis of clay-mineral assemblages.
   The maturation gradient seems to have had no effect upon the distribution of the trace elements referred to as proxy indicators for palaeodepositional conditions of OM-rich sediments (Ba, P, V, Mo, Ni, Co, Cu, Cd, Cr and Mn). Consequently, trace elements appear to be reliable palaeoenvironmental markers. They indicate that, during the La Luna Fm. deposition, the water column must have had variable conditions, with high primary production near the surface and the correlative development of euxinic conditions at the bottom. This provides further arguments for an upwelling system affecting the northern platform of South America during Late Cretaceous time. The relative scarcity of reactive iron in the depositional environment must have taken an active part in a process involving sulphur and acting on the environmental conditions as well as on OM (vulcanisation). This process favours aliphatic OM storage and may be relevant for many other OM-rich facies or hydrocarbon source rocks.

AB  - Aluminum-phosphate-sulfate (APS) minerals, formed during early diagenesis in relation to acid meteoric waters, are the main host of Sr and S in the Early-Middle Triassic continental sandstones of the Iberian Ranges (east of the Iberian Peninsula). The sources of these elements and the effects of paleoenvironmetal changes on these sources and on the formation of APS minerals during Early-Middle Triassic tunes, were established on the basis of Sr and S isotopic analyses.
   The S and Sr data (delta S-34 \Lon := +11 to +14%0 and Sr-87/Sr-86 = 0.7099-0.7247, respectively) can be interpreted as resulting from mixing of different sources. Strontium was sourced from the dissolution of pre-existing minerals like K-feldspar and clay minerals inherited from the source areas, causing high radiogenic values. However, the isotopic signal must also be influenced by other sources, such as marine or volcanic aerosol that decreased the total Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios. Marine and volcanic aerosols were also sources of sulfur, but the delta S-34 was lowered by dissolution of pre-existing sulfides, mainly pyrite. Pyrite dissolution and volcanic aerosols would also trigger the acid conditions required for the precipitation of APS minerals.
   APS minerals in the study area are found mainly in the Canizar Formation (Olenekian?-Aegian), which has the lowest Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios. The lower abundance of APS minerals in the Eslida Formation (Aegian-Pelsonian) may indicate change in the acidity of pore water towards more alkaline conditions, while the increased Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios imply decreased Sr input from volcanic activity and/or marine aerosol inputs during Anisian times. Therefore, the decrease in abundance of APS minerals from the Early to Middle Triassic and the variations in the sources of Sr and S are indicative of changes in paleoenvironmental conditions during the beginning of the Triassic Period.
   These changes from acid to more alkaline conditions are also coincident with the first appearance of carbonate paleosols, trace fossils, and plant fossils in the upper part of the Canizar Formation (and more in the overlying Eslida Formation) and mark the beginning of biotic recovery in this area. The presence of APS minerals in other European basins of the Western Tethys (such as the German Basin, the Paris Basin and the southeastern France and Sardinia basins) could thus also indicate that unfavorable environmental conditions caused delay in biotic recovery in those areas. In general, the presence of APS minerals may be used as an indicator of arid, acidic conditions unfavorable to biotic colonization.

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is an indicator of developmental instability referred to random deviations from mean asymmetry. That average asymmetry is the directional asymmetry (DA), which, in the particular case of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), corresponds to a right thoracic and left lumbar curves. Investigating the presence of FA and DA in AIS has never been done, and it is a key element of the pathophysiology of the scoliotic condition. Thirty-six X-rays of patients with AIS were digitized and analysed using Geometric Morphometric analyses to test for both statistical effects. The individual FA score for each patient was calculated using Procrustes ANOVA and a methodology based on the components of shape was used to estimate the individual DA score. DA is a stronger effect than FA (2.12 to 1), as it has been found in other clinical conditions. The individual DA score, with an effect size of 0.58, is a better predictor of the Cobb angle than FA score. The methodology presented in this paper to estimate DA score is a valid approach in the study of asymmetries in AIS. FA should be correlated in future studies with environmental covariates to serve as a variable in the medical prognosis, while DA will serve as a good predictor of the Cobb angle during the course of the condition, avoiding the abuse of X-rays. This potential use of DA should be tested on 3D shape due to the three-dimensional clinical presentation of AIS.

AB  - Globally, drought constitutes a serious threat to food and water security. The complexity and multivariate nature of drought challenges its assessment, especially at local scales. The study aimed to assess spatiotemporal patterns of crop condition and drought impact at the spatial scale of field management units with a combined use of time-series from optical (Landsat, MODIS, Sentinel-2) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) (Sentinel 1) data. Several indicators were derived such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), Land Surface Temperature (LST), Tasseled cap indices and Sentinel-1 based backscattering intensity and relative surface moisture. We used logistic regression to evaluate the drought-induced variability of remotely sensed parameters estimated for different phases of crop growth. The parameters with the highest prediction rate were further used to estimate thresholds for drought/non-drought classification. The models were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and validated with in-situ data. The results revealed that not all remotely sensed variables respond in the same manner to drought conditions. Growing season maximum NDVI and NDMI (70-75%) and SAR derived metrics (60%) reflect specifically the impact of agricultural drought. These metrics also depict stress affected areas with a larger spatial extent. LST was a useful indicator of crop condition especially for maize and sunflower with prediction rates of 86% and 71%, respectively. The developed approach can be further used to assess crop condition and to support decision-making in areas which are more susceptible and vulnerable to drought.

AB  - The US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) initiated planning in 2007 and conducted field work in 2011 for the first National Wetland Condition Assessment (NWCA) as part of the National Aquatic Resource Surveys (NARS). It complements the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) National Wetland Status and Trends (S&T) program that estimates wetland acres nationally. The NWCA used a stratified, unequal probability survey design based on wetland information from S&T plots to select 900 sites for the conterminous 48 states. Based on site evaluation information, the NWCA estimates that there are 94.9 (+/- 6.20) million acres of wetlands in the NWCA target wetland population (reported in acres to be consistent with S&T). Not all of the estimated target population acres could be sampled due to accessibility and field issues. Based on the sites that could be sampled, the sampled population for the NWCA is estimated to be 62.2 (+/- 5.28) million acres of wetland area. Landowner denial for access was the main reason (24.7%+/- 3.5%) for the sampled population being smaller than the target population, and physical inaccessibility was the second reason (6.8%+/- 2.1%). The NWCA 2011 survey design was successful in enabling a national survey for wetland condition to be conducted and coordinated with the USFWS S&T survey of wetland extent. The NWCA 2016 survey design has been modified to address sample frame issues resulting from the difference in S&T focusing only on national estimates and NWCA focusing on national and regional estimates.

AB  - An efficient urban environmental design considers appropriate thermal comfort condition, shaded space, and activity intensity. Physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) and visible sky, i.e., the sky view factor (SVF), are usually used as indicators to determine the outdoor thermal comfort and amount of shaded space, respectively. The activity intensity in urban parks, which is dependent on culture and micrometeorological conditions, was represented inappropriately by attendance density in Taiwan. To optimize the park design and improve the park utilization rate in Taiwan, several environmental factors such as sound pressure levels and numbers of park visitors were measured, and PET values and SVF values were calculated from primary micrometeorological data such as wind speed and globe temperature. This study proposed equivalent continuous sound pressure level (Leq) as a novel indicator to represent park activity intensity and investigated the correlation between Leq and SVF at different PET values. Leq was more appropriate than was attendance density in representing the park activity intensity in Taiwan. In addition, Leq was highly negatively correlated with SVF when visitors felt that the outdoor thermal comfort condition was hot or very hot. In other words, a lower degree of shading in the park resulted in lower activity intensity. Park visitors tended to engage in activities in the shaded regions because of more favorable thermal comfort conditions (i.e., neutral PET). The established quantitative relationships among Leq, PET, and SVF can serve as a reference for park planning.

AB  - Changes in chlorophyll a (chl a), leaf area, and leaf length need to be considered when developing ecological assessments of mangrove forests where distinct seasons occur. The purpose of this study was to assess such changes between the dry and rainy seasons in a variety of mangrove classes. Six different classes were examined, consisting of 3 species (white mangrove Laguncularia racemosa, red mangrove Rhizophora mangle, and black mangrove Avicennia germinans) that were either healthy or in poor condition. In total, 360 leaf samples were taken from the upper and lower canopy for chl a content. Additionally, leaf area index (LAI) was recorded at the same locations. For all the poor-condition classes, we observed an increase in the chl a content during the rainy season in both the upper and lower canopies. Moreover, dwarf black mangrove was the only poor-condition class which did not show an increase in leaf length during the rainy season. The healthy white mangrove showed no seasonal difference in chl a in the upper canopy, but the lower canopy did have higher chl a content during the dry season as well as a lower LAI. The healthy red mangrove also did not show any seasonal difference in chl a content, but the upper canopy had a higher chl a content. For the healthy black mangrove, no seasonal differences were found in chl a content, LAI, or leaf morphology in both upper and lower canopies. Consequently, for future endeavors we recommend that seasonal changes in the upper canopy be considered, especially when examining stands in poor condition.

AB  - The dynamics of processes affecting the quality of stormwater removed through drainage systems are highly complicated. Relatively little information is available on predicting the impact of catchment characteristics and weather conditions on stormwater heavy metal (HM). This paper reports research results concerning the concentrations of selected HM (Ni, Cu, Cr, Zn, Pb and Cd) in stormwater removed through drainage system from three catchments located in the city of Kielce, Poland. Statistical models for predicting concentrations of HM in stormwater were developed based on measurement results, with the use of artificial neural network (ANN) method (multi-layer perceptron). Analyses conducted for the study demonstrated that it is possible to use simple variables to characterise catchment and weather conditions. Simulation results showed that for Ni, Cu, Cr, Zn and Pb, the selected independent variables ensure satisfactory predictive capacities of the models (R-2 > 0.78). The models offer considerable application potential in the area of development plans, and they also account for environmental aspects as stormwater and snowmelt water quality affects receiving waters.

AB  - In this contribution we outline the outstanding attributes and inferred depositional controls for dark mudstones of the Alicia Formation (similar to 570 Ma) in order to reveal the intrinsic characteristics of unknown Ediacaran marine depositional conditions into the basin. The Alicia Formation represents a continuous and undeformed similar to 150 m thick sequence in which nine siliciclastic lithofacies were accumulated controlled by the Clymene sea conditions. Sedimentary facies analysis of their fine-grained rocks reveals a deposition across two depositional sequences. The basal portion is described as formed in an upper offshore while the upper portion represents a lower shoreface environment. This study combines the stratigraphic characterization with detailed facies descriptions, petrography, XRD, SEM and geochemistry analyses. This succession was deposited under relatively constant marine environmental conditions with relative sea level variations manifested between the fair-weather and storm wave bases. Bottom-water conditions during its sedimentation show fluctuations in the geochemical indicators as redox-sensitives (U, Mo, V), terrigenous supply (Si, Al, Zr, Th), carbonate productivity (CaO) and organic productivity (Cu, Ni, P/Al). This research represents an exceptional example of preserved fine-grained Ediacaran tidal shelf deposits in the Tandilia Basin. The data provide evidence for the middle Ediacaran anoxia, which post-dates a previous oceanic oxygenation event (EOO, 580 Ma) and pre-dates the white sea assemblage radiation (560 Ma) probably developed in a well oxygenated sea. Within the SW Gondwana scenario, our findings may support a link between the depositional setting during most severe redox changes.

AB  - Functional traits respond to environmental drivers, hence evaluating trait-environment relationships across spatial environmental gradients can help to understand how multiple drivers influence plant communities. Global-change drivers such as changes in atmospheric nitrogen deposition occur worldwide, but affect community trait distributions at the local scale, where resources (e.g. light availability) and conditions (e.g. soil pH) also influence plant communities. We investigate how multiple environmental drivers affect community trait responses related to resource acquisition (plant height, specific leaf area (SLA), woodiness, and mycorrhizal status) and regeneration (seed mass, lateral spread) of European temperate deciduous forest understoreys. We sampled understorey communities and derived trait responses across spatial gradients of global-change drivers (temperature, precipitation, nitrogen deposition, and past land use), while integrating in-situ plot measurements on resources and conditions (soil type, Olsen phosphorus (P), Ellenberg soil moisture, light, litter mass, and litter quality). Among the global-change drivers, mean annual temperature strongly influenced traits related to resource acquisition. Higher temperatures were associated with taller understoreys producing leaves with lower SLA, and a higher proportional cover of woody and obligate mycorrhizal (OM) species. Communities in plots with higher Ellenberg soil moisture content had smaller seeds and lower proportional cover of woody and OM species. Finally, plots with thicker litter layers hosted taller understoreys with larger seeds and a higher proportional cover of OM species. Our findings suggest potential community shifts in temperate forest understoreys with global warming, and highlight the importance of local resources and conditions as well as global-change drivers for community trait variation.

AB  - Invertebrate community structure in wetlands is determined by a complex suite of environmental factors and biotic interactions. Hydrology (i.e. hydroperiod and water permanence) is considered the paramount environmental control of freshwater wetlands, with temporary drying being a major constraint on biota. However, factors controlling invertebrate assemblages in saline-alkaline wetlands remain poorly investigated. Moreover, most previous studies analyzing environmental filtering on wetland invertebrates have focused on local scales, and cross-regional studies are rare. In this study, the snail fauna was used to evaluate environmental filtering across saline-alkaline intermittently inundated and perennially inundated marshes in Songnen Plain and freshwater intermittently inundated and perennially inundated marshes in Sanjiang Plain, of Northeastern China. Multivariate analyses showed snail assemblages were concurrently being influenced by saline conditions (Sanjiang, for freshwater versus Songnen, for saline), and hydrologic conditions (intermittently inundated wetlands versus perennially inundated wetlands in Songnen and Sanjiang). Snail abundance and richness were significantly higher in freshwater wetlands of the Sanjiang Plain than in saline-alkaline wetlands of the Songnen Plain. Snail abundance of perennially inundated wetlands was higher than intermittently inundated wetlands in Sanjiang Plain, as predicted, but the reverse was true in Songnen Plain wetlands, contrary to prediction. Across Northeastern China, salinity was a more important control on snail assemblages than hydroperiod, a pattern previously unreported, and salinity mediated the impacts of hydroperiod. In regions where saline wetlands occur, the unique relationships between saline conditions and hydroperiod need to be considered for the assessment and conservation of threatened wetland resources.

AB  - 1.  Generation time, diapause phenology and cold tolerance of the flesh fly, Sarcophaga bullata, were examined under confined natural conditions in central Ohio.  In this locality, the fly can complete a maximum of four generations annually.
   2.  Very few pupae entered diapause in the first and second generations (May to July in 1988).  In the third generation (August) 37% of the pupae entered an overwintering diapause, as did all pupae from the fourth generation (September).
   3.  The adult eclosion date in the spring and annual generation time can be predicted accurately from degree day data.
   4.  Cold tolerance of the field-overwintering portion of the population was high.  After 30 days under field conditions, diapausing pupae readily survived a 7-day exposure to -17-degrees-C.  Glycerol appears to be the major cryoprotectant in S.bullata, and glycerol concentrations in the field population (95-142 mM) remained high throughout the winter.
   5.  In contrast, diapausing flies reared under laboratory conditions (20-degrees-C, 12:12 LD) were less cold tolerant, and glycerol concentrations were lower (6.9-21.2 mM).  Field conditions thus promote the acquisition of high levels of cold tolerance, presumably as a consequence of the accumulation of higher concentrations of glycerol.
   6.  In spite of differences in the cold tolerance of laboratory and field flies, the supercooling points of the two groups of flies were nearly the same, thus implying that the supercooling point is not a good indicator of cold tolerance.

AB  - Over the past fifty years, considerable research in waste stabilization pond operation has led to the development of a number of models used to describe the hydraulic regime and predict treatment efficiency. Models range in complexity from plug or completely mixed simplifications to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models which are able to predict flow hydraulics at a local level. Information about the exit age of pond effluent can be used to estimate pollutant decay. However, a mechanistic approach to understanding pond operation highlights the importance of knowing both the time and spatial history of pond effluent. A CFD model of a large pond system was constructed to demonstrate various hydraulic scenarios under different boundary conditions. Two scenarios were compared to visually demonstrate the effects of differing hydraulic conditions. Typical mechanistic models were applied to each condition to quantify biological differences. This simple example indicates that integrating biological and localised flow models will lead to a more holistic understanding of pond operation and treatment efficiency.

AB  - Heavy metals may adversely affect health in marine organisms. As top predators, sharks may be especially vulnerable to exposure over long lifespans. Here we evaluate plasma levels of 14 heavy metals and 12 trace elements in white sharks, Carcharodon carcharias, in South Africa to determine whether they are related to sex, body size, and/or body condition and other health parameters. High levels of mercury and arsenic were found in shark blood at levels considered toxic in other vertebrates. Heavy metal concentrations were not related to body size or sex. Metal concentrations were not related to body condition with exception of copper, which was positively correlated. Protective effects of elements such as selenium, zinc, and iron were not detected. No negative effects on health parameters, such as total leukocytes or granulocyte to lymphocyte ratios were observed. Results suggest that sharks may have protective mechanisms that mitigate harmful effects of heavy metal exposure, providing new opportunities for future studies.

AB  - Biogenic silica has been considered as a potential feedstock for producing a variety of silicon-containing products. A new synthesis pathway of tetraethyl orthosilicate from silica that is contained in rice hull ash has been recently proposed. Requiring only one-step processing, it is expected to offer advantages over conventional routes which are derived from silicon metal. This study aims to investigate the optimal synthesis conditions for which this new technology can sustainably replace the conventional method. Experiments employing different reaction conditions are performed to provide the necessary information for a conceptual process design and an economic and environmental viability evaluation. The results obtained by comparison with a selected conventional process show that, under the optimal synthesis conditions, the new process can decrease the production cost and markedly reduce the high greenhouse gas emissions. The competitiveness of the new process is further examined with a sensitivity analysis considering fluctuations in key feedstock and utility prices and alternative sources of electricity supplied to the conventional process. The new synthesis technology shows high potential as a sustainable alternative to the conventional one.

AB  - 1. A survey was carried out to assess some welfare indicators in broilers reared by the largest poultry companies in Italy, to determine whether they accord with European proposal COM (2005) 221 final.
   2. Productive traits, carcase injuries and foot dermatitis were recorded from 279 640 broiler chickens reared in winter and in summer in 5 farms representative of the Italian production system.
   3. The densities currently used in Italy are in accordance with the European proposal, which recommends that broilers are kept at a density lower than 30 to 32 kg live weight/m(2) and not exceeding 38 to 40 kg live weight/m2.
   4. Season markedly influenced broiler welfare status, with the worst score collected in winter cycles, when the recommended limit of 50 points for foot pad dermatitis was exceeded.
   5. Stocking density is not a straightforward indicator for bird welfare; there was no relationship between stocking density and lesion incidence or mortality rate.
   6. The control of environmental conditions, particularly litter quality, appears to be a key issue for broiler welfare.

AB  - Bacteria growing in biofilms experience gradients of environmental conditions, including varying levels of nutrients and oxygen. Therefore, bacteria within biofilms may enter distinct physiological states, depending on the surrounding conditions. In this study, rpoS expression and RpoS levels were measured as indicators of stationary phase growth within thick continuously-red Pseudimonas aeruginosa biofilms. The level of rpoS expression in a 3-day-old biofilm was found to be three-fold higher than the average expression in stationary phase planktonic culture. RpoS levels in biofilms, indicated by immunoblot analysis, were similar to levels in stationary phase planktonic cultures. In planktonic cultures, oxygen limitation did not lead to increased lec els of RpoS, suggesting that oxygen limitation was not the environmental signal causing increased expression of rpoS. These results suggest that bacteria within P. aeruginosa biofilms may exhibit stationary phase characteristics even when cultured in flow conditions that continually replenish nutrients.

AB  - The purpose of the article is to evaluate the effectiveness of managing the educational markets in the countries of the world that have the highest global competitiveness in the sphere of education, to determine and compare the factors of development of universities in the conditions of Industry 4.0 in these countries, and to develop recommendations for increasing the effectiveness of managing the educational market. For evaluating the effectiveness of managing the educational market, the authors' method is used, which is based on the classical formula of measuring effectiveness as a ratio of results and costs. For evaluating the susceptibility of the indicators of development of universities in the conditions of Industry 4.0 to the influence of various factors, the authors use the method of correlation analysis and the method of calculation of direct average. The information and analytical basis of the research includes the analytical and rating materials of CWUR, Legatum Institute, Online learning consortium, QS, Times Higher Education (THE) and World Bank for 2019. It is substantiated that quality is the basis of effective management of the educational market and is a goal of development of universities in the conditions of Industry 4.0. Growth of the volume of state financing of education and improvement of the macro-economic environment will allow achieveing internationalization of education, but they have small influence on its results. Quality of education determines the effectiveness of the national market of education, but is hardly managed at the level of macro-economy.

AB  - We examined a sediment record from Lake Hiidenvesi in southern Finland using paleolimnological methods to trace its limnoecological history. In our record, beginning from the 1940s, chironomid (Diptera) assemblages shifted from typical boreal taxa towards mesotrophic community assemblages at similar to 1960-1980 CE being finally replaced by eutrophic taxa from the 1990s onward. The diatom (Bacillariophyceae) assemblages reflected relatively nutrient rich conditions throughout the record showing a further increase in eutrophic taxa from the 1970s onward. A chironomid-based reconstruction of late-winter hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions suggested anoxic conditions already in the 1950s, probably reflecting increased inlake production due to allochthonous nutrient inputs and related increase in biological oxygen consumption. However, the reconstruction also indicated large variability in long-term oxygen conditions that appear typical for the basin. With regard to nutrient status, chironomid- and diatom-based reconstructions of total phosphorus (TP) showed a similar trend throughout the record, although, chironomids indicated a more straightforward eutrophication process in the benthic habitat and seemed to reflect the intensified human activities in the catchment more strongly than diatoms. The DO and TP reconstructions were mostly similar in trends compared to the measured data available since the 1970s/1980s. However, the increase in TP during the most recent years in both reconstructions was not visible in the monitored data. The results of our multiproxy study emphasize the significance of including both epilimnetic and hypolimnetic systems in water quality assessments and provide important long-term limnoecological information that will be useful in the future when setting targets for restoration.

AB  - Social data from census and household surveys provide key information for monitoring the status of populations, but the data utility can be limited by temporal gaps between surveys. Recent studies have pointed to the potential for remotely sensed satellite sensor data to be used as proxies for social data. Such an approach could provide valuable information for the monitoring of populations between enumeration periods. Field observations in Assam, north-east India suggested that socioeconomic conditions could be related to patterns in the type and abundance of local land cover dynamics prompting the development of a more formal approach. This research tested if environmental data derived from remotely sensed satellite sensor data could be used to predict a socioeconomic outcome using a generalised autoregressive error (GAR(err)) model. The proportion of female literacy from the 2001 Indian National Census was used as an indicator of socioeconomic conditions. A significant positive correlation was found with woodland and a significant negative correlation with winter cropland (i.e., additional cropping beyond the normal cropping season). The dependence of female literacy on distance to nearest road was very small. The GAR(err) model reduced residual spatial autocorrelation and revealed that the logistic regression model over-estimated the significance of the explanatory covariates. The results are promising, while also revealing the complexities of population-environment interactions in rural, developing world contexts. Further research should explore the prediction of socioeconomic conditions using fine spatial resolution satellite sensor data and methods that can account for such complexities.

AB  - Females across many taxa commonly use multiple or complex traits to choose mates. However, the functional significance of multiple or complex signals remains controversial and largely unknown. Different elements of multiple or complex signals may convey independent pieces of information about different aspects of a prospective mate (the "multiple messages" hypothesis). Alternatively, multiple or complex signals could provide redundant information about the same aspect of a prospective mate (the "redundant" or "back-up" signal hypothesis). We investigated these alternatives using spadefoot toads, Scaphiopus couchii. Spadefoot toads primarily use calls to attract their mates, but males also exhibit sexually dimorphic coloration. We investigated whether male coloration is indicative of male size, condition, or infection status by a socially transmitted monogenean flatworm. We found that male coloration and dorsal patterning predicts male size and condition but not infection status. Moreover, when we presented females with a choice between a bright male model and a dark male model, we found that females preferred the bright model. Because aspects of males' calls are also associated with male size and condition, we conclude that coloration is a potentially redundant indicator of male phenotype. We suggest that coloration could enhance mate choice in conjunction with male calling behavior by providing females with a long distance cue that could enable them to identify prospective mates in a noisy chorus environment where the discrimination of individual calls is often difficult. Generally, such redundant signals may facilitate mate choice by enhancing the quality and accuracy of information females receive regarding prospective mates.

AB  - Regeneration rates of coral lesions reflect the ability of colonies to repair damage and therefore can be useful indicators of coral health and environmental conditions. We quantified regeneration rates of boulder corals Montastraea spp. at four, 6 m deep patch reefs within Biscayne National Park (BNP) and the upper Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS), and along a 3 to 18 m depth transect in FKNMS. Coral lesions (approx. 2 cm(2)) created during sampling for cellular-diagnostic analysis were monitored quarterly in 2001 and 2002, and in February 2003. Regeneration was a dynamic process, continuing longer than previously reported (> 300 d after lesion formation). Geographic location was the strongest factor affecting regeneration rate at our study sites. Lesion regeneration differed significantly among 6 m deep sites; sites offshore from John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park (Algae Reef and White Banks) consistently had the highest regeneration rates, with colonies exhibiting exponential declines in lesion size and a high percentage of completely healed lesions. Along the depth gradient, corals at the 3 m site regenerated significantly faster than corals at 6, 9, and 18 m. These results suggest that corals sampled at FKNMS 6, 9 and 18 m sites and BNP were in poor physiological condition or were exposed to suboptimal environmental conditions, as evidenced by highly variable and overall low regeneration rates, a low percentage of healed lesions, and a high occurrence of breakage or Type II lesions (lesions that increased in size by merging with areas of denuded tissue on the colony).

AB  - The potential for iron (hydr)oxides to remove dissolved hydrogen sulphide from seawater has been examined under flow-through conditions. Ferrihydrite (a hydrous iron (III) oxide) was stabilised by precipitation onto zeolite pellets, and rates of sulphide removal were determined under laboratory conditions at pH 8.5. Sulphide removal kinetics were dependent on the initial sulphide concentration, substrate mass and flow rate. The experimental data suggest that these parameters can be optimised to result in the rapid and effective removal of hydrogen sulphide. The results from laboratory experiments compared favourably with sulphide removal kinetics determined in a series of experiments performed online in a recirculating mariculture production system. However, the presence in solution of ligands such as phosphate may also significantly affect reaction rates; a 50% reduction in sulphide removal rate for substrate removed from an online system was partly attributed to phosphate adsorption. The formation of a more crystalline, less reactive iron (hydr)oxide in recharged substrate was the likely result of FeS oxidation, which may also have contributed to the observed reduction in sulphide removal rates. Ferrihydrite-coated zeolite would appear to provide an efficient, low-cost method for sulphide removal, which is particularly suited to relatively small-scale aqueous flow-through systems. The reaction of iron (hydr)oxides with dissolved sulphide is also accompanied by a distinct colour change due to the formation of black FeS(s) which, under appropriate conditions, may be used as a rapid indicator of sulphidic conditions.

AB  - Metridium senile, the fluffy (or plumose) sea anemone, is a circumboreal species adapted to the cold northern oceans. We performed a 40-day experiment on 108 individuals of M. senile collected from the Akkeshi-ko estuary in Japan to test their survivability in higher temperatures and their upper and lower salinity survivability limits. In addition to using survivorship to determine if there is a smaller tolerance range than the extreme limits of temperature and salinity, we used asexual reproduction via pedal laceration as an indicator of the most favorable environmental conditions for M. senile. The resulting limitations are used to both broaden our understanding of the biology of M. senile and to assess potential effects of changing oceanic conditions, since M. senile is unable to survive in warm water temperatures or in extreme salinities. Our results support the use of pedal laceration by M. senile as a way to quickly colonize an area with favorable environmental conditions in order to preserve a well-adapted phenotype.

AB  - We revisited 44 remnants of historically species-rich meadows in two regions in Estonia in order to evaluate their importance in harbouring meadow species. We used Ellenberg's indicator values (EIV), diversity and evenness indices and species functional traits (CSR strategy, height, clonal mobility, ramet life span) to analyse changes in vegetation and habitat conditions. Habitat loss resulted in similar amount of loss of both meadow specialists and generalists. Only meadow specialists were negatively affected by cessation of management in meadows unmown for more than 10 years in South Estonia. The largest change was an increase in Ellenberg's indicator value (EIV) of nutrients. We found a significant decline in typical meadow species (e.g. Briza media, Primula farinosa) and an increase in strong competitors. Species in the remnant meadows tended to have increased clonal mobility and shortened ramet life span, indicating fertile habitats. The ecological conditions became unfavourable for meadow species which prefer high illumination and unfertile conditions. The remnant meadows have largely lost the floristic diversity of the original nutrient-poor or moist species-rich meadows.

AB  - Despite the fact that livestock animals like companion pets have adapted through domestication to a life with human beings, they have the same demands on their environment as their feral conspecifics. Therefore, animal husbandry means keeping animals under conditions which are appropriate to the respective species. Livestock are known to respond to non-appropriate surroundings in ways which lead to serious physiological and behavioural problems. If attempts to adapt fail, abnormal behaviour patterns may result. Compulsive disorders or stereotypies often results from repeated or continued sub-optimal environmental conditions that prevent animals from exercising highly motivated behaviour. An animal's behaviour is the result of multifaceted interactions: endogenous and exogenous stimuli, past and present features of the environment, phylogenesis and behavioural ontogeny. It is difficult to assess the well-being of animals under current husbandry conditions simply by using compulsive disorders and stereotypes as welfare indicators. Consequently, it is not always possible to decrease the occurrence of abnormal behaviours and improve the well-being of an animal merely by optimising aspects of the given environment afterwards.

AB  - Chrysophyte resting stages (cysts) were analysed in a sediment core from Langsee, a small lake in the Carinthian lowland (Austria) with climate-driven meromixis, spanning the Late Glacial Interstadial (= Greenland Interstadial 1, ca. 14.7 to 12.7 ky BP). Of the 32 cyst types occurring at least once with a minimum of > 1%, six were related to chrysophyte taxa so far. Nine cyst types were described as new to science. Aiming to define ecological preferences, we compared the cyst stratigraphy with pollen and diatom stratigraphies, diatom-inferred total phosphorus (Di-TP) and diatom-inferred mean summer epilimnetic water temperatures (Di-SEWT). Two significant cyst zones corresponded with the two main pollen zones (Betula followed by Pinus), and a change from meso-eutrophic (dominance of Cyclotella ocellata) to oligotrophic conditions (C. comensis dominance). Secondary changes in cyst assemblages may have been triggered by climate fluctuations. In sum, we classified three groups of cyst types: (1) cysts related to meso-eutrophic conditions; (2) cysts related to oligotrophic conditions and/or cold water; (3) cysts with unknown ecological preferences.

KW  - GRASSES
AB  - Chinese leymus (Leymus chinensis (Trin.) Tzvel.) is an important perennial grass widely distributed in Eastern Asia and can be one of the best pasture grass species for the rangeland industry in northern China. However, there is no information on the effect of storage conditions on seed germination and seedling growth, which are critical for grassland establishment. Seeds of Chinese leymus from 4 distinct biotypes were stored in sealed plastic bags at room (5-28 degrees C) or cold (4 degrees C) conditions. Seed germination and seedling growth were measured at 1-year-storage interval for 8 years. The results showed that the seeds of various biotypes had similar response to storage, although they displayed significantly different maximum of germination and seedling length. High temperature was helpful to break the dormancy, while low temperature facilitated to maintain high germination. At both storage environments, seedling length decreased more dramatically than seed germination. Seedling growth proved to be a good indicator for seed quality following long period of storage, in addition to seed germinability. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis showed that genetic diversity existed among the 4 biotypes, but no fragment profiles variation was detected after storage.

AB  - An attempt for the spectroscopic identification of oxygenated compounds produced in combustion processes under different environmental conditions is reported in this paper. A deeper knowledge about presence and evolution of such species in dependence of the operating conditions of practical burner represents a fundamental hint to the objective of an advancement of the control of combustion process and reduction of pollutant emissions. This paper mainly focuses on species characterized by the presence of carbonyl functionality since aldehydes, ketones and diketones are among the principal intermediate species and products of hydrocarbon oxidation. They are by themselves to be considered atmospheric pollutants and are also indicators of actual pathways followed during the chemical reactions occurring in the combustion process. For these reasons they are most suitable for the exploitation of the above indicated objectives.
   In this paper, a classification of spectroscopic features and markers of these classes of carbonyl compounds is presented on the basis of both literature and spectra collected from sample species. This interpretative scheme is then used for the attribution of fluorescence signals collected from a tetradecane spray in different environmental conditions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Farm animals raised under free-range (FR) systems are assumed to have improved welfare and higher-quality products that are better to eat than intensively reared animals. However, the modulations are limited in scientific investigations. In this study, we compared 2 rearing systems (FR and cage) and their effects on chickens, including production performance, product quality, body condition, physiological indicators, and gene expression. By using a match-mismatch design in which each treatment was transferred to the other treatment during the last period of the experiment, we aimed to understand the influence of current and former rearing conditions and the ability of individuals to adapt to the current environment. The results indicated that the FR system led to better chicken welfare (e.g., gait score, feather condition, and physiological indicators, P < 0.05) and contributed to higher product quality (P < 0.05), although it resulted in poorer production performance (P < 0.05) and foot pad condition (P < 0.05) than that of the cage rearing system. Additionally, the FR system triggered a series of inner changes and genetic responses in chickens, such as the upregulation of calcium and GnRH signaling, actin and cytoskeleton regulations, immune functions, and developmental processes, and the downregulation of pathological regulations (q-value < 0.05 for all gene ontology terms and P < 0.05 for all Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways). In conclusion, rearing systems alter chicken gene expression patterns, which provide a genetic basis for the adaptability to rearing environments and ultimately affects chicken welfare and products.

AB  - We studied the population dynamics of free-living ticks in the Tamaulipan Biotic Province in south Texas from March, 2005 to November, 2008. We collected 70,873 ticks using carbon dioxide traps. Amblyomma cajennense represented 93.6% of the ticks identified. A. cajennense is distributed from northern Argentina to south Texas in the Tamaulipan Biotic Province. Emergence of larval A. cajennense ticks was observed two to five weeks after significant rain events (p<0.0001) and had a strong negative correlation with temperature (p<0.0001). More larvae were observed under humid conditions (p<0.05). Fewer larvae were observed during windy and warmer conditions (p<0.05). This observation indicates high sensitivity of larvae to desiccating conditions. Peaks in nymphal activity were observed after peaks of larval emergence. Activity of nymphs was negatively correlated with temperature (p<0.05). Adult activity was negatively correlated with humidity (p<0.05) and negatively correlated with total rain from three to six weeks prior to observation (p<0.05). Adult A. cajennense are particularly tolerant to drier conditions relative to other closely related ticks. Adult female activity was positively correlated with temperature (p<0.05). Peaks in rain activity and a summer behavioral diapause appear to be the dominant factors controlling emergence of larvae, and by extension, the life cycle of A. cajennense in the Tamaulipan Biotic Province.

AB  - The detection and enumeration of indicator bacteria such as Escherichia coli is used to assess the extent of faecal contamination of drinking water. On the basis of this approach, the effectiveness of storing water contaminated with faecal indicator bacteria in brass or earthern vessels (mutkas) of the type used in rural India have been investigated. Suspensions of bacteria in sterile distilled water were maintained for up to 48 h in each vessel and enumerated by surface plate counts on nutrient agar (non-selective) and several selective coliform media at 37 degrees C either under standard aerobic conditions, or under conditions designed to neutralise reactive oxygen species (ROS), e.g. using an anaerobic cabinet to prepare plates of pre-reduced growth medium or by inclusion of sodium pyruvate in the growth medium, with incubation of aerobically-prepared plates in an anaerobic jar. The counts obtained for E. coli decreased on short-term storage in a brass mutka; counts for selective media were lower than for equivalent counts for non-selective medium, with ROS-neutralised conditions giving consistently higher counts than aerobic incubation. However, after 48 h, no bacteria were cultivable under any conditions. Similar results were obtained using water from environmental sources in the Panjab, and from rural households where brass and earthern mutkas are used for storage of drinking water, with enumeration on selective coliform media (presumptive total coliforms). In all cases results indicated that, while storage of water in a brass mutka can inactivate E. coli and coliforms over a 48 h period, standard aerobic plate counting using selective media may not be fully effective in enumerating sub-lethally damaged bacteria.

AB  - Isoprostanes, are a novel group of prostaglandin-like compounds that are biosynthesised from esterified polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) through a non-enzymatic free radical-catalysed reaction. Several of these compounds possess potent biological activity, as evidenced mainly through their pulmonary and renal vasoconstrictive effects, and have short half-lives. It has been shown that isoprostanes act as full or partial agonists through thromboxane receptors. Both human and experimental studies have indicated associations of isoprostanes and severe inflammatory conditions, ischemia-reperfusion, diabetes and atherosclerosis. Reports have shown that F-2 -isoprostanes are authentic biomarkers of lipid peroxidation and can be used as potential in vivo indicators of oxidant stress in various clinical conditions, as well as in evaluations of antioxidants or drugs for their free radical-scavenging properties.
   Higher levels of F-2 -isoprostanes have been found in the normal human pregnancy compared to non-pregnancy, but their physiological role has not been well studied so far. Since bioactive F-2 -isoprostanes are continuously formed in various tissues and large amounts of these potent compounds are found unmetabolised in their free acid form in the urine in normal basal conditions with a wide inter-individual variation, their role in the regulation of normal physiological functions could be of further biological interest, but has yet to be disclosed. Their potent biological activity has attracted great attention among scientists, since these compounds are found in humans and animals in both physiological and pathological conditions and can be used as reliable biomarkers of lipid peroxidation.

AB  - We investigated the effect of hatching date on chick body condition, chick survival, post-fledging survival and eventual breeding performance as an adult (laying date and clutch volume) of Great Skuas in Foula (Shetland). In 10 out of 16 years there was a seasonal decline in chick body condition. In the remaining years, there was no detectable effect of hatching date on chick condition. Differences among years were statistically significant. Chicks in early broods survived better than late-hatched chicks in four years, and no trend could be detected in one year. Annual variation in the seasonal pattern of chick growth and survival, and of adult territorial attendance, suggests that environmental conditions play a role in determining the seasonal decline in performance. Post-fledging survival in relation to hatching date was studied by analysis of ringing recoveries. Hatching date affected post-fledging survival, but only in the first year of life. Breeding parameters of birds of known hatching date were studied when they came back to breed in Foula. Hatching dale of an individual did not affect its laying date or volume of the clutches laid later in life. This suggests that laying dale has a low heritability, or none at all. Birds that laid early in the season produced more future recruits than later birds. After an early breeding attempt, skuas had a higher overwinter survival probability than after a late season. These results suggest that laying date is an indicator of individual quality in skuas, in the sense that early birds apparently are more competent at gathering resources for reproduction and survival.

AB  - This study examined the effects of social housing manipulations on bodyweight, corticosterone levels, and performance of T-maze alternation in male CD-1 mice. Males that adopted a dominant social rank were heavier than those that adopted a subordinate social rank. Dominant mates also had lower corticosterone concentrations than the subordinates. However, there was little to suggest that these physiological indicators of social rank were moderated by housing condition. Indeed, statistical analysis confirmed that the difference in bodyweights was evident before males were socially housed. The mice showed high levels of spatial alternation on the T-maze from the start of testing so performance accuracy was high. Neither social rank nor housing condition had any clear categorical effect on T-maze performance. However, performance did fluctuate over successive blocks of testing and there was a negative association between accuracy on the T-maze and corticosterone levels (consistent with performance impairment because of elevated corticosterone). Therefore, under present conditions, individual differences in corticosterone were a better predictor of T-maze performance than social rank or housing condition. The results of the present study tend further support to the proposition that corticosterone levels measured non-invasively in urine may be used to predict diverse welfare outcomes for laboratory mice, from bodyweight to cognitive performance. Moreover, intrinsic physiological parameters rather than external influences, such as social housing, may have more influence on mouse behaviour.

KW  - holistic approach

KW  - seismic risk
KW  - socio-economic vulnerability
AB  - Risk has been defined, for management purposes, as the potential economic, social and environmental consequences of hazardous events that may occur in a specified period of time. However, in the past, the concept of risk has been defined in a fragmentary way in many cases, according to each scientific discipline involved in its appraisal. From the perspective of this article, risk requires a multidisciplinary evaluation that takes into account not only the expected physical damage, the number and type of casualties or economic losses, but also the conditions related to social fragility and lack of resilience conditions, which favour the second order effects (indirect effects) when a hazard event strikes an urban centre. The proposed general method of urban risk evaluation is multi hazard and holistic, that is, an integrated and comprehensive approach to guide decision-making. The evaluation of the potential physical damage (hard approach) as the result of the convolution of hazard and physical vulnerability of buildings and infrastructure is the first step of this method. Subsequently, a set of social context conditions that aggravate the physical effects are also considered (soft approach). In the method here proposed, the holistic risk evaluation is based on urban risk indicators. According to this procedure, a physical risk index is obtained, for each unit of analysis, from existing loss scenarios, whereas the total risk index is obtained by factoring the former index by an impact factor or aggravating coefficient, based on variables associated with the socioeconomic conditions of each unit of analysis. Finally, the proposed method is applied in its single hazard form to the holistic seismic risk evaluation for the cities of Bogota (Colombia) and Barcelona (Spain).

AB  - During the summers of 1991-1994, the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) conducted variable probability sampling on 344 lakes throughout the northeastern United States. Trophic state data were analyzed for the Northeast as a whole and for each of its three major ecoregions-the Adirondacks (ADI), the New England Uplands (NEU), and the Coastal Lowland and Plateau (CLP)-and inferred to the entire population of lakes greater than or equal to 1 ha (N = 11,076). Results were compared to a large, nonrandomly sampled data set for the same area compiled by Rohm and others and contrasted with lake trophic state information published in the National Water Quality Inventory: 1994 Report to Congress [305(b) report. Lakes across the entire Northeast were identified by EMAP data as 37.9% (+/-8.4%) oligotrophic, 40.1% (+/-9.7%) mesotrophic, 12.6% (+/-7.9%) eutrophic, and 9.3% (+/-6.3%) hypereutrophic. Lakes in the ADI and NEU generally are at a low, nearly identical trophic state (96% oligotrophic/mesotrophic), while those in the CLP are much richer (45% eutrophic). EMAP results are similar to results of the Rohm data set across the entire region. In the CLP, however, EMAP identified approximately 45% of the lakes as eutrophic/hypereutrophic, while the Rohm data set identified only 21% in these categories. Across the entire Northeast, the 305(b) report identified a much higher proportion (32.2%) or lakes in eutrophic condition and a much smaller proportion (19.8%) in oligotrophic condition than did the EMAP survey data(12.5% +/- 7.9% and 37.9% +/- 8.5%, respectively). Probability sampling has several advantages over nonrandom sampling when regional resource condition assessment is the goal.

AB  - Young rhesus monkeys exposed to conditions of social restriction are subject to stress. The physiological indicator, plasma cortisol, can be used to measure this stress. A technique using dexamethasone suppression-adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge was used to determine whether inanimate enrichment and social housing condition affected plasma cortisol levels in juvenile rhesus monkeys. Cortisol levels in two cohorts of monkeys (N = 64) were determined first while monkeys were caged singly and then while caged in pairs. Both control and enriched subjects received the dexamethasone suppression-ACTH challenge procedure and, for each cohort, cortisol samples were obtained after 10 and 12 months of single-caging and subsequently after 2 and 4 months of pair-housing. Compared with controls, experimental subjects receiving inanimate environmental enrichment did not show lower levels of plasma cortisol. Although environmental enrichment may lead to behavioural improvements, it did not affect adrenal function in this study. Social housing condition (single vs. pair)'also did not affect cortisol. Monkeys in most conditions responded appropriately to the dexamethasone suppression-ACTH challenge, indicating that levels of stress were not extreme. There were a number of significant interaction effects that were due to an atypical set of results for one of the control groups in one of the singly housed test sessions. Monkeys that spent their year of single-caging in indoor rooms showed higher activations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system than did monkeys that spent their year of single-caging in outdoor buildings. This suggests that aspects of the environment outside of the cage (conspecific activity, environmental variation, etc.) may influence plasma cortisol. This is surprising, considering that inanimate and social enhancements within the cage had little effect.

AB  - Presented for the first time in this paper are the results of a detailed multi-proxy investigation conducted on the Hangenberg Black Shale (HBS) from the Polish part of the Laurussian Shelf, which provide details about the environmental conditions in existence during deposition of the shale and the role played by anoxic conditions in the mass extinction events that occurred at the end of the Devonian times. Inorganic and organic redox indicators indicate that bottom water redox conditions changed periodically from being mainly anoxic/euxinic to oxic or being partially depleted in oxygen. U/Th values above 1.25, Ni/Co values above 7 and V/(V + Ni) values above 0.8 recorded from the lower part of the HBS all point to anoxic/euxinic conditions being present, as do high total organic carbon contents (TOC) above 10% and degree of pyritisation (DOP) values around 0.75%. However, the presence of benthic fauna over the lower part of the HBS attests to opportunistic colonisation of the sea-floor during oxic episodes. Evidence for similar episodes has also been recognised over the middle part of the HBS, e.g., U/Th values below 1.25, Ni/Co values below 4, V/(V + Ni) values below 0.8, TOC values of 3% to 5.5% and DOP values of 0.4% to 0.75%, plus the common occurrence of benthic fauna. Anoxic conditions returned during the deposition of the upper part of the HSB, though they were not as well developed as when the lower part of the shale was laid down.
   Of interest is the presence of small pyrite framboids and isorenieratene biomarkers in all the analysed samples, which suggest that euxinic conditions persisted in the photic zone of the water column. A twenty centimetre thick layer of volcanogenic deposits (tuffites) is present in the middle part of the HBS, the geochemical characteristics of which are typical of ocean floor basalts. The occurrence of volcanogenic material below and within the HBS, together with an absence of calcium carbonate over its upper part, the presence of abundant tetrads just above the black shale and a drastic decrease in faunal frequency in the upper part of the HBS imply that volcanism may have caused oceanic acidification (or hypercapnia) that in turn potentially may have influenced the Hangenberg mass extinction event.

AB  - Offshore oil and gas assets are highly complex structures comprising of several components, designed to have a lifecycle of about 20 to 30 years of working under harsh operational and environmental conditions. These assets, during their operational lifetime, are subjected to various degradation mechanisms such as corrosion, erosion, wear, creep and fatigue cracks. In order to improve economic viability and increase profitability, many operators are looking at extending the lifespan of their assets beyond the original design life, thereby making life extension (LE) an increasingly critical and highly-discussed topic in the offshore oil and gas industry. In order to manage asset aging and meet the LE requirements, offshore oil and gas operators have adopted various approaches such as following maintenance procedures as advised by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), or using the experience and expertise of engineers and inspectors. However, performing these activities often provides very limited value addition to operators during the LE period of operation. This paper aims to propose a systematic framework to help operators meet LE requirements while optimizing their cost structure. This framework establishes an integration between three individual life assessment modules, namely: condition assessment, remaining useful life (RUL) prediction and LE decision-making. The benefits of the proposed framework are illustrated through a case study involving a three-phase separator system on a platform which was constructed in the mid-1970s in West Africa. The results of this study affirm the effectiveness of this framework in minimizing catastrophic failures during the LE phase of operations, whilst ensuring compliance to regulatory requirements.

AB  - The composition of a peatland plant community has considerable effect on a range of ecosystem functions. Peatland plant community structure is predicted to change under future climate change, making the quantification of the direction and magnitude of this change a research priority. We subjected intact, replicated vegetated poor fen peat monoliths to elevated temperatures, increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), and two water table levels in a factorial design to determine the individual and synergistic effects of climate change factors on the poor fen plant community composition. We identify three indicators of a regime shift occurring in our experimental poor fen system under climate change: nonlinear decline of Sphagnum at temperatures 8 degrees C above ambient conditions, concomitant increases in Carex spp. at temperatures 4 degrees C above ambient conditions suggesting a weakening of Sphagnum feedbacks on peat accumulation, and increased variance of the plant community composition and pore water pH through time. A temperature increase of +4 degrees C appeared to be a threshold for increased vascular plant abundance; however the magnitude of change was species dependent. Elevated temperature combined with elevated CO2 had a synergistic effect on large graminoid species abundance, with a 15 times increase as compared to control conditions. Community analyses suggested that the balance between dominant plant species was tipped from Sphagnum to a graminoid-dominated system by the combination of climate change factors. Our findings indicate that changes in peatland plant community composition are likely under future climate change conditions, with a demonstrated shift toward a dominance of graminoid species in poor fens.

AB  - Optimal environmental conditions and adequate packaging materials can be used to guarantee high quality product through shelf life. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of environmental conditions on quality parameters of intermediate moisture content (IMC) banana and identify the critical quality parameters of IMC banana during storage. IMC banana samples were placed in air-tight containers and stored according to a two level full factorial design with four factors (the storage temperatures, relative humidity, light level condition and air composition in the container). The quality indicators (moisture content, colour, rehydration capacity, penetration force and specific volume) were measured and sensory characteristics (overall opinion/acceptance, appearance/colour and firmness/texlure) were also evaluated by a consumer group. It was found that temperature and relative humidity were the most influential environment factors for colour Hunter L, brownness index (BI) and rehydration capacity, acceptance and colour for IMC banana. L-o (outer), moisture content and water activity were the critical instrumental quality parameters of IMC banana during storage. The 54% variation of overall sample quality throughout time was explained by all the quality parameters except specific volume. Shelf-life thresholds were defined from the good correlation between quality characteristics and the sensory acceptance, and for a sensory acceptance threshold of 5 (neither like nor dislike), the thresholds of L-o, a(w), moisture content and rehydration capacity were 49.4, 0.59, 13.5% wb and 12.2, respectively.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) is the most widespread sort, planted in the process of afforestation of degraded habitats, in the Mediterranean karst area. Its principal role as a pioneer species on the island of Rab is to improve habitat conditions. The aim of the research was directed to determining its ameliorative role during one rotation age.
   Materials and Methods: Research of pine culture established in 1936, surveying of the forest stand structure at four time points (1971, 1975, 1985 and 1997). Plant sociological research is made according to the methodology of plant sociology. The following pedophysiographic characteristics were determined: pH in water and 0.01 M CaCl2 (1:2,5), part of humus by oxidation in potassium bicromate, total nitrogen and indicators of humus ingredients in humus-accumulative soil horizon. Annual percentage of the number of dying trees was calculated by the formula: m = 1 - ((N1)/(N0))(1/t) in which No is the number of trees at the beginning, and N-1 - in the end of the monitoring period or time interval t. Emergence or ingrowth was calculated by theformula r = (In (NO0) - in (N-1))/T.
   Results: Structural elements showed that tree stock increased during the rotation age (294.46 m(3)/ha), however the number of climatozonal broadleaved vegetation decreased (in 1975 - 3544 plants, in 1997-2395 plants). Their current number and coverage are insufficient for creating stable climatozonal forest community of holm oak and manna ash. Forest stands conditions do not enable progressive succession of vegetation.
   Conclusions: Aleppo pine culture during one rotation age has not enabled the conversion of the form forest of stands. Edaphic conditions and ecological factors along with negative anthropogencous influence do not contribute to improvement of habitat conditions.

AB  - The current distribution and host range of the Sclerotiniaceae indicate that the family originated in the Northern Hemisphere. The ancestors were possibly present on earth during the Tertiary period when in most northern areas, environmental conditions were wet, warm and uniform until the approach of the Pleistocene epoch. It seems from present-day host-pathogen relationships that some ancient groups of plants and a variety of angiosperms were hosts. The teleomorph of early genera was well adapted to wet conditions, with ascospores the only dispersive spore and microconidia probably serving a spermatial function. Macroconidia were probably later evolutionary developments associated with colonization of habitats drier than the original one. The onset of: the Pleistocene Ice Age would have exerted considerable environmental pressures on early genera resulting in selection of adaptations which enabled survival of the gradually changing conditions, particularly sub-zero temperatures and unavailability of hosts during the harsh winter months. The major adaptations in the Sclerotiniaceae have been a range of multihyphal, reserve-rich resting structures which survive harsh environmental conditions and provide nutrients and protection for the teleomorphs, which are highly sensitive to cold and desiccation. The resting structures are useful indicators of phylogenetic relations within the family. Information on stromata and sclerotia of the Sclerotiniaceae is reviewed and then used to discuss evolution of these structures. The first type of resting structure to evolve was probably an indeterminate stroma which developed by branching and interweaving of infection hyphae within host tissues. Several, better differentiated forms were produced with their morphology related to type of host and tissue infected and to characteristics of the pathogens. The different stromata could have evolved along a common pathway or independently. The general anatomical similarity of the various structures could be accounted for because of the limited structural forms that can be produced by interweaving of filamentous hyphae. It seems that sclerotia may have developed from hyphal tissue which had the ability to produce sclerotia when the climate was cold and wet, and macroconidia when conditions were warmer and drier. Two main types of sclerotia are distinguished, tuberoid sclerotia and piano-convex sclerotia. The literature relating to the morphology and ontogeny of macroconidia is reviewed and used for speculation on the effects of environmental conditions on evolution of macroconidia, the origin of macroconidial anamorphs and stages in the evolution of botrytoid spores. It is concluded that in the Sclerotiniaceae there are at least two main pathways along which resting structures have evolved, one leading to a variety of stromata and the other to two types of sclerotia. Sclerotia predated macroconidia and both anamorphs could have originated from common generative tissue.

AB  - Based on the palynological record of core REG 972, this work aimed to reconstruct the paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental history from 66.5 to 47 kyr BP at the south Brazilian continental margin, as well as to identify the influence of continental discharge in the southern portion of the Rio Grande Cone. Nineteen samples were processed following the standard methodology for palynological studies. Organic matter (OM) content was measured in the sediments. The age model was established according to O-18 isotopes analyses in benthic foraminiferal tests. The studied interval corresponds to a glacial interval, divided in palynozones (PZs): PZIa (66.5-64.5 kyr), PZIb (64.5-53.5 kyr), and PZII (53.5-47 kyr). PZIa was characterized by drier conditions, with grassland and salt marsh taxa dominance (Cyperaceae and Amaranthaceae). During PZIb and PZII, the increase of Bryophyta, Pteridophyta, Araucaria angustifolia, Arecaceae, and Alchornea triplinervia points to wetter and warmer conditions that may be related to the beginning of marine isotope stage 3 and later to the sea-level rise. In the oceanic environment, the presence of freshwater algae and marine indicators lead to the conclusion that marine conditions prevailed during Rio Grande Cone sedimentary formation, even under low sea-level conditions when terrigenous influence was stronger. The data on OM content, dinoflagellate taxa, and mean sea level changes point to a period of low productivity during PZI. In PZII, a period of higher productivity took place because of Subantarctic Shelf Water influence, bringing cold and nutrient-rich waters to the area.

AB  - Blast furnace tuyere is an important "window" between the inside and outside of blast furnace. Stable and accurate detection of the combustion condition of tuyere raceway plays a significant role in maintaining longevity, safety, and smooth of blast furnace. The adiabatic combustion temperature as a traditional measurable indicator of the raceway combustion condition considers the raceway temperature as a constant. It cannot explain the productivity and quality fluctuations of iron in practical production while the operation parameters are fixed and unchanged. Thus, this paper presents the image-based flame detection system specific to the blast furnace raceway to research the actual combustion condition in the raceway. The system mainly consists of an optical detector to capture raceway images and a digital image processing unit to extract flame features. In this paper, the nonlinear partial least-squares colorimetry and Monte Carlo method with iterative optimization are developed to obtain the temperature distribution of the raceway. Power spectral analysis is used to extract the flame flicker frequency. Massive raceway images captured from 15 raceways of a 2500-m(3) blast furnace were used to analyze raceway flames. The results demonstrate that temperature distribution of the raceway can fluctuate in a wide range and considerable temperature non-uniformity exists among the 15 raceways. This case can explain why productivity and quality of iron are unstable under the same operation parameters. And, the detection system performs well in revealing the nature of the raceway combustion condition.

AB  - Environmentally sensitive benthic foraminifera (protists) from Chesapeake Bay were used as bioindicators to estimate the timing and degree of changes in dissolved oxygen (DO) over the past five centuries. Living foraminifers from 19 surface samples and fossil assemblages from 11 sediment cores dated by Pb-210, Cs-131, C-14, and pollen stratigraphy were analyzed from the tidal portions of the Patuxent, Potomac, and Choptank Rivers and the main channel of the Chesapeake Bay. Ammonia parkinsoniana, a facultative anaerobe tolerant of periodic anoxic conditions, comprises an average of 74% of modern Chesapeake foraminiferal assemblages (DO = 0.47 and 1.72 ml l(-1)) compared to 0% to 15% of assemblages collected in the 1960s. Paleoecological analyses show that A. parkinsoniana was absent prior to the late 17th century increased to 10-25% relative frequency between approximately 1670-1720 and 1810-1900, and became the dominant (60-90%) benthic foraminiferal species in channel environments beginning in the early 1970s. Since the 1970s, deformed tests of A. parkinsoniana occur in all cores (10-20% of Ammonia), suggesting unprecedented stressful benthic conditions. These cores indicate that prior to the late 17th century, there was limited oxygen depletion. During the past 200 years, decadal scale variability in oxygen depletion has occurred, as dysoxic (DO = 0.1-1.0 mi l(-1)), perhaps short-term anoxic (DO < 0.1 mi l(-1)) conditions developed. The most extensive (spatially and temporally) anoxic conditions were reached during the 1970s. Over decadal timescales, DO variability scents to be Linked closely to climatological: factors influencing river discharge; the unprecedented anoxia since the early 1970s is attributed mainly to high freshwater now and to an increase in nutrient concentrations From the watershed.

AB  - In this study we performed a simulation of carcinogenesis evolution based on vary-ing system parameters in the multi-parametric space. A non-linear multi-scale diffusion cancer invasion model that describes the interactions of the tumor cells, matrixmetalloproteinases (MM), matrix-degradative enzymes (MDE) and oxygen was employed for simulation. To quantify chaotic cancer attractors, the technique based on the wandering trajectories analysis was applied. Multi-parametric evolution of conditions leading to cancer invasion was defined and illustrated in numerous figures.
   Chaotic attractors and phase spaces of the regular oscillations of basic indicators of a biological system with parameters that correspond to the chaotic and regular regions, respectively, have been presented. Amplitude level contours of MM, MDE and oxygen concentrations have been obtained and juxtaposed with the corresponding parametric planes. In all cases the carcinogenesis is accompanied by significant increase in chemical oscillation amplitudes of MM, MDE and oxygen concentrations. The obtained results derived from all control parameter planes could be used for evaluations of conditions resulting in cancer invasion as well as the modes to inhibit and/or stabilize carcinogenesis.

AB  - A thorough understanding of the rate of depletion of ungerminated seeds in soil is necessary to understand and model the population dynamics of many plant species. To assess how edaphic conditions influence seed survival over time a long-term field study was set up. Mesh bags of seeds of 12 species were buried under 12 contrasting semi-natural and grassland habitats and retrieved at intervals over 10 years. Seed survival and viability were assessed through germination trials and chemical staining. There were clear differences in the rate of depletion of ungerminated seed between species and also differences in the variability of this measure between habitats. Seed survival was longer in soils with a higher pH, lower moisture content and lower soil C:N. Soil characteristics need to be taken into account within studies of plant populations that depend on regeneration from seed, particularly for species where seed survival is sensitive to edaphic conditions. Ignoring this influence of the dynamics of seeds under different soil conditions may have a serious impact on the success of population modelling.

AB  - Sedimentation patterns are described from the Kilbride Formation west of the Maam Fault zone, north Galway, Ireland.  Seven distinct facies are described using faunal and lithological parameters.  Environments of deposition range from marginal marine to deep shelf conditions.  Lateral facies distributions were largely controlled by a rocky topographic high which influenced sedimentation until being buried by outer shelf sediments in middle-upper Kilbride Formation times.  Four distinct sequences are described:  in the lower Kilbride Formation, sequences I and IV are dominated by proximal storm deposits; sequence II was deposited in the lee of the topographic high and is interpreted as barred estuarine deposits; and in sequence III, at the topographic high, no deposition took place.  In the upper Kilbride Formation the barrier was buried and uniform outer shelf conditions prevailed throughout the area.  Faunal assemblages were strongly controlled by local environmental conditions and do not conform directly with the expected pattern of depth-related brachiopod communities.  The Lingula and Eocoelia communities are amalgamated and allochthonous, the Pentameroides and Costistricklandia communities are absent, and only the Clorinda community is well represented, though parautochthonous.

AB  - By comparing diatom communities in natural and disturbed sites, indicators for different types and levels of anthropogenic disturbance can be found. As a first step, this study aims to describe the different natural and disturbed community types found throughout the French hydrosystem. 836 diatom samples were analysed with an unsupervised neural network, the self-organising-map, a well accepted method for community ordination. 11 different communities were identified, 5 corresponding to non-impacted or slightly impacted conditions and representing the diatom natural variability of our dataset. These 5 communities corresponded to 5 different hydro-ecoregions, i.e. 5 river types with similar geological context and range in altitude. The 6 other communities were typical of rivers under anthropogenic pressure.

AB  - To date there have only been two studies using testate amoebae as palaeoecological indicators in tropical peatlands. Here we present a new similar to 500-year testate amoeba record from San Jorge, a domed peatland in Peruvian Amazonia, which has a well-constrained vegetation history based on pollen analysis. We observe a major shift from Hyalosphenia subflava to Cryptodifflugia oviformis-dominated communities at similar to 50 cm depth (c. AD 1760), which suggests a change to drier conditions in the peatland. The application of a statistical transfer function also suggests a deepening of the water table at this time. The transition in the microbial assemblage occurs at a time when pollen and geochemical data indicate drier conditions (reduced influence of river flooding), leading to an ecosystem switch to more ombrotrophic-like conditions in the peatland. Our work illustrates the potential of testate amoebae as important tools in tropical peatland palaeoecology, and the power of multiproxy approaches for understanding the long-term development of tropical peatlands.

AB  - A 12 m sediment core from the Aiding Lake basin in the today hyper-arid Turpan depression (Autonomous Xinjiang Province, NW-China) has been studied. The core, which was drilled near the deepest point of the endorheic Turpan basin (154 m below sea level), revealed several climatic and palaeoenvironmental changes during the Late Pleistocene. The sediments which were analyzed relating to sedimentology (grain size), geochemistry (Ti/Al ratio, chemical index of weathering, total organic and inorganic carbon, sulfur, nitrogen), and magnetic susceptibility, are of fluvial, eolian, and lacustrine origin. Age control was done by five C-14 dates. Reservoir effects for the stratigraphic units were considered. Less saline conditions lasted until the end of the Pleistocene, forced by stronger westerlieS and low, but increasing temperatures. Sometime after Dansgaard-Oeschger event 1 (14.6 ka) up to present, environmental conditions were arid and Aiding became a salt lake. High sand contents indicate eolian input during a period of cold, windy and arid conditions, associated with Heinrich event 2 (-24.8-23.4 ka cal BP; HEMMING 2004), whereas high sand input of the uppermost 2 m and salt accumulation reflects a general change to drier conditions since the Pleistocene/Holocene transition. In summary, the Lake decreased from its maximum size of around 3000 km(2) during the MIS3 to a seasonal small lake today.
   The measured Rb/Sr ratio, generally used as an indicator for weathering conditions of lake catchments, with reduced Sr influx during arid periods due to weak chemical weathering, has to be interpreted differently for Aiding Lake: Very low Rb/Sr ratios in the uppermost 2.7m similar to that of unweathered loess represent the recent drought and Sr accumulation during the Holocene. Contrary to other studies, we found e.g. that Rb/Sr dynamics do not indicate the intensity of past chemical weathering, but allows the distinction of different source areas and the decoupling of weathering and subsequent transport to the sink. This is consistent to the westerly index, according to AN et al. (2012), which was calculated to separate eolian from fluvial influx. Our study shows that the interpretation of palaeoclimate proxies depends on the understanding of the entire process-response-system within a specific catchment and environment. In summary and in comparison to other regional studies, we can distinguish six palaeoclimatic phases: A) with strong westerlies and cold-wet climate (c. 28.5-24.8 ka BP); B) with very strong winter monsoon and very cold climate (24.8-23.4 ka BP); C) with strong winter monsoon and cold climate, merging to cold more humid conditions due to enhancing westerlies (23.4 - similar to 20.5 ka BP). Phase D showed strongly reduced eolian dynamics afterwards and was a period of cool-wet conditions with weakening westerlies and a geomorphological stability in the Turpan basin (until similar to 16 ka). Phase E was dominated by the cold-dry spell of Heinrich event 1(15.8-14.6 ka BP), eolian transport was reactivated by high winter monsoon wind speeds, and fluvial discharge decreased. During the D/O1 warming (after 14.6 ka BP), material was merely transported from the melting mountain glaciers to the lake. In the Turpan basin, warm and dry conditions led to a sealing of surfaces by biocrusts, which again suppressed eolian processes. Phase F started with the transition to hot-very dry Holocene climate. It experienced enhanced seasonality (stronger winter and summer monsoon) and marks a period when the propagation of moist westerly air masses to the Turpan basin was prevented.

AB  - Wheat is an important food crop. Its production is limited by multiple environmental stresses, especially terminal heat stress. High temperature and drought are the main stresses affecting wheat production in the Mediterranean region. Hence, the chlorophyll content in leaves reflects photosynthetic activity and the yield potential of wheat plants. So, the aim of this study was to evaluate SPAD (Soil Plant Analysis Development) chlorophyll meter readings and their relationships with the grain yield of spring wheat growing in different environments, and to examine the physiological responses to environmental stress at different growth stages. Sixteen spring wheat genotypes were grown under two temperature (cool and warm) and two moisture (rain-fed and irrigated) regimes during the 2011/2012 growing season in two locations in Turkey (Adana and Diyarbakir). There were significant genotypic variations in SPAD values under all conditions. There was a significant positive correlation between third-leaf SPAD values and grain yield in the cool-climate conditions at Adana. There was a significant positive relationship between flag-leaf SPAD values at the heading stage and grain yield under cool-climate conditions in Diyarbakir, while the relationship between SPAD values and grain yield was negative under warm-environment conditions. The SPAD values were more strongly affected by location and heat stress than by drought stress. Regarding to the range of SPAD values within each genotype was relatively stable. Together, these results showed that SPAD values can be used as an indicator of grain yield in spring wheat, providing that the measurements are taken at appropriate stages at each location.

AB  - Photodermatoses are a group of skin disorders caused or exacerbated by ultraviolet and/or visible radiation, which collectively affect a high proportion of the population and substantially affect quality of life (QoL). Our objective was to assess the psychological impact of these conditions. Patients with a range of photodermatoses diagnosed at a specialist investigation centre in the UK completed questionnaires evaluating (i) anxiety and (ii) depression, using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), (iii) social anxiety, using the Fear of Negative Evaluation measure (FNE), (iv) coping strategies (brief COPE) and (v) QoL, using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Questionnaires were returned by 185 of 260 patients (71.1% response rate). Mean age was 50.2 years (SD 14.5, range 20-85), 80.3% female. Polymorphic light eruption was the most common diagnosis, followed by photoaggravated eczema, other photoaggravated dermatological conditions and solar urticaria. Across the sample, high percentages, i. e. 23% and 7.9% of individuals, showed scores indicating clinical levels of anxiety and depression, respectively. Facial involvement was a strong indicator for depression (t = 2.7, p < 0.01). In regression analyses psychological factors (particularly depression and adaptive coping) were the principle predictors of QoL, accounting for 17.7% of the variance (F = 7.61, p < 0.01), while clinical variables accounted for an additional 10.1% (F = 8.96, p < 0.01), with number of months/year affected exerting a significant effect (p < 0.01). This study demonstrates the high psychological comorbidity of these conditions; more awareness of this is required, with adoption of a biopsychosocial approach to their management.

AB  - The phytoplankton assemblages from eight reservoirs of the Paranapanema River were studied during two consecutive years Chlorophyceae and Bacillaryophyceae dominated in richeness The observed high number of taxa, 234, reflects the extensive sampling programme and evidences the necessity of considering the whole hydrograph basin to assess the biodiversity status of inland water ecosystems The dams had a negative effect on phytoplankton richness with higher number of taxa associate to riverine (non-regulated) stretches The tributary rivers also exhibited high species richness showing the importance of considering the lateral dimension, in addition to the longitudinal one for aquatic biota inventories in large river basins/reservoirs Richness and diversity were also positively influenced by the connectivity with lateral wetlands (macrophyte-dominated lakes) due to the periphyton influence The phytoplankton abundance/biomass was not influenced by higher water retention time Higher values occured in the middle basin stretches (river-passage reservoirs) due to the increase in the trophic conditions There was a positive corielation with phosphorus Poorer light conditions in the cascade do not limit the phytoplankton biomass with assemblages dominated by species tolerant to turbulent conditions and high mineral turbidity Bacillariophyceae and Cryptophyceae dominated numerically The first group (unicellular forms) was prominent in the large and oligotrophic upstream reservoirs The second was highly abundant in the river-passage (low retention time) and more eutrophic, reservoirs Cyanophyceae growth is probably controlled by advection processes (wash-out effect) The zooplankton does not control the phytoplankton biomass and the diversity of both groups is positively associated in the cascade The structure of the phytoplankton assemblages showed to be a good indicator of the operationally distinct reservoirs of the Paranapanema cascade and also reflected the changes in the trophic conditions along the basin

AB  - Sedimentary rocks from the Eocene Shahejie Formation including the third (Es3) and fourth (Es4) members, in the Dongying Depression, Bohai Bay Basin, NE China, have been analyzed to determine bulk and molecular geochemical characteristics. Sedimentary rocks from the Es4 Member contained no or trace amounts of perylene, but C-32-C-35 17 alpha(H),21 beta(H) homohopanes were well preserved along with concomitant high concentrations of beta-carotane and phytane, suggesting reducing depositional conditions. However, some samples, mostly from the Es3 Member contained abnormally high concentrations of perylene with high dibenzofuran and 9H-fluoren-9-one consistent with oxidizing environments. On the other hand, indications from the relatively high pristane/phytane (Pr/Ph) values, the absence of C-32-C-35 homohopanes and beta-carotane are not consistent with reducing conditions in these sedimentary rocks, indicating the perylene of the investigated samples was deposited in oxidizing conditions. In combination with the sample locations in the depression, bulk geochemical characterization including low total organic carbon (TOC) contents and poor kerogen quality, and a series of molecular geochemical records, perylene has a high probability of being preserved by rapid deposition under oxidizing environments. As the conversion of quinones to perylene must ultimately involve a reduction stage, perylene preservation under oxidizing conditions seems to be formed by alternative precursors during oxidation, such as by cyclodehydrogenation of 1,1'-binaphthyl. Hence, caution should be taken when perylene is used as an indicator of strongly reducing environments.

AB  - Haematococcus pluvialis is a unicellular green alga with great commercial value, due to its synthesis of powerful antioxidant astaxanthin. H. pluvialis was mainly distributed in small water bodies but was also observed in eutrophicated lakes, and even coexisted with Microcystis. However, Haematococcus cells never prevail in eutrophicated water bodies. Phosphorus is the main limiting factor in most aquatic ecosystems and may have a role in the distribution of H. pluvialis. Here, we focused on the physiological responses of H. pluvialis to various phosphorus conditions (0.002, 0.02, 0.2, and 2 mM), and compared with a bloom-forming cyanobacterium Microcystis wesenbergii. Growth determination suggested that high phosphorus conditions (0.2 mM and 2 mM) favor the growth of H. pluvialis cells, but H. pluvialis cells have a shorter duration of log phase than M. wesenbergii cells. Growth determination also indicated H. pluvialis cells had lower tolerability to low phosphorus (0.002 mM). Qualitative comparisons from long-term and short-term phosphorus uptake experiments, polyphosphate accumulation and extracellular alkaline phosphatase expression analysis suggested two different phosphorus utilization strategies in the two species. H. pluvialis cells were characterized with the induction of extracellular alkaline phosphatase to survive phosphorus-deficient condition, while M. wesenbergii cells were characterized with quick uptake of phosphorus and accumulation more of polyphosphate in phosphorus-replete conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate features of phosphorus uptake and utilization in H. pluvialis, which will increase our understanding in the distribution of H. pluvialis.

AB  - The California spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) population is the basis for a valuable commercial and recreational fishery off southern California, yet little is known about its population dynamics. Studies based on CalCOFI sampling in the 1950s indicated that the abundance of phyllosoma larvae may be sensitive to oceanographic conditions such as El Nino events. To further study the potential influence of environmental variability and the fishery on lobster productivity, we developed a 60-year time series of the abundance of lobster phyllosoma from the historical CalCOFI sample collection. Phyllosoma were removed from the midsummer cruises when the early-stage larvae are most abundant in the plankton nearshore. We found that the abundance of the early-stage phyllosoma displayed considerable inter-annual variability but was significantly positively correlated with El Nino events, mean sea-surface temperature, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which are significantly intercorrelated. Conditions during the warm years (1950s and 1980 present) were the most productive for lobster phyllosoma in the Southern California Bight. Total lobster fishery landings show an increasing trend since 1980 due to increasing commercial landings from 1980-2000 and increased recreational landings since 2005. However, this trend is not observed in the phyllosoma time series or in the Baja California fishery whose landings are correlated with the U.S. fishery. We suggest that the stage 1 phyllosoma may provide a useful fishery-independent index of spiny lobster spawning stock biomass and stock productivity Due to the relationship identified here between environmental conditions and phyllosoma abundance, we suggest that this information could be used as an environmental indicator for management.

AB  - The threshold values of indicator species and ratios delineating the transition between NOx and VOC sensitivity of ozone formation are assumed to be universal by various investigators. However, our previous studies suggested that threshold values might vary according to the locations and conditions. In this study, threshold values derived from various model simulations at two different locations (the area of Switzerland by UAM Model and San Joaquin Valley of Central California by SAQM Model) are examined using a new approach for defining NOy and VOC sensitive regimes. Possible definitions for the distinction of NO, and VOC sensitive ozone production regimes are given. The dependence of the threshold values for indicators and indicator ratios such as NOy, O-3/NOz, HCHO/NOy, and H2O2/HNO3 on the definition of NOx and VOC sensitivity is discussed. Then the variations of threshold values under low emission conditions and in two different days are examined in both areas to check whether the models respond consistently to changes in environmental conditions. In both cases, threshold values are shifted similarly when emissions are reduced. Changes in the wind fields and aging of the photochemical oxidants seem to cause the day-to-day variation of the threshold values. O-3/NOz and HCHO/NOy indicators are predicted to be unsatisfactory to separate the NOx and VOC sensitive regimes. Although NOy and H2O2/HNO3 provide a good separation of the two regimes, threshold values are affected by changes in the environmental conditions studied in this work. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Many passerines lay protoporphyrin-pigmented eggs, and the degree of spotting seems to be related to female condition and environmental characteristics. However, most studies have ignored the relationship between the male's quality and eggshell pigmentation. Because ornaments can act as honest indicators of individual quality, spottiness could be related to the parents' feather colouration. Using models of bird vision, we investigated whether male and female ornamentation explained variation in spotting coverage in a free-living population of blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus). We also explored the associations between other important individual characteristics (i.e. the pair's infection status) and spotting coverage. Females that laid more pigmented eggs suffered from higher parasitaemia by the blood parasite Leucocytozoon and had smaller clutches, more saturated yellow breast feathers and reduced body mass. Male plumage colour and infection status explained a higher percentage of the variation in eggshell pigmentation than female characteristics. Males that had more saturated white cheeks and less saturated yellow breasts and were more intensely infected by the parasite Haemoproteus and less by Plasmodium attended nests with more spotted eggs. Additionally, these males were younger and more likely to father extra-pair offspring. These results, although observational, suggest that male attractiveness, male age, extra-pair paternity and parasitic infections could be important determinants of eggshell pigmentation. Males in poorer condition might have provided less food to laying females, which in turn laid more pigmented eggs and were also in poor condition. Alternatively, increased eggshell pigmentation could result from female differential allocation or breeding in low-quality territories.

AB  - Animals may be able to assess the quality of other individuals by using information contained in single or multiple traits. We investigated the honesty of the information potentially conveyed through different elements of the tail of the black-billed magpie, Pica pica, which develops in a similar way in both sexes while still in the nest. Variability and age and sex dimorphism were all higher for tail features than for other morphological characters. Tail length of first-year males and females was negatively correlated with the number of feathers with fault bars, which may reflect stressful environmental conditions during feather growth in the nest. Adult males may indicate current body condition through overall tail expression, while the current condition of adult females may be signalled by indicators of stressful environmental conditions during feather growth in the previous year, although both these correlations were weak. Tail length correlated negatively with testes volume of first years, and tails tended to be less damaged in both first-year and adult males with large testes. First-year males that had reached sexual maturity had shorter tails than those that had not. There was no association between parasitism and tail expression, but tail length was positively related to spleen size in first-year males. This study provides evidence that multiple information about individual quality may be conveyed by different features of the tail in ways that vary in different age and sex classes.

AB  - Algal cultures at production scales are de-facto xenic cultures that integrate diverse microbial communities. These microbes interact directly or indirectly with the algal primary producers in the system. The extent and direction of the interactions are determined by key algal growth parameters that are typically dominated by temperature, light and nutrient availability. The population dynamics of the microbial community relative to the growth conditions for Nannochloropsis salina (CCMP 1776) were investigated. The experiment was carried out in f/2 growth medium or secondarily treated wastewater in enclosed Solix BioSystems Lumian AGS4000 photobioreactor panels. Bacterial abundance and taxonomic profiles were assessed through amplicon metagenomics. Escherichia coli, as a pathogen indicator, was assessed through standard and genomic approaches. The microbial community responded to changes in the availability of macronutrients. Responses were also correlated to changes in the algal density and relative chlorophyll content. Stress conditions, associated with rapid algae growth enhance bacterial diversity, while having a non-uniform impact on abundance across taxa. The taxonomically rich Proteobacteria phylum reacted to nutrient enhancement with an increase in abundance across numerous genera. Bacteroidetes genera showed a variable response to changes in both nutrient status and other growth parameters, including substrate type, indicating a more complex response to changes in environmental factors. Nevertheless, while notable shifts were observed in the microbial community composition, the community structure has shown resilience and evident capacity for rapid adaptation to changes in the environmental conditions. Pathogen indicator organisms, while declining during rapid growth of algae, may survive and can recover in numbers and viability as algae enter senescence under nutrient stress conditions.

AB  - In response to concerns about declining water quality, increased aquatic plant biomass, and harmful algal blooms, a lake monitoring program was undertaken on a suburban kettle lake near Toronto, Canada. We identified environmental conditions consistent with eutrophication, and the largest source of phosphorus (P) loading was from sediment release during an extended period of low dissolved oxygen during thermal stratification of the water column. To put these current environmental conditions in perspective, account for long-term limnological trends, and develop a sustainable lake management strategy, we also undertook paleolimnological analysis of a sediment core. Using diatoms as proxy indicators, historic limnological conditions were reconstructed. Although pre-European settlement conditions were typical of lakes with forested catchments in this region, the lake was mesotrophic (total phosphorus [TP] similar to 17.5 mu g/L), likely from P bound to dissolved organic carbon. P concentrations increased with the use of chemical fertilizers and establishment of seasonal lakeside cottages and resorts starting in the 1920s (the beginning of the diatom-inferred (DI-) TP upward trend). With the conversion of these cottages into year-round homes (since 1960) and further urbanization of the catchment, including servicing with municipal water supply but continued reliance on septic tanks, P has increased further (TP similar to 26.1 mu g/L). For restoration to a sustainable state, methods of preventing sediment P release (capping the sediment surface or oxygenation of the hypolimnion) should be considered, along with installation of municipal wasterwater servicing and stewardship projects to prevent further P loading from septic systems and surface runoff.

AB  - Modern lake hydrodynamics, ostracode species autecology, stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta C-13) of multiple ostracode species, ostracode taphonomy and sediment geochemistry were studied to improve interpretation of the late Pleistocene-early Holocene (similar to 24-10 ka) stable isotope record of ostracodes in sediment core PI-6 from Lago Peten Itza, northern Guatemala. Oxygen and carbon stable isotopes in modern and fossil species assemblages of Lago Peten Itza were used as indicators of changes in the balance between evaporation and precipitation, past lake level and carbon source. Ostracode taphonomy was used to detect past periods of strong currents, high-energy environments, and possible partial or full mixing of the lake. The modern lake water isotopic composition displays clear seasonal differences that are independent of lake level fluctuations. Modern benthic species displayed lower delta O-18 and delta C-13 values than nektobenthic species, with differences of 3.0 parts per thousand and 5.3 parts per thousand, respectively. Valves of nektobenthic species display higher values of delta C-13 because these ostracodes live in shallower environments among abundant algae and aquatic plants, where productivity is high. The benthic species Limnocythere opesta Brehm, 1939 displayed the smallest average offset from delta O-18 water (+0.3 parts per thousand) and the largest offset from delta C-13(DIC) values (-4.1 parts per thousand) among studied ostracode species. Nektobenthic species Heterocypris punctata Keyser, 1975 displayed the smallest difference relative to the delta C-13(DIC) values (-0.1 parts per thousand).
   Late Pleistocene-early Holocene climate conditions and water levels in Lago Peten Itza can be summarized as follows: 1) high lake levels and cold conditions (Last Glacial Maximum [LGM], similar to 24-19 ka), 2) fluctuating lake levels and cold conditions (Heinrich Stadial 1 [HS1], similar to 19-15 ka), 3) high lake levels and warm and wetter conditions (Bolling-Allerod [BA], similar to 15-13 ka), 4) low lake levels and dry conditions (Younger Dryas [YD], similar to 13-11.5 ka) and 5) high lake levels and warm and wetter conditions (early Holocene, similar to 11.5-10.0 ka). Average lake level fluctuation in Lago Peten Itza during the late Pleistocene-early Holocene was as much as similar to 25 m. Ostracode analyses suggest that the LGM was characterized by relatively low delta O-18 (+4.7 to +6.0 parts per thousand), and delta C-13 values (-7.1 to -6.4 parts per thousand) in ostracode valves, high inferred water depths and high percentages of broken adult and juvenile valves (>66%), suggesting a high-energy environment, strong currents, partial to full mixing, downslope transport, colder water temperatures and wetter conditions. An increase in the relative abundance of the benthic species L. opesta and higher numbers of broken valves suggest heavy precipitation events during the LGM (similar to 23.7, 21.7, 20.8 and 20.1 ka). HS1 was predominantly dry, but we identified times when lake levels were slightly higher, at the onset of the deglacial and a brief period (similar to 17-16 ka) between HS1b and HS1a. All studied climate proxies indicate wetter and warmer conditions and lake system stability during the BA. Lake levels dropped during the YD and gradually increased during the Preboreal and early Holocene. We demonstrate that modern and fossil ostracode isotopic signatures, species assemblages and taphonomy can be used together with physical and geochemical variables in Lago Peten Itza sediments to make high-resolution inferences about late Pleistocene-early Holocene environmental changes in the lowland Neotropics.

AB  - The presence of shale gas has been confirmed in almost every marine shale distribution area in North America. Formation conditions of shale gas in China are the most favorable for marine, organic-rich shale as well. But there has been little research focusing on shale gas in Qiangtang Basin, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, where a lot of Mesozoic marine shale formations developed. Based on the survey results of petroleum geology and comprehensive test analysis data for Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, for the first time, this paper discusses characteristics of sedimentary development, thickness distribution, geochemistry, reservoir and burial depth of organic-rich shale, and geological conditions for shale gas formation in Qiangtang Basin. There are four sets of marine shale strata in Qiangtang Basin including Upper Triassic Xiaochaka Formation (T(3)x), Middle Jurassic Buqu Formation (J(2)b), Xiali Formation (J(2)x) and Upper Jurassic Suowa Formation (J(3)s), the sedimentary types of which are mainly bathyal-basin facies, open platform-platform margin slope facies, lagoon and tidal-flat facies, as well as delta facies. By comparing it with the indicators of gas shale in the main U.S. basins, it was found that the four marine shale formations in Qiangtang Basin constitute a multi-layer distribution of organic-rich shale, featuring a high degree of thickness and low abundance of organic matter, high thermal evolution maturity, many kinds of brittle minerals, an equivalent content of quartz and clay minerals, a high content of feldspar and low porosity, which provide basic conditions for an accumulation of shale gas resources. Xiaochaka Formation shale is widely distributed, with big thickness and the best gas generating indicators. It is the main gas source layer. Xiali Formation shale is of intermediate thickness and coverage area, with relatively good gas generating indicators and moderate gas formation potential. Buqu Formation shale and Suowa Formation shale are of relatively large thickness, and covering a small area, with poor gas generating indicators, and limited gas formation potential. The shale gas geological resources and technically recoverable resources were estimated by using geologic analogy method, and the prospective areas and potentially favorable areas for Mesozoic marine shale gas in Qiangtang Basin are forecast and analyzed. It is relatively favorable in a tectonic setting and indication of oil and gas, shale maturity, sedimentary thickness and gypsum-salt beds, and in terms of mineral association for shale gas accumulation. But the challenge lies in overcoming the harsh natural conditions which contributes to great difficulties in ground engineering and exploration, and high exploration costs.

TI  - Factors associated with hospitalisations in chronic conditions deemed avoidable: ecological study in the Spanish healthcare system

AB  - Objectives: Potentially avoidable hospitalisations have been used as a proxy for primary care quality. We aimed to analyse the ecological association between contextual and systemic factors featured in the Spanish healthcare system and the variation in potentially avoidable hospitalisations for a number of chronic conditions.
   Methods: A cross-section ecological study based on the linkage of administrative data sources from virtually all healthcare areas (n=202) and autonomous communities (n=16) composing the Spanish National Health System was performed. Potentially avoidable hospitalisations in chronic conditions were defined using the Spanish validation of the Agency for Health Research and Quality (AHRQ) preventable quality indicators. Using 2012 data, the ecological association between potentially avoidable hospitalisations and factors featuring healthcare areas and autonomous communities was tested using multilevel negative binomial regression.
   Results: In 2012, 151 468 admissions were flagged as potentially avoidable in Spain. After adjusting for differences in age, sex and burden of disease, the only variable associated with the outcome was hospitalisation intensity for any cause in previous years (incidence risk ratio 1.19 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.26)). The autonomous community of residence explained a negligible part of the residual unexplained variation (variance 0.01 (SE 0.008)). Primary care supply and activity did not show any association.
   Conclusions: The findings suggest that the variation in potentially avoidable hospitalisations in chronic conditions at the healthcare area level is a reflection of how intensively hospitals are used in a healthcare area for any cause, rather than of primary care characteristics. Whether other non-studied features at the healthcare area level or primary care level could explain the observed variation remains uncertain.

AB  - algae are present in the inner and middle ramp environments of the Attard member. Sporolithaceans and melobesioids dominate the inner ramp, while mastophoroids and peyssonneliaceans are subordinate. In the middle ramp the association of red algae is characterized by an increase of sporolithace-nas and a decrease of melobesioids, mastophoroids and peyssonneliaceans. These assemblages are related to the depth gradient existing from the inner relatively shallow to the progressively deeper middle ramp. However, transportation of red algae down slope may have had an effect on the red algae associations. The shape, morphology and structure of rhodoliths in the inner ramp environment are indicative of high-energy conditions. Nevertheless localized sectors of inner ramp are characterized by morphologies typical of low energy probably related to the presence of areas colonized by seagrass. Rhodoliths from the middle ramp have characteristics of moderately high-energy. The presence of Sporolithon Heydrich and Lithoporella (Foslie) Foslie indicates that the production of carbonate took place under tropical conditions. We suggest that the Mg/Ca ratios may had a control on the flourishing of coralline algae in the Oligocene carbonate factories situated in oligo- to mesotrophic conditions, whereas during Early to Middle Miocene times the trophic conditions were one of the main controlling factor.We investigated the distribution of the red algae assemblages along the depositional profile of the Attard carbonate ramp of Malta (Chattian). The Attard member is ascribed to the Lower Coral line Limestone Formation characterized by 4 members: Maghlaq, Attard, Xlendi and II Mara. Coralline

AB  - The holococcolith Calyptrosphaera sphaeroidea Schiller was collected at Miyake-jima Island, Japan and unialgal cultures established. Alternation of the holococcolith and heterococcolith phases was induced using new culture media (MNK, TR, and LO). Cells synchronized in the holococcolith phase were transferred into TR medium to induce a life cycle change. The heterococcolith phase, which has never been reported before, appeared after more than 40 days. The heterococcoliths were very small elliptical discs, about 0.5 mum wide and 1 mum long. Typical diploid-type organic scales on the cell surface were observed. This phase was very stable in culture and was tolerant of unfavorable conditions. To reverse the life phase, cells in the heterococcolith phase were transferred into cold LO medium and exposed to low temperature (4degreesC) and low light (2 mumol photons.m(-2).s(-1)) for 30 min before culturing at normal conditions (22.5degreesC and 20 mumol photons. m(-2).s(-1)). The swimming behavior of the holococcolith cells seemed to be an indicator of the life cycle phase transition. This article reports for the first time a set of conditions that could control the transition of a coccolithophorid from one life phase to the other. Selected vitamins and trace metals induced the heterococcolith phase, whereas a slightly higher concentration of components in the basic medium along with concomitant stresses of light and temperature induced the holococcolith phase. Based on the results, we propose a hypothesis that the alternation of coccolithophorid life phases is regulated by changes between pelagic and coastal environments coupled with changes in seasonal conditions.

AB  - Water and energy are closely interlinked during their production and consumption processes. The limited and temporary distribution of energy and water resources poses a significant environmental challenge. Industrial wastewater treatment plants are essential elements of water production and also significant energy consumers. This study proposes a methodology for energy management of a wastewater treatment plant. Specifically, it examines the impact of optimum operating conditions on energy costs for a dairy wastewater treatment plant using a dissolved air flotation process. Monte Carlo simulation was used to optimize the parameters and to determine the reuse potential of dairy effluent. Firstly, the optimum operating conditions were determined. The results revealed a maximum fat, oil, and grease removal efficiency of 97% and a chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency of 70%. The optimum conditions were pH of 8, a saturation pressure of 5 bars, and a recirculation ratio of 33%. The optimum concentrations of coagulant and flocculant that contain polyaluminum chloride and cationic polymer were 20 mg/L and 25 mg/L, respectively. The results of the simulation study gave a recirculation ratio of 26.31%, a polyaluminum chloride concentration of 42.5 mg/L, a cationic polymer concentration of 36.31 mg/L, and a saturation pressure of 4.61 bars. Finally, energy cost assessment was performed using a newly developed model which showed that the energy cost indicator of the existing process was lower than optimum operating conditions. The reuse potential of dairy effluent as cooling water was found to be 52%.

AB  - In the Southern Alps, the role of landscape context on meadows plant diversity was evaluated using a multi-model information theoretic approach and five competing hypotheses of landscape context factors: habitat quality (H1), matrix quality (H2), habitat change (H3), matrix quality change (H4) and topography-environmental conditions (H5)- measured at three spatial scales (125, 250 and 500 m). Shannon diversity index and species richness represented plant diversity obtained in 34 plots (100 m(2) size). Landscape context affected plant diversity measures differently. Matrix quality change at larger scale (500 m) was the most supported hypothesis explaining Shannon diversity index, while species richness responded mostly to topography-environmental conditions in the immediate surroundings (125 m). No effects of present-day habitat and matrix quality (H1 and H2) were found. Matrix quality change affected positively Shannon diversity index through an effect of landscape neighbourhood context on farming management practices. Due to the importance of exposure and inclination of slopes, topography-environmental conditions influenced species richness mostly through energy-driven processes and farming management strategies. In terms of scale, matrix quality change was the strongest hypothesis explaining Shannon diversity index at all scales, while the underlying process affecting species richness changed with scale (H5 or H3). Overall, landscape context explained only 25-28 % of the variation in plant diversity, suggesting that landscape management may support biodiversity conservation when comprised in a global strategy including farming practices. In the study area, change in landscape diversity may be a good indicator for Shannon diversity index and south-eastern facing meadows should be preserved.

AB  - Background Factors affecting working equid welfare are wide-ranging and reflect cultural, economic and climatic conditions, the type of work equids are used for, and individual differences in the practices of their handlers. In Mexico working equids are widely used for facilitating agricultural activities, however, welfare issues are common. Objectives To assess working equids across three communities in Mexico, identify predominant welfare problems and document how these problems vary across locations, associated working roles and species type. Study design Cross-sectional survey. Methods The study combined the administration of a wide-ranging questionnaire to equid handlers/owners and a welfare assessment of their animal. 120 equid owners were asked about their equid management practices, the working conditions and health status of their animal. The welfare of their equids (56 donkeys, 7 mules, 57 horses) was assessed by evaluating body condition, signs of illness or injury and behavioural indicators. Results Welfare varied by species, working role, sex and location. The poorest welfare was seen in one of the two arid regions (the third location having a tropical climate). Donkeys had poorer welfare than horses, and equids used for packing had poorer welfare than those used for riding and agroforestry. Overall poor body condition and wounds were the most common problems seen. Main limitations Work type, species type and location strongly co-varied, thus the impact of each factor could not be assessed in isolation. The sample size was relatively small. Conclusions Results showed significant regional variations in welfare, suggesting that environmental and/or cultural variations are producing a major effect on welfare.

AB  - Black shales in the geologic record have long been considered to reflect deposition under anoxic or even euxinic conditions. Although bottom-water anoxia favors deposition of black shales, certain biological indicators, such as benthic fossils and bioturbation, suggest that bottom-water conditions may not have been as persistently anoxic as commonly presumed. Examination of twelve marine carbonaceous shale-bearing units, ranging in age from Middle Proterozoic to Cretaceous, suggests that in addition to paleontological clues, early diagenetic marcasite formed in uncompacted surficial sediments is a reliable indicator of oxygen-bearing bottom waters. Marcasite requires low pH values to form, and oxidation of already existing sedimentary pyrite provides a plausible chemical scenario to achieve that condition. In the studied examples, degraded pyrite framboids and corrosion features on pyrite grains indicate partial pyrite destruction in surface sediments, and suggest that intermittent reoxidation of earlier formed iron sulfides may indeed have generated the low pH values required for marcasite formation. Thus, observations of textures spatially associated with secondary marcasite growth are consistent with a scenario whereby oxygen in overlying sea water drove downward migration of oxidation fronts. Pervasive marcasite in black shales from a wide range of occurrences suggests multiple reoxygenation events during the deposition of these shale units and calls for more dynamic ocean circulation than previously assumed. The latter consideration may, for example, prove important for those instances where a black shale is associated with an oceanic anoxic event (OAE), because these are commonly presumed to have been deposited under fully anoxic conditions.

AB  - An evaluation of water quality and phytoplankton composition was carried out in order to determine the trophic conditions of Lake Patzcuaro (2035 m above sea level), a high altitude tropical lake. Temperatures ranged from 15 to 23-degrees-C Total phosphorus and inorganic nitrogen showed a seasonal variation; highest values coincided with the rainy season (0.48 and 2.1 mg litre-1, respectively). Dissolved oxygen ranged from 2 to 7.9 mg litre-1 at the surface and from 0.6 to 7.3 mg litre-1 on the bottom, the lowest values being found in shallow zones. Average transparency varied from 0.62 to 1.4 m Secchi depth. Rainfall was a primary factor in seasonal variability as it influenced both physical and biological conditions by contributing to the transport and deposition of silt, which mixed with sinking algal cells.
   The composition of the surface phytoplankton segregated along five major divisions comprising a total of 49 species. General seasonal patterns of dominance alternated in a sequence beginning with Bacillariophyta, through Chlorophyta to Cyanophyta. Diatoms, the dominant group from February to early June, included Melosira granulata, Stephanodiscus sp., Synedra sp. and Fragilaria sp. During the rainy season (late June to September), Microcystis aeruginosa, Oscillatoria sp., Anabaena sp., Merismopedia sp., Crucigenia cuadrata, Oocystis lacustris, Selenastrum gracile, Mallomonas sp. and Tetraediella sp. were important. Melosira granulata was present throughout the period of study.
   Spatial and temporal variability in both physical and biological conditions make it difficult to assign a specific trophic state to Lake Patzcuaro. Nevertheless, analysis of the algal community indicates a generally mesotrophic condition.

This biosedimentary event was described in several areas, such as in Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, North America, Oman and Tibet. In Tunisia, filaments are well represented within well laminated black shales constituting the Bahloul Formation, late Cenomanian - early Turonian in age. These black shales were deposited under anoxic conditions developed in an outer ramp environment. Filaments are particularly abundant in the upper part of the Bahloul Formation, which is topped by a condensation level exhibiting encrusted ammonites associated with frequent burrows, and phosphatic and glauconitic grains. In terms of depositional environments, the filament concentrations announce an evolution towards "normal"-marine conditions, which followed the anoxic conditions favouring black-shale formation. This trend coincided with a deepening that led to maximum flooding at the condensation surface. The petrographic study of samples taken along a N-S transect shows a clear evolution of filament structures from distal to proximal ramp. Limestones deposited in the outer ramp environment mainly contain well preserved "pelagic" bivalve shells showing a thin-shelled structure composed of elongated filaments. Laterally, toward the proximal ramp, the bivalve shells are progressively disintegrated, the filaments being arranged parallel to bedding. In an even more proximal setting, filaments appear finer, highly fragmented and arranged without preferential orientation. The Cenomanian-Turonian "pelagic" bivalves thus probably lived in an outer ramp environment and their thin shells disintegrated progressively into filaments. This happened during high energy conditions generated by storms.
   The filament event, which is associated to other bio-events expressed by the extinction and the first occurrence of some pelagic species, could be used to establish local to global correlations.
   When the ammonite Watinoceras, the main early Turonian marker, is rare or absent, the filament-rich facies could indicate the proximity of the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary.
   At a global scale, the filament event illustrates a sea-level rise in relation with eustatic and climatic changes. The maximum flooding of this transgressive event was identified in several localities and dated about 93 Ma. The very high sea-level conditions are favourable to accumulation and preservation of organic-rich facies such as black shales, which illustrate the anoxic event OAE2.
   The abundance of filaments near the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary is an indicator of high organic productivity following a climatic change to warmer conditions. The latter have clearly influenced oceanic water-masses circulation, water column stratification and nutrient partitioning.

AB  - This study assessed the relationship among land use, riparian vegetation, and avian populations at two spatial scales. Our objective was to compare the vegetated habitat in riparian corridors with breeding bird guilds in eight Rhode Island subwatersheds along a range of increasing residential land use. Riparian habitats were characterized with fine-scale techniques (used field transects to measure riparian vegetation structure and plant species richness) at the reach spatial scale, and with coarse-scale landscape techniques (a Geographic Information System to document land-cover attributes) at the subwatershed scale. Bird surveys were conducted in the riparian zone, and the observed bird species were separated into guilds based on tolerance to human disturbance, habitat preference, foraging type, and diet preference. Bird guilds were correlated with riparian vegetation metrics, percent impervious surface, and percent residential land use, revealing patterns of breeding bird distribution. The number of intolerant species predominated below 12% residential development and 3% impervious surface, whereas tolerant species predominated above these levels. Habitat guilds of edge, forest, and wetland bird species correlated with riparian vegetation. This study showed that the application of avian guilds at both stream reach and subwatershed scales offers a comprehensive assessment of effects from disturbed habitat, but that the subwatershed scale is a more efficient method of evaluation for environmental management.

AB  - The basic Master Curve (MC) method for analysis of brittle fracture test results is intended for macroscopically homogeneous ferritic steels only. In reality, the steels in question are seldom fully macroscopically homogeneous. The materials' toughness may depend on the specimen location in the sample. Inhomogeneity may be deterministic or random (or a mixture of both) in nature. Deterministic inhomogencity can be accounted for, provided that the specimen extraction histories are known and enough specimens are tested. Random inhomogeneity is much more difficult to handle. The structural integrity assessment procedure SINTAP contains a lower tail modification of the MC analysis. This enables conservative lower bound type fracture toughness estimates also for inhomogeneous materials. The problem is that the SINTAP method, does not provide information of the tougher material. Therefore, a probabilistic description of the complete material is not possible. In this paper, a,new comparatively simple extension of the MC is introduced for inhomogeneities governed by two separate MC distributions. The extension is shown to be extremely efficient in describing e.g. weld heat-affected zone (HAZ) data. In addition, a simple method for the analysis of random inhomogeneous material consisting of mixed data is presented. The method is also applicable for data sets including several different materials. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The body condition score (BCS) of a dairy cow is an assessment of the proportion of body fat that it possesses, and it is recognized by animal scientists and producers as being an important factor in dairy cattle management. The scale used to measure BCS differs between countries, but low values always reflect emaciation and high values equate to obesity. The intercalving profile of BCS is a mirror image of the milk lactation profile. Cows lose condition for 50 to 100 d postcalving, because of homeorhetic changes that occur in the somatotropic axis and the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin, and the upregulation of lipolytic pathways in adipose tissue. Management and feeding have little effect on early postcalving BCS loss (wk 1 to 4 postcalving) until the natural period of insulin resistance has passed and the somatotropic axis has recoupled. There is evidence, however, that management and diet can influence the timing of recoupling of the somatotropic axis and the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin, and gene expression differences in adipose tissue 30 d in milk confirm an effect of energy intake on lipogenic enzymes. The BCS in which a cow calves, nadir BCS, and the amount of BCS she loses postcalving are associated with milk production, reproduction, and health. Body condition score may also be a valid indicator of animal welfare, but further research is required to determine the effect of BCS and BCS change on how a cow "feels." Although the actual strength of the association may vary, there is relative consistency in the associations among calving and nadir BCS, and BCS change on milk production, postpartum anestrous, the likelihood of a successful pregnancy and days open, the risk of uterine infection, and the risk of metabolic disorders. For many production and health variables, the association with BCS is nonlinear, with an optimum calving BCS of 3.0 to 3.25 (5-point scale); lower calving BCS is associated with reduced production and reproduction, whereas calving BCS >= 3.5 (5-point scale) is associated with a reduction in early lactation dry matter intake and milk production and an increased risk of metabolic disorders. Ongoing research into the automation of body condition scoring suggests that it is a likely candidate to be incorporated into decision support systems in the near future to aid producers in making operational and tactical decisions.

AB  - Background: Individual body growth is controlled in large part by the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of, and competition for, resources. Grizzly bears (Ursus arctos L.) are an excellent species for studying the effects of resource heterogeneity and maternal effects (i.e. silver spoon) on life history traits such as body size because their habitats are highly variable in space and time. Here, we evaluated influences on body size of grizzly bears in Alberta, Canada by testing six factors that accounted for spatial and temporal heterogeneity in environments during maternal, natal and 'capture' (recent) environments. After accounting for intrinsic biological factors (age, sex), we examined how body size, measured in mass, length and body condition, was influenced by: (a) population density; (b) regional habitat productivity; (c) inter-annual variability in productivity (including silver spoon effects); (d) local habitat quality; (e) human footprint (disturbances); and (f) landscape change.
   Results: We found sex and age explained the most variance in body mass, condition and length (R-2 from 0.48-0.64). Inter-annual variability in climate the year before and of birth (silver spoon effects) had detectable effects on the three-body size metrics (R-2 from 0.04-0.07); both maternal (year before birth) and natal (year of birth) effects of precipitation and temperature were related with body size. Local heterogeneity in habitat quality also explained variance in body mass and condition (R-2 from 0.01-0.08), while annual rate of landscape change explained additional variance in body length (R-2 of 0.03). Human footprint and population density had no observed effect on body size.
   Conclusions: These results illustrated that body size patterns of grizzly bears, while largely affected by basic biological characteristics (age and sex), were also influenced by regional environmental gradients the year before, and of, the individual's birth thus illustrating silver spoon effects. The magnitude of the silver spoon effects was on par with the influence of contemporary regional habitat productivity, which showed that both temporal and spatial influences explain in part body size patterns in grizzly bears. Because smaller bears were found in colder and less-productive environments, we hypothesize that warming global temperatures may positively affect body mass of interior bears.

AB  - Pteropods have been hailed as the "canary in the coal mine" for ocean acidification, however, questions remain about their life history, habitat, and the environmental parameters that the isotopic composition of their shells reflect. In order to use pteropods as recorders of ocean chemistry, it is first necessary to understand where they calcify and how this may change through the year, whether this signal is affected by dissolution, and if shells are retained in the subfossil, and eventually fossil, record. Here we create the first annual record of the stable isotopic composition of shells of the pteropod Heliconoides inflatus in the Cariaco Basin, Venezuela utilizing samples and data from the CARIACO time series. Sixty-four H. inflatus specimens from 17 sediment trap samples between November 1996 and April 1998, and 22 specimens from the late Holocene-aged CAR2000-MC-2 core were analyzed for shell condition (an assessment of the amount of dissolution that a shell has experienced), size, and carbon and oxygen isotopic composition. Carbon isotopic measurements of juveniles (1mm) were more variable than those in adults (1 mm), suggesting juvenile pteropods likely have a higher growth rate, and therefore different metabolic vital effects, and a more varied diet than adult pteropods. H. inflatus was found to have an apparent calcification depth of 51.2 +/- 34.0 m, suggesting they calcify at the shallowest part of their diurnal migration in the mixed layer (10-35 m in the Cariaco Basin). H. inflatus shell calcification will therefore only be impacted by changes in water chemistry at mixed layer depths. The shell condition did not impact the stable isotopic composition of the shells in either the sediment trap or core sample, suggesting the potential for using the isotopic composition of pteropod shells as oceanographic proxies when they are preserved. Comparisons between sediment trap and core sample show a 0.5 degrees C warming that is marginally significant and a significant 0.45 parts per thousand decrease in delta C-13 between the late Holocene and the late 1990's. These measurements reflect changes in oceanic conditions linked to anthropogenic fossil fuel emissions known as the Suess effect, and lay the groundwork for establishing pteropods as paleoceanographic proxies in the future.

AB  - Background: Nematodes play a key role in soil processes with alterations in the nematode community structure having the potential to considerably influence ecosystem functioning. As a result fluctuations in nematode diversity and/or community structure can be gauged as a 'barometer' of a soil's functional biodiversity. However, a deficit exists in regards to baseline knowledge and on the impact of specific GM crops on soil nematode populations and in particular in regard to the impact of GM potatoes on the diversity of nematode populations in the rhizosphere. The goal of this project was to begin to address this knowledge gap in regards to a GM potato line, cisgenically engineered for resistance to Phytophthora infestans (responsible organism of the Irish potato famine causing late blight disease). For this, a 3 year (2013, 2014, 2015) field experimental study was completed, containing two conventional genotypes (cvs. Desiree and Sarpo Mira) and a cisgenic genotype (cv. Desiree + Rpi-vnt1). Each potato genotype was treated with different disease management strategies (weekly chemical applications and corresponding no spray control). Hence affording the opportunity to investigate the temporal impact of potato genotype, disease management strategy (and their interaction) on the potato rhizosphere nematode community.
   Results: Nematode structure and diversity were measured through established indices, accounts and taxonomy with factors recording a significant effect limited to the climatic conditions across the three seasons of the study and chemical applications associated with the selected disease management strategy. Based on the metrics studied, the cultivation of the cisgenic potato genotype exerted no significant effect (P > 0.05) on nematode community diversity or structure. The disease management treatments led to a reduction of specific trophic groups (e.g. Predacious c-p = 4), which of interest appeared to be counteracted by a potato genotype with vigorous growth phenotype e.g. cv. Sarpo Mira. The fluctuating climates led to disparate conditions, with enrichment conditions (bacterial feeding c-p = 1) dominating during the wet seasons of 2014 and 2015 versus the dry season of 2013 which induced an environmental stress (functional guild c-p = 2) on nematode communities.
   Conclusions: Overall the functional guild indices in comparison to other indices or absolutes values, delivered the most accurate quantitative measurement with which to determine the occurrence of a specific disturbance relative to the cultivation of the studied cisgenic P. infestans-resistant potatoes.

AB  - We investigated five time-equivalent core sections (180-110 kyr BP) from the Balearic Sea (Menorca Rise), the easternmost Levantine Basin and southwest, south, and southeast of Crete to reconstruct spatial patterns of productivity during deposition of sapropels S5 and S6 in the Mediterranean Sea. Our indicators are Ba, total organic carbon and carbonate contents. We found no indications of Ba remobilization within the investigated core intervals, and used the accumulation rate of biogenic Ba to compute paleoproductivity. Maximum surface water productivity (up to 350 g C/m(2)/yr) was found during deposition of S5 (isotope stage 5e) but pronounced spatial variability is evident. Coeval sediment intervals in the Balearic Sea show very little productivity change, suggesting that chemical and biological environments in the eastern and western Mediterranean basins were decoupled in this interval. We interpret the spatial variability as the result of two different modes of nutrient delivery to the photic zone: river-derived nutrient input and shoaling of the pycnocline/nutricline to the photic zone. The productivity increase during the formation of S6 was moderate compared to S5 and had a less marked spatial variability within the study area of the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Given that S6 formed during a glacial interval, glacial boundary conditions such as high wind stress and/or cooler surface water temperatures apparently favored lateral and vertical mixing and prevented the development of the spatial gradients within the Eastern Mediterranean Sea (EMS) observed for S5. A non-sapropel sediment interval with elevated Ba content and depleted O-18/O-16 ratios in planktonic foraminifer calcite was detected between S6 and S5 that corresponds to the weak northern hemisphere insolation maximum at 150 kyr. At this time, productivity apparently increased up to five times over surrounding intervals, but abundant benthic fauna show that the deep water remained oxic. Following our interpretation, the interval denotes a failed sapropel, when a weaker monsoon did not force the EMS into permanent stratification. The comparison of interglacial and glacial sapropels illustrates the relevance of climatic boundary conditions in the northern catchment in determining the facies and spatial variability of sapropels within the EMS.

AB  - A noncalcareous volcanic paleosol succession from the upper montane rain forest of the Cordillera de Talamanca, Costa Rica (Lat. 9 degrees 41 ' 03.3 '' N; Long. 83 degrees 53 ' 45.9 '' W; 2507 m elev.) provides evidence for changing Quaternary elevation, climate, and ecosystems. Basal deposits (Crb horizons) are saprolitized, porphyritic andesite enriched in Si, At, and Fe, and depleted in base cations, which record an earliest period of very intense weathering forming a leached residuum of smectite-kaolinite and Fe-oxides (or oxyhydroxides) on a mature paleolandscape, probably in tropical lowlands. Paleo-saprolite deposits are sharply overlain by interbedded lapilli tuffs and two paleosols with dark-colored, organic C-rich (2-3 wt.%) Ab horizons (one containing abundant grass pollen), interpreted as mollic epipedons of grassland soils (andic Mollisol-like paleosols) with delta C-13 values (-24.5 parts per thousand PDB) that record a former C3 grassland ecosystem. Possible pedogenic carbonate (Btkb) horizons (with all carbonate removed by overprinting by younger pedogenic processes) provide evidence of former drier and drained conditions. Uppermost buried soils (mainly Btb horizons) are non-calcareous, clay-rich, andic Ultisol-like paleosols that record pedogenesis under climates similar to current conditions, with highly weathered clay mineral suites. AMS dating of charcoal from the upper (Btb) paleosol constrains a latest glacial age (36,640 +/- 650 C-14 yr BP; ages for two additional deeper samples were > 43-48 ka) for the 2Btb paleosol. Uplift rates of the Cordillera de Talamanca are estimated as 1 km/1 Ma. Consequently, the described paleosols provide evidence for: 1) initial lowland pedogenesis, perhaps at 2-3 Ma, 2) regional uplift and major unconformity, volcanism and development of a grassland ecosystem that has delta C-13 values similar to those measured in modem, high-elevation paramo sites in the cordillera (-24.4 to -26.3 parts per thousand PDB) but formed mollic epipedons and pedogenic carbonates, which do not characterize modem paramo soils, followed by 3) continued late Pleistocene volcanism and pedogenesis in environments similar to current oak-dominated montane rain forest conditions. The paleosol succession provides a valuable record of dynamic climate-ecosystem change and uplift history in the Cordillera de Talamanca that can complement and extend existing bog and lake sediment records.

AB  - Legal definitions exert a significant impact on the waste management strategy. Waste that is technically suitable for recovery does not automatically become a raw material if there is no market for it, or its use is not commercially effective and, hence, they should be disposed of. The majority of disposed wastes, including recyclable waste, are not environmentally safe. Waste as a freshly generated anthropogenic material is not geochemically stable. Przezchlebie fly ash surface pond (Upper Silesia, Poland) in the post-closure stage was subject to field validation of the results of laboratory leaching/extraction tests and long-term column experiments on fly ash (FA) leaching behaviour under controlled conditions for environmental risk assessment. The study showed: (i) the possibility of a discontinuous non-linear time delayed increase of pollution potential of disused 'non-hazardous' large-volume waste in the dumping sites to the hazardous level; (ii) inconsistency of the laboratory leaching tests and the actual leaching behaviour of trace metals, particularly when equilibria conditions are dictated by kinetically determined reactions where the test results reflected entirely wash-out (I) and dissolution (II) phases, but did not comprise delayed release (III) phase; and (iii) necessity of life-cycle screening/monitoring of 'non-hazardous' dumping sites for contaminant release as a function of the primary (pH-Eh, ionic strength, ionic composition of solute) and secondary controlling factors (L/S-liquid to solid ratio, water flow conditions) along the vertical profile of an anthropogenic or natural vadose zone. These data are to be used to develop long-term predictive hydrogeochemical models and their field validation, and for providing an early warning and remedial actions with respect to the particular site. The formation of pH (and Eh) as a function of time-dependent (kinetically defined) processes appeared to be a key issue for a correct prediction of the leaching behaviour of waste. The presented case study on FA shows that waste, even those considered non-hazardous and fit for use in a commercially proven applications, should not be treated the same way as a natural raw material. To facilitate waste utilisation and disposal in environmentally safe way and to prioritise its use, reliable environmental risk assessment prediction models and testing procedures, as well as special enforcement strategy and regulations, should be developed with respect to waste and not 'materials.'

AB  - While almost all life cycle assessment (LCA) studies published so far are based on generic vehicles, type approval energy consumption as well as emission data, and application scenarios related to standardized laboratory-based driving cycles, this projects aims at quantifying the LCA based on a real-world vehicle composition and energy consumption data measured before and after the electric conversion of a mini class car. Furthermore, consequences of a second life of a vehicle's glider on the environmental impact were investigated.
   After having driven 100,000 km, a Smart was converted from combustion to electric in a laboratory project. The inventory was developed grounded upon materials data from laboratory measurements during the conversion process as well as on real-world energy consumption data prior and after the conversion. Three base models are compared in this life cycle impact assessment: a conventional new Smart (combustion engine), a new electric Smart, and a Smart converted from combustion engine to electric. Together with two sensitivity analyses (four different electricity mixes as well as urban vs. mixed driving conditions) and two EOL treatments, 36 scenarios have been quantified. The inventory is based on Ecoinvent database v 2.2 as a background system and includes raw material extraction.
   In urban use, the modeled battery electric vehicle has a favorable environmental impact compared to the ICEV even when charged with the German electricity mix of the year 2013. The advantage in summed up endpoints of the converted Smart is 23 % vs. the new electric Smart on average for the mixed driving conditions and 26 % for the urban driving conditions, respectively. Over a variety of impact categories, electricity consumption during battery cell production in China as well as impacts due to microelectronic components dominated the life cycle. Results for 18 midpoint categories, endpoints for damages to human health, to resource quality and to ecosystem quality as well as the Single score endpoints are reported.
   This investigation points out that real-world treatments in inventory development can more specifically outline the environmental advantages of the electric car. The electric conversion of a used combustion engine vehicle can save an additional 16 % (CO2-eq) and 19 % (single score endpoints) of the environmental impact over a lifetime, respectively, when compared with the new BEV.

AB  - Background. The Gotland Basin spawning ground is one of three main spawning areas of Baltic cod, Gadus morhua Linnaeus, 1758. The threshold water parameters for cod development are the salinity exceeding 11% and the oxygen level above 2 mL . L-1. Such conditions are only present when the 11% isohaline is above the 2 mL . L-1 isooxygen. In such situation the water volume between the isolines is called the "suitable reproduction volume". When the position of the isolines is reversed, the salinity and the oxygen level of the water layer demarcated by them are below the required thresholds and as such the water is unsuitable for the cod development. We refer to it as the "unsuitable reproduction volume". The main aim of the presently reported study was to examine whether variations in suitable and unsuitable reproduction habitat estimates could explain the fluctuations in cod recruitment.
   Material and methods. The suitable and unsuitable reproduction volumes in the Gotland Basin were estimated based on single point observations at three oceanographic monitoring stations using the contouring software Balthypsograph. To test the spatial hydrological heterogeneity in the Gotland Basin we used 15 observations during 1969-1995 on four stations in each of two transects. The oceanographic monitoring and demersal trawl research survey data from 1974-2012 have been used in analyses.
   Results. The sufficient reproduction conditions in the southern Gotland Basin persisted only until 1981. In later decades the reproduction potential of the Gotland Basin has decreased. The latest major North Sea water inflows in 1993 and 2003 in the Central Gotland Basin formed the suitable reproduction volume below the layers where cod eggs are floating. A significant relation between the recruit abundance and suitable and the unsuitable reproduction volumes was found only for the Southern Gotland Basin (P < 0.03).
   Conclusions. We demonstrated that single-point estimates sufficiently quantify the reproduction conditions in the Gotland Basin and thus can be used for estimation of the reproduction volumes. The unsuitable reproduction volume concept can be used as an ecological indicator for egg survival probability in the Gotland Basin. However, it is too premature to re-define the concept of the suitable reproduction volume because it is applicable only to the Gotland spawning ground.

AB  - Introduction. Archaeological sites of the 4th century AD absent on most of the area of the Late Sarmatian culture. This may be both due to the difficulties of their identification and absence of chronological indicators and due to migrations of nomads from the steppe zone. Perhaps unfavorable climatic conditions for nomadic cattle breeding affected the decrease in the number of nomadic population in the 4th century AD. Methods and materials. The paleosoil data allow reconstructing the ecological situation in dry and desert steppes in the first centuries AD. The initial stage of the Late Sarmatian era (the late 2nd - the early 3rd centuries AD) was marked by arid conditions with cold winters with little snow, which were favorable for cattle breeding in the steppe zone. In the late 3rd century and at the turn of the 3rd - 4th centuries, the processes of humidization began - an increase in climate humidity, which favorably affected the ecological situation in the steppe: high grass, area watering. Such situation provided successful livestock grazing in summer. However, in winter, an increase in humidity led to heavy snowfalls and snowstorms, an increase in snow cover, frequent winter thaws, rain, fog, that were replaced by periods of cooling. At this time, grass icing and ice crust formation occured. Analysis. In those conditions, the number of days, when cattle grazing was impossible, increased. As a consequence, there was weakening and disease of the livestock, until the complete loss of the herd. This was followed by the decrease of population. Results. The humidization processes primarily affected the Southern Urals and in the final of the 3rd century reached the Volga-Don steppes. This could be the reason for the outflow of the Late Sarmatian population from the Southern Urals to the Volga regions. In the 4th century AD, the steppes from the Urals to the Lower Don were practically depopulated. The beginning of the humid period, which was unfavorable for the nomadic economy, had a positive effect on settled agricultural societies. The Early Alanian culture of the Central Caucasus demonstrates the dynamics of active development throughout the Late Sarmatian period, including in the 4th c. AD. The duration of this humid period is difficult to estimate, however, in the Hun Epoch, steppes remained almost uninhabited, as evidenced by the small number of sites of this time.

AB  - Watershed land cover is widely used as a predictor of stream-ecosystem condition. However, numerous spatial factors can confound the interpretation of correlative analyses between land cover and stream indicators, particularly at broad spatial scales. We used a stream-monitoring data set collected from the Coastal Plain of Maryland, USA to address analytical challenges presented by (1) collinearity of land-cover class percentages, (2) spatial autocorrelation of land cover and stream data, (3) intercorrelations among and spatial autocorrelation within abiotic intermediaries that link land cover to stream biota, and (4) spatial arrangement of land cover within watersheds. We focused on two commonly measured stream indicators, nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) and macroinvertebrate assemblages, to evaluate how different spatial considerations may influence results. Partial correlation analysis of land-cover percentages revealed that simple correlations described relationships that could not be separated from the effects of other land-cover classes or relationships that changed substantially when the influences of other land-cover classes were taken into account. Partial Mantel tests showed that all land-cover percentages were spatially autocorrelated, and this spatial phenomenon accounted for much of the variation in macroinvertebrate assemblages that could naively be attributed to certain classes (e.g., percentage cropland). We extended our use of partial Mantel tests into a path-analytical framework and identified several independent pathways between percentage developed land and instream measurements after factoring out spatial autocorrelation and other confounding variables; however, under these conditions, percentage cropland was only linked to nitrate-N. Further analyses revealed that spatial arrangement of land cover, as measured by areal buffers and distance weighting, influenced the amount of developed land, resulting in a threshold change in macroinvertebrate-assemblage composition. Moreover, distance-weighted percentage cropland improved predictions of stream nitrate-N concentrations in small watersheds, but not in medium or large ones. Collectively, this series of analyses clarified the magnitude and critical scales of effects of different land-cover classes on Coastal Plain stream ecosystems and may serve as an analytical framework for other studies. Our results suggest that greater emphasis should be placed on these important spatial considerations; otherwise, we risk obscuring the relationships between watershed land cover and the condition of stream ecosystems.

AB  - Creating methods to achieve sustainable development is a global challenge faced by civilization in the 21st century. As an operational element of sustainability science, landscape sustainability science (LSS) plays an important role in the development of methods for sustainable development. Landscape services (LS) is a newly emerging concept associated with ecosystem services (ES) that exhibits great potential for promoting landscape sustainability research despite its nascent stage of development. In this article, the historical development of the LS concept is reviewed, and the special implications and advantages of LS relative to ES for landscape practices are further expanded. Furthermore, a sustainability-oriented LS conceptual framework specifically developed for the integration of LS and landscape sustainability research is proposed. We refer to this framework as the landscape service capability-flow-demand (LSCFD) framework. Finally, the prospects for the application of the new framework in landscape sustainability assessments are explored. By using LSCFD, we suggest that a distinction be made between landscape service capacity (LSC), landscape service flow (LSF), and landscape service demand (LSD). LSC refers to the long-term potential of a landscape for producing various types of materials, energy, information, conditions, and effectiveness that are valued by people. LSF refers to the transmission process for material, energy, information, conditions and effectiveness from a landscape to benefit people that occur either within or across the landscape. LSD is the societal dimension of LS and refers to the types and volume of material, energy, information, conditions, and effectiveness that a landscape's inhabitants need to satisfy their existence, livelihood, and development. Based on the LSCFD framework, landscape sustainability assessments can be performed by considering the following four areas: LSC sustainability, LSF sustainability, LSD sustainability, and the dynamic equilibrium relationships among the other three areas. Thus, various types of LS capabilities, integrated services capabilities, and the diversity and balance of LS demands should be evaluated. Additionally, analyzing the supplying regions of LS flow, spatial orientation of the population that benefits, transmission media, transmission mechanism, and transmission limiting factors is essential to explore the dynamic equilibrium relationships between LS capability, flow, and demand. The LSCFD concept framework of LS provides a method for implementing LSS into actual practice. In the context of global environmental changes and sustainable development, the LSCFD framework of LS will definitely contribute to future research.

AB  - Palaeolimnological techniques were applied to spring habitats in the Trentino Region (NE Italy) as a test in order to reconstruct past environmental changes in these crucial and fragile milieus. Three different sites were selected from a database of more than one hundred on the basis of morphological, geological, and biological factors, including human impact evaluation: Nambrone, Paul and Madonnina Val Lomasona. Sampling was performed by adapting standard lake-sediment coring methods, and the retrieved sediment was described and subsampled following standard "lake" procedures. Field work and sedimentological analyses revealed clear influence from nearby fluvial environment for the Nambrone site, whereas Paul and Madonnina Val Lomasona were selected for further analyses (e.g., dating, diatoms, chironomids). Lead-210 and Caesium-137 dating methods were used to obtain a chronological framework, in addition to historical information on land use and other events in the area. The upper part of the Paul sequence presented organic rich sediment compatible with spring environments, but the lower and essentially detrital part appeared to record alluvial deposition, probably linked to extraordinary flood events (1882, 1966). This interpretation is indirectly confirmed by the records of the fallout nuclides Caesium-137 and Lead-210, that were both unfortunately concentrated in the topmost 1 cm, making it impossible to construct a normal age-depth profile. Madonnina Val Lomasona sedimentological and biological indicators point to a marked charge around ca 5 cm, dividing the sequence in two units, corresponding to different environmental conditions. Although the interpretation of the dating results is not completely straightforward, the assembled data suggest that the upper 5 cm of the record represents ca the last 50 years. During this period we found typical limnocrenic, clear-water spring conditions, while before 1960s the coexistence of lotic and lentic chironomid species including several opportunistic ones and the low richness, emphasized the presence of a disturbance (e.g., highly variable flow and/or trophic conditions), as confirmed also by diatom assemblages and,sedimentological features. The recorded disturbance is probably linked to a water-level change due to the local land use, as also testified by historical data. The results of this study support the idea that carefully selected spring sites might be approached with adapted palaeolimnological techniques to extract valuable palaeoenvironmental information. However, it also highlighted the low percentage of "good sites" (1%) and considerable difficulties in coring and sampling without disturbing the sediment.

AB  - The epithelial cell layer that lines the gills of fish controls paracellular permeation of chemicals through tight junctions. The integrity of tight junctions can be affected by inflammation, which likely affects the bioavailability of chemicals. Here, the inflammation of the rainbow trout gill cell line RTgillW1 was induced via exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Cells were then coexposed to extracts of oil sands processaffected water (OSPW), which contain complex mixtures of chemicals. After 24 h of exposure, cells exposed to LPS showed a reduction in transepithelial electrical resistance, an indicator of ase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis determined that abundances of transcripts of genes coding for tight junction proteins were significantly less in cells exposed to 20, 50, or 100 mg L-1 LPS. Chemical analysis revealed increased permeation of constituents of OSPW across epithelia at all studied LPS concentrations. These in vitro findings were confirmed in vivo in rainbow trout exposed to LPS and OSPW for 48 h, which resulted in greater accumulation of chemicals relative to that for fish exposed to OSPW alone. Our results demonstrated that inflammation and disruption of tight junctions could lead to greater uptake of potentially harmful chemicals from the environment, which has implications for mixture risk assessment.

AB  - Accumulation of heavy metals on naturally grown epiphytic lichens and its impact on their physiological integrity was examined. Lichen species collected from differently polluted areas (oil refinery, roadside) were compared with the species collected from relatively lesser polluted areas. Heavy metal buildup in lichens were found to have significant damaging effect on their physiological health. Pb, Cd, Zn, Cu, Co, Ni and Cr concentrations were found to be higher in the lichen species collected from both the polluted areas. Metal accumulation in lichen thallus has positive correlation at p <= 0.01 (r = 0.417 to 0.772) with the recorded protein concentrations. Whereas, other studied parameters like chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations, membrane stability and pH documented negative correlation with the accumulated heavy metals. However, abundance of species Dirinaria applanata and Dirinaria sp. at polluted areas with better protein content indicates their tolerance towards heavy metal. Chlorophyll degradation and protein contents in the lichens were found to be efficient physiological parameters to correlate with the air quality of a region. Sensitivity to heavy metals may be the cause of sparsity of species Arthonia cinnabarina, Cryptothecia subnidulans and Lecanora sp. in the polluted areas. However, lesser sensitivity to heavy metals favored the growth of species Dirinaria applanata and Dirinaria sp. even in higher polluted areas.

AB  - Measurement of changes of pH at various intracellular compartments has potential to solve questions concerning the processing of endocytosed material, regulation of the acidification process, and also acidification of vesicles destined for exocytosis. To monitor these events, the nanosized optical pH probes need to provide ratiometric signals in the optically transparent biological window, target to all relevant intracellular compartments, and to facilitate imaging at subcellular resolution without interference from the biological matrix. To meet these criteria we sensitize the surface conjugated pH sensitive indicator via an upconversion process utilizing an energy transfer from the nanoparticle to the indicator. Live cells were imaged with a scanning confocal microscope equipped with a low-energy 980 nm laser excitation, which facilitated high resolution and penetration depth into the specimen, and low phototoxicity needed for long-term imaging. Our upconversion nanoparticle resonance energy transfer based sensor with polyethylenimine-coating provides high colloidal stability, enhanced cellular uptake, and distribution across cellular compartments. This distribution was modulated with membrane integrity perturbing treatment that resulted into total loss of lysosomal compartments and a dramatic pH shift of endosomal compartments. These nanoprobes are well suited for detection of pH changes in in vitro models with high biological background fluorescence and in in vivo applications, e.g., for the bioimaging of small animal models.

AB  - Intracellular compartmentalisation is a significant barrier to the successful nucleocytosolic delivery of biologics. The endocytic system has been shown to be responsible for compartmentalisation, providing an entry point, and trigger(s) for the activation of drug delivery systems. Consequently, many of the technologies used to understand endocytosis have found utility within the field of drug delivery. The use of fluorescent proteins as markers denoting compartmentalisation within the endocytic system has become commonplace. Several of the limitations associated with the use of green fluorescent protein (GFP) within the context of drug delivery have been explored here by asking a series of related questions: (1) Are molecules that regulate fusion to a specific compartment (i.e. Rab- or SNARE-GFP fusions) a good choice of marker for that compartment? (2) How reliable was GFP-marker overexpression when used to define a given endocytic compartment? (3) Can glutathione-s-transferase (GST) fused in frame with GFP (GST-GFP) act as a fluid phase endocytic probe? (4) Was GFP fluorescence a robust indicator of (GFP) protein integrity? This study concluded that there are many appropriate and useful applications for GFP; however, thought and an understanding of the biological and physicochemical character of these markers are required for the generation of meaningful data.

AB  - Simple Summary The potentially important role of forests in climate change mitigation suggests a strong need for a more detailed understanding of these ecosystems. Besides climatic conditions, diverse forest vegetation creates varied conditions for the activity of soil microorganisms, and particular attention should be focused on a comprehensive study on the influence of different forest types on microbial activities. We conducted an experiment on six different forest soils (two coniferous, two deciduous, and two mixed sites comprising trees of different ages) collected from the same region (Lublin Upland, Poland) to assess the relationship between forest type and seasonal changes in microbial parameters. The annual mean values of the soil microbial indicators suggest that the mature deciduous stand was the most sustainable in microbial activities among the forest soils investigated. The diversity of the forest environment and the multifactorial dependence of the microbiological activity of forest soils necessitates further research in this field, especially using the same soil types. An understanding of forest ecosystem functioning can also be useful for forest management. Understanding the functioning of different forest ecosystems is important due to their key role in strategies for climate change mitigation, especially through soil C sequestration. In controlled laboratory conditions, we conducted a preliminary study on six different forest soils (two coniferous, two deciduous, and two mixed sites comprising trees of different ages) collected from the same region. The aim was to explore any differences and assess seasonal changes in soil microbial parameters (basal respiration BR, microbial biomass C-mic, metabolic quotient qCO(2), dehydrogenase activity DHA, and C-mic:C-org ratio). Indicator- and forest-specific seasonality was assessed. In addition to litter input, soil parameters (pH, nutrient content, texture and moisture) strongly regulated the analyzed microbial indicators. PCA analysis indicated similarity between mature mixed and deciduous forests. Among annual mean values, high C-mic and DHA with simultaneously low qCO(2) suggest that the mature deciduous stand was the most sustainable in microbial activities among the investigated forest soils. Research on the interrelationship between soil parameters and forest types with different tree ages needs to be continued and extended to analyze a greater number of forest and soil types.

AB  - The Wet Chemistry Laboratory (WCL) on the Mars Phoenix Lander measured ions in a soil-water extraction and found Na+, K+, H+ (pH), Ca2+, Mg2+, SO42+; ClO4-, and Cl-. Equilibrium models offer insights into salt phases that were originally present in the Phoenix soil, which dissolved to form the measured WCL solution; however, there are few experimental datasets for single cation perchlorates (ClO4-), and none for mixed perchlorates, at low temperatures, which are needed to build models. In this study, we measure ice and salt solubilities in binary and ternary solutions in the Na-Ca-Mg-ClO4 system, and then use this data, along with existing data, to construct a low-temperature Pitzer model for perchlorate brines. We then apply our model to a nominal WCL solution. Previous studies have modeled either freezing of a WCL solution or evaporation at a single temperature. For the first time, we model evaporation at subzero temperatures, which is relevant for dehydration conditions that might occur at the Phoenix site. Our model indicates that a freezing WCL solution will form ice, KClO4, hydromagnesite (3MgCO(3)center dot Mg(OH)(2)center dot 3H(2)O), calcite (CaCO3), meridianiite (MgSO4 center dot 11H(2)O), MgCl2 center dot 12H(2)O, NaClO4 center dot 2H(2)O, and Mg(ClO4)(2)center dot 6H(2)O at the eutectic (209 K). The total water held in hydrated salt phases at the eutectic is similar to 1.2 wt.%, which is much greater than hydrated water contents when evaporation is modeled at 298.15 K (similar to 0.3 wt.%). Evaporation of WCL solutions at lower temperatures (down to 210 K) results in lower water activities and the formation of more dehydrated minerals, e. g. kieserite (MgSO4 center dot H2O) instead of meridianiite. Potentially habitable brines, with water activity aw >0.6, can occur when soil temperatures are above 220 K and when the soil liquid water content is greater than 0.4 wt.% (100 x g(H2O) g(soil)(-1)). In general, modeling indicates that mineral assemblages derived from WCL-type solutions are characteristic of the soil temperature, water content, and water activity conditions under which they formed, and are useful indicators of past environmental conditions.

AB  - We studied an old growth deciduous forest seed bank to examine how its potential role in regeneration is shaped by natural forest environment. Our research questions were: is the spatial pattern of seed bank influenced by local variation in elevation, soil moisture and light intensity, and what is the impact of herb layer characteristics on seed bank pattern. We recorded species composition of the herb layer and seed bank on a 2 x 40 m study plot divided into 20 quadrates, situated in a natural oak-hornbeam forest, in the Bialowieza Primeval Forest, (NE Poland). Soil cores were sampled from two soil layers (0-5 cm and 5-10 cm) yielding altogether 40 samples of a total 15.9 dm(3) and 0.159 m(2). Seeds were extracted from soil samples under a microscope. Ellenberg indicator values were used to characterize light (L) and moisture (F) conditions. Relative quadrate elevation was averaged for nine points. There were 6.65 x 10(3) seeds m(-2) in upper soil layer and 3.00 x 10(3) seeds m(-2) in lower soil layer. Seed bank structure constituted of patches 6 m diameter in the upper soil layer and 4 m in the lower soil layer. Aggregated pattern of the seed bank was influenced by clumped distribution of plants in the herb layer. Seed bank species richness in the upper soil layer was correlated with moisture (r = 0.485, P =0.03) and light (r = 0.526, P = 0.0172) values. Seed densities were correlated with moisture (r = 0.848 P <0.0001 upper and r = 0.491 P = 0.0278 lower soil layer) and light (r = 0.803 P <0.0001 upper and r = 0.751 P = 0.0001 lower soil layer). Seed density in upper soil layer was negatively correlated with elevation (r =-0.485 P = 0.0422). Higher seed density and species richness of the seed bank associated with better light conditions and higher moisture is probably caused by higher seed production in favourable conditions, and factors promoting seed persistence in soil. Our results indicate, that even subtle changes in light, moisture and mean relative elevation can shape seed bank spatial pattern on a fine local scale, differentiating the response of this community to small scale disturbances present in natural forests.

AB  - PASADO is a multidisciplinary Potrok Aike Sediment Archive Drilling prOject, which was conducted from 2008 to 2013, focusing on the sedimentary record of the volcanic crater maar Laguna PotrokAike (52 degrees S, 70 degrees W, 116 m asl) in southern Patagonia, Argentina. It represents one of the few non-glacial and extra-Andean sediment archives studied so far on the continental landmass between subtropical South America and Antarctica that covers the entire Holocene and the Late Glacial. In this study, a high-resolution diatom analysis of the Late Glacial time interval situated between 15.60 and 10.51 ka cal. BP was performed on the PASADO sediment core. This period is of particular interest as it encompasses the Antarctic Cold Reversal (ACR), as well as the Younger Dryas (YD) chronozone. To better refine the variability of environmental and climatic conditions of this Late Glacial time interval, we combined our data with those of a microsedimentological analysis conducted on the same sediments and for the same period to infer changes in lake level and water column stratification. Our study revealed that diatoms are an ideal proxy to complement microsedimentological analyses by providing important independent information on the past limnological dynamics of Laguna Potrok Aike and the paleoclimatic conditions that prevailed during the Late Glacial in the study area and allows a new way of explaining shifts in the position of Southern Hemisphere Westerly Winds (SWW) during the Late Glacial. Peaks of planktonic diatoms, particularly Cyclostephanos patagonicus, correspond to previously detected total organic carbon (TOC), Ca/Si, Ca and Mn peaks and support the hypothesis that relatively high lake levels and weaker SWW have prevailed during the Late Glacial. Moreover, a cyclic pattern, observed both in the biological and geochemical indicators, suggests at least five shifts in the position of the SWW from the beginning of the ACR to the end of the YD. The periodicity of these shifts seems to be related to Antarctic ice-sheet discharge (AID) events in the Scotia Sea that coincide with enhanced iceberg flux from the Antarctic ice-sheet.

AB  - This paper describes the influence of seawater ageing on composites used in a range of marine structures, from boats to tidal turbines. Accounting for environmental degradation is an essential element in the multi-scale modelling of composite materials but it requires reliable test data input. The traditional approach to account for ageing effects, based on testing samples after immersion for different periods, is evolving towards coupled studies involving strong interactions between water diffusion and mechanical loading. These can provide a more realistic estimation of long-term behaviour but still require some form of acceleration if useful data, for 20 year lifetimes or more, are to be obtained in a reasonable time. In order to validate extrapolations fromshort to long times, it is essential to understand the degradation mechanisms, so both physico-chemical and mechanical test data are required. Examples of results from some current studies on more environmentally friendly materials including bio-sourced composites will be described first. Then a case study for renewable marine energy applications will be discussed. In both cases, studies were performed first on coupons at the material level, then during structural testing and analysis of large components, in order to evaluate their long-term behaviour.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PRESSURE VESSEL TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
LA  - English
CP  - International Pipeline Conference (IPC 2006)
AB  - The acceptance criteria used in reliability based design and assessment are defined as a set of reliability targets (where reliability is defined as 1.0 minus the probability of failure). Because of the linear nature of pipeline systems, reliability targets are defined on a per kilometer-year basis. Such targets are directly applicable to failure causes (or limit states) that are equally likely to occur anywhere along a segment of the pipeline (e. g., equipment impact or yielding/rupture of defect-free pipe under internal pressure). They are, however, not directly applicable for design and assessment situations involving limit states that apply at known specific locations. Examples include design for geotechnical loads on a particular unstable slope or integrity assessment of a corrosion defect at a specific location (as determined by in-line inspection). In previous work, reliability targets for natural gas pipelines have been developed on the basis of appropriate societal and individual risk criteria. This paper describes an approach to adapt these targets and demonstrate compliance with them, for location-specific limit states. The approach is based on using separate checks to ensure that the individual and societal risk criteria underlying the targets are met. An example is included to demonstrate application of the approach to design a pipeline on an unstable slope. [DOI: 10.1115/1.3110019]

AB  - Simple Summary Heat stress alters the normal physiological status, compromising the function of organs such as the small intestine. However, evidence exists of a wider distribution of organ dysfunction, stemming from factors such as a reduction in blood flow due to redistribution to the skin for increased radiant heat loss to the environment. Simultaneously, assessing organ dysfunction at multiple locations presents technical difficulties, and hence studies are lacking. Therefore, the aim of this experiment was to determine the pattern of Evans Blue Dye distribution as a cost-effective indicator of organ dysfunction in HS chickens supplemented with betaine. The results showed that Evans Blue Dye concentration increased in the kidney and muscle during heat stress, while such concentration was reduced with betaine. Therefore, betaine could improve the broiler's tolerance to heat stress, and Evans Blue Dye may be a useful tool for investigating the effects of heat stress on broiler organ dysfunction.
   Abstract In a 2 x 2 factorial design, 60 male Ross-308 broilers were fed either a control or 1 g/kg betaine diet and housed under thermoneutral (TN) or heat stress (HS) conditions. Broilers were acclimated to diets for 1 week under TN (25 degrees C), then either kept at TN or HS, where the temperature increased 8 h/day at 33 degrees C and 16 h/day at 25 degrees C for up to 10 days. Respiration rate (RR) was measured at four time points, and on each of 1, 2, 3, 7 and 10 days of HS, 12 broilers were injected with 0.5 mg/kg of Evans Blue Dye (EBD) solution to quantify regional changes in tissue damage. Betaine was quantified in tissues, and ileal damage was assessed via morphometry and transepithelial resistance (TER). Heat stress elevated RR (p < 0.001) and resulted in reduced villous height (p = 0.009) and TER (p < 0.001), while dietary betaine lowered RR during HS (p < 0.001), increased betaine distribution into tissues, and improved ileal villous height (p < 0.001) and TER (p = 0.006). Heat stress increased EBD in the muscle and kidney of chickens fed the control diet but not in those receiving betaine. Overall, these data indicate that supplemented betaine is distributed to vital organs and the gastrointestinal tract, where it is associated with improved tolerance of HS. Furthermore, EBD markers help reveal the effects of HS on organs dysfunction.

AB  - Background: The presence of natural and industrial jarosite type-compounds in the environment could have important implications in the mobility of potentially toxic elements such as lead, mercury, arsenic, chromium, among others. Understanding the dissolution reactions of jarosite-type compounds is notably important for an environmental assessment (for water and soil), since some of these elements could either return to the environment or work as temporary deposits of these species, thus would reduce their immediate environmental impact.
   Results: This work reports the effects of temperature, pH, particle diameter and Cr(VI) content on the initial dissolution rates of K-Cr(VI)-jarosites (KFe3[(SO4)(2-X)(CrO4)(X)](OH)(6)). Temperature (T) was the variable with the strongest effect, followed by pH in acid/alkaline medium (H3O+/OH-). It was found that the substitution of CrO42- in Y-site and the substitution of H3O+ in M-site do not modify the dissolution rates. The model that describes the dissolution process is the unreacted core kinetic model, with the chemical reaction on the unreacted core surface. The dissolution in acid medium was congruent, while in alkaline media was incongruent. In both reaction media, there is a release of K+, SO42- and CrO42- from the KFe3[(SO4)(2-X)(CrO4)(X)](OH)(6) structure, although the latter is rapidly absorbed by the solid residues of Fe(OH)(3) in alkaline medium dissolutions. The dissolution of KFe3[(SO4)(2-X)(CrO4)(X)](OH)(6) exhibited good stability in a wide range of pH and T conditions corresponding to the calculated parameters of reaction order n, activation energy E-A and dissolution rate constants for each kinetic stages of induction and progressive conversion.
   Conclusions: The kinetic analysis related to the reaction orders and calculated activation energies confirmed that extreme pH and T conditions are necessary to obtain considerably high dissolution rates. Extreme pH conditions (acidic or alkaline) cause the preferential release of K+, SO42- and CrO42- from the KFe3[(SO4)(2-X)(CrO4)(X)](OH)(6) structure, although CrO42- is quickly adsorbed by Fe(OH)(3) solid residues. The precipitation of phases such as KFe3[(SO4)(2-X)(CrO4)(X)](OH)(6)), and the absorption of Cr(VI) after dissolution can play an important role as retention mechanisms of Cr(VI) in nature.

AB  - The use of enterococci as a fecal indicator bacterial group for public health risk assessment has been brought into question by recent studies showing that "naturalized" populations of Enterococcus faecalis exist in the extraenteric environment. The extent to which these naturalized E. faecalis organisms can confound water quality monitoring is unclear. To determine if strains isolated from different habitats display different survival strategies and responses, we compared the decay patterns of three E. faecalis isolates from the natural environment (environmental strains) against three human gut isolates (enteric strains) in laboratory mesocosms that simulate an oligotrophic, aerobic freshwater environment. Our results showed similar overall decay rates between enteric and environmental isolates based on viable plate and quantitative PCR (qPCR) counts. However, the enteric isolates exhibited a spike in copy number ratios of 16S rRNA gene transcripts to 16S rRNA gene DNA copies (rRNA:rDNA ratios) between days 1 and 3 of the mesocosm incubations that was not observed in environmental isolates, which could indicate a different stress response. Nevertheless, there was no strong evidence of differential gene expression between environmental and enteric isolates related to habitat adaptation in the accompanying mesocosm metatranscriptomes. Overall, our results provide novel information on how rRNA levels may vary over different growth conditions (e.g., standard lab versus oligotrophic) for this important indicator bacteria. We also observed some evidence for habitat adaptation in E. faecalis; however, this adaptation may not be substantial or consistent enough for integration in water quality monitoring.
   IMPORTANCE Enterococci are commonly used worldwide to monitor environmental fecal contamination and public health risk for waterborne diseases. However, closely related enterococci strains adapted to living in the extraenteric environment may represent a lower public health risk and confound water quality estimates. We developed an rRNA:rDNA viability assay for E. faecalis (a predominant species within this fecal group) and tested it against both enteric and environmental isolates in freshwater mesocosms to assess whether this approach can serve as a more sensitive water quality monitoring tool. We were unable to reliably distinguish the different isolate types using this assay under the conditions tested; thus, environmental strains should continue to be counted during routine water monitoring. However, this assay could be useful for distinguishing more recent (i.e., higher-risk) fecal pollution because rRNA levels significantly decreased after 1 week in all isolates.

AB  - Improving swine climatic resilience through genomic selection has the potential to minimize welfare issues and increase the industry profitability. The main objective of this study was to investigate the genetic and genomic determinism of tolerance to heat stress in four independent purebred populations of swine. Three female reproductive traits were investigated: total number of piglets born (TNB), number of piglets born alive (NBA) and average birth weight (ABW). More than 80,000 phenotypic and 12,000 genotyped individuals were included in this study. Genomic random-regression models were fitted regressing the phenotypes of interest on a set of 95 environmental covariates extracted frompublic weather station records. Themodels yielded estimates of (genomic) reactions norms for individual pigs, as indicator of heat tolerance. Heat tolerance is a heritable trait, although the heritabilities are larger under comfortable than heat-stress conditions (larger than 0.05 vs. 0.02 for TNB; 0.10 vs. 0.05 for NBA; larger than 0.20 vs. 0.10 for ABW). TNB showed the lowest genetic correlation (-38%) between divergent climatic conditions, being the trait with the strongest impact of genotype by environment interaction, while NBA and ABW showed values slightly negative or equal to zero reporting a milder impact of the genotype by environment interaction. After estimating genetic parameters, a genome-wide association study was performed based on the single-step GBLUP method. Heat tolerance was observed to be a highly polygenic trait. Multiple and non-overlapping genomic regions were identified for each trait based on the genomic breeding values for reproductive performance under comfortable or heat stress conditions. Relevant regions were found on chromosomes (SSC) 1, 3, 5, 6, 9, 11, and 12, although there were important regions across all autosomal chromosomes. The genomic region located on SSC9 appears to be of particular interest since it was identified for two traits (TNB and NBA) and in two independent populations. Heat tolerance based on reproductive performance indicators is a heritable trait and genetic progress for heat tolerance can be achieved through genetic or genomic selection. Various genomic regions and candidate genes with important biological functions were identified, which will be of great value for future functional genomic studies.

AB  - There is no doubt that all vector-borne diseases are very sensitive to climatic conditions. Many such diseases have shown marked increases in both distribution and incidence during the past few decades, just as human-induced climate change is thought to have exceeded random fluctuations. This coincidence has led to the general perception that climate change has driven disease emergence, but climate change is the inevitable backdrop for all recent events, without implying causality. Coincidence and causality can be disentangled using tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) as a test case, based on the excellent long-term data for this medically significant European disease system. Detailed analysis of climate records since 1970 has revealed abrupt temperature increases just prior to the dramatic upsurge in TEE incidence in many parts of central and eastern Europe. Furthermore, the seasonal patterns of this temperature change are such as might have favoured the transmission of TBE virus between co-feeding ticks. Nevertheless, the pattern of climate change is too uniform to explain the marked heterogeneity in the timing and degree of TBE Upsurge, for example in different counties within each of the Baltic countries. Recent decreases as well as increases in TBE incidence must also be taken into account. Instead of a single cause, a network of interacting factors, acting synergistically but with differential force in space and time, would generate this epidemiological heterogeneity. From analysis of past and present events, it appears that human behavioural factors have played a more significant role than purely biological enzootic factors, although there is an explicit causal linkage from one to the other. This includes a range of abiotic and biotic environmental factors, together with human behaviour determined by socio-economic conditions. Many of the abrupt changes followed from the shift from planned to market economies with the fall of Soviet rule. Comparisons between eight countries have indeed revealed a remarkable correlation between poverty indicators and the relative degree of upsurge in TBE from 1993. Against this background of longer-term shifts in TBE incidence, sudden spikes in incidence appear to be due to exceptional weather conditions affecting people's behaviour, which have a differential impact depending on socio-economic factors. This new perspective may also help explain the epidemiology of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever around the eastern Mediterranean region, including the current exceptional epidemic in Turkey.

AB  - Disturbance-based silviculture is of increasing interest as an approach to provide multiple ecosystem services and beta diversity in habitat conditions. One such approach increasingly employed in the eastern U.S. is a set of forestry practices developed to diversify forested bird habitats, called Silviculture with Birds in Mind (SBM). While strongly appealing to many private landowners, empirical data have not yet been reported regarding the effects of SBM treatments on forest structure and dynamics and how they compare to natural disturbances. Moreover, the potential of bird-oriented silviculture like SBM to enhance co-benefits, for instance, by retaining high carbon stocks in managed forests, has not been investigated. The objectives of our study were thus (i) to analyze the effects of SBM treatments on forests and compare them with natural disturbances, and (ii) to assess the co-benefits of multiple habitat indicators and carbon storage within three years of silvicultural treatment in mature northern hardwood-conifer forests.
   We derived 14 stand structural variables as well as carbon storage from 217 SBM inventory plots, and compared them with the effects of intermediate-severity wind disturbance using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Subsequently, we applied multi-hierarchical Bayesian models to investigate SBM treatment effects on aboveground carbon storage, as well as on four key habitat indicators. We also used Bayesian models to derive the relationships between habitat indicators and carbon storage.
   SBM treatments created a diversity of post-harvest stand conditions and, while having lower values for some structural characteristics in comparison to controls, significantly enhanced the variation in individual structural elements. Moreover, the treatments were closer in ordinal space to the irregular structure associated with intermediate-severity wind disturbance than untreated control plots. However, the NMDS indicated that SBM treatments did not fully approximate partial wind disturbances. Carbon storage was positively associated with stand structural complexity.
   Disturbance-based approaches like SBM help diversify habitat conditions and we expect these effects to become more pronounced as stands respond to the treatments over time. If applied more broadly, treatments targeted at diversifying habitats would also help maintain high carbon stocking at landscape scales. However, as the treatments do not fully emulate the region's natural disturbance regime, we propose widening the portfolio of multi-cohort, retention, and gap-based silvicultural approaches in landscape-scale management.

TI  - Quantifying population-level risks using an individual-based model: Sea otters, Harlequin Ducks, and the Exxon Valdez oil spill
T2  - INTEGRATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT
LA  - English
AB  - Ecological risk assessments need to advance beyond evaluating risks to individuals that are largely based on toxicity studies conducted on a few species under laboratory conditions, to assessing population-level risks to the environment, including considerations of variability and uncertainty. Two individual-based models (IBMs), recently developed to assess current risks to sea otters and seaducks in Prince William Sound more than 2 decades after the Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS), are used to explore population-level risks. In each case, the models had previously shown that there were essentially no remaining risks to individuals from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) derived from the EVOS. New sensitivity analyses are reported here in which hypothetical environmental exposures to PAHs were heuristically increased until assimilated doses reached toxicity reference values (TRVs) derived at the no-observed-adverse-effects and lowest-observed-adverse-effects levels (NOAEL and LOAEL, respectively). For the sea otters, this was accomplished by artificially increasing the number of sea otter pits that would intersect remaining patches of subsurface oil residues by orders of magnitude over actual estimated rates. Similarly, in the seaduck assessment, the PAH concentrations in the constituents of diet, sediments, and seawater were increased in proportion to their relative contributions to the assimilated doses by orders of magnitude over measured environmental concentrations, to reach the NOAEL and LOAEL thresholds. The stochastic IBMs simulated millions of individuals. From these outputs, frequency distributions were derived of assimilated doses for populations of 500?000 sea otters or seaducks in each of 7 or 8 classes, respectively. Doses to several selected quantiles were analyzed, ranging from the 1-in-1000th most-exposed individuals (99.9% quantile) to the median-exposed individuals (50% quantile). The resulting families of quantile curves provide the basis for characterizing the environmental thresholds below which no population-level effects could be detected and above which population-level effects would be expected to become manifest. This approach provides risk managers an enhanced understanding of the risks to populations under various conditions and assumptions, whether under hypothetically increased exposure regimes, as demonstrated here, or in situations in which actual exposures are near toxic effects levels. This study shows that individual-based models are especially amenable and appropriate for conducting population-level risk assessments, and that they can readily be used to answer questions about the risks to individuals and populations across a variety of exposure conditions.

AB  - Fluctuating lake levels are an important driver of ecosystem change, and changes in the precipitation/evaporation balance of a region can lead to undesirable changes in ecosystem functioning. Large-scale changes in hydrology will become increasingly more likely as a result of ongoing climate change in the coming century. This is especially true for the Tibetan Plateau, which plays a crucial role as the "Asian water tower" for the surrounding densely populated regions. Chironomids (Diptera: Chironomidae) have proven to be one of the most valuable bioindicators for monitoring and reconstructing the development of aquatic ecosystems. Besides temperature, water depth and salinity are two of the most important environmental factors affecting chironomids. To study the relationship between chironornids and water depth, we analyzed surface sediment samples of two large Tibetan lakes, Selin Co and Taro Co. These lakes have similar environmental conditions (e.g. elevation, temperature and oxygenation) but show strong differences in salinity (7-10 and 0.5 ppt, respectively). Our results show that the chironomid assemblages in both lakes have similar water depths at which the fauna abruptly changes in composition, despite different faunal assemblages. The most important boundaries were identified at 0.8 and 16 m water depth. While the uppermost meter, the "splash zone", is characterized by distinctly different conditions, resulting from waves and changing water levels, the cause of the lower zone boundary remains enigmatic. Even though none of the measured water depth-related factors, such as water temperature, oxygen content, sediment properties, light intensity or macrophyte vegetation, show a distinct change at 16 m water depth, comparison to other records show that a similar change in the chironomid fauna occurs at 16 m water depth in large, deep lakes around the world. We propose that this boundary might be connected to water pressure influencing the living conditions of the larvae or the absolute distance to the surface that has to be covered for the chironomid larvae to hatch. We conclude that water depth either directly or indirectly exerts a strong control on the chironomid assemblages even under different salinities, resulting in distribution patterns that can be used to reconstruct past fluctuations in water depths.

AB  - The Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary interval of northern Germany is characterised by non-marine deposits attributed to the Purbeck and Wealden fades. These organic-rich sediments were deposited under restricted, brackish-lacustrine conditions in a palaeogeographically isolated basin (Lower Saxony Basin). Rock-Eval and delta C-13(org) measurements were performed to characterise the composition and distribution of the organic matter, to determine the kerogen type chemically, and to define the quantity and maturity of the organic matter. A strong correlation between the optical characteristics, documented by the palynofacies analysis, and the chemical kerogen analyses have led to a better understanding of the palaeoenvironment and the processes which caused the organic matter enrichment.
   The samples studied from the basin center show a high petroleum generation potential, their estimated maturity is close to the onset of oil generation. Total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations of up to 18% have been measured, hydrogen index values reach up to 1185 mg HC/g TOC. The kerogen assemblages in two basinal successions are dominated by granular amorphous organic material (AOM), dinoflagellate cysts, and Botryococcus algae. In a more marginal succession continent-derived debris (phytoclasts, pollen and spores) is dominant. The AOM is interpreted to have originated either from phytoplankton (probably dinoflagellate cysts and Botryococcus), or its bacterial/archaeal degradation products formed under anoxic conditions. TOC-rich samples which are dominated by these amorphous kerogens show the highest petroleum potential, the AOM therefore plays a key role for the petroleum generation.
   The long-term climatic and hydrological evolution of the Lower Saxony Basin, which is based on palynomorphs, ostracods, and benthic foraminifera, is here interpreted by a five-stage model. Fluctuations in the salinity of the water bodies are directly reflected by the ratio between different freshwater and brackish-marine organisms as well dinoflagellate cyst diversity; five different cyst morphogroups are used for palaeoenvironmental interpretations. The deposition of TOC-rich beds in the German Wealden can be best explained by both high primary productivity and the establishment of prolonged phases of bottom water anoxia in a brackishlacustrine depositional environment. Ecological conditions supporting enhanced productivity and preservation of the algal/bacterial-derived organic matter were most favourable during the mid-late Berriasian (Wealden 1-4).

AB  - Alpine karst aquifers are important groundwater resources for the provision of drinking water all around the world. Yet, due to difficult accessibility and long-standing methodological limitations, the microbiology of these systems has long been understudied. The aim of the present study was to investigate the structure and dynamics of bacterial communities in spring water of an alpine limestone karst aquifer (LKAS2) under different hydrological conditions (base vs. event flow). The study was based on high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, study design and sample selection were guided by hydrology and pollution microbiology data. Spanning more than 27 months, our analyses revealed a taxonomically highly stable bacterial community, comprising high proportions of yet uncultivated bacteria in the suspended bacterial community fraction. Only the three candidate phyla Parcubacteria (OD1), Gracilibacteria (GN02), Doudnabacteria (SM2F11) together with Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes contributed between 70.0 and 88.4% of total reads throughout the investigation period. A core-community of 300 OTUs consistently contributed between 37.6 and 56.3% of total reads, further supporting the hypothesis of a high temporal stability in the bacterial community in the spring water. Nonetheless, a detectable response in the bacterial community structure of the spring water was discernible during a high-discharge event. Sequence reads affiliated to the class Flavobacteriia clearly increased from a mean proportion of 2.3% during baseflow to a maximum of 12.7% during the early phase of the studied high-discharge event, suggesting direct impacts from changing hydrological conditions on the bacterial community structure in the spring water. This was further supported by an increase in species richness (Chaol) at higher discharge. The combination of these observations allowed the identification and characterization of three different discharge classes (Q1-Q3). In conclusion, we found a taxonomically stable bacterial community prevailing in spring waters from an alpine karst aquifer over the entire study period of more than 2 years. Clear response to changing discharge conditions could be detected for particular bacterial groups, whereas the most responsive group - bacteria affiliated to the class of Flavobacterlia - might harbor potential as a valuable natural indicator of "system disturbances" in karst aquifers.

AB  - Forests across the U.S. and U.S. affiliated islands of the Caribbean and Pacific constitute rich and dynamic social-ecological systems that, while heterogeneous in many ways, share certain characteristics and trends that underscore the utility of sustainability assessments that go beyond single jurisdictional efforts. This paper summarizes a recent effort to assess the sustainability of tropical island forests of and politically affiliated with the U.S. using the Montreal Process criteria and indicator framework (MP C&I), which address ecological, social, economic, and institutional dimensions of forests. Forests cover 45 percent of the total area and more than 50 percent of each island jurisdiction, except Hawaii (36 percent). Forest cover is generally stable over much of the area in terms of recent reference conditions. The history of human occupation and land alteration is a prominent determinant of current conditions throughout the islands, which exhibit relatively high rates of threatened species in comparison to mainland counterparts and particularly where endemism is high. The islands also harbor significant areas of new or novel assemblages of native and non-native forest species, predominately on abandoned agricultural lands cleared of native forests long ago, which have been shown to contribute to the restoration of these degraded lands and provide many other ecosystem services at levels as high as and in some cases higher than native forests. Although industrial-level commercial timber harvest is small to nonexistent on most islands, socioeconomic and cultural linkages to forests are extensive but difficult to quantify. Amassing a foundation of data sufficient to address the MP C&I was challenging, in part due to the heterogeneity of the islands, island geography, and limited reporting capacities. We document significant improvements in the availability of data important for sustainability assessments in the last decade or so, especially with the extension of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis program to the islands. Likewise, we find the MP C&I to be a useful tool for organizing and presenting information important for assessing forest sustainability. Nevertheless, considerable data gaps remain in the areas of biodiversity, forest functions and processes, and socioeconomic conditions of forests, which are critical elements to track across the islands, particularly in the context of climate change and ongoing anthropogenic pressures.

AB  - Background: Despite widespread interest in solar-powered sea slugs (Sacoglossa: Gastropoda), relatively little is know about how they actually perform functional kleptoplasty. Sister-taxa Elysia timida and E. cornigera provide an ideal model system for investigating this phenomenon, since they feed on the same algal genus and only E. timida is capable of long-term kleptoplasty. Recent research has explored factors regarding functional kleptoplasty in E. timida, including their starvation longevity, digestive activity, autophagal response and photosynthetic efficiency under two different temperature conditions (18 degrees C and 21 degrees C). These studies revealed the trends E. timida displays regarding each factor during starvation as well as influences temperature has on some aspects of functional kleptoplasty. This study examines E. cornigera regarding each of these factors in an attempt to elucidate differences between each species that could explain their differing kleptoplastic abilities. Since both species naturally occur in 25 degrees C seawater (E. timida peak summer temperature, E. cornigera low winter temperature), each species was acclimatized to 25 degrees C to facilitate comparison and determine if these species exhibit physiological differences to starvation when under the same environmental conditions.
   Results: When comparing the different E. timida temperature treatments, it becomes clear that increased temperatures compromise E. timida's kleptoplastic abilities. Specimens acclimatized to 25 degrees C revealed shorter starvation longevities surviving an average 42.4 days compared to the 95.9 day average observed in specimens exposed to 18 degrees C. Each temperature treatment displayed a significantly different decrease throughout the starvation period in both, the rate of photosynthetic efficiency and in the decreasing functional kleptoplast abundance. Lysosomal abundances are assessed here as indicators of different aspects of metabolic activity, which could be correlated to temperature. E. cornigera, also acclimatized to 25 degrees C did not display significantly similar patterns as any of the E. timida temperature treatments, having fewer incorporated kleptoplasts, a higher lysosomal response to starvation, a faster decrease in photosynthetic efficiency and a lower starvation longevity.
   Conclusions: These results confirm that each species has different physiological reactions to starvation and kleptoplast retention, even under the same conditions. While temperature affects aspects of functional kleptoplasty, it is likely not responsible for the differences in kleptoplastic abilities seen in these species.

AB  - The genus Vanilla comprises around 110 species distributed throughout Earth's tropical regions, with the largest number of reported species growing in the American continent. Vanilla farming is associated with many Mexican cultures such as the Totonac, Mayan, Chinantec, and Mazatec, among others. Currently, this crop is threatened by technical, social, ecological, and climatic conditioning factors, limiting its production and the preservation of wild and cultivated species. It is therefore necessary to ascertain the current diversity status of each of these species, as well as some of their main bioclimatic profile indicators, in order to help decision-making, aimed at preserving and genetically improve these species. During 2008, we gathered data from IPN, MEXU, and XAL herbaria, as well as from CONABIO's World Information Network on Biodiversity (REMIB), the Global Biodiversity and Information Facility (GBIF), and we also used data from live access to BUAP's vanilla germplasm bank, obtained between 2008 and 2014. Distribution maps were generated using a geographical information system. Bioclimatic profiles for each species were obtained considering 19 WorldClim variables and altitude at a spatial resolution of approximately 1 Km(2). Variance, Mean, and standard deviation for each of the 19 variables were calculated at each of the registered points. Extreme environmental condition intervals (minimum, average, and maximum) were also obtained. In order to determine the most important distribution variables of the species, we performed a principal component analysis and carried out Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's tests on the variables identified as significant. Results indicated records for V. planifolia, V. pompona, V. insignis, V. inodora V. odorata, V. cribbiana, and V. sprucei in Mexico, distributed throughout nine states in the country. V. planifolia presented wide intervals of temperature and rain precipitation, while V. pompona, V. odorata, V. insignis and V. inodora presented intermediate intervals. The amplitudes of extreme data for each species can be considered in locating areas where ex situ regional preservation strategies could be put in place, as well as in establishing areas for cultivation. The bioclimatic profile we found, allows for an indirect inference of each species' genetic condition, which could be used in genetic improvement programs; for instance, V. odorata grows at high altitudes and tolerates low temperatures, while V. inodora tolerates high temperatures, and V. odorata, V. pompona and V. planifolia tolerate low rain precipitation.

AB  - 1. Biodiversity, water quality and ecosystem processes in streams are known to be influenced by the terrestrial landscape over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Lumped attributes (i.e. per cent land use) are often used to characterise the condition of the catchment; however, they are not spatially explicit and do not account for the disproportionate influence of land located near the stream or connected by overland flow.
   2. We compared seven landscape representation metrics to determine whether accounting for the spatial proximity and hydrological effects of land use can be used to account for additional variability in indicators of stream ecosystem health. The landscape metrics included the following: a lumped metric, four inverse-distance-weighted (IDW) metrics based on distance to the stream or survey site and two modified IDW metrics that also accounted for the level of hydrologic activity (HA-IDW). Ecosystem health data were obtained from the Ecological Health Monitoring Programme in Southeast Queensland, Australia and included measures of fish, invertebrates, physicochemistry and nutrients collected during two seasons over 4 years. Linear models were fitted to the stream indicators and landscape metrics, by season, and compared using an information-theoretic approach.
   3. Although no single metric was most suitable for modelling all stream indicators, lumped metrics rarely performed as well as other metric types. Metrics based on proximity to the stream (IDW and HA-IDW) were more suitable for modelling fish indicators, while the HA-IDW metric based on proximity to the survey site generally outperformed others for invertebrates, irrespective of season. There was consistent support for metrics based on proximity to the survey site (IDW or HA-IDW) for all physicochemical indicators during the dry season, while a HA-IDW metric based on proximity to the stream was suitable for five of the six physicochemical indicators in the post-wet season. Only one nutrient indicator was tested and results showed that catchment area had a significant effect on the relationship between land use metrics and algal stable isotope ratios in both seasons.
   4. Spatially explicit methods of landscape representation can clearly improve the predictive ability of many empirical models currently used to study the relationship between landscape, habitat and stream condition. A comparison of different metrics may provide clues about causal pathways and mechanistic processes behind correlative relationships and could be used to target restoration efforts strategically.

AB  - Whole nematode communities, extracted from soil samples taken from agricultural fields, were enumerated by taxonomic family and trophic group (i.e., bacterivores, fungivores, omnivores, plant-parasites, and predators) to evaluate nematode community structure as an indicator for monitoring ecological condition of soil. No differences were found in mixing treatments or methods of packing or shipping samples. However, extraction using Cobb's sifting and gravity method, followed by sucrose centrifugation, gave greater recovery of free-living nematodes than elutriation followed by sucrose centrifugation. Population means and variance of the sampled area were similar when sampled using different strategies for collecting soil samples within fields, including several patterns, directions and repetitions of transects. Components of variation associated with ratios among the five trophic groups of nematodes and selected indices of community structure were quantified as variation among regions, among counties, among agricultural fields (2-ha area), among transects within agricultural fields, and within composite soil samples. The variance component for 'within composite soil samples' was relatively large compared to the other components of variance. Variation within composite soil samples was less for maturity indices (based on life-history strategy characteristics), ratio of bacterivores to plant-parasites, sum of bacterivores and fungivores, populations of plant-parasites, and populations of bacterivores than for trophic diversity indices, populations of fungivores, populations of omnivores, populations of predators, or the ratio of fungivores to bacterivores. With a single composite sample per field, the ability to differentiate ecological condition of soils among fields within a region improved if the variance among and within fields exceeded the variance within composite samples. Given the variance components, power curves indicated that detection of a 10% change (with 0.8 power) in the ecological condition of soils within a region between two time periods would require sampling a minimum of 25 and 50 fields with one composite soil sample analyzed per field for the maturity and trophic diversity index, respectively. More than 100 fields per region would be required to detect temporal change in populations of individual trophic groups. Biplots of maturity indices, but not of trophic diversity or populations of individual trophic groups, identified clear differences among fields. Thus, maturity indices, which differentiated among sampling sites better and more efficiently than trophic diversity indices or measures based on populations of individual trophic groups, may be appropriate for use in a regional and/or national monitoring program.

AB  - Rainfall regimes are expected to shift on a regional scale as the water cycle intensifies in a warmer climate, resulting in greater extremes in dry versus wet conditions. Such changes are having a strong impact on the agro-physiological functioning of plants that scale up to influence interactions between plants and microorganisms and hence ecosystems. In (semi)-arid ecosystems, the date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) -an irreplaceable tree- plays important socio-economic roles. In the current study, we implemeted an adapted management program to improve date palm development and its tolerance to water deficit by using single or multiple combinations of exotic and native arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF1 and AMF2 respectively), and/or selected consortia of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR: B1 and B2), and/or composts from grasses and green waste (C1 and C2, respectively). We analyzed the potential for physiological functioning (photosynthesis, water status, osmolytes, mineral nutrition) to evolve in response to drought since this will be a key indicator of plant resilience in future environments. As result, under water deficit, the selected biofertilizers enhanced plant growth, leaf water potential, and electrical conductivity parameters. Further, the dual-inoculation of AMF/PGPR amended with composts alone or in combination boosted the biomass under water deficit conditions to a greater extent than in non-inoculated and/or non-amended plants. Both single and dual biofertilizers improved physiological parameters by elevating stomatal conductance, photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll and carotenoids content), and photosynthetic efficiency. The dual inoculation and compost significantly enhanced, especially under drought stress, the concentrations of sugar and protein content, and antioxidant enzymes (polyphenoloxidase and peroxidase) activities as a defense strategy as compared with controls. Under water stress, we demonstrated that phosphorus was improved in the inoculated and amended plants alone or in combination in leaves (AMF2: 807%, AMF1+B2: 657%, AMF2+C1+B2: 500%, AMF2+C2: 478%, AMF1: 423%) and soil (AMF2: 397%, AMF1+B2: 322%, AMF2+C1+B2: 303%, AMF1: 190%, C1: 188%) in comparison with controls under severe water stress conditions. We summarize the extent to which the dual and multiple combinations of microorganisms can overcome challenges related to drought by enhancing plant physiological responses.

AB  - Harp seals are the most abundant marine mammal in the north Atlantic. As an ice obligatory predator, they reflect changes in their environment, particularly during a period of climatic change. As the focus of a commercial hunt, a large historic data set exists that can be used to quantify changes. There are three populations of harp seals: White Sea/Barents Sea, Greenland Sea and Northwest Atlantic. The objective of this paper is to review their current status and to identify the factors that are influencing population dynamics in different areas. Although important historically, recent catches have been low and do not appear to be influencing trends in either of the two northeast Atlantic populations. Massive mortalities of White Sea/Barents Sea seals occurred during the mid 1980s due to collapses in their main prey species. Between 2004 and 2006, pup production in this population declined by 2/3 and has remained low. Body condition declined during the same period, suggesting that ecosystem changes may have resulted in reduced reproductive rates, possibly due to reduced prey availability and/or competition with Atlantic cod. The most recent estimate of pup production in the Greenland Sea also suggests a possible decline during a period of reduced hunting although the trend in this population is unclear. Pupping concentrations are closer to the Greenland coast due to the reduction in ice in the traditional area and increased drift may result in young being displaced from their traditional feeding grounds leading to increased mortality. Reduced ice extent and thickness has resulted in major mortality of young in the Northwest Atlantic population in some years. After a period of increase, the population remained relatively stable between 1996 and 2013 due to increased hunting, multiple years with increased ice-related mortality of young seals, and lower reproductive rates. With a reduction in harvest and improved survival of young, the population appears to be increasing although extremely large interannual variations in body condition and fecundity have been observed which were found to be influenced by variations in capelin biomass and ice conditions. Each of these populations has been impacted differently by changes in their ecosystems and hunting practices. By identifying the factors influencing these three populations, we can gain a better understanding of how species may respond to changes that are occurring in their ecosystems.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities as predictors of species assemblages in the Owabi Ramsar Wetland were investigated between May and September 2019. Data were collected in 154 plots at five different sites. The prevalence index method was used to categorise the species into wetland and non-wetland indicators. Log series and Hill number models were applied to quantify community assemblages, whereas the CCA technique was used to examine the relationship between anthropogenic activities and species presence or absence. In all, 2 185 individuals, belonging to 32 families and 68 species were recorded. Paspalum orbiculare and Persicaria lanigera were the most abundant, indicating their wide distribution. Mean number of individuals were highest at Atafua and lowest at Owabi. An abundance of terrestrial species (41.2%; i.e. plant species not listed as obligate wetland plants) and facultative species (30.9%), compared with obligate wetland species (27.9%), suggests a dominance of species from dryland habitats into the wetland. Farming activities, increased levels of NH4+, PO43+ and NO3-N, were the predictors that explained 72.01% of the overall variability in community assemblages. The results revealed the impact of the anthropogenic activities on the ecological integrity of the Owabi Ramsar Wetland and the need to institute conservation measures outlined in this study.

AB  - The processing of waste from confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) presents a major environmental challenge. Treatment of waste and subsequent land application is a common best management practice (BMP) for these operations in Kentucky, USA, but there are few data assessing the effect of runoff from such operations on aquatic communities. The authors sampled a stream bordering a CAFO with a land application program to determine if runoff from the fertilized fields was adversely affecting stream communities. Water chemistry, periphyton, and macroinvertebrate samples from riffle habitats downstream of the CAFO were compared to samples collected from an upstream site and a control stream in 1999 and 2000. Riffle communities downstream of the fertilized fields had higher chlorophyll a levels than other sites, but there were no significant differences in macroinvertebrate numbers or in biometrics such as taxa richness among the sites. The BMP in place at this site may be effective in reducing this CAFO's impact on the stream; however, similar assessments at other CAFO sites should be done to assess their impacts. Functional measures such as nutrient retention and litter decomposition of streams impacted by CAFOs should also be investigated to ensure that these operations are not adversely affecting stream communities.

AB  - Compromises in biodiversity and biotic integrity from human development alter native wildlife communities. Anecdotal evidence suggests that increases in residential development contribute to increases in human-wildlife interactions; however, little empirical research has addressed this issue. We tested whether housing density could be used to indicate patterns of reported human-wildlife interactions in Northern New York. We used a novel application of univariate and bivariate K-functions to assess the spatial relationship of reported human-wildlife interactions along a gradient of housing densities. We found that reported human-wildlife interactions are not completely spatially random in Northern New York State and the reports tend to cluster more in areas dominated by suburban and exurban housing densities compared to areas with urban or wildland housing densities. Low-density developments have unintended ecological consequences including an increase in reported human-wildlife interactions. Further work is needed to determine specific reasons for clustering of reported human-wildlife interactions in suburban and exurban areas. However, planners should consider human-wildlife interactions as a potential negative outcome of low-density development and devise development designs, such as clustering, to reduce future human-wildlife conflicts.

AB  - Managing Wildland-Urban-Interface (WUI) fires is a challenging task due to the inherent complexity of the WUI environment. To ensure the success of strategies for the protection of population and structures, safety measures have to be implemented at different scales (landscape, community and homeowner). The present study is focused on the homeowner scale and deals with the threat related to the presence of LPG domestic tanks in a WUI fire scenario. Recent accidents have demonstrated that the risk associated with this type of installation is real, but often disregarded by residents. A methodology was developed, providing a set of indicators that may easily be compared with risk acceptance criteria, assessing whether the integrity of an LPG tank exposed to WUI fire scenarios is compromised or not. The methodology is applicable to a vast range of situations and at a different level of detail according to available data. A number of case studies were carried out, showing that WUI fire scenarios impacting on domestic LPG tanks complying with regulations currently adopted in several Mediterranean countries cannot be deemed safe. The methodology proposed represents an advanced tool to assist on safety distances sizing to be prescribed by standards, driving regulators towards better-informed decision-making.

AB  - This paper reports the results of an extensive investigation of water chemistry in the small lakes of European Russia and Western Siberia along a climatic gradient. It was demonstrated that small lakes unaffected by any direct contamination can be used as indicators of natural geochemical conditions of water formation, as well as global and regional fluxes of airborne pollution and climate warming. A novel concept was developed for within- and between-zone variability in water chemistry over vast areas of tundra, taiga, forest, and steppe, and contributions of natural and anthropogenic factors to its formation under present-day conditions were estimated. A proposed predictive scenario showed that climate warming will result in an increase in water salinity in southern regions and ubiquitous phosphorus enrichment in terrestrial waters; the hydrologic and geochemical conditions of water formation in northern Siberia will change significantly in response to permafrost thawing. Zonal features in the development of anthropogenically-induced processes in terrestrial surface waters (acidification, eutrophication, and metal enrichment) were determined. It was demonstrated that, in addition to naturally acidified lakes with high contents of humic acids, acid lakes of anthropogenic origin occur over the whole humid region discussed here, and acidification processes were characterized for each subregion. The trophic status of lakes and limitation of their bioproductivity with respect to nutrients were estimated. The concentrations and distribution of trace elements were analyzed in terrestrial waters from various climatic zones of European Russia and Western Siberia, and the first estimates were obtained for the mean concentrations and coefficients of migration of a wide range of elements in terrestrial freshwaters. We distinguished a group of metal (Mo, As, U, Bi, Sb, Cd, Ag, Se, Re, Pb, Cd, W, etc.) the enrichment of which in natural waters results from their global dispersion in the environment. Experimental results and natural observations are presented on the processes of metal ion complexation with humus substances, and sequences of their increasing activity in competing for organic ligands were derived. Data are presented on the speciation of metals depending on natural water chemistry in the tundra, taiga, and steppe zones. The pioneering investigations on the geochemistry of natural waters allowed us to substantiate new regional norms for water quality.

AB  - Structure and injuries of octocoral communities (Octocorallia: Alcyonacea) of Ecological Reserve Siboney-Jutici, Santiago de Cuba, Cuba. In the spur-and-groove reefs of the Ecological Reserve Siboney-Jutici (Southeast Cuba) octocorals are one of the predominant components of the sessile fauna. Main objectives of the present paper are characterizing the composition, structure and conservation status of the octocoral communities and assessing on the prevailing environmental conditions in the study area. For data collection, six sampling sites were located every 2-3km ranging from 12m to 17m depth along the spur-and-groove reefs. In each site, 22-26 1m(2) quadrants were zigzag arranged every 2m. The density of colonies was determined per site. The severity degree and predictability of environmental conditions were inferred by using the Heterogeneity and Equitability indexes, respectively. Hydrodynamic stress and the Comparative Pollution Index were also assessed. Current affectations of the octocoral communities were also determined and classified into four main categories: mechanical damage, diseases, predation and invertebrate and macroalgae overgrowth. As a result, 25 species represented by 752 colonies were recorded and Eunicea flexuosa and Gorgonia ventalina were the most abundant. The occurrence of Eunicea succinea forma succinea constituted the first report for Eastern Cuba. Site densities ranged from 3.58 +/- 1.84 to 7.58 +/- 2.16 colonies/m(2) and considered from moderate to low. The biggest densities were reported at both sides of the San Juan River mouth. Despite of the composition and structure of the octocoral communities, low to high hydrodynamic stress and low and moderate levels of contamination were inferred, it is likely that these indexes could have been overestimated due to the sensitivity of the indicator species to other factors such as sedimentation. The environmental conditions were mostly favorable and stable. In general, the number of dead colonies was low and mostly caused by the detachment of the substrate and overgrowth of Millepora alcicornis. Injuries were mainly brought about by mechanical damage, followed by coenenchyme loss, predation by Cyphoma gibbosum and macroalgae overgrowth. On the other hand, negative effects by Hermodice carunculata predation, bleaching, Red Band and Black Band Disease were not observed. Among sampled species, G. ventalina colonies were the most severely damaged within the community. As a whole, octocoral communities of spur-and-groove reefs in the Ecological Reserve Siboney-Jutici showed a good conservation status. Rev. Biol. Trop. 58 (4): 1211-1221. Epub 2010 December 01.

AB  - Models represent our primary method for integration of small-scale, process-level phenomena into a comprehensive description of forest-stand or ecosystem function. They also represent a key method for testing hypotheses about the response of forest ecosystems to multiple changing environmental conditions. This paper describes the evaluation of 13 stand-level models varying in their spatial, mechanistic, and temporal complexity for their ability to capture intra- and interannual components of the water and carbon cycle for an upland, oak-dominated forest of eastern Tennessee. Comparisons between model simulations and observations were conducted for hourly, daily, and annual time steps. Data for the comparisons were obtained from a wide range of methods including: eddy covariance, sapflow, chamber-based soil respiration, biometric estimates of stand-level net primary production and growth, and soil water content by time or frequency domain reflectometry. Response surfaces of carbon and water flux as a function of environmental drivers, and a variety of goodness-of-fit statistics (bias, absolute bias, and model efficiency) were used to judge model performance.
   A single model did not consistently perform the best at all time steps or for all variables considered. Intermodel comparisons showed good agreement for water cycle fluxes, but considerable disagreement among models for predicted carbon fluxes. The mean of all model outputs, however, was nearly always the best fit to the observations. Not surprisingly, models missing key forest components or processes, such as roots or modeled soil water content, were unable to provide accurate predictions of ecosystem responses to short-term drought phenomenon. Nevertheless, an inability to correctly capture short-term physiological processes under drought was not necessarily an indicator of poor annual water and carbon budget simulations. This is possible because droughts in the subject ecosystem were of short duration and therefore had a small cumulative impact. Models using hourly time steps and detailed mechanistic processes, and having a realistic spatial representation of the forest ecosystem provided the best predictions of observed data. Predictive ability of all models deteriorated under drought conditions, suggesting that further work is needed to evaluate and improve ecosystem model performance under unusual conditions, such as drought, that are a common focus of environmental change discussions.

AB  - The surface conditions of road pavements, including the occurrence and severity of distresses present on the surface, are an important indicator of pavement performance. Periodic monitoring and condition assessment is an essential requirement for the safety of vehicles moving on that road and the wellbeing of people. The traditional characterization of the different types of distress often involves complex activities, sometimes inefficient and risky, as they interfere with road traffic. The mobile laser systems (MLS) are now widely used to acquire detailed information about the road surface in terms of a three-dimensional point cloud. Despite its increasing use, there are still no standards for the acquisition and processing of the data collected. The aim of our work was to develop a procedure for processing the data acquired by MLS, in order to identify the localized degradations that mostly affect safety. We have studied the data flow and implemented several processing algorithms to identify and quantify a few types of distresses, namely potholes and swells/shoves, starting from very dense point clouds. We have implemented data processing in four steps: (i) editing of the point cloud to extract only the points belonging to the road surface, (ii) determination of the road roughness as deviation in height of every single point of the cloud with respect to the modeled road surface, (iii) segmentation of the distress (iv) computation of the main geometric parameters of the distress in order to classify it by severity levels. The results obtained by the proposed methodology are promising. The procedures implemented have made it possible to correctly segmented and identify the types of distress to be analyzed, in accordance with the on-site inspections. The tests carried out have shown that the choice of the values of some parameters to give as input to the software is not trivial: the choice of some of them is based on considerations related to the nature of the data, for others, it derives from the distress to be segmented. Due to the different possible configurations of the various distresses it is better to choose these parameters according to the boundary conditions and not to impose default values. The test involved a 100-m long urban road segment, the surface of which was measured with an MLS installed on a vehicle that traveled the road at 10 km/h.

AB  - To improve the long-term environmental risk assessment of waste applications, a predictive "multi-surface" modelling approach has been developed to simultaneously predict the leaching and reactive transport of a broad range of major and trace elements (i.e., pH, Na, Al, Fe, Ca, SO4, Mg, Si, PO4, CO3, Cl, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Mo) and fulvic acids from MSWI bottom ash. The geochemical part of the model approach incorporates surface complexation/precipitation on Fe/Al (hydr)oxides, complexation with humic and fulvic acids (HA and FA, respectively) and mineral dissolution/precipitation. In addition, a novel approach is used to describe the dynamic leaching of FA, based on the surface complexation of FA on Fe/Al (hydr)oxides. To enable reactive transport calculations, the geochemical part of the model is combined with advective/dispersive transport of water and first-order mass transfer between mobile and stagnant zones. Using a single, independently determined set of input parameters, adequate model predictions are obtained for the leaching of a broad range of elements under widely different conditions, as verified with data from the European standardised pH-static and percolation leaching tests (TS 14997 and TS 14405, respectively). The percolation tests were operated at different flow velocities and with flow interruptions to enable verification of the local equilibrium assumption. Although the combination of experimental and modelling results indicates that the leaching of major solubility-controlled elements occurs largely under local equilibrium conditions, this study has led to the identification of physical non-equilibrium processes for non-reactive soluble salts, as well as possible sorption-related non-equilibrium processes for the leaching of Mo, FA and associated trace metals. Further improvement of the reactive transport model can be achieved by a more mechanistic description of the (dynamic) leaching behaviour of humic substances. As the modelling approach outlined in this study is based on the fundamental processes that underlie leaching, the approach is expected to be also applicable to other granular contaminated materials application scenarios and conditions. Therefore, the combination of standardized leaching test methods, selective chemical extractions and mechanistic modelling, constitutes a promising generic approach to assess the long-term environmental impact of the application of granular contaminated materials in the environment.

AB  - Globally, Bangladesh is the fifth largest aquaculture producer, with pangasius (Pangasianodon hypopthalamus) contributing 18 % of the total aquaculture production. This production is characterized by unregulated farming practices, domestic trade without value addition, product development, or export. In this paper, the Sustain ability Assessment of Food and Agriculture (SAFA) framework of the FAO was used to assess the competency of Bangladeshi pangasius farmers by comparing their practices with the indicators of farming practices prescribed by the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC). A survey of 150 farmers was undertaken that investigated the SAFA dimensions of good governance, environmental integrity, production and economics, and social well-being. Of 57 indicators, only 35 % were met at the best/good level, most of which occurred in the production and economic (47 %) and environmental dimension (40 %) and the least in the social dimension (29 %). Therefore, improvement of farming practices in all of the SAFA dimensions is required, with social and environmental dimensions demanding the most attention. Aquaculture certification for Bangladeshi pangasius farmers also requires improvements in legal frameworks and the involvement of value chain actors. Under a research and development initiative, one method to improve compliance is to develop a best practices approach for cluster agribusiness cooperation in farmer groups that have to be contractually bound to processing plants. This can spread and make sale at the potential international whitefish market.

AB  - Climate change and habitat loss threaten species survival in Madagascar. Ruffed lemurs, a representative species in the eastern rainforest, could lose 38-93% of their habitat from climate change and deforestation by 2070; protecting areas from deforestation is necessary to protect Malagasy biodiversity.
   Madagascar has experienced extensive deforestation and overharvesting, and anthropogenic climate change will compound these pressures. Anticipating these threats to endangered species and their ecosystems requires considering both climate change and habitat loss effects. The genus Varecia (ruffed lemurs), which is composed of two Critically Endangered forest-obligate species, can serve as a status indicator of the biodiverse eastern rainforest of Madagascar. Here, we combined decades of research to show that the suitable habitat for ruffed lemurs could be reduced by 29-59% from deforestation, 14-75% from climate change (representative concentration pathway 8.5) or 38-93% from both by 2070. If current protected areas avoid further deforestation, climate change will still reduce the suitable habitat by 62% (range: 38-83%). If ongoing deforestation continues, the suitable habitat will decline by 81% (range: 66-93%). Maintaining and enhancing the integrity of protected areas, where rates of forest loss are lower, will be essential for ensuring persistence of the diversity of the rapidly diminishing Malagasy rainforests.

AB  - Air pollution management is becoming a major topic of political concern, and many studies have devoted to the efficiency measurement of air pollution management. However, several drawbacks must be overcome for better applying efficiency measurement to improve air pollution management, including neglect of the importance of different indicators, non-integrity of indicator information for efficiency measurement, and lack of analyzing regional factors in the efficiency of air pollution management. Accordingly, by utilizing the evidential reasoning (ER) approach with entropy weighting method to propose an ER-based indicator integration and introducing the slacks-based measure (SBM) model with consideration of undesirable outputs and the regression model to propose an SBM-based efficiency analysis, a new air pollution management method, called integrated ER-SBM method, is developed in the present study. In the case study of Chinese 29 provinces, the application procedure and results are provided to illustrate how to apply the integrated ER-SBM method to integrate various air pollution indicators with different importance and further analyze the influence of regional factors, such as technological innovation, regional population density, import-export values, number of industries, and energy resources, on the efficiency of air pollution management. In addition, the policy recommendations targeting the results are concluded as well.

AB  - Macroinvertebrates are increasingly used as indicators of wetland integrity and productivity. However, accurate interpretation of biological information depends on effective sampling methods, which are also preferably cost-effective. We compared sampling yield, precision, and cost-effectiveness of two traditional wetland sampling methods (dipnet, stove pipe corer) to a dipnet combined with a dropframe in wetlands in the Platte River Valley, USA. The dropframe method was designed to be more quantitative than standard dipnet techniques and to maximize capture of mobile taxa. We compared measures of macroinvertebrate community structure (e. g., abundance, richness, diversity) and function (functional structure, habitat associations), as well as processing time for each sampling technique in vegetated and non-vegetated habitats. Vegetated habitats harbored higher richness, diversity, abundance, and biomass of most invertebrates. The dipnet consistently yielded the lowest values in vegetated and non-vegetated habitats, suggesting that sampling with a dipnet alone can greatly underestimate macroinvertebrate populations and diversity. The corer and the dropframe yielded similar results, but the dropframe produced significantly higher richness values. While the dropframe appeared to be a good choice for sampling in these wetlands, sample processing times for this method were more than two times longer than the other methods. Results provide a basis for informed decisions regarding quantitative sampling of wetland macroinvertebrates.

AB  - Since the concept of "fishing down marine food webs" was first proposed in 1998, mean trophic level of fisheries landings (MTL) has become one of the most widely used indicators to assess the impacts of fishing on the integrity of marine ecosystem and guide the policy development by many management agencies. Recent studies suggest that understanding underlying causes for changes in MTL is vital for an appropriate use of MTL as an indicator of fishery sustainability. Based on the landing data compiled by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and trophic information of relevant species in Fishbase, we evaluated MTL trends in 14 FAO fishing areas and analyzed catches of upper and lower trophic level groups under different trends of MTL and found that both the cases of a recovered MTL trend and a generally increasing MTL trend could be accompanied by decreasing catches of lower trophic level species. Further, community structure and exploitation history should be considered in using MTL after excluding species with trophic levels lower than 3.25 to distinguish "fishing-through" from "fishing-down". We conclude that MTL used as an indicator to measure fishery sustainability can benefit from a full consideration of both upper and lower trophic level species and masking effects of community structure and exploitation history.

AB  - An approach in determining ecosystem integrity and stress on ecosystem level is to assess processes within ecosystems. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential use of an in situ assay with immobilized Chlorella vulgaris as an indicator of effects on ecosystem functioning with regard to primary production. The herbicide linuron, applied in concentrations of 20, 60, and 180 mu g linuron/L, was used to induce direct effects on primary producers. Direct and indirect changes in structure and function within outdoor model ecosystems of 3 m(3) were monitored. The intermediate and highest concentration of linuron caused a decline in growth of the macrophyte Elodea sp., resulting in a significant increase of concentrations of nutrients. The increase in concentrations of nutrients caused an indirectly stimulated growth of immobilized C. vulgaris at the intermediate concentration, whereas similar concentrations of nutrients, at the highest treatment, did not stimulate Chlorella growth. It appeared that the direct effect of linuron on C. vulgaris growth was masked by nutrient availability at the intermediate but not at the highest linuron concentration. The observed immobilized algal growth was an accumulated effect of toxic and trophic pressures within the ecosystem, resulting in an integrative endpoint to detect actual impairment of ecosystem function.

AB  - A serious problem in the culture of animal cells to produce therapeutic proteins is apoptosis (programmed cell death) because it restricts the ability of the cell culture to yield the heterologous material. One means to delay apoptosis is genetically to engineer the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2 into the genome. This had been adopted elsewhere to give TB/C3 hybridoma cells that overexpressed bcl-2 (pEF bcl-2-MCIneopA plasmid) and a control, pEF, which contained a nonsense sequence (pEF-MC1neopA). In the spinner cultures used in the present investigation, bcl-2 cells grew for 60 h to give greater cell density at a faster specific rate and with prolonged better viability than the controls in which, after 36 h, the membrane integrity and the apoptotic index of the cells declined rapidly leading to death. Prior to 36 h, production of the monoclonal antibody was only slightly higher in the pEF control giving little evidence for the metabolic burden of its production on antibody synthesis. Bcl-2 synthesis, however, was associated with 125% increase in heat flow rate (HFR) measured in the chemically (triacetin) calibrated batch microcalorimeter. HFR is a function of the metabolic rate and it is suggested that its greater level in the bcl-2 cells than the control was caused by the increased protein production due to the bcl-2 gene expression. The bcl-2 cells had an increased lactate flux compared with the control. The calorimetric-respirometric (CR) ratio confirmed the likelihood that glycolysis rather than glutaminolysis was the primary reason for this increase. It may be due to the limitation in mitochondrial capacity and/or the paucity of biosynthetic precursors leading to production of them from glucose.
   The stationary liquid phase balance (SLPB) was shown to be the appropriate on-line method to measure the oxygen uptake rate (OUR) in the dilute cell suspensions grown in the tank bioreactor. The metabolic rate expressed as HFR was measured in a customised flow microcalorimeter, which had been calibrated using the enthalpy of hydrolysis produced by the new test reaction using methyl paraben. Both HFR and OUR declined before the decrease in cell density in batch culture, indicating that they were sensitive indicators of deteriorating environmental conditions. However, neither proved to be an early detector of the onset of apoptosis. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The literature is filled with numerous idiosyncratic definitions of what it means for consumption to be authentic. The authors address the resulting conceptual ambiguity by reconceptualizing authenticity, defining it as a holistic consumer assessment determined by six component judgments (accuracy, connectedness, integrity, legitimacy, originality, and proficiency) whereby the role of each component can change according to the consumption context. This definition emerges from a two-stage, multimethod concept reconstruction process leveraging data from more than 3,000 consumers across no fewer than 17 types of consumption experiences. In stage one, the authors take a qualitative approach employing both in-depth interviews and surveys (one conducted on a nationally representative sample) to identify authenticity's six constituent components. The final components are based on themes emerging from consumer data that were integrated and reconciled with existing definitions in the literature. In stage two, quantitative analyses empirically estimate the six components and support the composite formative nature of the construct. The authors document how certain components contribute to assessments of authenticity differently across contexts; in addition, they show that authenticity has consumer-relevant downstream consequences while being conceptually distinct from consumer attitudes. Their findings offer practitioners direction regarding what to emphasize to convey authenticity to consumers.

AB  - Mitigation measures carried out at the regulated metarhithron Gurtenbach in Upper Austria were evaluated by a survey of the dragonfly fauna. The assessment method developed in this study was based on the longitudinal distribution of dragonflies along riverine biocoenotic regions (the Rhithron-Potamon-Concept explains changes in species composition along a river's length). Numerically expressed habitat preferences led to the definition of a set of six reference species. According to the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive the current situation of the odonate species was compared with this inventory of river type-specific reference species and assessed in a five-tiered classification system of the ecologic status. At the regulated stretch the record of five species (including one reference species) was classified as class IV (poor ecological status). At the three rehabilitated stretches a total of 23 species were found. Two stretches were classified as showing good ecological status (class II), due to the occurrence of two autochthonous reference species (Calopteryx virgo, Onychogomphus forcipatus). The sensitive method applied not only allowed the evaluation of the differences between regulated and rehabilitated stretches but also the assessment of potamalisation effects within the rehabilitated section due to river bed widening and backwater influences.

AB  - In this study, we developed a multi-criteria assessment of spatial variability of the vulnerability of three different biodiversity descriptors: sites of high conservation interest by virtue of the presence of rare or remarkable species, extensive areas of high ecological integrity, and landscape diversity in grid cells across an entire region. We assessed vulnerability in relation to (a) direct threats in and around sites to a distance of 2 km associated with intensive agriculture, building and road infrastructure and (b) indirect effects of human population density on a wider scale (50 km). The different combinations of biodiversity and threat indicators allowed us to set differential priorities for biodiversity conservation and assess their spatial variation. For example, with this method we identified sites and grid cells which combined high biodiversity with either high threat values or low threat values for the three different biodiversity indicators. In these two classes the priorities for conservation planning will be different, reduce threat values in the former and restrain any increase in the latter. We also identified low priority sites (low biodiversity with either high or low threats). This procedure thus allows for the integration of a spatial ranking of vulnerability into priority setting for regional conservation planning. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Little is known about the viability of myxozoan actinospore stages after harvest from laboratory cultures of infected oligochaete worms. The viability and reactivity of actinospores of three myxozoan species was evaluated after short-term storage at 4 degrees C and 12 degrees C. Two methods of determining actinospore viability were compared: differential fluorescent staining and direct microscopic observation of morphological indicators of spore integrity. Spore reactivity was quantified by measuring polar filament discharge rates in a micro-assay with fish mucus substrate and mechanical stimulation by vibration. The age-dependent viability of the three species showed clear differences. Myxobolus cerebralis actinospores had the shortest effective life span whereas Henneguya nuesslini actinospores survived significantly longer. Storage at lower temperatures yielded higher viability in all species. Myxobolus pseudodispar actinospores were significantly robust up to 12 degrees C when assessed by staining, but showed similar viability characteristics as H. nuesslini when analyzed morphologically. Evaluation of spore viability by fluorescent staining correlated with morphological assessment, although fewer viable actinospores were usually detected microscopically. Polar filament discharge activity of morphologically intact actinospores did not significantly decrease until the third day of storage compared to freshly harvested samples. The results indicate that durability and reactivity trends during storage of actinospores differ among myxozoan species.

AB  - Purpose
   Clients in Nigeria have continuously questioned the quality of services being rendered by architectural firms in building projects. This study aims to investigate the areas of service responsible for determining client satisfaction.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The study uses questionnaire for data collection on perceived service quality and indicators of clients' satisfaction.
   Findings
   The results of descriptive statistics suggest that efficient analysis and compliance with client brief along with buildability, flexibility and comprehensiveness of the design are the main technical determinants of clients' satisfaction. Management measures for engendering clients' satisfaction include team communication and collaboration as well as regular site visits when required. The study established a significant relationship between the perceived service quality and client satisfaction. At technical level, economical design and compliance with budget, buildability, optimal and error-free design and timely delivery have significant correlation with the perception of service quality, which could engender client satisfaction. At management level, collaboration and coordination, integrity and trust, regular site visits and project management knowledge and skills had significant relationships with perceived service quality.
   Originality/value
   To improve overall client satisfaction, architects are expected to focus on these factors in the process of service delivery. Architects' expertise and skills can be further harnessed through continuous training and understanding of the project environment.

AB  - In this study we investigated the seasonal variations in the intracellular content of 14 trace elements (Al, As, Ba, Cd, Ce, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Pd, Sb, Zn) and physiological parameters (namely chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, ergosterol, photosynthetic efficiency, cell membrane integrity) in the thalli of the lichen Evernia prunastri (L.) Ach. exposed to an urban environment (Siena, central Italy). Lichen thalli were collected before each exposure period from an unpolluted area and transplanted to 16 sites; every 3 months the thalli were retrieved and replaced with new ones. Exposed-to-control ratios of trace elements revealed a marked intracellular accumulation of Cd in summer and autumn, and of Sb in autumn and spring, possibly as a result of vehicular traffic pollution. However, considering the low absolute concentrations of these elements, the intracellular fraction of depositions may hardly have caused an impairment of physiological parameters. As a matter of fact, indicators of photobiont vitality (content of chlorophylls a and b and photosynthetic efficiency) did not show any fluctuation across seasons, while changes in the indicators of mycobiont vitality (cell membrane damage and ergosterol content) overall did reflect some seasonal changes and/or lichen growth.

AB  - Indicators are applied faster and at lower costs than conventional surveys, providing quick and efficient responses that can facilitate protected areas management. Our aim was to select indicators from vegetation to monitor protected areas. For this purpose, we analyzed understory and quantified lianas and tree ferns in protected and non-protected areas, in order to find indicator species. Our study areas are located in Vale do Ribeira, southeastern Sao Paulo state, Brazil. One of the areas is under two protection categories (IUCN's categories II and V), and the other is a privately owned farm. Lianas with large diameters (>13 cm) and tree ferns with great heights (>19 m) were considered indicators of undisturbed areas (protected areas) because their growth is directly related to forest successional stage. Indicator species within the protected area were shade tolerant species, such as Bathysa australis (A.St.-Hil.) K.Schum., whereas outside the protected area were pioneer species, such as Pera glabrata (Schott) Poepp. ex Baill. e Nectandra oppositifolia Ness. All of the suggested indicators can be used in management actions, especially in protected areas, to guarantee forest maintenance and ensure fulfillment of the conservation objectives of these areas.

AB  - The Bay Islands of Honduras are surrounded by one of the world's most magnificent coral reefs. However, the reef communities have suffered greatly due to human activities on the islands. Even though permit regulations and agencies have been established since 1991, degradation of the environment continues because of the lack of technical expertise in environmental evaluations of projects, inconsistency in enforcement of the regulations, lack of community participation, and the weakness of the environmental legislation. This is the first evaluation of the effectiveness of coastal regulations for development projects and of the associated environmental impacts on the Bay Islands covering the period from 1992 to 1995. The results indicate that although compliance to the regulations increased, the number and severity of the environmental impacts also increased. A $27 million loan from the Inter-American Development Bank to prepare a Program for the Environmental Management of the Bay Islands is designed to maintain the quality of the environment, with an emphasis on coastal resources and sustainable uses of these resources. With appropriate planning, combined with community participation, adequately trained staff and sufficient budgets, the Bay Islands could become the western Caribbean model for well-planned, economically viable development that maintains environmental integrity and responds to the sociopolitical context of the islands.

AB  - Whatever the magnitude of the greenhouse effect on climate change, commercial fishermen want to know how this $2 billion industry may be influenced in the Pacific Northwest.  There is a strong relationship between atmospheric and oceanic conditions an indicators of climate fluctuations.  Nonetheless, our ability to actually predict climate effects on fisheries-ocean interactions is limited because the biological responses to climate change (e.g., salmon catch), are not uniform over large geographical areas.  The authors explore the problem of applying the historically mechanistic view of natural systems.  They concentrate on studies of low-frequency alterations that impact large areas of the world's oceans.

AB  - In recent years, the development and implementation of new in vitro techniques for ecotoxicology and environmental risk assessment has become a priority; however, the current data indicate a lack of standardization in available in vitro sperm tests. In this review, we describe the main approaches currently used for in vitro toxicity testing of fish spermatozoa. Though fish species show huge diversity in their reproductive strategies, most are external fertilizers. Fish spermatozoa are highly specialized, transcriptionally inactive cells that become motile only upon spawning in the aqueous environment. Here, we suggest that they could become a useful toxicology tool because of their simplicity and availability. Indeed, fish spermatozoa are a promising model for genotoxicity testing, since parental exposure to genotoxicants, both in vivo and in vitro, affect embryo development. In aquaculture practice it means that evaluation of spermatozoa DNA damage could help in predicting embryo quality. Fish spermatozoa could also be useful for the study on nongenomic mechanisms of toxicity, such as the effects of xenobiotics on protein posttranslational modifications. Nevertheless, we conclude that further studies on fish spermatozoa are required to establish a clear correlation between in vitro and in vivo toxicities.

AB  - Urban stormwater runoff is a globally significant threat to the ecological integrity of aquatic habitats. Green stormwater infrastructure methods such as bioretention are increasingly used to improve water quality by filtering chemical contaminants that may be harmful to fish and other species. Ubiquitous examples of toxics in runoff from highways and other impervious surfaces include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Certain PAHs are known to cause functional and structural defects in developing fish hearts. Therefore, abnormal heart development in fish can be a sensitive measure of clean water technology effectiveness. Here we use the zebrafish experimental model to assess the effects of untreated runoff on the expression of genes that are classically responsive to contaminant exposures, as well as heart -related genes that may underpin the familiar cardiotoxicity phenotype. Further, we assess the effectiveness of soil bioretention for treating runoff, as measured by prevention of both visible cardiac toxicity and corresponding gene regulation. We find that contaminants in the dissolved phase of runoff (e.g., PAHs) are cardiotoxic and that soil bioretention protects against these harmful effects. Molecular markers were more sensitive than visible toxicity indicators, and several cardiac -related genes show promise as, novel tools for evaluating the effectiveness of evolving stormwater mitigation strategies.

AB  - Vitamin A (VA) is a fat-soluble micronutrient that plays essential roles in various biological processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. In the intestine, VA are known to promote mucosal homeostasis and immunity. However, the effect of VA in intestinal development has not been well elucidated. In the present study, we generated human intestine organoids from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and investigated the effect of the VA active metabolite all-trans retinoic acid (RA), on differentiation into intestinal organoids. As a result, RA increased the gene expression of a drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4, as a functional molecule of intestinal mature development, in iPSC-derived intestinal organoids. In addition, RA increased transepithelial electrical resistance, an indicator of epithelial integrity, and decreased the permeability of monolayers to fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran in intestinal epithelial monolayers. Finally, RA increased the expression of ZO-1, a marker of tight junctions, which are essential for intestinal epithelial barrier function. Taken together, these results indicate that RA promotes barrier functions of iPSC-derived intestinal epithelial monolayers by increasing ZO-1 expression. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB  - In this study, the relationships between the productivity of Anatolian black pine forests and the environmental variables were investigated in Demirci (Manisa) district of Turkey. Inventory study was performed on 40 stands totally. Ages and heights for 3 different plus trees in each stand were measured and site (bonitet) index values were calculated according to height at the age of 100 for the black pine. At the first stage, Pearson and Spearman correlation analyses were used to determine binary linear relations between productivity of the species and environmental factors in the district. Multiple regression analysis and regression tree method were performed to obtain the productivity models of the species, respectively. As a result of these analyses, it has been concluded that the lower slopes and flats with a smooth surface at average altitudes of 1000 m-1350 m are the most suitable areas for the productivity of Anatolian black pine in the district. Furthermore, it has been found that litter thickness on the soil is not a clear indicator for the productivity of the species in the natural stands On the other hand, it has been determined that the north aspect significantly contributes to the productivity of this species in the elevations below 1000 m and all these relationships are especially related with water and nutrition contents in the environment.

AB  - Key messageModels were developed to predict spatial distribution of specific leaf area (SLA) and horizontal distribution of leaf area for western larch. Cardinal branch direction significantly influenced both SLA and horizontal leaf area distributions.AbstractLeaf area, specific leaf area (SLA), and their spatial distribution in the crown are important indicators of biological response to changes in growing conditions including light and water availability. Western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.) is a deciduous coniferous pioneer species in the U.S. Inland Northwest known for its rapid growth, high-quality wood, and ecological importance. Analysis with nonlinear models revealed that SLA and horizontal leaf area distributions differ between cardinal quadrants of juvenile western larch crowns. SLA was significantly higher in the more illuminated, southern side of the crown, and leaf area peaked closer to the stem in the southwest quadrant. Similar to other conifers, horizontal distributions of foliage in western larch also shifted further outward towards the branch tips with increasing depth in the crown. Models developed for horizontal distribution of leaf area and spatial distribution of specific leaf area for western larch may be extended by future researchers to predict its response to environmental variables or management practices.

AB  - Reintroduction of fire and thinning have been suggested as the main practices to regain forest health in ponderosa pine forests of northern Arizona. Recent silvicultural programs and the occurrence of catastrophic wildfires have created a range of disturbance severities and a mosaic of forest conditions. Sixteen stands were randomly selected to create a completely randomized experimental design with four treatments, (1) unmanaged, (2) thinned, (3) thinned and burned, and (4) wildfire, with four replicates of each treatment. We assessed changes occurring in ground foraging ant functional groups at the stand scale as related to these treatments. A pitfall trapping scheme was implemented during the summer months of 2002 and 2003. A total of 18,009 specimens were collected representing 20 species from 10 genera. We found that traditional biodiversity measures, such as species richness, diversity, and dominance were a less satisfactory measure of treatment impact on ants than functional group analysis, which allowed us to consider the ecosystem role of each species. We found that different functional groups were dominant under different levels of disturbance severity and suppressed or excluded other functional groups that were less suited to the disturbance intensity. Maintaining a diversity of habitat types is suggested for supporting ecologically diverse ant functional groups and improve forest health.

AB  - Sustainable forest management ideally involves five elements: 1) establishing a clear set of values, goals and objectives and, 2) planning actions that are most likely to meet desired goals and objectives, 3) implementing appropriate management activities, 4) monitoring the outcomes to check on predictions, effectiveness, and assumptions, and 5) evaluating and adjusting management depending on the outcome of monitoring. Within this framework, indicators are used to determine whether the outcome of management has met the intended goals. In this paper we provide general guidance for developing an integrated and logical monitoring system, define and differentiate between "evaluative" and "prescriptive" indicators, provide more specific advice on choosing evaluative indicators (including a comparison of types of ecological indicators), and provide specific advice on defining prescriptive indicators. Our guidelines for developing an indicator and monitoring framework are based on three principles. The first principle is to develop a logical framework, including 1) establishing clear values and goals before setting indicators and objectives, and 2) linking prescriptive and evaluative indicators directly to plan objectives, and to each other. The second principal is to use the framework to learn adaptively by: 1) designing management activities to address specific questions, 2) learning about thresholds, and 3) testing assumptions. The third principal is to create a formal plan for learning.

AB  - The European Union recognizes the importance of public procurement as one of the instruments that must be used to achieve smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. In Spain, Law 9/2017, of November 8, on Public Sector Contracts, transposes the European Parliament and Council Directives 2014/23/EU and 2014/24/EU into the Spanish legal system. This law aims to incorporate transversally socially responsible criteria when preparing and executing public contracts. In addition, it obliges bidding companies to meet specific requirements on gender equality, fair labor conditions, fair trade consumption or energy efficiency. Specifically, the basic objectives pursued by the Law are; the impartiality and objectivity of procedures, greater transparency in public procurement and improving the quality- price ratio. All this means guaranteeing the correctness of the procedures, avoiding any hint of corruption and using public procurement in a strategic manner to implement, with the resources that are managed through the contracts, public policies at communitarian and national levels in the social, environmental, and development fields and the innovation and promotion of the participation of small and medium enterprises in public procurement. Faced with this situation, public administrations have begun to develop guidelines and approve instructions for the implementation of socially responsible clauses in their hiring. However, despite its importance, there is no specific measurement instrument that evaluates this type of behavior.
   In this context, we propose this research with the aim of facilitating a tool, composed of a series of ethical and sustainable indicators, in line with the new Law, which allow comparative measurement and comparison of the responsible behavior of administrations in relation to their public contracts. In this way, the contracting bodies must present in their specifications concrete measures to guarantee, on the one hand, integrity in their contracting procedures and, on the other hand, the strategic use of their contracts. All this it will allow to implement, with the resources that are managed through contracts, national and international policies in social, environmental, promotion of innovation and of the participation of small and medium enterprises in public procurement.
   The research has revealed the existence of numerous guides and publications for the implementation of social, ethical and environmental clauses in public procurement, as well as instructions or agreements on sustainable public procurement. Specifically, in Spain, there are many administrations that, in recent years, have published good practice guides for the inclusion of Social Responsibility clauses in their contracts. In addition, it has been observed the continued existing commitment of the Spanish public administrations with the Social Responsibility, through the approval of Agreements or Instructions. Indeed, since 2005, in which the Good Governance Code of the General State Administration was approved in Spain, and in 2009, when the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces approved its own Code of Good Governance, very significant steps have been taken in terms of Social Responsibility and sustainability. In the second stage of the study, a series of social and environmental indicators were created to evaluate and compare responsible practices in public procurement throughout the different phases of the contract (preparation, awarding, execution).
   This first investigation has some limitations derived from the lack of quantitative data, however, like any exploratory study, it constitutes a hypothesis-generating element and serves as the basis for future investigations that allow evaluating the hiring of the entities that make up the public sector in relationship to social, environmental and ethical issues. At the same time, this proposal may favor focusing the practices and responsible policies to address the observed shortcomings, contributing to obtain economic and social environmental benefits, for the Administration and for the private sector and society in general.
   According to the objectives formulated in this exploratory study, it has been proven that, increasingly and with a general nature, public administrations are aware and are concerned about the aspects that have to do with Transparency, Social Responsibility and sustainability. From the analysis of the current situation of sustainable public procurement, the important efforts of the initiatives, both national and international, aimed at strengthening a regulatory framework in this area are confirmed. Specifically, in Spain, it is observed that there are many administrations that adopt the commitment to be socially responsible in their hiring. However, the great task that remains to be done to adapt to the regulatory framework in these matters has been verified.
   The importance of this work, because it is a pioneer, is that it has defined a series of indicators that serve to evaluate sustainability in public procurement. In addition, the proposed indicators allow to guide the implementation of good practices and can be used in future research as a basic methodological instrument to advance in the understanding and improvement of sustainable public procurement processes. All this will allow knowing the current situation of sustainable public procurement and being able to compare them over time, evaluate the impact of the approval of procurement laws in local administrations, determine good practices in public procurement, measure the effects of instructions or agreements on public procurement, identify if there are patterns of behavior among public administrations in relation to their responsible contracting and what could be the conditioning factors of sustainable practices in public procurement.

AB  - Modern agricultural practices heavily rely on the use of agrochemicals. Glyphosate based herbicides are among the most widespread agricultural supplies. The massive application of glyphosate in conventional farming, provides continuous inputs of the herbicide into the environment, unintentionally placing non-target organisms at risk. Shallow lakes immersed in agroecosystems serve as integrators of human interventions in their watersheds. Autotrophic plankton, which are key components of biogeochemical cycles and food-webs, respond quickly to anthropogenic disturbances. Here, we assessed the environmental implications and ecological consequences of agricultural land use and glyphosate contamination on phytoplankton from 52 shallow lakes scattered over 180,000 km2 across the central pampas in Argentina, which lay on areas differentially impacted by glyphosate. Indicators of glyphosate usage positively correlated with lake turbidity and Cyanobacteria abundance, and were negatively associated with Chlorophyceae diversity. Glyphosate impact indicators were also associated with higher abundance of the small-sized representatives within each major algal class, which are assumed to be better adapted to poor light conditions. Detection of the presence of GLY-transporter genes (phnD) in seston samples was associated with higher picocyanobacteria biomass and lower pico-eukaryotic algae. Our results illustrate that the observed distribution patterns of phytoplankton can be explained by the combination of the watershed's agricultural profile, conductivity, and light quality.

AB  - Identifying vulnerable levels of eco-environment over a global scale is critical for environmental management and ecological conservation. We present the method to optimize the use of freely assessable datasets to derive 16 factors for a proposed assessment framework (Nguyen and Liou, 2019; Liou et al., 2017; Nguyen et al., 2016) [1-3]. Results show that the datasets are suitable for evaluating global eco-environmental vulnerability (GEV). PM2.5 that is a hazardous substance in environment and an anthropogenic disturbance associated with nature and human-made influence is selected to validate the GEV map. The GEV map well correlates with PM2.5 distribution patterns with correlation coefficient of approximately 0.82. All datasets and mapping procedures are processed in ArcGIS 10.3/QGIS 2.16.3 software. Advantages of our method include three aspects:
   The analysis procedure is simple but powerful, while dealing with various complex environmental issues.
   The framework is flexible to adjust influential indicators subject to the conditions of concerned regions and purposes of decision makers.
   The framework can be easily applied for different concerned regions over various scales.
   Our findings include GEV mapping and eco-protection zoning that provide key hotspots of eco-environmental vulnerability levels over a global scale for the decision makers and people to take further actions to lessen disturbances and achieve environmental sustainability.

AB  - For a long time, human impact has deeply simplified most of the forest ecosystems of the Mediterranean Basin. Here, forests have seldom had the chance to naturally develop a complex and multilayered structure, to host large and old trees and rich biological communities, approaching old-growth conditions. Also for this reason, limited information is currently available about Mediterranean old-growth forests, particularly with regard to deadwood. The main aim of this work is to help fill this critical knowledge gap. In Sicily (Italy), we identified a Quercus pubescens forest that seemed to show some typical old-growth features. Total living volume (360 m(3) ha(-1)) and basal area (34 m(2) ha(-1)) were, respectively, about 6 and 3 times higher than the averages recorded in the regional forest inventory for this forest type. Deadwood was particularly abundant, exceeding the threshold of 30 m(3) ha(-1), mainly represented by lying dead elements. Dead to live wood ratio reached 9%, a value close to the threshold of 10% considered for Mediterranean old-growth forests. As the investigated forest showed some typical old-growth traits, it deserves to be fully protected and could be a permanent monitoring area for studying deadwood and stand dynamics in mature Mediterranean stands.

AB  - Sedimentology is of increasing importance in environmental research, particularly environmental pollution studies, where past trends in environmental processes need to be combined with data on present conditions to predict likely future changes -the past and present as a key to the future. Two examples are used to illustrate the role of sedimentology in assessing the influence of major processes on the transport, accumulation, deposition and modification of contaminants in fluvial/estuarine systems and in developing environmental management plans.
   Example 1 shows that when assessing nutrient behaviour in fluvial/estuarine depositional settings, it is important to examine the partitioning of phosphorus between grain size fractions to evaluate the sedimentological processes which control the dispersion and trapping of these contaminants. Example 2 shows that in studies of anthropogenic metal inputs to modern depositional settings, lateral and stratigraphic trends in sediment texture and mineralogy should be examined, in addition to trends in metal loads and evaluation of the prevailing physical, chemical and biological processes that may influence metal mobility and dispersion.
   Clearly, basic sedimentological data should form part of any assessment of potentially contaminated sites and part of investigations into the dispersion and trapping of contaminants in fluvial systems. These data are also required for rational environmental management to ensure that planning decisions are compatible with natural environmental constraints.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) have aroused widespread concern due to their extensive distribution in aquatic environments and adverse effects on aquatic organisms. However, the underlying toxicity of different kinds of MPs on freshwater microalgae has not been examined in detail. In this study, we investigated the effects of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene (PE) MPs on the growth of Microcystis aeruginosa, as well as on its toxin production and oxidative stress. We found that all three kinds of MPs had an obvious inhibition effect on the growth of M. aeruginosa. Considering the results of antioxidant-related indicators, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), and cell membrane integrity were greatly affected with exposure to PVC, PS and PE MPs. Moreover, the content of intracellular (intra-) and extracellular (extra-) microcystins (MCs) had a noticeable increase due to the presence of PVC, PS, and PE MPs. Finally, according to the comprehensive stress resistance indicators, the resistance of M. aeruginosa to three MPs followed the order: PE (3.701) > PS (3.607) > PVC (2.901). Our results provide insights into the effects of different kinds of MPs on freshwater algae and provide valuable data for risk assessment of different types of MPs.

AB  - The assessment of cell concentration and viability of freshly isolated hepatocyte preparations has been traditionally performed using manual counting with a Neubauer counting chamber and staining for trypan blue exclusion. Despite the simple and rapid nature of this assessment, concerns about the accuracy of these methods exist. Simple flow cytometry techniques which determine cell concentration and viability are available yet surprisingly have not been extensively used or validated with isolated hepatocyte preparations. We therefore investigated the use of flow cytometry using TRUCOUNT Tubes and propidium iodide staining to measure cell concentration and viability of isolated rat hepatocytes in suspension. Analysis using TRUCOUNT Tubes provided more accurate and reproducible measurement of cell concentration than manual cell counting. Hepatocyte viability, assessed using propidium iodide, correlated more closely than did trypan blue exclusion with all indicators of hepatocyte integrity and function measured (lactate dehydrogenase leakage, cytochrome P450 content, cellular ATP concentration, ammonia and lactate removal, urea and albumin synthesis). We conclude that flow cytometry techniques can be used to measure cell concentration and viability of isolated hepatocyte preparations. The techniques are simple, rapid, and more accurate than manual cell counting and trypan blue staining and the results are not affected by protein-containing media. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

AB  - In aquatic ecosystems, biological indicators are used in concert with nutrient concentration data to identify habitat impairments related to cultural eutrophication. This approach has been less commonly implemented in coastal areas due to the dominance of physical conditions in structuring biological assemblage data. Here, we describe the use of the stable isotopic composition of Nassarius obsoletus (Say), the eastern mudsnail, as an indicator of cultural eutrophication for 40 locations in coastal estuaries in New York. We found N-15 enrichment in mudsnail tissue where watersheds had high population densities, land use patterns were more urbanized, and when sampling sites were adjacent to wastewater treatment plant discharges. Stable carbon isotopes were responsive to salinity and watershed forest cover, with more saline sites reflecting a predominantly C-4 or algal carbon isotopic signature and more forested sites a lighter isotopic signature reflecting greater inputs of C-3 terrestrial detrital carbon. Mudsnail nitrogen isotopic composition had a high level of separation between more affected and pristine watersheds (from 6.6 to 14.1%), highlighting its utility as an indicator. We thus propose that stable isotope values of estuarine biota, such as the eastern mudsnail, can be used in concert with water quality data to identify areas where improvements in water quality are needed and can also be used to identify sources of detrital carbon to estuarine environments.

AB  - Our study provides new knowledge about macrophyte assemblages and environmental variables of Slovak drainage and irrigation canals. The canal system, comprising ca. 15% of all flows in Slovakia, is one of the oldest in Central Europe. This information represents a first step toward exploitation of macrophytes as an obligatory biological quality element for the assessment of ecological potential according to the requirements of the Water Framework Directive. Among 61 canals studied, a total of 85 aquatic plant species (35 hydrophytes, 16 amphiphytes and 34 helophytes) were recorded during the years 2012-2014, including three neophytes and 18 threatened species. Physico-chemical variables explained the highest proportion of species variability, whilst hydromorphological variables and landscape variables were much less significant. Chemical oxygen demand, ammonium nitrogen, electrical conductivity, water pH, flow velocity and water depth were identified as most important drivers of species composition of aquatic macrophytes and explained 21.1% of the variability. The CCA results revealed differences in species composition of canals reflecting the geographical origin and environmental conditions as well, relating to South-Eastern and South-Western Slovakia. In conclusion, macrophytes in drainage and irrigation canals are able to reflect several environmental variables and might provide valuable information for bioindication in assessing the ecological potential.

AB  - Soil trampling is one of the most obvious direct negative human impacts in Antarctica. Through a range of experiments and field studies based on quantitative physical (soil penetration resistance) and biological (collembolan abundance) indicators, we evaluate the current codes of conduct relating to the protection of Antarctic soils from the consequences of pedestrian impacts. These guidelines include using, where available, established paths that cross vegetation-free soils. However, the effectiveness of this strategy is highly dependent on context. Limited intensity use-below 100 foot passes per year-produces small changes at the soil surface that can recover relatively rapidly, suggesting that the dispersal of activity across wider corridors may be the most appropriate option. However, for paths with a higher use level and those located in steep-sloped sites, it is desirable to define a single track, following stony or bouldery surfaces wherever possible, to keep the disturbed area to a minimum. It is clear that both environmental conditions and expected use levels must be taken into account in determining when and where it is more appropriate to concentrate or disperse human activities. Even though they may have performed satisfactorily to date, the increasing pressure in terms of numbers of visits for certain sites may make it necessary to revise existing codes of conduct.

AB  - The environmental assessment of a new biocomposite preparation based on Trichoderma sp. L-6, L-3, and D-11 strains for the biodegradation of crop residues was carried out under the conditions of model experiments. The effect of biocomposite (titer not less than 10(9) cells/mL) on the microbial complex of turf soil was evaluated when applied in quantities corresponding to the recommended (2 L/ha), reduced (1 L/ha) and increased (4 L/ha) hectare doses. After 45 days the number of the main ecological-trophic and taxonomic groups of microorganisms involved in the nitrogen and carbon transformation cycles was taken into account. The calculation of ecological coefficients of mineralization and pedotrophy, which characterize the direction of microbiological processes, did not reveal significant changes in the structure of the soil microbial community in comparison with intact soil. Triticum aestivum, Sinapis alba, and Trifolium pannonicum were used as test cultures to study the phytotoxicity of Trichoderma spp. The initial preparative form of all the studied strains suppressed the vital activity of plants. When diluted with 1:10 and 1:100, phytotoxicity decreased, and the growth-stimulating properties of the strains were manifested. The highest level of phytotoxic effects was found in the cruciferous culture, growth-stimulating effect - in the legume culture. Based on the results obtained, recommendations are made for the practical use of a biocomposite based on Trichoderma fungi.

AB  - Phytoplankton is the main indicator group for eutrophication in coastal ecosystems, however its high dispersal potential does not enable the assessment of localized effects of coastal nutrient enrichment. Benthic diatoms are sessile microalgae associated with sandy substrates and have the potential to reflect more localized pollution impacts. Although benthic diatoms are widely used bioindicators in freshwater systems, they have rarely been used for assessing the eutrophication status of oligotrophic environments such as the eastern Mediterranean Sea. In the present study, we assess the efficiency of benthic diatoms as bioindicators of nutrient enrichment in oligotrophic coastal systems, by investigating the effect of different physicochemical conditions and nutrient concentrations on the assemblage composition, diversity and individual species populations. To do this, we sampled along a eutrophication gradient formed by anthropogenic nutrient inputs from a metropolitan area. The main driver of assemblage composition, diversity and biomass of diatoms was nitrogen concentration and its temporal and spatial changes. Nitrogen loadings were positively correlated with increased biomass of Cocconeis spp. and negatively correlated with Mastogloia spp. Our findings suggest that in coastal ecosystems of oligotrophic marine ecoregions, benthic diatom assemblage structure and specific taxonomic groups can be reliable predictors of coastal eutrophication offering higher spatial resolution compared to phytoplankton.

AB  - Methodological advances are essential for robust ecological research. Quantitative reconstructions of environmental conditions using testate amoebae rely on sound taxonomy. While the taxonomy of large species is relatively well resolved, this is not the case for most small taxa (typically <45 mu m long). In New Zealand, peatlands contain a diversity of both cosmopolitan and characteristic large southern endemic taxa, but also have a high abundance of small taxa. The latter are often lumped into morphotypes reducing their value as ecological indicators. In this study, we demonstrate how (a) lumping small taxa versus splitting them into unique types, and (b) including or excluding them from community analysis influenced their ecological inference. We assessed testate amoeba composition in six peat bogs from New Zealand, three that were moderately-to-highly impacted, and three that were non-impacted. Environmental variables were measured at each sampling site and the surface testate amoeba community patterns and community-environment relationships compared. We found a clear division between impacted and non-impacted sites. Several distinct small taxa were more strongly related to water-table depth and conductivity, while the larger taxa were more correlated to pH. These results show that improved taxonomic resolution of small taxa can provide more informed environmental assessment. (C) 2018 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - When an ecosystem reaches tipping points for selected indicators, resilience to further changes in external drivers can decrease, regime shifts can occur that diminish the capacity of the ecosystem to provide ecosystem services, and the ecosystem is more vulnerable to collapse. Evaluating tipping points for resilience using crisp decision rules can result in decision errors about whether or not resilience has been compromised. The source and nature of those errors are described and a fuzzy decision rule is proposed for evaluating resilience. Decision errors are evaluated for four cases. Cases 1 through 3 (or case 4) derive conditions for evaluating decision errors when there is a single (or multiple) indicator(s). The primary sources of decision errors for the four cases are discrepancies between measured (or established) and true values of the indicators (or tipping points) and using a crisp decision rule to reach conclusions about whether or not resilience has been compromised. A fuzzy decision rule, based on fuzzy TOPSIS, is proposed that evaluates the extent to which an ecosystem is resilient. Although crisp decision rules provide unambiguous conclusions about resilience, those conclusions can be faulty, particularly when measured indicators and established tipping points deviate substantially from their true values. In contrast, the conclusions from the fuzzy decision rule are less susceptible to the decision errors and, hence, faulty decisions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) may face ecological extinction in Georgia due to hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) invasion. Hemlock demise is predicted to lead to a large influx of hemlock wood into streams. We sampled invertebrates in Billingsley Creek, a Georgia Appalachian headwater stream, to test the hypothesis that this influx of coarse woody debris (CWD) will shift community composition by diversifying and adding to ecosystem structure. To mimic a mass hemlock die-off, similar to 600 m(3)/ha of variously sized dead hemlock wood was introduced to 11 of 21 plots. We sampled macroinvertebrates and environmental conditions at all plots for 1 year before and 1 year after wood introductions. Benthic invertebrates responded positively but marginally to introduced wood in terms of abundance, biomass, and diversity. Results suggested that CWD is a limiting resource for invertebrate abundance and biomass in Billingsley Creek. Plots with introduced wood collected significantly more benthic organic matter (63.2 g/m(2)) than plots without introduced wood (20.6 g/m(2)) in December, soon after leaf-fall (P = 0.049), which may help explain this response. Several shredder taxa were indicators of introduced wood. We predict that a future influx of deadwood will alter community composition without posing a threat to its constituents.

AB  - The potential impacts on natural enemies of crops that produce insecticidal Cry proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are an important part of an environmental risk assessment. Entomopathogenic nematodes are important natural enemies of lepidopteran pests, and the effects of Bt crops on these nontarget organisms should be investigated to avoid disruption of their biological control function. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of Cry1Ac-expressing transgenic Bt broccoli on the entomopathogenic nematode, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Poinar (Rhabditida: Heterorhabditidae), under tri-trophic conditions. Using Cry1Ac-resistant Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) larvae as hosts, we evaluated the potential impact of Cry1Ac-expressing Bt broccoli on several fitness parameters of H. bacteriophora. Virulence, reproductive potential, time of emergence, and preference of H. bacteriophora for the host (P. xylostella) were not significantly affected when Cry1Ac-resistant P. xylostella larvae were reared on leaves of Cry1Ac or non-Bt broccoli. Also the aforementioned parameters of the subsequent generation of H. bacteriophora did not differ between nematodes obtained from P. xylostella reared on Cry1Ac broccoli compared with those obtained from P. xylostella reared on non-Bt broccoli. To the best of our knowledge, the current study provides the first clear evidence that Cry1Ac does not affect important fitness parameters of H. bacteriophora.

AB  - This paper reviews assessments of environmental impacts arising from consumption, taking into account the production and disposal of goods consumed. Assessments have mostly focused on understanding household consumption, but there is an increasing interest in understanding government consumption, as well as in the treatment of gross capital formation and trade. National economic and environmental accounts are the most frequently used data source for such studies and input-output techniques are usually applied. For many OECD countries and a few developing countries, assessments address only energy or greenhouse gas emissions. Few studies address a broader range of emissions-related environmental impacts. There is a lack of consideration for important pressures on ecosystems such as habitat change and overexploitation of fisheries and forests. In all countries, housing and food are important. In poor countries, public services can contribute substantially, while in rich countries, mobility and the consumption of manufactured goods is important. In rapidly developing economies, investments, especially in infrastructure and buildings, are important causes of environmental pressure as well. Differences in production conditions and pollution intensities across countries are substantial, so explicitly modelling the production of internationally traded goods using multi-regional input-output analysis is necessary to account correctly for the environmental impacts arising from the consumption of imported goods.

AB  - During the 1994/1995 EMAP-Estuaries program in the Carolinian Province we investigated the feasibility of using parasites of fish as response indicators. Parasites of fish are an indigenous component of healthy ecosystems. Within the EMAP-E design, the suite of environmental parameters which may affect parasite abundance, richness, prevalence, and diversity can be divided into three categories: I) the physical and chemical characteristics of the water and sediment (including contaminants) external to the fish; 2) the internal environment defined by the physical condition (physiological) of individual fish; and 3) the presence and relative abundance of benthic macroinvertebrates, many of which serve as intermediate hosts. The biotic response of parasites to environmental stressors is also reflected in the health of fish. Parasite assemblages of silver perch Bairdiella chrysura respond to both natural and anthropogenic stressors. Our results showed that particular environmental stressors and specific parasites that respond include: temperature and monogeneans; contaminants and nematodes; low dissolved oxygen and protists; and salinity, together with a mixture of metal and organic contaminants and crustacea. Parasites of fish are useful biomarkers and appear to be more sensitive to environmental stressors than are the fish themselves. Parasite responses to selected environmental stressors may be used to discriminate polluted and unpolluted sites. The use of parasites of fish as biomarkers has relevant application to fisheries management and coastal monitoring programs.

AB  - Hopanes preserved in both modern and ancient sediments are recognized as the molecular fossils of bacteriohopanepolyols, pentacyclic hopanoid lipids. Based on the phylogenetic distribution of hopanoid production by extant bacteria, hopanes have been used as indicators of specific bacterial groups and/or their metabolisms. However, our ability to interpret them ultimately depends on understanding the physiological roles of hopanoids in modern bacteria. Toward this end, we set out to identify genes required for hopanoid biosynthesis in the anoxygenic phototroph Rhodopseudomonas palustris TIE-1 to enable selective control of hopanoid production. We attempted to delete 17 genes within a putative hopanoid biosynthetic gene cluster to determine their role, if any, in hopanoid biosynthesis. Two genes, hpnH and hpnG, are required to produce both bacteriohopanetetrol and aminobacteriohopanetriol, whereas a third gene, hpnO, is required only for aminobacteriohopanetriol production. None of the genes in this cluster are required to exclusively synthesize bacteriohopanetetrol, indicating that at least one other hopanoid biosynthesis gene is located elsewhere on the chromosome. Physiological studies with the different deletion mutants demonstrated that unmethylated and C30 hopanoids are sufficient to maintain cytoplasmic but not outer membrane integrity. These results imply that hopanoid modifications, including methylation of the A-ring and the addition of a polar head group, may have biologic functions beyond playing a role in membrane permeability.

AB  - Pathogenic enteric bacteria are a major cause of drinking water related morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Solar disinfection (SODIS) is an effective means to fight this problem. In the present study, SODIS of two important enteric pathogens, Shigella flexneri and Salmonella typhimurium, was investigated with a variety of viability indicators including cellular ATP levels, efflux pump activity, glucose uptake ability, and polarization and integrity of the cytoplasmic membrane. The respiratory chain of enteric bacteria was identified to be a likely target of sunlight and UVA irradiation. Furthermore, during dark storage after irradiation, the physiological state of the bacterial cells continued to deteriorate even in the absence of irradiation: apparently the cells were unable to repair damage. This strongly suggests that for S. typhimurium and Sh. flexneri, a relatively small light dose is enough to irreversibly damage the cells and that storage of bottles after irradiation does not allow regrowth of inactivated bacterial cells. In addition, we show that light dose reciprocity is an important issue when using simulated sunlight. At high irradiation intensities (>700 W m(-2)) light dose reciprocity failed and resulted in an overestimation of the effect, whereas reciprocity applied well around natural sunlight intensity (<400 W m(-2)).

AB  - Recent findings suggest that nitric oxide (NO) is an important biologic mediator which exerts a wide variety of effects on numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes. L-Arginine is oxidized to L-citrulline with concomitant NO production; as a result, nitrate and nitrite accumulates, This study was conducted to determine the potential NO production by proximal tubular cells (PTC) in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and cytokines and to evaluate the cytotoxic effect associated with NO release. After a 7-day stimulation with LPS (100 mu g/ml), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) (10 ng/ml), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) (10 ng/ml), the nitrate and nitrite levels were determined by a spectrophotometric method based on the Griess reaction. Moreover, alpha-methylglucopyranoside phosphate and lactate dehydrogenase release and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay served as indicators of sodium-dependent hexose transport integrity and cell death, respectively, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha used alone or together or combined with LPS led to a significant generation of NO by PTC. Our results also demonstrate that NO induced by LPS and cytokines could inhibit sodium-dependent transport and could induce PTC damage.

AB  - Producing food to meet rising global demand requires a more thorough understanding of how farming systems can ensure food security without compromising economic, environmental, and social sustainability. This dilemma can be addressed through a social-ecological systems approach to ecosystem service assessment, which assesses the linkages between the different components of an agricultural social-ecological system - beef production in the Canadian Prairies. Using this framework, we documented the relationships between governance and management, social and ecological structures and processes, ecosystem services and human well-being for these systems. We also examined how this framework could aid in the greater integration of ecosystem services into decision-making and management practices for these systems. The framework was applied to all stages of the prairie beef production cycle, consisting of the cow-calf, backgrounding, finishing and feed production stages. The benefits, shortcomings and limitations of such an approach as well as the state of knowledge on relationships between the components of the system are discussed, and recommendations for future research directions, farm management strategies and policy are proposed. Overall, the high degree of heterogeneity in biophysical and socio-economic conditions across the prairie landscape underscores the need for more site-specific ecosystem service assessments and environmental stewardship policies that are tailored to these specific contexts.

AB  - Climate change is mainly generated by an increase of greehouse gas emissions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has established mitigation and adaptation as strategies to deal with climate change. However, few studies have been developed jointly. With the purpose of studying the possible synergies between mitigation and adaptation, three coffee production systems in the municipality of Libano: agroforestry systems (AFS) with Cordia allidora, AFS with plantain and monocultures, with four replications by treatment, were evaluated. As mitigation indicator, the carbon footprint in the coffee production and processing was estimated, whereas the adaptation was measured as the ant diversity. The AFS with C. alliodora favor both mitigation and adaptation to climate change since they have a positive carbon footprint and the greatest richness of ant genus (12.8 vs -3.0 vs -6.4 Mg CO(2)e/ha/year in carbon footprint and 1.3 vs 0.6 vs 0.6 of Margalef Index of ants in AFS with C. alliodora, AFS with plantain and monoculture, respectively). The agricultural production systems, environmental-friendly managed and associated with native trees, are a good strategy to implement in programs of mitigation-adaptation of climate change. The inclusion of native tree favors the producer's economy and increases the shelter places and the minimal conditions for surviving, similar to natural ecosystems so the different groups of animals for climate change adaptation.

AB  - Although a number of biomarkers of pollutant exposure have been identified in invertebrate species, little is known about the effect on Malpighian tubules playing an essential role in excretion and osmoregulation. Analyses of structural and functional alterations on this organ can be useful to predict the effects at the organism and population level in monitoring studies of environmental pollution. The aim of the present review is to provide a synthesis of existing knowledge on cellular damages induced by xenobiotics in Malpighian tubules both under laboratory and field conditions. We compared studies of exposure to pesticides and heavy metals as mainly environmental contaminants from anthropogenic activities. This report provided evidence that the exposure to xenobiotics has an effect on this organ and reinforces the need for further research integrating molecular biomarkers with analysis on Malpighian tubules.

   Malpighian tubules are the primary excretory and osmoregulator organs of insects. Data reviewed here show that the exposure to pesticides and heavy metals cause alterations in the cells of Malpighian tubules easily recognizable by ultrastructural analyses. As insects inhabit an enormous range of ecological niches both in terrestrial and aquatic environments, alterations in Malpighian tubules are a good candidate for monitoring studies as biomarkers of sublethal effects induced by toxicants.

AB  - Climate change will exacerbate the degree of abiotic stress experienced by semi-arid ecosystems. While abiotic stress profoundly affects biotic interactions, their potential role as modulators of ecosystem responses to climate change is largely unknown. Using plants and biological soil crusts, we tested the relative importance of facilitative-competitive interactions and other community attributes (cover, species richness and species evenness) as drivers of ecosystem functioning along stress gradients in semi-arid Mediterranean ecosystems. Biotic interactions shifted from facilitation to competition along stress gradients driven by water availability and temperature. These changes were, however, dependent on the spatial scale and the community considered. We found little evidence to suggest that biotic interactions are a major direct influence upon indicators of ecosystem functioning (soil respiration, organic carbon, water-holding capacity, compaction and the activity of enzymes related to the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles) along stress gradients. However, attributes such as cover and species richness showed a direct effect on ecosystem functioning. Our results do not agree with predictions emphasizing that the importance of plant-plant interactions will be increased under climate change in dry environments, and indicate that reductions in the cover of plant and biological soil crust communities will negatively impact ecosystems under future climatic conditions.

AB  - A study on variation in energy exchange characteristics and their relation with total leave dry weight was conducted in sixteen Himalayan tree species grown under identical natural environmental conditions at 550 m altitude in Central Himalayas. The study revealed a highly positive correlation in all the species between the total energy absorbed by their leaves and leaf dry weight, which is directly correlated with total plant biomass. Therefore, the possibility of using leaf energy exchange characteristics as a means of predicting the biomass production potential is proposed.

AB  - The results of a biomonitoring survey carried out in the town of Siena (central Italy) using the biodiversity of epiphytic lichens as indicator of air pollution are reported. The general picture was rather good, with more than 60% of the study area being in the categories "semi-natural" or "natural" according to a calibrated scale of environmental naturality/alteration. Compared with the situation of 1995, ameliorating conditions were found as a result of an improvement in air quality over time. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wound healing is an essential process to restore tissue integrity after trauma. Large skin wounds such as burns often heal with hypertrophic scarring and contractures, resulting in disfigurements and reduced joint mobility. Such adverse healing outcomes are less common in the oral mucosa, which generally heals faster compared to skin. Several studies have identified differences between oral and skin wound healing. Most of these studies however focus only on a single stage of wound healing or a single cell type. The aim of this review is to provide an extensive overview of wound healing in skin versus oral mucosa during all stages of wound healing and including all cell types and molecules involved in the process and also taking into account environmental specific factors such as exposure to saliva and the microbiome. Next to intrinsic properties of resident cells and differential expression of cytokines and growth factors, multiple external factors have been identified that contribute to oral wound healing. It can be concluded that faster wound closure, the presence of saliva, a more rapid immune response, and increased extracellular matrix remodeling all contribute to the superior wound healing and reduced scar formation in oral mucosa, compared to skin.

AB  - Industrial zones have been key drivers of growth across Asia but are also the source of water quality deterioration in surrounding rivers and streams. This study examined the effects of industrial zone located at the San Cristobal sub-catchment of Laguna de Bay, the Philippines on the spatiotemporal variation in water quality and benthic macroinvertebrate communities. Sampling sites were established in upstream and downstream sections of two tributaries of San Cristobal River, and the main channel of Diezmo River, and were sampled in 2018 during dry (February and April) and rainy (June and October) seasons. Results showed significant spatial difference with declining water quality (low dissolved oxygen; high levels of ammonia-nitrogen, phosphate-phosphorus, and total suspended solids) at the downstream sites. Consequently, benthic macroinvertebrates responded via change in community structure and composition (decline in pollution-sensitive taxa from upstream through downstream) to water quality degradation related to industrial land use downstream. Furthermore, seasonal variation was observed in benthic macroinvertebrate communities due to the absence of spate-induced disturbance, allowing benthic macroinvertebrates to proliferate in the rainy season. Findings of this study reveal that benthic macroinvertebrates can be used as bioindicators in the evaluation of the ecological integrity of surface river and stream systems that pass through industrial zones.

AB  - Molecular studies, especially in relation to the activity of secondary metabolite gene clusters, require the ability to extract good quality RNA from fungal biomass. This is often hindered by the cell wall structure and endogenous RNase activity in filamentous fungi. There is thus a need for rapid methods for the extraction of good quality RNA for use in microarrays and for quantitative PCR assays. The objective of this study was to examine the use of different systems for the high throughput method to extract intact RNA from filamentous fungi. Two bead beating systems with different motion patterns and speed capacities were tested in the development of the extraction protocol. They were evaluated based on the total RNA yield and overall RNA quality. The high speed bead beating with glass beads associated with an automated purification method gave more than three times higher total RNA yields with less than a quarter of the amount of mycelium required. Furthermore the integrity and overall quality was conserved, with RNA Quality Indicator (RQI) numbers consistently >7.5. This method also reduced cross contamination risks and kept RNA handling to a minimum while still being capable of multiple sample processing, reducing the time required to obtain RNA from filamentous fungi.

AB  - In response to accidental oil spills at sea, chemical oil dispersants are utilized to limit negative impacts on nearby littoral zones. However, current evidence suggests that such dispersants may be toxic to aquatic organisms. Blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and giant scallops (Placopecten magellanicus) were exposed to different environmentally relevant concentrations of oil dispersant and their behavioural responses were closely monitored using high frequency (10Hz) valvometry. Behavioural valve responses included rapid closures when oil dispersant was added to the experimental tanks. At higher concentrations, the mussels remained closed throughout the exposure period. The giant scallop displayed escape behaviours (clapping) prior to mortality, suggesting toxicity of the oil dispersant. Relationships between different behavioural indicators and oil dispersant concentrations were observed for both species, but with different trends. While scallops demonstrated positive correlations between gaping behaviours and dispersant concentration, mussels exhibited a concentration threshold beyond which the gaping behaviour was characteristic of longer closure periods. This study highlights behavioural response differences consistent with bivalve-specific biological traits: the continuous valve closure of an intertidal species, M. edulis, firmly attached to the substrate, and the escapement behaviours of a semi-mobile subtidal species, P. magellanicus. From these observations, it appears that valvometry could be used as a tool for environmental assessments.

AB  - The taxonomic status, biotechnological and ecological potential of several Micromonospora strains isolated from an extreme hyper arid Atacama Desert soil were determined. Initially, a polyphasic study was undertaken to clarify the taxonomic status of five micromonosporae, strains LB4, LB19, LB32(T), LB39(T) and LB41, isolated from an extreme hyper-arid soil collected from one of the driest regions of the Atacama Desert. All of the isolates were found to have chemotaxonomic, cultural and morphological properties consistent with their classification in the genus Micromonospora. Isolates LB32(T) and LB39(T) were distinguished from their nearest phylogenetic neighbours and proposed as new species, namely as Micromonospora arida sp. nov. and Micromonospora inaquosa sp. nov., respectively. Eluted methanol extracts of all of the isolates showed activity against a panel of bacterial and fungal indicator strains, notably against multi-drug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 700603 while isolates LB4 and LB41 showed pronounced anti-tumour activity against HepG2 cells. Draft genomes generated for the isolates revealed a rich source of novel biosynthetic gene clusters, some of which were unique to individual strains thereby opening up the prospect of selecting especially gifted micromonosporae for natural product discovery. Key stress-related genes detected in the genomes of all of the isolates provided an insight into how micromonosporae adapt to the harsh environmental conditions that prevail in extreme hyper-arid Atacama Desert soils.

AB  - Soil erosion rates on six semi-arid loamy upland rangeland sites located in southeastern Arizona were measured using a rainfall simulator and Cs-137 fallout methods. Site characteristics that have the greatest effects on soil. erosion and runoff were identified. Long term (50 years) soil erosion rates as estimated using Cs-137 method varied between 5.1 and 11.0 Mg ha(-1) y(-1) and showed significant differences between Historic Climax Plant Community and Mesquite/Native states within the State and Transition Model. Erosion rates under simulated rainfall were measured between 0.9 and 17.2 g m(-2) min(-1) at 175 mm h(-1) precipitation across all sites and varied as much as 8-fold at the same location, depending on the time of the simulation. Temporal variability of erosion rates within a site was in some cases much greater than inter-site differences. This variability was attributed to natural or management driven changes in plant community and soil characteristics. Bare soil area, an aggregate indicator for all types of cover combined, was the main controlling factor of erosion process across ecological sites. For meaningful interpretation rainfall simulation, results must be placed in the context of the range of possible vegetation and surface conditions within a given ecological site.

AB  - Upper Saalian (Illinoian) glaciolacustrine deposits in central Poland, preserved in a tectonic graben, were exposed in an opencast lignite mine and investigated using sedimentological and micro-paleontological methods. The extraglacial lake sediments provide the first records of late Saalian cladoceran communities in central Europe, recovered from glaciolacustrine deposits. Sedimentation was dominated by a supply of clastics that fluctuated with the seasons, forming rhythmites. In addition to seasonal cyclicity, sedimentary and environmental conditions changed every several years to decades, with periods of increased inflow to the lake delivering sandy material, and periods of almost stagnant water dominated by suspension settling. The sediments contain Cladocera assemblages that indicate the lake was initially deep, oligotrophic, and filled with moderately cold water. Changes in Cladocera community composition and abundance were perhaps responses to climate seasonality. Zones without Cladocera were associated with seasons of higher inflow and sediment supply, and directly or indirectly, with tectonic activity in the graben. Earthquakes, documented by the presence of seismites, caused not only deformation of unconsolidated lake-bottom sediments, but possibly also changes in habitat characteristics. Combined sedimentological and biological data were used to infer the lake's history and show that deposits of glaciolacustrine lakes can be used as indicators of past ecological and climate changes.

AB  - The ecological interpretation of extinct plants requires that function-based ecological analogy be made between extant and extinct organisms. Particularly for non-angiosperns, such analogy has been reluctantly assumed. Using a non-angiosperm model, this study identifies a specific suite of characters that can be used to interpret light environments for ancient plants; The tree fern Cyathea caracasana is used as a living model because it offers structural and architectural analogy with ancient tree ferns and some Paleozoic free-standing arborescent pteridosperms. A variety of leaf anatomical and morphological measurements were made on 34 individuals growing in secondary forest and abandoned pasture at Reserva Natural La Planada, Narino, Colombia. Leaf characters were correlated with site-light conditions quantified from hemispherical photographs. Spearman correlation coefficients show that blade size, petiole length, and palisade/spongy mesophyll ratio are well correlated with light environment. Significant relationships ps were also observed in frond surface area, thickness of ultimate segment, epidermis thickness, and hypodermis thickness. Although some features may be influenced by nutrient and water status, a well-developed palisade layer and thick hypodermis are specific indicators of light environment that vary plastically in Cyathea caracasana. These data can be used to refine ecological interpretations of extinct foliage; Alethopteris- and Neuropteris-type medullosan pteridosperms of the Middle Pennsylvanian (Westphalian) of Euramerica provide an illustrative example.

AB  - Estimating spatial patterns of variability in coastal marine priority habitats may allow to plan monitoring programs and impact evaluation studies and to optimize sampling designs in environmental investigations. In this study the spatial variability of the vertical distribution (18 m, 23 m, 28 m, 33 m, and 38 m of depth) of coralligenous cliff assemblages was estimated in three marine biogeographic areas of the Mediterranean Sea: the Sardinia Sea, the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Bonifacio Strait. Sampling sites were selected in the West, North, and East coast of Sardinia, all in pristine conditions (far from any anthropogenic sources of influence and in highly oligothrophic water). Important variations among areas in the vertical zonation of the coralligenous cliffs have emerged, especially at the shallower depths, and the dominant taxa have been highlighted. Despite these unconsistencies, a common increase in the number of taxa/groups per sample was found with depth. Thermal environment and hydrodynamics have been discussed as the most likely important drivers of such variability. Overall, these data support the hypothesis that coralligenous cliff assemblages unaffected by local anthropogenic disturbance may be relevantly different in structure and indicate that the lack of gorgonians and bryozoans (commonly used as ecological indicators) is not necessarily a sign of local human impact, as it may be the result of biogeographic patterns.

AB  - Marine recreation activities have been flourishing in Taiwan recently. "Gold Coast" with a beautiful and long gold beach in Tainan City has excellent natural environmental conditions for marine recreation activities. However, how marine recreation activities coexist with offshore oyster farming becomes an important issue. This study explored the trade-off analysis of Tainan Gold Coast recreation activities with stakeholders' perspective, in order to make various sea uses coexist and develop. The approach of trade-off analysis adopts a framework of Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) to organize information and facilitate evaluation of the options and their impacts. This study developed 3 scenarios of "Gold Coast" sea use. The areas of oyster farming and marine recreation activities (with power and with non-power) along the "Gold Coast" were presented with different use proportions. The values of 3 scenarios based on social, economical and ecological criteria and their 6 indicators were derived with the contingent valuation method and official statistical data. Finally, this study used the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to gain the weights of 3 criteria and 6 indicators from stakeholders including oyster farmers, water recreation enthusiasts, local residents and officers in Tainan City. The findings indicate that the scenario C that oyster farming and marine recreation activities use the proportion of the waters area along "Gold Coast" as 3: 7 over the conflicting zone is the optimum solution.

AB  - Environmental change that disrupts communication during mate choice and alters sexual selection could influence population dynamics. Yet little is known about such long-term effects. We investigated experimentally the consequences that disrupted visual communication during mate choice has for the quantity and viability of offspring produced in a threespine stickleback population (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We further related the results to long term monitoring of population dynamics in the field to determine if changes are apparent under natural conditions. The results show that impaired visual communication because of algal blooms reduces reliability of male visual signals as indicators of offspring survival during their first weeks of life. This relaxes sexual selection but has no effect on the number of offspring hatching, as most males have a high hatching success in turbid water. Despite eutrophication and high turbidity levels that interfere with communication during mate choice, the population has grown during recent decades. Large numbers of offspring hatching, combined with high variation in juvenile fitness, has probably shifted selection to later life history stages and maintained a viable population. Together with reduced cost of sexual selection and ongoing ecosystem changes caused by human activities, this could have promoted population growth. These results point to the complexity of ecosystems and the necessity to consider all influencing factors when attempting to understand impacts of human activities on populations.

AB  - In this study focusing on human-environment interactions, we analyze the use of an immersive visualization theater (IVT) for exploring how humans use and value cultural ecosystem services provided by natural landscapes in Israel's Carmel Forest. Our goal in this inductive, exploratory study is to assess the impact of the IVT on the quality and content of stakeholder discussions held in the theater.
   We facilitated 10 focus group discussions in the IVT, where a series of high-resolution photographs were projected. Participants were asked (in writing and orally) to choose from among the scenes where they would prefer to spend time, and then asked to explain their answers. Next, they were asked to describe activities in selected scenes in which they were likely to participate. We suggest that the immersion theater, due to screen size, photo resolution, social interaction, and group isolation within the theater, elicited attention to detail and triggered memories and sensory responses to various landscapes. The qualitative data derived from focus group discussions add to our understanding of the diverse meanings and importance that different people attribute to the landscape, contribute to understanding the social processes and conditions through which participants attribute value to cultural ecosystem services, and allow us to generate testable hypotheses for continuing research.

AB  - Development of effective methods for assessing the ecological status of lakes based on littoral benthic fauna has been hampered by the lack of quantitative data on the relative impacts of key pressures on the benthic community. We used variance partitioning at 126 sites belonging to 14 natural Mediterranean lakes to analyze the pure and shared effects of eutrophication, morphological alterations, microhabitat type, lake morphometry and geographic position on the littoral macroinvertebrate community. The spatial arrangement of the sampling sites was responsible for 9.1% of the total variance in littoral benthic community composition, lake morphometry accounted for 4.3% of variation, and microhabitat type accounted for 3.9%. Communities appeared to be affected primarily by morphological alterations to lake shorelines, and their impact was 2.5 times as important as that of eutrophication. The structure of littoral benthic communities was governed by processes acting at several spatial scales from region to lake scale. Thus, several pressures and the various spatial scales at which these act should be taken into account when implementing methods of assessing lake ecological condition based on littoral benthic invertebrates. Region-specific methods for subalpine and volcanic lakes might enhance the validity of assessment of results of morphological alterations and improve management of those water resources.

AB  - Eight medium amendments were conducted on top of a fine ash coal dump (i) to evaluate a few cost-effective treatments that could determine the minimum fertility status required for the local ash to support the establishment of a viable vegetation cover, and (ii) to select suitable grass species that would establish on the ash and could serve as a foundation for long-term rehabilitation. Degree and success of grass establishment per medium amelioration treatment is expressed in terms of total biomass, percentage basal cover, and in terms of a condition assessment model. Both the chemical and physical nature of the ash medium before and after amendment was characterized, as were the concentrations of some essential and potentially toxic elements in leaf samples. In terms of medium amelioration 5000 kg ha(-1) compost, or 500 kg ha(-1) kraal manure or 480 kg 2:3:2 ha(-1) proved to be most effective. The grass species that occurred with the highest frequency, irrespective of treatment, were the perennials bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. var, dactylon], weeping lovegrass [Eragrostis curvula (Schrader) Nees], and the annual teff [Eragrostis ref (Zuccagni) Trotter]. Of the potentially toxic extractable metals monitored in the leaves of vegetation on the dump, only Se accumulated to an average level of 4.4 mg kg(-1) that could be toxic to livestock.

AB  - Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) is a technique used worldwide to increase the availability of water resources. We study how MAR modifies microbial ecosystems and its implications for enhancing biodegradation processes to eventually improve groundwater quality. We compare soil and groundwater samples taken from a MAR facility located in NE Spain during recharge (with the facility operating continuously for several months) and after 4 months of no recharge. The study demonstrates a strong correlation between soil and water microbial prints with respect to sampling location along the mapped infiltration path. In particular, managed recharge practices disrupt groundwater ecosystems by modifying diversity indices and the composition of microbial communities, indicating that infiltration favors the growth of certain populations. Analysis of the genetic profiles showed the presence of nine different bacterial phyla in the facility, revealing high biological diversity at the highest taxonomic range. In fact, the microbial population patterns under recharge conditions agree with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH). Moreover, DNA sequence analysis of excised denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) band patterns revealed the existence of indicator species linked to MAR, most notably Dehalogenimonas sp., Nitrospira sp. and Vogesella sp.. Our real facility multidisciplinary study (hydrological, geochemical and microbial), involving soil and groundwater samples, indicates that MAR is a naturally based, passive and efficient technique with broad implications for the biodegradation of pollutants dissolved in water.

AB  - High mountain ecosystems and their biota are governed by low-temperature conditions and thus can be used as indicators for climate warming impacts on natural ecosystems, provided that long-term data exist. We used data from the largest alpine to nival permanent plot site in the Alps, established in the frame of the Global Observation Research Initiative in Alpine Environments (GLORIA) on Schrankogel in the Tyrolean Alps, Austria, in 1994, and resurveyed in 2004 and 2014. Vascular plant species richness per plot increased over the entire period, albeit to a lesser extent in the second decade, because disappearance events increased markedly in the latter period. Although presence/absence data could only marginally explain range shift dynamics, changes in species cover and plant community composition indicate an accelerating transformation towards a more warmth-demanding and more drought-adapted vegetation, which is strongest at the lowest, least rugged subsite. Divergent responses of vertical distribution groups of species suggest that direct warming effects, rather than competitive displacement, are the primary causes of the observed patterns. The continued decrease in cryophilic species could imply that trailing edge dynamics proceed more rapidly than successful colonisation, which would favour a period of accelerated species declines.

AB  - Mediterranean coastal ecosystems suffer many different types of natural and anthropogenic environmental pressure. Microbial communities, major conductors of organic matter decomposition are also subject to these environmental constraints. In this study, our aim was to understand how microbial activities vary at a small spatio-temporal scale in a Mediterranean coastal environment. Microbial activities were monitored in a Pinus halepensis litter collected from two areas, one close to (10 m) and one far from (300 m) the French Mediterranean coast. Litters were transferred from one area to the other using litterbags and studied via different microbial indicators after 2, 5 and 13 months. Microbial Basal Respiration, qCO(2), certain enzyme activities (laccase, cellulase, beta-glucosidase and acid phosphatase) and functional diversity via Biolog microplates were assayed in litterbags left in the area of origin as well as in litterbags transferred from one area to the other. Results highlight that microbial activities differ significantly in this short spatial scale overtime. The influence of microlocal conditions more intensified for litters situated close to the sea, especially during summer seems to have a stressful effect on microbial communities, leading to less efficient functional activities. However, microbial activities were more strongly influenced by temporal variations linked to seasonality than by location. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human settlements are the place where human beings live, among which the rural settlements can be regarded as a reflection of human-land relationship in mountain areas because their vertical distribution is greatly influenced by the specific geographical environment and ecological conditions of mountains. Based on field investigation, this paper uses physical, geographical, and ecological theories to make a comprehensive study of rural settlements and mountain disasters in the upper Min River, which is an ecologically fragile area with high-frequency disasters (collapse, landslide, debris flow, etc.) and a minority inhabit district. By applying these modern scientific theories, this paper attempts to shed some light on the relationship between rural settlements and mountain disasters. Consequently, an in-depth understanding of this relationship was achieved as follows: (1) Rural settlements and mountain disasters are mainly distributed in the intercepted flows of water and soil; and both quantity and quality of arable lands in mountains are important indicators of these flows. (2) The Small Watershed Management Project is a complex system of rural settlements and mountain disasters that interacts with and constrains the ecological system. By this project, the human survival will be better guaranteed. Being fundamental for the ecological reconstruction, the coupling mechanism of rural settlements and mountain disasters is not only an engine to promote harmonious development between human and nature, but also a bridge to link them.

AB  - Large storage facilities in hydropower-dominated river basins have traditionally been designed and managed to maximize revenues from energy generation. In an attempt to mitigate the externalities downstream due to a reduction in flow fluctuation, minimum flow requirements have been imposed to reservoir operators. However, it is now recognized that a varying flow regime including flow pulses provides the best conditions for many aquatic ecosystems. This paper presents a methodology to derive a trade-off relationship between hydropower generation and ecological preservation in a system with multiple reservoirs and stochastic inflows. Instead of imposing minimum flow requirements, the method brings more flexibility to the allocation process by building upon environmental valuation studies to derive simple demand curves for environmental goods and services, which are then used in a reservoir optimization model together with the demand for energy. The objective here is not to put precise monetary values on environmental flows but to see the marginal changes in release policies should those values be considered. After selecting appropriate risk indicators for hydropower generation and ecological preservation, the trade-off curve provides a concise way of exploring the extent to which one of the objectives must be sacrificed in order to achieve more of the other. The methodology is illustrated with the Zambezi River basin where large man-made reservoirs have disrupted the hydrological regime.

AB  - The extension of transgene technology to pasture species presents new challenges for ecological risk assessment because, unlike most crops, pasture plants are well adapted for persistence in mixed plant communities and are an important source of invasive species worldwide. Despite this, the impact of transgenic pasture plants on native ecosystems remains relatively unstudied. Here we use a community gradient modelling approach to investigate the performance of subterranean clover containing a nutrition-enhancing transgene over a range of ecologically important grassland communities at a study site in south-eastern Australia. Our data, which were collected over a full annual growing season, show that the transgenic clover line has different seedling survival and seed dormancy breakdown rates than the commercial non-transgenic line, which suggests that transgenic populations will decline faster than non-transgenic ones in perennial native grassland communities but could, under optimal climatic conditions, have potentially higher growth rates in grazed annual grasslands. These results demonstrate that changes to ecologically important demographic parameters can occur in plants containing transgenes that are not typically considered fitness enhancing, and that genotype by environment interactions and management regimes that impact on these parameters may influence the invasiveness of transgenic plants. Our study also demonstrates the utility of incorporating plant community gradient modelling into ecological risk assessment protocols designed for transgenic pasture plants.

AB  - Water conservation is one of the most critical ecosystem service functions of river basins and is an important indicator of regional eco-environmental conditions. Beijiang River Basin (BRB) is an important water source and ecological barrier for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area (GBA), and its water conservation function is of widespread concern. In this study, based on the hydrological model WEP-L (Water and Energy transfer Processes in Large River basin), and the water balance principle, we analysed the multiple time-scale characteristics of water conservation in the BRB during 1960-2018 and revealed the response of water conservation to climate change based on scenario setting and hydrological simulation. The results showed that annual water conservation exhibited an insignificant reducing trend of -4.69 mm/10a. Water conservation reduced insignificantly in spring, summer, and autumn, while it showed a nonsignificant increasing trend of 4.69 mm/10a in winter. The spatial distribution of water conservation in the BRB was low in the south and high in the north, mainly due to the spatial distribution of land use. Precipitation was the main factor affecting water conservation. The results can provide a reference for water resource planning and management, and provide a theoretical foundation for ecosystem restoration and reconstruction.

AB  - The study empirically investigates the relationship between financial development, sustainable economic opportunity and ecological footprint in Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries. The research was carried out utilizing time series data on financial access (bank branches per 100,000 adults), financial depth (private credit by deposit money banks to GDP), financial efficiency (bank return on equity percentage, after tax), financial stability (bank Z-score), composite index for financial development, ecological footprint indicator and sustainable economic opportunity. Bootstrap panel causality procedure based on meta-analysis in heterogeneous mixed panels was employed to test causal effects. The empirical results indicate the following; (i) causality between financial development, sustainable economic opportunity and ecological footprint varies across countries with different conditions, which leads to the conclusion that SADC countries are heterogeneous in nature, (ii) for the entire panel, financial development causally affects both sustainable economic opportunity and ecological footprint, and (iii) for the entire panel, sustainable economic opportunity causally affects ecological footprint. The findings suggest introduction of modern financial institutions, especially depository and investment institutions that will stimulate financial services and not only provide funds for investments in human and physical capital required to improve sustainable economic opportunity in SADC countries, but also make funds available for research and development of more efficient ecofriendly technologies.

AB  - Salt marshes are very important areas for biogeochemical cycling, sediment accretion, pollution filtration and retention and erosion and stabilization of the river margins. The high organic matter content in the salt marsh plant sediments along with the radial oxygen diffusion provided by these halophyte root systems gather the ideal conditions for the development of a microbial rhizosphere community. Due to the quick feedback of the microbial communities to an environmental change, these organisms become important monitors for environmental impact assessment. A Salt marsh Sediment Microbial Index (SSMI) that reflected physical-chemical and microbial parameters was applied to plant rhizosphere sediments of five salt marshes from three important water bodies from Portugal. The SSMI revealed to be plant-independent evaluating efficiently the different marshes according to their maturity degree and disturbance influence. Mature salt marshes SSMI classification grouped all the systems at this development stage, while the younger salt marshes are classified in different groups according to their evolution degree. Also the impact degree is reflected at this level discriminating also the more adversely impacted salt marshes. Being a multi-metric index, the SSMI sub-metrics are also susceptible of ecological interpretation, giving important backstage information about the underlying biogeochemical cycling processes.

AB  - The northern shrimp Pandalus borealis is an important prey species in North Atlantic marine systems and is the target of major fisheries. It reaches its southern limit of distribution in the western Gulf of Maine (GOM), where temperature is thought to play an important role in its stock dynamics. We examined recruitment dynamics of northern shrimp P. borealis in the GOM from 1968 to 2011 and before and after 1999, when a shift to warmer temperatures occurred (Friedland & Hare 2007). Recruitment was related to temperature during all 3 time periods and was related to the reproductive output of the population from 1968 to 2011 and 1968 to 1999 but not in the most recent period (2000 to 2011). Colder temperatures during the pelagic larval stage were associated with higher recruitment. Recruitment variability increased coincident with the 1999 temperature shift; other changes in the physical environment and lower trophic levels of the GOM have been seen as well. Whether the increase in recruitment variability signals a regime shift in the GOM is not yet clear. Increasing the reproductive potential of GOM northern shrimp through conservation measures could help compensate for increasingly unfavorable environmental conditions (warming) and increase the chances of preserving this population and its ecological role in the GOM.

AB  - Natural disaster's impact on the community and development's sustainability are occurring in aggravated and multiplied size and intensity. Global concern for finding appropriate ecological indicators stems partly from our inability to interpret early warning signals of a major ecological change, given the complexity of ecological systems. Traditional ecological knowledge represents experience acquired over thousands of years of direct human contact with the environment. Communities have evolved with the nature, its resources, its risks and natural processes as well which in certain conditions act as disasters due to their damaging impacts. Traditions of food, culture, spirituality, ethics and livelihoods have developed in the background of these natural or anthropogenic challenges in the background of interface between nature and human development, and thus, communities possess experience and knowledge to foresee, analysis, prepare for and face these challenges to sustain with resilience. India has a treasure of such indigenous and traditional knowledge of natural resource management and these can be extrapolated to understand the modern concepts of disaster risk management in terms of early warning, preparedness, mitigation, response and relief as well. Rajasthan and Bundelkhand, the regions historically known for drought disaster present icons showcasing the traditional wisdom. Present paper reviews the concepts and associated ecological hypothesis, traditional knowledge framework for disaster management in Indian context and discusses cases from Rajasthan and Bundelkhand in order to evolve recommendations for science and policies.

AB  - Aim To test the hypothesis that macroscale environmental variables explain local taxonomic richness of stream macroinvertebrates, and then to identify the relationships between these variables and benthic fauna richness in North Africa.
   Location North Africa, from West Morocco to East Tunisia.
   Methods Using a large-scale data base made of 211 sampling sites gathered from an area of 500,000 km(2), an artificial neural network model has been built to identify and predict the influence of macroscale environmental variables on local macroinvertebrate richness.
   Results The correlation coefficient (r) between observed and estimated taxon richness values was 0.75 (P < 0.001), and the model explained more than 55% (r(2) = 0.563) of the macroinvertebrate richness variation. Macroinvertebrate richness was, therefore, accurately predicted using only three environmental variables accounting for hydrology (number of rainy days), geographical factors, i.e. connections between European and North African land masses (longitude) and climatic gradient (altitude).
   Main conclusions Stream macroinvertebrate richness in North Africa results from a combination of climatic, geographical and hydrological parameters. Although consistent with current biogeographic and ecological concepts mainly derived from European and North American streams, this study underlines the specificity of dry Mediterranean ecosystems. The shape of diversity patterns results from climatic conditions and their associated environmental seasonal dynamics, which screens geographical processes.

AB  - The French government is planning the construction of offshore wind farms (OWF) in the next decade (around 2900 MW). Following the European Environmental Impact Assessment Directive 85/337/EEC, several studies have been undertaken to identify the environmental conditions and ecosystem functioning at selected sites prior to OWF construction. However, these studies are generally focused on the conservation of some species and there is no holistic approach for analysing the effects arising from OWF construction and operation. The objective of this article is to promote a sampling strategy to collect data on the different ecosystem compartments of the future Dieppe-Le Treport (DLT) wind farm site, adopting an ecosystem approach, which could be applied to other OWFs for the implementation of a trophic network analysis. For that purpose, an Ecopath model is used here to derive indices from Ecological Network Analysis (ENA) to investigate the ecosystem structure and functioning. The results show that the ecosystem is most likely detritus-based, associated with a biomass dominated by bivalves, which could act as a dead end for a classic trophic food web since their consumption by top predators is low in comparison to their biomass. The systemic approach developed for DLT OWF site should be applied for other French and European installations of Offshore Wind Farm.

AB  - BACKGROUND Tetracycline (TC) residues in water and soil have received wide attention due to their adverse effects on human health and ecosystem. Layer-structured biogenic manganese oxides (BMOs) could be obtained from fungi Pleosporales sp. Y-5 culture. Cobalt doping into BMOs (Co-BMOs) was conducted by a facile impregnation-calcination method to eliminate TC residues through activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS). RESULTS The TC in aqueous solution could be nearly completely removed in about 10 minutes under the optimal condition ([TC] = 50 mg L-1, [catalyst] = 0.2 g L-1, [PMS] = 0.4 g L-1, 25 degrees C). The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) identified the coexistence of SO4-center dot and OH center dot during PMS activation. The Co-BMOs catalyst remained great catalytic activity after five runs. Possible mechanism of PMS activation and TC degradation pathway were proposed. Preliminary biological toxicity test using green algae Chlorella vulgaris (FACHB-8) as ecological indicator confirmed that TC degradation solution was less toxic than the original solution. CONCLUSION This study demonstrated high catalytic activity and stability of Co-BMOs for degradation of TC by PMS activation. The Co-BMOs/PMS system is helpful in new efforts for TC degradation without generation of more toxic intermediates. (c) 2018 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - The formulation of scientifically justified guidelines for management of anthropogenic impacts on river health requires better understanding of the quantitative linkages among river-system parameters. The present study examines relationships between land use and biological metrics of river health in Tasmania, in the context of a variety of environmental drivers. An extensive dataset (103 sites) of macroinvertebrate assemblages was collected between 1999 and 2006. We hypothesised that grazing by domestic livestock would have the greatest impact on community structure of the land-use types investigated because grazing is a dominant land-use type in Tasmania (and can cover a large proportion of catchment area), because land clearance for grazing is rarely followed by regeneration and because historically riparian vegetation has not been protected. Multivariate and correlation analysis showed that community structure responded strongly to land use and confirmed that the strongest relationships were observed for grazing land use and environmental variables associated with grazing, such as e. g. water abstraction and/or regulation and riparian vegetation. Analyses accounting for hydrological region and location confirmed the generality of this relationship. We conclude that catchment-wide management actions would be required to mitigate these impacts of grazing because land use and riparian vegetation condition were generally stronger determinants of community structure at catchment rather than local scales.

AB  - Long-term monitoring is essential to evaluate the effects of wetland restoration projects. A monitoring program before and after restoration has been carried out in the study area located in the Yellow River Delta since 2001. Water quality, soil salinity. soil organic matter, plant community. and bird species were chosen as indicators in this program. During the past seven years, the restored wetland showed increasing efficiency in reducing water pollution levels. Soil quality was constantly improved through salinity reduction and soil organic matter accumulation. The vegetation community quickly re-established after the restoration was initiated in 2002. The restored vegetation communities provide favorable habitat conditions for birds and thirty-seven bird species were observed in October 2007. Based on Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), plant species and vegetation community are mainly influenced by soil salinity and water depth. These indicate that conducting freshwater to the project area is an efficient measure for vegetation restoration. While monitoring results show that the restoration project had positive effects on the wetland ecosystem over the past seven years, two issues remain for future study: (1) the contribution of harvesting vegetation to stabilizing nutrient removal rate and the accumulation of soil organic matter in the soil; and (2) the effects of excessive propagation of Phragmites australis on spatial heterogeneity and plant diversity.

AB  - Coastal areas are sensitive systems suffering both natural and anthropic pressures. Specifically, coastal sand dune dynamics is related with observable modifications in plant communities, and this relationship is being pointed out in recent years as a monitoring tool in littoral areas. Plant community types, with a relatively stable floristic composition related to specific ecologic conditions ("plant associations"), provide a suitable tool for bioindication within monitoring processes and in the management of littoral areas. In this regard, recent bio-geologic studies performed in dune systems of Southwest Europe allowed the identification of a number of specific bioindicators for both mobile and interior dunes.
   In Northwest Iberian Peninsula, sand dune vegetation is distinguished by its transitional character between typical Atlantic and Mediterranean vegetation types, and its originality is still enhanced by the occurrence of narrow endemic species and by the fact that most vegetation types are endemic to the territory. The organisation of these community types within dune systems is strongly determined by specific dynamic processes mediated by both natural and anthropic disturbances, so they present a large potential for bioindication of coastal dynamics and conservation status. In this paper, the most significant ecologic, floristic and biogeographic characters of sand dune vegetation in Northwest Iberian Peninsula are discussed with the purpose of demonstrating the usefulness of well-defined vegetation types for bioindication within the context of both short- and long-term monitoring of coastal sand dune systems.

AB  - Our study compared the soil collembolan at three semi-natural sites (a beech forest, a beech-fir forest and a fir stand) and three managed sites (Norway spruce, beech-fir and fir). Collembola were extracted from a total of 60 samples with a Bertese-Tullgren funnel, counted and identified to species level. A total of 7187 specimens, representing 51 species and 37 genera, were collected. There were significant differences between managed and natural forests (t-test, P = 0.000). The communities and their population densities were significantly lower in the managed site: 51 species with 708,498 ind m(-2) in the semi-natural forests to 36 species and 306,042 ind m(-2) in the managed stands. The endemic component suffered a particularly severe decrease in species richness and abundance (57% and 71% tower in the managed forests, respectively). These species with narrow distribution and small local populations are doubly vulnerable to alterations of environmental conditions. They are very sensitive to loss of their natural habitat owing to human intervention and thus represent useful indicators of tolerance to environmental stress. We highlight the need to take endemic species into consideration in studies on the conservation of biodiversity because they are most at risk of extinction. Semi-natural forests are refuges for endemic species and should be protected. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lakes are sensitive to changes in their environmental boundary conditions that can be indicated in the periodic behavior of water quality variables. The present work aims to assess the degree to which common annual periodic behavior is present (1994-2010) in the meteorological parameters (global radiation, air temperature, cloud cover), streamflow; and five primary nutrients (e.g. total phosphorus, nitrate-nitrogen) as possible indicators of ecosystem vulnerability in four different ecosystems using wavelet coherence analysis. The cascade system is located in the mouth of a shallow river where the water flows through a eutrophic pond then a disturbed/undisturbed macrophyte covered wetland reaching a large shallow lake. The results highlight the differing abilities of the elements of the cascade of ecosystems to follow seasonality. The changes in water quality (nutrient cycle) in the eutrophic pond most closely mirror meteorological seasonality. The vulnerability of the wetland ecosystem was expressed by its decreased capacity to follow seasonal changes due to high algae loads and additional inflows. Moreover, the wetland proved to be weak and unstable regarding phosphorus and nitrogen retention. With the successful application of wavelet coherence analysis to the "black-box" cascade system the study sets an example for the implications of the method in such combined or stand-alone natural/partially-constructed ecosystems.

AB  - Urbanization affects ecosystem function and environmental quality through shifts in ecosystem fluxes that are brought on by features of the built environment. Green infrastructure (GI) has been suggested as a best management practice (BMP) to address urban hydrologic and ecological impacts of the built environment, but GI practice has only been studied from a limited set of climatic conditions and disciplinary approaches. Here, we evaluate GI features in a semiarid city from the perspective of soil ecology through the application of soil nematode community analysis. This study was conducted to investigate soil ecological interactions in small-scale GI as a means of assessing curb-cut rain garden basin design in a semiarid city. We looked at the choice of mulching approaches (organic vs. rock) and how this design choice affects the soil ecology of rain basins in Tucson, AZ. We sampled soils during the monsoon rain season and assessed the soil nematode community as a bioindicator of soil quality and biogeochemical processes. We found that the use of organic mulch in GI basins promotes enhanced soil organic matter contents and larger nematode populations. Nematode community indices point to enhanced food web structure in streetscape rain garden basins that are mulched with organic material. Results from this study suggest that soil management practices for GI can help promote ecological interactions and ecosystem services in urban ecosystems.

AB  - Quantitative genetic diversity is a fundamental component of the interaction between natural populations and their environment. In breeding programmes, quantitative genetic studies on tropical trees have so far focused on fast-growing, light-demanding species, but no information exists on shade-tolerant, slow-growing species. For this study, 27 3-year-old open-pollinated families of the Neotropical shade-tolerant rainforest tree Sextonia rubra were measured in semicontrolled conditions for 20 morphological, growth, and photosynthesis traits; the effect of genetic relatedness, habitat of provenance, and mother tree status on seedling traits was analysed. Nine traits displayed significant genetic effects, while mother tree status and habitat effects were not significant (P > 0.05) for an y trait. Estimated heritability varied between 0.14 and 0.28, with growth-related traits having the highest values. Additive genetic variation correlated positively with nonheritable variation, suggesting that ecological-evolutionary factors increasing or decreasing additive genetic variance may also affect nonheritable variation in the same direction. Our results suggest that quantitative genetic variability should be taken into account in ecological studies on, and in the management of, natural tropical rainforests; further research is needed to investigate genetic x environment interactions, in particular from the point of view of the genetic response of shade-tolerant plant species to variations in light availability.

AB  - Ants are increasingly being recognized as useful tools for land managers to monitor ecosystem conditions. However, despite an abundance of studies on ant responses to both environmental disturbance and land management techniques, an analysis of the practice and value of including ants in monitoring is lacking. Consequently, conservation managers are left with little guidance as to if, when, and how ants can be used to assess conservation activities. Based on our review of approximately 60 published studies, we outline five areas where ants provide valuable information for management-based monitoring: (1) to detect the presence of invasive species, (2) to detect trends among threatened or endangered species, (3) to detect trends among keystone species, (4) to evaluate land management actions, and (5) to assess long-term ecosystem changes. We also discuss practical considerations when designing a monitoring framework for ants, including appropriate methods, taxonomic resolution for sampling, and spatial and temporal scale. We find that when integrated with management goals, monitoring ants can provide information over the short-term on topics such as the status of invasive or keystone species, as well as over longer time frames, for instance the impact of climate change. Overall, we conclude that ants merit monitoring based on their inherent ecological qualities, independent of any "indicator" attributes they might have. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - As methods for assessing the environmental conditions in ponds are still not well developed, I studied zooplankton to identify a response of community indices to abiotic, biotic, and habitat type in two types of ponds differing in the level of human stress. Ponds of low human alterations (LowHI) harbored generally richer communities and a higher share littoral zooplankton, whose occurrence was associated with higher water transparency and complex macrophyte habitat, particularly the presence of hornworts and charoids. In high human-impact ponds (HighHI) planktonic communities prevailed. Their distribution was mainly related to the open water area and fish presence. Anthropogenic disturbance was also reflected in the frequency of rare species, which were associated with LowHI ponds. Higher diversity of zooplankton increased the chance for rare species to occur. Despite the fact that the majority of rare species are littoral-associated, they had no prevalence towards a certain ecological type of plants, which suggests that any kind of plant cover, even macrophytes typical for eutrophic waters (e.g., Ceratophyllum demersum) will create a valuable habitat for conservation purposes. Thus, it is postulated that a complex and dense cover of submerged macrophytes ought to be maintained in order to improve the ecological value of small water bodies.

AB  - Changes in land use often increase nutrient loading to aquatic ecosystems, affecting primary productivity and water quality, with flow-on effects to consumers. We explored whether fish-assemblage composition, species diversity, and the representation and richness of ecological guilds were associated with catchment land use in 31 estuaries in Victoria, Australia. Fish assemblages were surveyed using fyke and gill nets. Species were assigned to ecological guilds based on salinity associations and their use of estuaries, water column position and trophic characteristics. The Shannon diversity index, representation and richness of several marine-associated species and trophic guilds dominated by marine-associated species were positively related to tidal exchange, indicating the widespread influence of marine connectivity on estuarine fish assemblage and trophic structure. These patterns were driven by adult life stages. The richness and the proportion of demersal species in juvenile assemblages were negatively associated with the proportion of the catchment with land uses expected to elevate nutrient loads (e.g. animal production, horticulture, industry and urbanization). This relationship may reflect shifts in vegetated habitat, resource availability or changes in water quality induced by nutrient enrichment. Juvenile demersal fish show promise as an indicator of the effects of catchment land use on the structure of estuarine fish assemblages.

AB  - Assessing spatial variation in hydrologic processes can help to inform freshwater management and advance ecological understanding, yet many areas lack sufficient flow records on which to base classifications. Seeking to address this challenge, we apply concepts developed in data-rich settings to public, global data in order to demonstrate a broadly replicable approach to characterizing hydrologic variation. The proposed approach groups the basins associated with reaches in a river network according to key environmental drivers of hydrologic conditions. This initial study examines Colorado ( USA), where long-term streamflow records permit comparison with previously distinguished flow regime types, and Ecuador, where data limitations preclude such analysis. The flow regime types assigned to gages in Colorado corresponded reasonably well to the classes distinguished from environmental features. The divisions in Ecuador reflected major known biophysical gradients while also providing a higher resolution supplement to an existing depiction of freshwater ecoregions. Although freshwater policy and management decisions occur amidst uncertainty and imperfect knowledge, this classification framework offers a rigorous and transferrable means to distinguish catchments in data-scarce regions. The maps and attributes of the resulting ecohydrologic classes offer a departure point for additional study and data collection programmes such as the placement of stations in under-monitored classes, and the divisions may serve as a preliminary template with which to structure conservation efforts such as environmental flow assessments.

AB  - In the context of agrarian practices in organic agriculture, the use of organic amendments is considered a way to restore biodiversity in the edaphic environment. However, large differences may exist among the different organic amendments, according to their nature and degree of decomposition. The aim of this work was to compare the effects on the nematofauna of organic compost and conventional management, in a cereal-fallow-vetch crop rotation system, and to assess the utility of nematodes as an indicator of management changes in land use and soil conditions.
   Bacterial-feeders predominated in the nematode community, while the least opportunistic groups had a very low occurrence. Thus, the abundance models obtained for the nematofaunal trophic structure showed best fit to a logarithmic series. Fluctuations in the nematode populations were associated with seasonal variations characteristic of the Mediterranean climate.
   No statistically significant differences among the fertilization treatments included in the study were observed in our study, and thus the organic amendment did not lead to any change in trophic diversity. For the rehabilitation of agricultural soils that have progressively lost a great part of their biodiversity, adequate management of the organic matter is required, introducing a source of energy to allow the functioning of the edaphic system, and thereby restoring the lost biological diversity.

AB  - The protected area approach has extended from conserving biodiversity to improving human well- being. However, the relationship between conservation and socioeconomic and cultural development continues to be controversial. This paper combines land use variables with socioeconomic and cultural variables through multivariate ordination analysis and evaluates their evolution in two areas inside and outside a Biosphere Reserve since the approval of the Governance Plan for Use and Management in the Reserve. The results indicate a similar tendency in the two areas, from the abandonment of traditional rural activities and decline in pine plantations to naturalness, urban sprawl and the growth of the tertiary economic sector, welfare indicators and sustainability index. However, it can be broadly observed that the region included inside the protected area presents better conservation features (native forest) and rural systems (forestry and primary economic sector) than the region outside the protected area while maintaining similar socioeconomic and cultural conditions. We suggest that the designation of the Biosphere Reserve does not influence the local population negatively but does safeguard its conservation, which could have enhanced socioeconomic and cultural development. Thus, even though certain changes must be made to replace the conifer plantations and encourage agricultural activities, the designation of the protected area fulfills its sustainability goal and enhances the local population's quality of life.

AB  - The water quality security of the Three Gorges Reservoir during different operating periods has been a subject of recent concern. This study is the first to report the spatiotemporal variability of organotins (OTs) in surface water under dynamic water level conditions in the Three Gorges Reservoir Region (TGRR). TGRR surface water was collected during three monitoring campaigns to analyze butyltins (BTs) and phenyltins (PTs) using a gas chromatography mass spectrometry system. Our results showed that TGRR surface water was polluted by BTs and PTs, with mono-OTs being the dominant species. A wide range of BTs and PTs concentrations was observed across the study area, but tributyltin (TBT) displayed extensive spatial distribution, and the highest concentrations consistently occurred in the downstream region of the TGRR study area, with a maximum of 393.35 ng Sn/L in Zigui (S27). The total OTs contamination level decreased over time. The diphenyltin concentration exhibited significant seasonal variation, while other OTs showed seasonal changes only during two monitoring campaigns, with the exception of dibutyltin. An ecological risk assessment indicated that both TBT and triphenyltin posed risks to aquatic organisms in TGRR surface water. We urgently recommend continuous monitoring and further measures to prevent and control OTs pollution in the TGRR. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Acyclovir and penciclovir, 2 antiviral drugs, are increasingly detected in aquatic environments. The present study explores the natural photochemical transformation mechanisms and fate of these drugs, examining direct and indirect photochemical transformation under simulated sunlight irradiation. The 2 antiviral drugs are photostable under certain conditions but significantly degrade in the presence of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (DOM). The degradation rate associated with the drugs' indirect photochemical transformation scaled with chromophoric DOM concentration. Quenchers and sensitizers were used to identify indirect photochemical transformation mechanism. Results suggested that both pharmaceuticals could be transformed by reacting with O-1(2), (OH)-O-center dot, and excited chromophoric DOM. The O-1(2) played an important role in indirect photochemical transformation. Furthermore, the reaction kinetics between their substructural molecules, guanine, isocytosine, and imidazole, with different reactive oxygen species were evaluated to determine which substrate functionalities were most susceptible to singlet oxygenation. Imidazole was identified as the reaction site for O-1(2), and preliminary O-1(2) oxidation mechanisms were further evaluated based on liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric results. Finally, aquatic ecotoxicity assessment of phototransformed solutions revealed that the degradation of acyclovir and penciclovir may not ultimately diminish environmental risk because of either formation of more toxic intermediates than parent pharmaceuticals or some synergistic effects existing between the intermediates.

AB  - The veredas (a type of wetlands) are wet ecosystems usually associated with the presence of hydromorphic soils, which often occur in the vicinity of springs and watercourses of the Cerrado region in Brazil. This study aimed to assess microbiological and biochemical soil properties in wetlands (veredas) located in preserved and disturbed environments (in farming and grazing areas) in the Cerrado biome. Soil samples were collected at depths of 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm, along reference lines arranged according to their position in the landscape, in the upper, middle and lower positions of one of the slopes. The total soil organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen (C-mic and N-mic), microbial biomass C:N ratio, microbial quotient, basal respiration, metabolic quotient and fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolytic activities in soil (as total soil heterotrophic enzymatic activity) were determined. The soils of veredas adjacent to agricultural and livestock environments showed changes in their biological properties compared to preserved ecosystems. Increased microbial biomass (C-mic and N-mic) is reported in veredas located nearby grazing areas under intensive and technified management, on the soil surface layer (0-10 cm), especially in the lower slope position, while in agricultural environments, under the same conditions of relief and depth, there is a relative decrease in microbial biomass carbon.

AB  - A critical examination of an aquatic environment adjacent to the discharge from an unbleached kraft pulp and paper mill (UBKM) was conducted in 1995, The assessment involved sampling of sediments, water, benthic macroinvertebrates, and fish collected 1.6 km upstream from the mill, at the mill's outlet, and 2.5 km downstream. Field-collected blue catfish (Ictalurus furcatus) and bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochisus) exposed to site sediments in the laboratory showed no significant within-organism adverse effects as measured by EROD activity, benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase activity, CYP1A content, DNA damage, condition factor, organ indices, differential blood cell counts, and histopathology, though DNA strand breaks increased at the most downstream site. No aqueous or sediment toxicity was observed using Ceriodapnia dubia and Pimephales promelas or Hyalella azteca and Chironomus tentans, respectively. Embryos of the mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) were evaluated for reproductive potential following laboratory exposures of adult mosquitofish to river sediments and water for 90 days. No significant adverse reproductive effects were observed immediately below the BKME discharge site. Analyses of field-collected benthic macroinvertebrate samples revealed no significant effects in terms of taxa, taxa richness, and other measures of their status. Using a comprehensive suite of within-organism, whole-organism, and community level endpoints, our study demonstrates that this effluent, discharged following secondary treatment from an UBKM, had no significant adverse impacts on the receiving aquatic ecosystem.

TI  - Research misconduct in health and life sciences research: A systematic review of retracted literature from Brazilian institutions
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Background
   Measures to ensure research integrity have been widely discussed due to the social, economic and scientific impact of research integrity. In the past few years, financial support for health research in emerging countries has steadily increased, resulting in a growing number of scientific publications. These achievements, however, have been accompanied by a rise in retracted publications followed by concerns about the quality and reliability of such publications.
   Objective
   This systematic review aimed to investigate the profile of medical and life sciences research retractions from authors affiliated with Brazilian academic institutions. The chronological trend between publication and retraction date, reasons for the retraction, citation of the article after the retraction, study design, and the number of retracted publications by author and affiliation were assessed. Additionally, the quality, availability and accessibility of data regarding retracted papers from the publishers are described.
   Methods
   Two independent reviewers searched for articles that had been retracted since 2004 via PubMed, Web of Science, Biblioteca Virtual em Saude (BVS) and Google Scholar databases. Indexed keywords from Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Descritores em Ciencias da Saude (DeCS) in Portuguese, English or Spanish were used. Data were also collected from the Retraction Watch website (www.retractionwatch.com). This study was registered with the PROSPERO systematic review database (CRD42017071647).
   Results
   A final sample of 65 articles was retrieved from 55 different journals with reported impact factors ranging from 0 to 32.86, with a median value of 4.40 and a mean of 4.69. The types of documents found were erratum (1), retracted articles (3), retracted articles with a retraction notice (5), retraction notices with erratum (3), and retraction notices (45). The assessment of the Retraction Watch website added 8 articles that were not identified by the search strategy using the bibliographic databases. The retracted publications covered a wide range of study designs. Experimental studies (40) and literature reviews (15) accounted for 84.6% of the retracted articles. Within the field of health and life sciences, medical science was the field with the largest number of retractions (34), followed by biological sciences (17). Some articles were retracted for at least two distinct reasons (13). Among the retrieved articles, plagiarism was the main reason for retraction (60%). Missing data were found in 57% of the retraction notices, which was a limitation to this review. In addition, 63% of the articles were cited after their retraction.
   Conclusion
   Publications are not retracted solely for research misconduct but also for honest error. Nevertheless, considering authors affiliated with Brazilian institutions, this review concluded that most of the retracted health and life sciences publications were retracted due to research misconduct. Because the number of publications is the most valued indicator of scientific productivity for funding and career progression purposes, a systematic effort from the national research councils, funding agencies, universities and scientific journals is needed to avoid an escalating trend of research misconduct. More investigations are needed to comprehend the underlying factors of research misconduct and its increasing manifestation.

AB  - A main challenge in sustainability sciences is to incorporate distributional aspects into ecosystem management and conservation. We explored and contrasted land ownership, forest cover and ecosystem services supply (ES) distribution in two municipalities of southern Chile (Panguipulli and Ancud), comprising 5,584 private properties. We relied on farm typologies data and ES indicators for forage, water regulation, and recreation opportunities. We calculated Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients to establish concentration ratios, and performed a hotspot analysis to determine ES supply distribution across properties. In both municipalities land ownership was highly concentrated: large properties ( > 1,000-30,000 ha) represented less than 1% of total and comprised 74.5% and 20.7% of farm area, in Panguipulli and Ancud respectively. Forest cover distribution followed the same pattern (80.5% and 58.2%, respectively). As a result, water regulation and recreation opportunities concentrated in medium and large properties, whereas forage concentrated in small and medium ones. Gini coefficients ranged from relatively equal to relatively unequal for land ownership, forests cover and ES in both study areas. These inequalities reflect a historical land ownership concentration in private lands since colonial times, a structural condition that challenges both nature conservation and development and, therefore, it should be brought to the forefront of policy design in developing countries.

AB  - The impact of the ca. 75 ka Mount Toba (Indonesia) supereruption on regional and global climate has been controversial. East Africa is pivotal for qualifying this impact, specifically in addressing a hypothesis that this eruption caused a volcanic winter leading to a genetic bottleneck in anatomically modern human populations. If the Toba eruption caused a volcanic winter in East Africa, effects should be recorded in sediments from climatologically sensitive ecosystems. In deep tropical lakes, cooler temperatures would have reduced the density contrast between the epilimnion and hypolimnion, causing increased mixing, hypolimnion oxygenation, and enhanced nutrient advection. Such environmental changes produce noticeable and predictable responses in lake fossil assemblages and sediment loading. Here we present the first paleoecological evidence from East Africa of environmental conditions surrounding the eruption in a high-resolution (similar to 8-9 yr) analysis of two cores collected by the Lake Malawi Drilling Project. These cores contain an undisturbed record of sedimentation before, during, and after deposition of the youngest Toba Tuff. Concentrations of climate-sensitive ecological indicators such as phantom midges, diatoms, and other algae through a >270 yr interval bracketing the Toba cryptotephra show no unusual or sustained deviations from background variability within Lake Malawi associated with the hypothesized post-Toba cooling. We find no evidence for significantly enhanced mixing or ecosystem disturbance that would be anticipated following a volcanic winter.

AB  - In Brazil, local agricultural research agendas are increasingly challenged by the search for sustainable biodiesel crop options for family farmers, especially under semi-arid conditions. The aim of this paper is to explore the suitability of different biodiesel crops (i.e. soybean, castor bean and sunflower) through a set of environmental and socioeconomic indicators in a semi-arid (Montes Claros) and a more humid (Chapada Gaucha) municipality in the state of Minas Gerais, southeast Brazil. A technical coefficient generator (TechnoGIN) was used to assess current (maize, beans, soybean and grass seed) and alternative (castor bean and sunflower) crops grown with current and alternative production techniques. The quantification of the inputs and outputs was based on farm surveys, expert knowledge, literature and field experiments. Although castor bean and sunflower are economically competitive with maize in Montes Claros, feed and labour requirements may hinder farmers' adoption. In Chapada Gaucha, the double cropping system soybean/sunflower presented small economic gains when compared to soybean; it also increased nitrogen losses and biocide residues. We conclude that the scope for alternative and sustainable biodiesel crops on family farms is limited. Their economic benefits are small or absent, while their introduction can lead to higher environmental impacts and there may be trade-offs with food and feed availability at the farm level.

AB  - The Micro Prespa basin is a trilateral catchment area of significant importance with a unique ecosystem closely related to the homonymous lake. In this frame, a fully operational monitoring project was carried out including continuous real-time measurements in Micro Prespa Lake with the use of a multi-sensor probe, as well as periodical sampling and analyses of all available water systems for an extended set of 85 parameters. Four main interacting water systems were identified, including alluvial and karstic aquifers, Micro Prespa Lake and adjacent drainage network. The results outlined that general environmental conditions are satisfying in respect to the relative legislation and the hydrogeochemical signatures. However, trends of environmental pressures were ascertained as a result of natural (geogenic) factors, embracing seasonal peaks for Ni, Pb, and NH4 mainly in groundwater systems. Based on chlorophyll a records, Micro Prespa is classified as oligotrophic to slightly mesotrophic, subjected to seasonal variations. Heavy metal concentrations are low, except Ni which appears to have elevated values during the dry hydrological period. Finally, the hydrogeochemistry of drainage network is primarily influenced by surface runoff of the surrounding mountainous areas, hence elevated phosphorus values of the Aghios Germanos stream are possibly linked with the leaching of the granitic formations on the east.

AB  - To clarify the effect of environmental factors on donate assemblages in rural reservoir ponds, we surveyed the odonate adults (Zygoptera and Anisoptera) in 70 study ponds in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan, during three sampling periods in 2005. Cluster analysis, indicator species analysis (INSPAN), and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) were used in combination to determine the relationship between odonate assemblages and environmental variables, i.e., biotic, physicochemical, and regional variables (the types of land use surrounding the ponds). A total of 41 odonate species were recorded in the study ponds, and 24 of them, excluding rare species, were used for each analysis. The study ponds were classified into six groups, and significant indicator species were selected from four of these groups. Examination of the correlation between each environmental variable and NMDS axes 1 and 2 revealed the profound effects of the presence of forest, paddy field, or open area around the ponds on the indicator species composition of each group. It was also revealed that the aquatic vegetation and forests around the ponds provide desirable conditions for the donates and, in contrast, concrete revetment has a detrimental effect. These results suggest that the recent decrease of forests around ponds and the reconstruction with concrete revetment will have a negative effect on the donate assemblages in ponds.

AB  - Below many rivers and extending laterally beneath their banks lies a zone of saturated sediments-the hyporheic zone. This region is the site of dynamic exchanges of water and materials between the groundwater below, lateral alluvial aquifers, and the river flowing above. In this centrally located ecosystem component, the actions of the microbial biofilms coating the sediments are considered to act like a biological filter, enhancing water quality during the exchange process. However, the hyporheic zones in many rivers are threatened by siltation, toxicants and increasing acidity, physical extraction for gravel, or altered groundwater inputs through pumping. Current protocols to assess river health do not explicitly consider that of the hyporheic zone, despite its central role in many rivers. This oversight is due largely to the relative infancy of the discipline of hyporheic research, limited communication to river managers by ecologists, and technical difficulties in sampling the hyporheic zone. Ecosystem health assessments in rivers with potentially important hyporheic zones could include measurements of the extent of hydrological exchange between the river and the hyporheic zone at a range of scales, the rates of some key interstitial chemical processes, and perhaps the biodiversity of hyporheic invertebrates. In Australia, the potential of some of these measurements is being investigated, especially in relation to assessing the health of "groundwater-dependent ecosystems."

AB  - The paper presents experimental data on restoration of soil, an ecosystem component. Each trial plot was treated differently. It is shown that the use of a combination of techniques, namely grass sowing and mineral and organic fertilization of soil, aimed at restoration of biological rotation of plants, radically intensifies the soil restoration. The developed organic-accumulating layer is the main indicator of successful soil restoration. The importance of soil as a structural element of an ecosystem is determined by its capacity to retain and accumulate nutrients thus ensuring stable conditions for self-restoration of ecosystem components.

AB  - RNA quality is of utmost importance to perform gene expression quantification by qPCR. The classical methods used to determine RNA quality are based on electrophoresis and spectrophotometer assessment, namely A(260)/A(280) and A(260)/A(230) ratios. It was previously shown that due to the complex nature of Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms, RNA extraction procedures could impact mRNA quality and thus accurate quantification. Herein, we contaminated and degraded RNA extracted from S. epidermidis biofilms, and assessed the effect on gene expression by qPCR. As expected, thermal degradation of RNA had a significant impact on gene expression on two out of the three tested genes. On the other hand, the contamination of the extracted RNA yielded an interesting result: while most contaminants did not changed the purity indicators or the integrity of RNA, significant changes on gene expression levels were found. This work confirms that poor RNA extraction has an important impact in qPCR quantification, emphasizing the consequences of carry-over contaminants on gene expression studies. Additionally, our results show that the parameters commonly used to assess the quality of extracted RNA from bacterial cultures seem to be insufficient to ensure reliable gene expression determination.

AB  - The Murray-Darling Basin (the Basin) is the largest river system in Australia, supplying about 40% of the country's irrigated agricultural output. Associated water resource development has come with a heavy price for the Basin's freshwater ecosystems degrading them over decades. Australian governments are attempting to achieve environmental sustainability by returning water to the environment through buy-back of irrigation licences and improved water efficiencies. To determine effectiveness, basin-wide management objectives were established for key indicators, including waterbird populations and life histories which can effectively indicate ecosystem function and condition, driven by flow and flooding regimes. Ongoing monitoring of waterbird numbers indicates continued declines. We evaluated the feasibility of meeting established waterbird objectives under existing and predicted climates. We modelled long-term waterbird numbers using one of the world's largest ongoing waterbird surveys (1983-2020), covering about 13.5% of the area of the entire Basin. Our findings suggest that under near future climate change projections, waterbird numbers will likely continue to decline, and remain below restoration targets set for the Basin. We discuss the current policy settings for using environmental water to support waterbird populations, recommending adjustments to restore the Basin's waterbird populations and their wetlands in order to meet Australia's conservation targets in relation to the ongoing global crisis of biodiversity loss.

AB  - Interactions between multiple stressors can result in unexpected ecological outcomes, especially in lowland lakes. Degraded shallow lakes typically occur in populated areas and are therefore subject to the combined effects of increased nutrient and sediment loading, and species invasions. This presents challenges for meeting ecological restoration objectives measured using traditional indicators of lake enrichment. Here we use stable isotope analyses from six shallow lakes in a highly modified agricultural landscape to explore how well fish community-level trophic metrics reflect individual and combined anthropogenic stressors. Community trophic metrics differed within a single basin and in similarly degraded shallow lakes, and appeared to reflect subtly different relative strengths of anthropogenic stressors within particular systems. Even allowing for the comparatively narrow range of lake and catchment conditions investigated here, our results support other studies indicating that food web metrics are sensitive to both the effects of eutrophication and invasive species in shallow lakes. Trophic responses to multiple stressors highlight the complexities of determining cause and effect relationships for prioritising stressor specific management actions, and subsequent measurement of ecosystem response. Notwithstanding these complexities, food web metrics derived from stable isotope analyses hold potential value for detecting complex responses to shallow lake management and restoration efforts.

AB  - Increasing human pressures, including recreational boating, on the coastline is a growing sector which has adverse effects on marine biota and habitats. Benthic filter feeders are good indicators of changes in marine ecosystems providing information of biotic response to anthropogenic pressures. This investigation has aimed to evaluate changes in delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotopic values, growth and survival rates of Pinna nobilis in different marine environments exposed to distinct human activities. In addition, Bayesian isotopic models have been applied to decipher food sources contributing to the filter feeders' diet. Results have revealed isotopic variation of adductor muscle of P. nobilis according to a human gradient. Similarly, individuals of eutrophic environments showed higher growth rates than those from oligotrophic conditions, however chance of survival in eutrophic environments was lower, especially during the first life stages of P. nobilis. Additionally, similar trends were demonstrated between adductor muscle and mantle tissue of examined individuals, making the latter tissue an appropriate non-lethal sampling technique having implications for environmental and biological assessment and conservation issues. Results have also shown that P. nobilis seems to be relying on pelagic rather than benthic related food sources. Properly assessed, filter feeders can provide information on their interaction with human derived activities, identifying possible alterations of marine systems at an early stage.

AB  - In this study, biodiversity patterns of free-living marine nematode communities were assessed in the Yangtze River estuary and its adjacent waters by certain diversity measures. The studied area exhibited spatial variation in nematode biodiversity patterns. According to habitat heterogeneity, two station groups, shallow water near shore area and shallow water continental shelf area, were observed in the Yangtze River estuary and its adjacent waters. In general, nematode abundance and species diversity in the near shore area were significantly lower than the continental shelf area. Salinity, sediment Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and Phaeophytin-a (Phaeo-a) concentrations were responsible for the discrimination of species diversity measures. They reflect the reverin influence to nematode species diversity. By contrast, our results showed that the average taxonomic distinctness with presence/absence data (Delta(+)), and the variation in taxonomic distinctness (Lambda(+)) were not influenced by natural environmental variability, nor pollutant and anthropogenic disturbances. The funnel plots for Delta(+) and Lambda(+) also indicate none of the studied stations were subjected to environmental stress and perturbation. Possibly because of nematodes' strong resistance to environmental stress, the taxonomic indices did not discriminate perturbed from unperturbed conditions in the present study. We should be cautious to regard the taxonomic distinctness indices as surrogates for other traditional indices such as the number of species or Shannon diversity.

AB  - The establishment of marine protected areas (MPA) has become the prevailing management strategy to stop the degradation of coastal and marine ecosystems; however, the effectiveness of MPAs is affected not only by ecological factors but also by social ones. Identifying and understanding socioeconomic conditions and the institutional context of fishing communities is essential to achieve success with MPAs. We propose a practical methodology for estimating the adaptive capacity (AC) of local communities to the establishment of MPAs. Adaptive capacity is defined as the ability of households to anticipate and respond to disturbances, natural or human induced, and to minimize, cope with, and recover from the consequences. We propose an index of adaptive capacity (IAC) of fishing communities that can be estimated at a local scale. This composite index comprises three dimensions, i.e., socioeconomic, social-ecological, and socio-political/institutional, which attempt to capture comprehensively the determinants of AC. Each dimension is constructed from three indicators, whose estimation is based on information collected from a household structured survey for which we suggested specific questions. We proposed the use of a Min function to highlight the weakest dimension of the IAC and guide decision makers with respect to elements that should be addressed to improve AC. A discussion about normalization and aggregation issues is also included.

AB  - Environmental monitoring of leachate quality from an open municipal solid waste dumping site in Tunceli, Turkey was studied in this research. The most commonly examined pollution parameters were determined on a seasonal basis. The annual average 5-day biological oxygen demand (BOD5) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) values of station points were measured as 70 and 425 mg/L, respectively, and also the average BOD5/COD ratio (a measure of biodegradability) was calculated as 0.20. The low ratio of biodegradability and slightly alkaline pH values in the leachate samples indicated that the site was characterized by methanogenic conditions. The mean ammonium-nitrogen (NH4 (+)-N) and corresponding phosphate (orthophosphate) values were assayed as 70 and 11 mg/L, respectively. The average solids content in the leachates was measured as 4,681 mg/L (total solids) and 144 mg/L (suspended solids). Very low concentrations of iron, manganese, copper, and zinc in the leachate samples were found and the concentration of cadmium was measured below detection limits. Excessive amount of nutrients and high organic and inorganic pollutant content in the leachates pose serious pollution potential to the environment. Since no drainage system or bio treatment exists in this open dumping site, high permeability of natural soil at the site and in the surrounding area and very fractured and crackled rocks under natural soil are indicators of high groundwater pollution potential in this site.

AB  - Salt marshes are simple ecosystems characterized by extreme conditions; two abiotic factors appear to structure habitats: regular submergence and the resulting soil salinity. These ecosystems support highly specialized species that have a high conservation value. In the last ten years, invasion by Elymus athericus (Poaceae) has led to a major change in vegetation cover (including changes in micro-habitats architecture) in salt marshes of the Mont-Saint-Michel Bay (France). In this study, we tried to determine whether ecological structure and high conservation value of invaded salt marshes had been preserved using spiders as indicators. The functional groups, abundances and flood resistance abilities of spider communities were compared between initial and invaded stations during 2002 and 2003. Invasion by E. athericus had both positive and negative consequences for spider communities, in particular for the dominant halophilic species. Pardosa purbeckensis populations clearly declined in habitats invaded by E. athericus, whereas Arctosa fulvolineata seemed to benefit greatly from the invasion. Functional groups were strongly affected by the plant invasion. Relation between the habitat change (vegetal invasion) and changes in the spider communities (both in terms of functional groups and halophilic species) confirms the high value of this taxon as bioindicators. Lastly, we suggest using abundances of P. purbeckensis as a parameter likely to help monitoring further salt marsh evolutions (such as management).

AB  - Compound disturbances may result in novel forest successional and developmental patterns. This study investigated effects of post-wind disturbance salvage harvesting, a unique compound disturbance of which the ecological consequences are unresolved, in fire-restored longleaf pine woodlands of the Alabama Fall Line Hills, a characteristically biodiverse and rare ecosystem. Plot-level data were collected May-June 2016 in areas undisturbed, wind-disturbed, and compound-disturbed (salvage harvested within seven months of an April 2011 EF3 tornado). Disturbance-mediated differences in (1) physical site conditions, (2) woody plant composition and structure, and (3) ground flora (herbaceous and woody plants <= 1 m in height) were assessed. Multivariate analyses revealed distinct differences in ground flora across disturbance categories. Biophysical drivers most correlated with differences in species assemblages included volume of coarse woody debris, sapling density, percent canopy cover, and basal area. Unharvested wind-disturbed plots had the greatest diversity of saplings and ground flora, and had indicator species with unique habitat requirements (specialists). Indicator species of compound-disturbed plots were mostly generalists that also had a relatively high frequency and abundance in the other disturbance categories. Reduced plant diversity on compound-disturbed plots was attributed to salvage harvest-mediated reductions in habitat heterogeneity and resource availability. Thus, leaving patches unharvested within salvaged stands is recommended to promote stand-scale plant diversity.

AB  - Near surface (i.e., camera) and satellite remote sensing metrics have become widely used indicators of plant growing seasons. While robust linkages have been established between field metrics and ecosystem exchange in many land cover types, assessment of how well remotely-derived season start and end dates depict field conditions in arid ecosystems remain unknown. We evaluated the correspondence between field measures of start (SOS; leaves unfolded and canopy greenness >0) and end of season (EOS) and canopy greenness for two widespread species in southwestern U.S. ecosystems with those metrics estimated from near-surface cameras and MODIS NDVI for five years (2012-2016). Using Timesat software to estimate SOS and EOS from the phenocam green chromatic coordinate (GCC) greenness index resulted in good agreement with ground observations for honey mesquite but not black grama. Despite differences in the detectability of SOS and EOS for the two species, GCC was significantly correlated with field estimates of canopy greenness for both species throughout the growing season. MODIS NDVI for this arid grassland site was driven by the black grama signal although a mesquite signal was discernable in average rainfall years. Our findings suggest phenocams could help meet myriad needs in natural resource management.

AB  - Global Environmental Assessments (GEAs) are in a unique position to influence environmental decision-making in the context of sustainability challenges. To do this effectively, however, new methods are needed to respond to the needs of decision-makers for a more integrated, contextualized and goal-seeking evaluation of different policies, geared for action from global to local. While scenarios are an important tool for GEAs to link short-term decisions and medium and long-term consequences, these current information needs cannot be met only through deductive approaches focused on the global level. In this paper, we argue that a more diverse set of futures tools operating at multiple scales are needed to improve GEA scenario development and analysis to meet the information needs of policymakers and other stakeholders better. Based on the literature, we highlight four challenges that GEAs need to be able to address in order to contribute to global environmental decision-making about the future: 1. anticipate unpredictable future conditions; 2. be relevant at multiple scales, 3. include diverse actors, perspectives and contexts; and 4. leverage the imagination to inspire action. We present a toolbox of future-oriented approaches and methods that can be used to effectively address the four challenges currently faced by GEAs.

AB  - African scientists were introduced to the ecosystem-based approach through professional interaction with scientists from NOAA's East Coast Fisheries Science Centers. In the mid-1990s, scientists from six African countries successfully implemented an ecosystem-based assessment and management project in the Gulf of Guinea that was expanded into a full scale 16 country ecosystem-based project encompassing the entire spatial domain of the Guinea Current Large Marine Ecosystem (GCLME) from Guinea-Bissau in the northwest to Angola in the southwest. Through the efforts of the project manager, the countries developed an excellent working relationship in operationalizing a five-module LME project for sustainably developing the goods and services of the Guinea Current LME. Over the five years of project implementation, a large cadre of African scientists was trained in ecosystem-based assessment and management methods based on the five-module LME approach. Both natural science and social science metrics were applied to assess changing conditions of GCLME: (i) productivity (gCm(2)y(-1)), (ii) fish and fisheries, (iii) pollution and ecosystem health, (iv) socioeconomics, and (v) governance in support of the sustainable development of GCLME goods and services. Through the association with senior ministerial representatives the scientists forged an interim Guinea Current Commission to oversee the sustainable development underway to mitigate effects of human and environmental stressors on the ecosystem.

AB  - We hypothesize that the thalli of the green-algal, CO2-sensitive lichen Usnea rubicunda (Stirton) undergo significant structural alterations as a biological response indicating increased CO2 emissions. To test that, U. rubicunda thalli were transplanted from a reference site with no volcanism into 36 sites distributed within the volcanically active Furnas caldera, encompassing the gradient of soil diffuse CO2 degassing areas (700 t d(-1) of hydrothermal CO2). After 6 months of exposure in similar macroclimatic conditions, both Furnas transplants and samples kept at the reference site were retrieved for histology to assess thalli structure and the proportion between the symbionts. On average, cross-sections of Furnas thalli were significantly thicker than reference, owing mostly to the fungal layers of medulla and central cord. The latter occupied a significantly greater than reference relative volumetric density despite a smaller than reference relative percentage of algal occupation on Furnas thalli. These results reveal a positive and time-integrated response of U. rubicunda to the greater availability of CO2 from hydrothermal emissions in the volcanic environment, translated in greater efficiency of the algae in sustaining the fungal biomass. Histomorphometric structural alterations in the heteromerous thalli of U. rubicunda are suitable response biomarkers with potential to indicate a global rise of CO2 levels in natural environments.

AB  - Remediation of saline-sodic soils used for cattle breeding is particularly challenging due to the limited alternatives. We hypothesize that introducing salt tolerant and productive forage in a lowland halophytic steppe, typical of saline-sodic soils, increases belowground biomass inputs and activity, generating a series of positive effects on soil biological and chemical properties, and aggregate stability ? an accepted indicator of soil degradation resistance. Under natural environmental conditions, we found that the introduction of Panicum coloratum (panicum) increased belowground biomass almost three times, the abundance of mites tended to be greater and that of springtails was 9.4 kg(?1) contrasting with none found in the halophytic steppe, after 7 years. The concentration of Ca2+ and Mg2+ increased 26% and 54%, respectively, and that of Na+ was reduced 31% compared with the halophytic steppe. Soil pH decrease 5% and electrical conductivity decreased 37% (changing from moderate to very slightly saline) in panicum compared to the halophytic steppe. However, in panicum, mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) and aggregate stability decreased 22% and 26%, respectively. We concluded that, although biological and chemical properties improved, aggregate stability ? an early indicator of soil recovery ? decreased, which was likely determined by MAOM reduction in saline-sodic soils.

AB  - Blackening and odorization of heavily polluted rivers has become a vital aquatic environmental problem in developing countries and has threatened river ecosystems. Monitoring the contamination and functional degradation conditions is important for bioremediation of river ecosystems. In this study, the diversity, composition, co-occurrence pattern, and function of bacterial communities collected from a heavily polluted urban river sediment were investigated using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing analysis. The degree of pollution in the river was divided into three levels, and the clustering result based on the relative abundance of bacterial communities was consistent with the pollution levels in the river. The community assembly analysis further demonstrated that bacterial community assembly was mainly driven by environmental selection (95.84%) in Jinchuan River. Composition of bacterial communities were clearly different at different pollution level sites, although no apparent changes in alpha diversity were observed. The complexity of the bacterial co-occurrence network decreased with aggravation of the pollution level, as indicated by topological features, suggesting that the interactions among bacterial communities were weakened. A phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States analysis predicted that the relative abundance of functional genes was negatively correlated with pollution levels, and those related to energy metabolism as well as xenobiotic biodegradation and metabolism decreased significantly. These results provide an ecological reference for monitoring and bioremediation of aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Metal pollution in aquatic systems is considered a serious environmental issue globally due to their ability to accumulate in aquatic environments. Wetlands are vulnerable to this pollution as they are known to trap toxins, removing them from the water. Artificial mussel technology, originally developed for marine environments, was applied to this freshwater system and spot water samples were collected. The Nyl River floodplain (Ramsar classified) is one of the largest and most ecologically significant wetlands in South Africa. The aims of this study were to determine metal contamination along the Nyl River system by means of artificial mussels (AM) and water ICP-MS analysis and to determine whether the use of AMs in conjunction with spot water testing could give more insight into the pollution in freshwater wetlands. The concentrations of Al, Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn were determined at seven sites. It was determined that the levels accumulated by the AMs differed in spatial and temporal trends when compared to spot water samples. It was determined that there were high levels of some metals found in the spot water tests that were not corroborated by the AMs results, which could indicate isolated pollution events. The use of AMs in conjunction with spot water testing was determined to be beneficial in gaining deeper insight into water metal conditions in dynamic freshwater systems.

AB  - Biodiversity is under threat from anthropogenic pressures, in particular in biodiversity-rich developing countries. Development cooperation actors, who traditionally focus on the improvement of socio-economic conditions in the South, are increasingly acknowledging the linkages between poverty and biodiversity, e.g. by referring to the ecosystem services framework. However, there are many different framings which stress the need for biodiversity integration and which influence how biodiversity and development are and/or should be linked. Moreover, there is a gap between the lip service paid to biodiversity integration and the reality of development cooperation interventions. This study analyses how biodiversity framings are reflected in environmental impact assessment (EIA) practice, and how these framings influence EIA and decision-making. The findings, based on an in-depth qualitative analysis of World Bank EIAs undertaken in West Africa, indicate the incoherent quality but also the dominance of the 'utilitarian' and 'corrective' framings, which respectively stress human use of nature and mitigation of negative unintended development impacts. Identifying and highlighting these discursive trends leads to increased awareness of the importance of biodiversity among all development actors in North and South. However, some framings may lead to an overly narrow human-centred approach which downplays the intrinsic value of biodiversity. This study proposes recommendations for an improved integration of biodiversity in development cooperation, including the need for more systematic baseline studies in EIAs.

AB  - Ready biodegradation is the primary biodegradability of a compound, which is used for discriminating whether a compound could be rapidly and readily biodegraded in the natural ecosystems in a short period and has been applied extensively in the environmental risk assessment of many chemicals. In this study, the effects of 24 molecular properties (including 2 physicochemical parameters, 10 geometrical parameters, 6 topological parameters, and 6 electronic parameters) on the ready biodegradation of 24 kinds of synthetic aromatic compounds were investigated using the OECD 301B CO2 Evolution test. The relationship between molecular properties and ready biodegradation of these aromatic compounds varied with molecular properties. A significant inverse correlation was found for the topological parameter TD, five geometrical parameters (Rad, CAA, CMA, CSEV, and N (c)), and the physicochemical parameter K (ow), and a positive correlation for two topological parameters TC and TVC, whereas no significant correlation was observed for any of the electronic parameters. Based on the correlations between molecular properties and ready biodegradation of these aromatic compounds, the importance of molecular properties was demonstrated as follows: geometrical properties > topological properties > physicochemical properties > electronic properties. Our study first demonstrated the effects of molecular properties on ready biodegradation by a number of experiment data under the same experimental conditions, which should be taken into account to better guide the ready biodegradation tests and understand the mechanisms of the ready biodegradation of aromatic compounds.

AB  - Climate change is expected to become an important driver influencing biodiversity. To protect biological diversity in the long term, nature conservationists must include potential climate change impacts in their management decisions. In order to incorporate effective climate change adaption strategies in the management of protected areas, potential threats of climate change need to be identified. In this study, climate model projections have been evaluated to derive information about the future exposure of nature parks to climate change. Indicators reflecting climate boundary conditions were selected in a cooperative process, considering both scientifically reliable climate scenario analysis and the requirements of park managers. The evaluation exhibits large uncertainties depending on the indicator. While for temperature, a warming trend is projected for all the regions, future projections for precipitation show the largest inter-model uncertainties. The Climatic Water Balance reflects the potential water availability and aids clarification to stakeholders, as it incorporates the temperature trend. The analysis robustly indicates a prolongation for the climatic growing season. The main challenges related to climate model information for decision-making are the uncertainties, different scales of climate and ecosystem processes and the finding of a common communication level for knowledge transfer. The results are useful for climate-influenced decision-making and provide one part of evidence for making adaptation decisions.

AB  - Understanding the factors controlling insect emergence from streams has applications to ecological theory regarding cross-boundary flux, along with practical value for monitoring stream function after restoration projects. We hypothesized that stream microhabitat would have effects on emergence that were independent of those mediated by the local stock of benthic macroinvertebrates. We set 50 emergence traps in a third-order stream in northern Minnesota, USA, during two study periods and used structural equation modeling to examine direct and indirect effects of benthic stock and microhabitat features on emergence. Emergence by biomass showed direct positive relationships to substrates of fines and detritus in the first sampling period, and to shallow depth and wood area in the second period. Emergence by abundance had direct positive relationships with benthic stock, CPOM, and fewer macrophytes in the first period, and with benthic stock and periphyton in the second period. Fine substrates may act to concentrate burrowing larvae, whereas CPOM and particularly wood may intercept drifting pre-emergent insects and provide exiting surfaces. Shallow depths may reduce the extent to which resident insects drift downstream (and leave the sample area) while emerging. Periphyton may be an indicator for patches with greater illumination, which itself attracts emergers. Our results suggest emergence is sensitive to environmental conditions at the microhabitat scale, and that stream restoration activities should consider habitat for emerging insects when designing projects.

AB  - A study on the Coleoptera community inhabiting a beach-dune ecosystem was carried out at Isola Varano, a site located along the southern Adriatic coast of Italy (Apulia). During 2002 bimonthly samples were taken using a standard system of traps: two transects with pitfall traps placed from the sealine limits to the first dune were used to collect spontaneously active individuals whereas core samples were taken in correspondence with each pitfall trap to sample burrowed beetles. Environmental variables such as beach profile, exposure, orientation, length, width, slope, mean grain size and dune height were also recorded. Temporal and spatial patterns were assessed for the most important Coleoptera species. Species were also studied both quantitatively and qualitatively using ecological indices: frequency and relative abundance were calculated together with species richness, alpha and beta diversity, the evenness of the community and dominance index. Comparisons with other beach localities over the Mediterranean basin showed that the coleopteran community of Isola Varano followed the general trends, both in space and time, that occurred for other sites even if lower diversity values were obtained. The presence of certain bioindicator species indicated a relatively good state of beach health but the impoverished dune fauna showed that the habitat was under a stressful condition due to the presence of a pinewood plantation in the retrodunal areas.

AB  - Since being elected in 2015, Canada's federal Liberal government has taken steps to overhaul major environment-related laws and policies, including federal environmental assessment (EA) and regulatory processes. During 2016-2017, a government-appointed panel toured Canada and received > 1000 suggestions from diverse sectors of society regarding EA reform. Yet, different sectors of society may have different views concerning scientific components of EA. We analyzed written submissions during public consultation (categorized into five sectors) regarding five key scientific components of EA: (1) openly sharing information, (2) evaluating cumulative effects, (3) scientific rigour, (4) transparency in decision-making, and (5) independence between regulators and proponents. On the whole, submissions from Indigenous groups, non-governmental organizations, and individuals/academics supported strengthening all five components. In contrast, most contributions from industry/industry associations, and, to a lesser extent, government bodies or agencies, suggested that there was no need for increased scientific rigour or increased independence. These findings indicate that there is cross-sectoral support for strengthening some scientific aspects of EA. However, the degree to which the Government of Canada strengthens the scientific rigour and independence of EA will indicate whether environmental decision-making in Canada is aligned with preferences from industry or the rest of Canada.

AB  - Decision-making plays a key role in reducing landslide risk and preventing natural disasters. Land management, recovery of degraded lands, urban planning, and environmental protection in general are fundamental for mitigating landslide hazard and risk. Here, we present a GIS-based multi-scale approach to highlight where and when a country is affected by a high probability of landslide occurrence. In the first step, a landslide human exposure equation is developed considering the landslide susceptibility triggered by rain as hazard, and the population density as exposed factor. The output, from this overview analysis, is a global GIS layer expressing the number of potentially affected people by month, where the monthly rain is used to weight the landslide hazard. As following step, Logistic Regression (LR) analysis was implemented at a national and local level. The Receiver Operating Characteristic indicator is used to understand the goodness of a LR model. The LR models are defined by a dependent variable, presence-absence of landslide points, versus a set of independent environmental variables. The results demonstrate the relevance of a multi-scale approach, at national level the biophysical variables are able to detect landslide hotspot areas, while at sub-regional level geomorphological aspects, like land cover, topographic wetness, and local climatic condition have greater explanatory power.

AB  - In this study a multiscale biomonitoring approach, which encompasses multiple levels of observations (from ultra- to meso- and macroscale, photo mosaicing and SRS), was applied to evaluate the conservation status of a P. oceanica meadow. In particular, the approach included a combination of molecular and biochemical parameters associated to the assessment of plant phenology and large-spatial bed structure and heterogeneity, which have ecological relevance. The aim was to identify a toolbox of reliable and economically feasible indicators to efficiently monitor and manage seagrass meadows.
   At ultrascale level, the OJIP-test, a screening test based on the quantitative analysis of the chlorophyll a fluorescence, was used for the first time on P. oceanica. At molecular level we tested the expression pattern of a panel of genes involved in the stress and photosynthesis pathways, as fast and sensitive response to stress exposure. At the microscale level, phenological features of P. oceanica were considered; at mesoscale level, the morphology of the meadow was determined by a photomosaicing technique. Finally, at a macroscale level, a spatially extensive map was produced by Remote Sensing approach. An anticipatory signal of pressure impending on the P. oceanica meadows was provided by molecular and biochemical markers, thus confirming the importance of a multiscale approach to asses a risk conditions in a natural environment, before these have a long-term effect.

AB  - Eastern Black Sea Region of Turkey is a sub-ecoregion of the Caucasus Ecoregion, and its Plecoptera fauna is similar to fauna of Caucasus with unique endemic species of the region. The Caucasus Ecoregion is one of the "WWF Global 200 Ecoregions," and it is also included in the list of top 25 hotspots in the World. Running water ecosystems of Eastern Black Sea sub-ecoregion are the most sensitive to land use change and global climate change. High-altitude aquatic ecosystems are more strongly threatened by global climate change in the region. Plecoptera constitute the most important part of the biodiversity of running waters in the region. Among the benthic macroinvertebrate taxa, Plecoptera is the best indicator of ecological conditions of running waters. The influence of environmental variables on the distribution of twenty Plecoptera species in running water ecosystems (headwaters, crenon, epirhithron, metarhithron) was assessed using canonical correspondence analysis. Sampling was carried out in 2009 and 2011. Eleven end groups were generated from the TWINSPAN analysis. Isoperla rhododendri, Isoperla grammatica, Protonemura bifida, Protonemura eumontana and Perla caucasica were closely related to pH, dissolved oxygen and riparian vegetation. Brachyptera transcaucasica transcaucasica, Nemoura martynovia, Nemoura taurica and Protonemura eumontana were related to Mg and Cu. The results show that the Plecoptera assemblage composition was affected by DO, pH, EC, temperature, nitrite, Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu, Zn, Al, riparian vegetation, altitude and stream width.

AB  - Environmental change can be viewed as the combined result of long-term processes and singular events. While long-term trends appear to be readily available for observation (in the form of temporal comparisons or space-for-time substitution), it is more difficult to gain information on singular events in the past, although these can be equally significant in shaping ecosystems. We examined the past 700 years in the history of a lowland wetland landscape in the Czech Republic with the help of palaeoecological, ecological, landscape archaeological, and archival data. Macrofossil and pollen data were compared to known drainage works in the area and historical climatological data. Trends and events in habitat conditions were assessed using species indicator values. Results showed that ecological succession was the general process in the study area, detected as a trend towards eutrophication, desiccation, and vegetation closure. Short-term events influenced development at the sites mainly from the second half of the nineteenth century. This is consistent with drainage history, although bias related to sample frequency cannot be excluded. On the whole, long-term trends and discrete events were complementary on different scales. We conclude that humans facilitated and accelerated background processes, which can be most likely associated with the succession of open wetlands towards terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - Natural attenuation processes valorization for PAH-contaminated soil remediation has gained increasing interest from site owners. A misunderstanding of this method and a small amount of data available does not encourage its development. However, monitored natural attenuation (MNA) offers a valuable, cheaper and environmentally friendly alternative to more classical options such as physico-chemical treatments (e.g., chemical oxidation, thermal desorption). The present work proposes the results obtained during a long-term natural attenuation assessment of historically contaminated industrial soils under real climatic conditions. This study was performed after a 10 year natural attenuation period on 60 off-ground lysimeters filled with contaminated soils from different former industrial sites (coking industry, manufactured gas plants) whose initial concentration of PAH varied between 380 and 2,077 mg kg(-1). The analysed parameters included leached water characterization, soil PAH concentrations, evaluation of vegetation cover quality and quantity. Results showed a good efficiency of the PAH dissipation and limited transfer of contaminants to the environment. It also highlighted the importance of the fine soil fractions in controlling PAH reactivity. PAH dissipation through water leaching was limited and did not present a significant risk for the environment. This PAH water concentration appeared however as a good indicator of overall dissipation rate, thereby illustrating the importance of pollutant availability in predicting its degradation potential.

AB  - Stormwater infiltration basins, one of the typical stormwater best management practices, are commonly constructed for surface water pollution control, flood mitigation, and groundwater restoration in rural or residential areas. These basins have soils with better infiltration capacity than the native soil; however, the ever-increasing contribution of nutrients to groundwater from stormwater due to urban expansion makes existing infiltration basins unable to meet groundwater quality criteria related to environmental sustainability and public health. This issue requires retrofitting current infiltration basins for flood control as well as nutrient control before the stormwater enters the groundwater. An existing stormwater infiltration basin in north-central Florida was selected, retrofitted, and monitored to identify subsurface physiochemical and biological processes during 2007-2010 to investigate nutrient control processes. This implementation in the nexus of contaminant hydrology and ecological engineering adopted amended soil layers packed with biosorption activated media (BAM; tire crumb, silt, clay, and sand) to perform nutrient removal in a partitioned forebay using a berm. This study presents an infiltration basin-nitrogen removal (IBNR) model, a system dynamics model that simulates nitrogen cycling in this BAM-based stormwater infiltration basin with respect to changing hydrologic conditions and varying dissolved nitrogen concentrations. Modeling outputs of IBNR indicate that denitrification is the biogeochemical indicator in the BAM layer that accounted for a loss of about one third of the total dissolved nitrogen mass input.

AB  - Research reported in this feature identifies a convergence of interpretations regarding the threshold dynamics of complex ecological systems. This convergence has arisen from a diverse set of investigations addressing rangeland ecosystem dynamics, disease transmission, and fluctuations in the populations of insect pests. Effective application of the threshold concept to ecosystem management will require development of more robust linkages between non-equilibrium theory and protocols to identify triggers that initiate threshold conditions, feedback loops that establish system resilience, and developmental trajectories and attributes of potential alternative stable states. Successful implementation of these theory/application linkages has the potential to underpin an operational framework of resilience-based ecosystem management that is founded upon the identification of structural indicators that are correlated with vulnerability or proximity to thresholds, rather than threshold identification per se. Several investigations indicate that thresholds are strongly influenced by scale; multiple cross-scale interactions demonstrate the need for greater knowledge and analyses to address scale-dependent processes, i.e., critical scales and scaling laws. This feature emphasizes the relevance of thresholds and non-equilibrium dynamics in multiple natural resource management applications and in so doing demonstrates the need for a more comprehensive and integrated ecological framework capable of quantitatively assessing dynamics at multiple scales to inform management and policy recommendations for optimal management and risk assessment.

AB  - To select grassland sites for successful botanical restoration, it is essential that there is both a biological (a species pool) and an environmental potential (suitable conditions for the species to establish). Our aim was to identify indicators of the environmental potential of botanical quality measured independently of the species composition of the vegetation. Data were collected on numerous sward, soil, and grassland management variables at 20 Danish low-lying grasslands managed under different intensities. Top soil from each site was bioassayed with oat (Avena saliva L.) as a phytometer. Correlation analyses were used to examine relationships among variables and groups of variables. Indicators independent of species composition of the vegetation related to high or low botanical nature quality were identified. Indicators for high potential nature quality were the K/P ratio in the sward and K concentration in bioassay plants. Indicators for low potential nature quality were dry matter (DM) production, feed units and P-concentration of the sward; dry weight, shoot number and leaf length in bioassay; potential N mineralisation rate and amount of mineral N in the soil in spring. We concluded that a combination of indicators was preferable to only one indicator, as botanical nature quality is influenced in a multi-factorial way. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lake protection is a very important element of environmental management. This is especially true of lake districts, where the lakes are an important resting place for residents, especially young people. The crucial is the question whether young people who participate in lake management in the future, are ready for it. It was assumed that their attitude towards lakes would be an indicator of such preparation. This study aimed to define a set of respondents' features that may condition the specific model of participation. Based on the research conducted among young residents (N = 167) of the Szczecinecki District in Poland, it was found that their pro-environmental attitudes were dominated by high values of the traits that make up the emotional component, average values of the cognitive component and the lowest values of activity. The lower the score of the overall attitude, the more often the respondents chose Recreational Lakes, rather than General Development or Natural Lakes. The most important feature that may determine the level of participation in the future is readiness to act. A comprehensive attitude index was created, which shows that it is worth examining the characteristics of respondents that correlate with the willingness to act, i.e., knowledge, logical thinking, creativity and belief in the effectiveness of actions taken and attachment to the place of residence, when planning participatory management in lakeland areas.

AB  - An anthropic ecosystem from Romania was investigated from acarological, vegetation and chemical point of view. The community structures of two groups of mites were studied (Acari: Mesostigmata, Oribatida) from a tailing pond, using transect method, in correlation with concentrations of heavy metals (As, Cu, Pb, Ni, Mn and Zn), with abiotic factors (altitude, aspect, soil temperature, soil humidity, soil pH) and biotic factor (vegetation coverage). Taking into account the mite communities, in total, 30 mite species were identified, with 1009 individuals and 18 immatures (10 species with 59 individuals, 5 immatures of Mesostigmata and 20 species with 950 individuals, 13 immatures of Oribatida). The investigated habitats from the tailing pond were grouped in five transects, with different degree of pollution, based on total metal loads. Taking into account of the connection between mites communities, abiotic factors and heavy metals, each transect were characterized through specific relationship. Using multivariate statistical analysis, we revealed that the occurrence of some Oribatida species was strongly correlated with vegetation coverage, soil pH and soil humidity, though concentrations of Cu, As, Mn, Ni and Zn also had an influence. Pb and Zn concentrations were shown to influence the occurrence of Mesostigmata mites. The heterogeneity of mites species richness at 2 m(2) scale was correlated with a metric related to the heterogeneity of heavy metals at the same scale.

AB  - Physiographic factors along with edaphic conditions play a crucial role in establishment of plant species throughout a region. Identification of the most effective factors is of high importance in sustainable management of a forest ecosystem. This study aims to investigate the relationships between understory vegetation and some environmental factors in natural forest ecosystems. This study has been carried out among the Fagetum orientalis communities of Ramsar Region, located in the north of Iran. For this purpose, 105 releves were sampled by a randomized-systematic method throughout the study area, using the Braun-Blanquet scale. Physiographic parameters such as elevation, as well as slope and orientation were measured. By identification of the herb-layer vegetation contained in each sampling, vegetation composition and cover abundance of species were separately identified. Then, the aforementioned properties of soil were entirely measured in the taken samples. Cluster analysis and detrended correspondence analysis have been applied to classify the site. Moreover, in order to determine the relation between species composition and environmental factors, canonical correspondence analysis was used. Results showed a significant relation between distribution of plant types and environmental factors. Eventually, environmental factors including slope, orientation, silt percent, pH, organic matter and soluble phosphorous were among the most effective factors in establishment of Hedera pastuchowii, Solanum kieseritzkii, Oplismenus undulatifolius, Sedum stoloniferum, Rubus hyrcanus and Saxifraga cymbalaria species.

AB  - Studies are increasingly using cholinergic parameters as biomarkers of early neurotoxicity, but few have characterized this system in ecologically relevant model organisms. In the present study, key neurochemicals in the cholinergic pathway were measured and analyzed from discrete parts of brain and blood from captive mink (Mustela vison). Similar to other mammals, the regional distribution of cholinergic parameters in the brain could be ranked from highest to lowest as: basal ganglia > occipital cortex > brain stem > cerebellum (F (3,192) = 172.1, p < 0.001). Higher variation in cholinergic parameters was found in the cerebellum (coefficient of variation = 34.9%), and the least variation was measured in the brain stem (19.7%). Variation was also assessed by calculating the difference between the lowest and highest measures among individual animals: choline acetyltransferase (1.6x fold difference), cholinesterase (2.0x), muscarinic receptor levels (2.4x), acetylcholine (3.7x), nicotinic receptor levels (3.9x), and choline transporter (5.0x). In blood samples, activity and inter-individual variation of cholinesterase was highest in whole blood and lowest in plasma and serum. By using captive mink of a common genetic source, age, gender, and rearing conditions, these data help establish normal levels, ranges, and variations of cholinergic biomarkers among brain regions, blood components, and individual animals. Such information may better enable the utility of cholinergic biomarkers in environmental assessments.

AB  - Two sampling methods, an array of physical-chemical and biological indicators, and uni-multivariate statistical procedures were compared on the basis of sensitivity to detect any impact and cost-effectiveness criteria, applied to environmental monitoring of fish farming. Sampling was conducted in a western Mediterranean gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) and meagre (Argyrosomus regius) farm (San Pedro del Pinatar, SE Spain). Both sampling methods (Van Veen grab vs SCUBA diving) provided similar results for all the parameters except redox potential. The most sensitive chemical parameters of the sediment were total phosphorus, total ammonium nitrogen and acid volatile sulphide, but the latter was the only one which correlated with the macrobenthic community structure. The application of univariate methods to biological indicators only showed a clear trend in two (AMBI and BENTIX) of the five indices used. Both biotic indices, although statistically correlated with the spatial pattern of the macrobenthic community, provided different quality status categorization that could lead to misinterpretation and so, validation in offshore conditions is required. Nevertheless, multivariate analysis of macrofauna confirmed a noticeable spatial pattern, at the same time that this statistical strategy has been proven and validated in a wide range of marine community studies.

AB  - Elaborate restoration attempts are underway worldwide to return human-impacted rivers to more natural conditions. Assessing the outcome of river restoration projects is vital for adaptive management, evaluating project efficiency, optimising future programmes and gaining public acceptance. An important reason why assessment is oftenomitted is lack of appropriate guidelines.
   Here we present guidelines for assessing river restoration success. They are based on a total of 50 indicators and 14 specific objectives elaborated for the restoration of low- to midorder rivers in Switzerland. Most of these objectives relate to ecological attributes of rivers, but socio-economic aspects are also considered.

AB  - The diatom/dinoflagellate index (Dia/Dino index) serves as an indicator in the assessment of the ecological status of the Baltic Sea within the scope of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). It describes the dominance patterns in the phytoplankton spring bloom. Implementation of this indicator requires a definition of the conditions describing good environmental status (GES). The aim of this study was to determine thresholds for GES for the Dia/Dino index on the basis of historical phytoplankton data from different regions of the Baltic Sea. Data from the first half of the twentieth century, corresponding to the pre-eutrophication period, provide an unadulterated reference, as exemplified by nutrient data. Early phytoplankton data showed high dominance of diatoms over dinoflagellates in spring blooms. Diatom dominance relates to a Dia/Dino index which allowed GES threshold of the Eastern Gotland Basin to be set at a Dia/Dino index of >0.5. The consistently very high Dia/Dino index in Kiel and Mecklenburg Bays supported a previously suggested GES threshold value of 0.75. Recent monitoring data revealed a sudden decrease of the Dia/Dino index, especially between 1984 and 1991, and thus a worsening environmental status. This deterioration could be attributed to warming rather than to eutrophication.

AB  - Indicators of water quality in open coasts, estuaries, and inlets including nutrients, water clarity, and toxicants were investigated in the Andoni River estuary in the eastern Niger Delta of Nigeria using standard methods. DO was generally below 5 mg/L and 20 % of sampled sites had turbidity levels above standards recommended for estuarine ecosystems. The sampled sites also did not meet international standards for nitrate, heavy metals, and hydrocarbons, exceeding limits for natural resource preservation, coral reef conservation, and aquaculture by very wide margins. Nitrate ranges were between 0.6 and 1.5 mg/L; THC (4.6-52.6 mg/L) heavy metals (Fe 0.45-1.54 mg/L, Mn 0.004-0.19 mg/L, Ni 0.08-0.16 mg/ L, Cd 0.02-0.5 mg/L, Pb 0.14-0.44 mg/L, and Zn 0.06-0.17 mg/L). A Water Quality Index calculated for the whole river system showed a declining capacity to support fish and aquatic grass habitats. This study, therefore, concludes that the estuary is suffering pollution from immediate hydrocarbon pollution sources and local pollution from eroded contaminated sediments, discharged domestic and human waste, and long distance river pollution. A comprehensive scientific investigation of estuarine conditions, source control measures for known pollutants, and source conversion of fecal sludge in riverine communities are among recommendations.

AB  - In the soils of bog ecosystems studied in Plesetskii raion of Arkhangelsk oblast, 169 species and infraspecific taxa of algae have been recorded. Their flora includes typical divisions of soil algae and is dominated by Chlorophyta, which is typical for the soil-climatic conditions of the taiga zone in general and bog ecosystems in particular. The phytocenotic organization of algal groups can serve as an indicator of bog trophicity, since a certain trophicity level is characterized by an individual combination of dominant species, life forms, morphotypes, and ecological groups of soil algae.

AB  - In the extreme North, the polar region of Siberian Russia, the largest mining and processing enterprises for metallic and nonmetallic ores, coal, oil, and gas are situated. The extremely vulnerable boreal and polar ecosystems of the North are responding adversely to the impact of these activities, and are in danger of collapse because of them. The mechanisms of such impacts, their formation, continuous extension, and merger have been studied. The deforested and destroyed areas of former forest-tundra and taiga ecosystems resemble the Arctic zones of a much harsher environment more than the typical Arctic zones where they occur.

AB  - Purpose of review
   Chronological age is a crude measure and may not be the best indicator of the ageing process. Establishing valid and reliable biomarkers to understand the true effect of ageing is of great interest. We provide an overview of biological and psychological characteristics that change with age and can potentially serve as markers of the ageing process, and discuss if an integration of these characteristics may more accurately measure the true age of a person. We also describe the clinicopathological continuum of these ageing-related changes.
   Recent findings
   Ageing-related changes in the biological and psychological systems of the body have been studied to varying degrees and with differing emphases. Despite the development of ageing indices, there is no single indicator that can holistically estimate the ageing process. Differential ageing of bodily systems remains poorly understood, and valid methods have not been developed for composite markers of biological and psychological processes.
   Summary
   The ageing process is complex and heterogeneous. Incorporating biological and psychological measures may improve accuracy in reflecting an individual's ` true age,' and elucidate why some people age successfully, whereas others show ageing-related decline and disease.

AB  - Traditional physico-chemical sensors arc becoming an obsolete tool for environmental quality assessment. Biomonitoring techniques, such as biological early warning systems present the advantage of being sensitivity, fast, non-invasive and ecologically relevant. In this work, we applied a video tracking system, developed with zebrafish (Danio rerio), to detect microbiological contamination in water. Using the fishs' behavior response, the system was able to detect the presence of a non-pathogenic environmental strain of Escherichia coif, at three different levels of contamination: 600, 1800 and 5000 CFU/100 mL (colony forming units/100 mL). Data was collected during 50 min of exposure and analyzed with the artificial neural networks Self-organizing Map and Multi-layer Perceptron. The behavior of exposed fish was more erratic, with pronounced and rapid changes on movement direction and with significant less exploratory activity. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values regarding the detection capability (distinction between presence or absence of contamination) ranged from 89 to 100%. Regarding the classification capability (distinction between experimental conditions), the values ranged from 67 to 89%. This research may be a valuable contribution to improve water monitoring and management strategies, by taking as reference the effects on biosensors, without a biased anthropocentric perspective.

AB  - The aim of this study was to explore how estuarine salt marsh macrophytes are distributed in relation to physicochemical variables. This information was examined to determine whether macrophyte species are associated with a specific range of physicochemical variables and so could be used as bioindicators. The distribution of eleven macrophyte species in fourteen estuaries across the South African temperate coast was assessed in relation to sediment (moisture content, organic content, electrical conductivity, pH and redox potential) and ground-water (electrical conductivity, salinity and depth of the groundwater) variables. A univariate and multivariate approach showed that common salt marsh species were poor bioindicators as they occurred over a broad range of values across the measured physicochemical variables (i.e. Bassin diffuse, Juncus kraussii, Sarcocornia pillansii, Sarcocornia tegetaria and Sporobolus virginicus). It is therefore suggested that rare species (Sarcocornia capensis, Frankenia pulverulenta, Poeciolepis ficoidea, S. decumbens, Plantago carnosa, Triglochin elongate, Spergularia media, Suaeda fruticosa and S. inflate) be studied further to establish relationships with physicochemical variables as these may be useful indicators to monitor responses to sea level and other environmental changes. This study provides useful data on the ecological requirements of species and habitats in response to diverse physiochemical conditions across various estuaries spanning a regional scale.

AB  - Coastal zooplankton have been investigated since 1984 at a Long Term Ecological Research station MC (LTER-MC) in the inner Gulf of Naples (Tyrrhenian Sea, Western Mediterranean). The sampling site, located between the littoral and the open sea systems, has very active hydrography that affects plankton communities. The present work was aimed at establishing whether, in such a dynamic and variable environment, species associations and homogeneous periods could be identified as characteristic and stable features of the mesozooplankton over the period 1984-2006. Hierarchical clustering was applied to assess species associations based on a matrix of similarities between species (R-mode), and homogeneous periods based on a matrix of similarities between observations (Q-mode). The Indicator Value index [IndVal, Dufrene and Legendre (1997) Species assemblages and indicator species: the need for a flexible asymmetrical approach. Ecol. Monogr., 67, 345-366] was calculated to identify species characterizing each period. Five taxonomic groups with well-defined composition and abundance were identified as robust associations that likely reflect different modes of community functioning. The temporal course of these associations was largely shaped by strong seasonal forcing comprising both physical and biological (e.g. trophic) signals. These associations persisted over the long term, thus indicating some stable characters in the Naples zooplankton time-series, providing evidence of resilience in communities in highly variable coastal conditions.

AB  - Long-term mechanistic research and monitoring provides integral science support for ecosystem-based management (EBM) of resources, activities and services. Decades of oceanographic and ecological research by Bill Peterson and colleagues along the Newport Hydrographic Line (NH Line) provides essential context for understanding and managing Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. and other marine resources in the California Current ecosystem. This research program helped federal scientists convey the significance of the northeast Pacific marine heatwave (2013-2016) to fisheries managers and stakeholders. Particularly illustrative were shifts in the composition of the copepod community, which reflected feeding conditions for Pacific salmon and other consumers. We identify six traits of the dataset produced by Peterson and colleagues that have made it especially valuable for informing management: (i) it has generated robust ecosystem indicators; (ii) it is longterm; (iii) it is associated with meaningful ecological mechanisms; (iv) it relates to ecosystem components of high societal value; (v) it can represent processes and lags at meaningful temporal scales; and (vi) it is part of a broader, integrative science effort. This research effort underscores the importance of developing and sustaining long-term mechanistic research and monitoring along the U.S. West Coast and elsewhere in the world.

AB  - The earliest microbiological studies on hot springs in India date from 2003, a much later date compared to global attention in this striking field of study. As of today, 28 out of 400 geothermal springs have been explored following both culturable and non-culturable approaches. The temperatures and pH of the springs are 37-99 A degrees C and 6.8-10, respectively. Several studies have been performed on the description of novel genera and species, characterization of different bio-resources, metagenomics of hot spring microbiome and whole genome analysis of few isolates. 17 strains representing novel species and many thermostable enzymes, including lipase, protease, chitinase, amylase, etc. with potential biotechnological applications have been reported by several authors. Influence of physico-chemical conditions, especially that of temperature, on shaping the hot spring microbiome has been established by metagenomic investigations. Bacteria are the predominant life forms in all the springs with an abundance of phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Thermi, Bacteroidetes, Deinococcus-Thermus and Chloroflexi. In this review, we have discussed the findings on all microbiological studies that have been carried out to date, on the 28 hot springs. Further, the possibilities of extrapolating these studies for practical applications and environmental impact assessment towards protection of natural ecosystem of hot springs have also been discussed.

AB  - Watershed management processes continue to call for more science and improved decision making that take into account the full range of stakeholder perspectives. Increasingly, the core principles of ecological risk assessment (i.e., the development and use of assessment endpoints and conceptual models, conducting exposure and effects analysis) are being incorporated and adapted in innovative ways to meet the call for more science. Similarly, innovative approaches to adapting decision analysis tools and methods for incorporating stakeholder concerns in complex natural resource management decisions are being increasingly applied. Here, we present an example of the integration of ecological risk assessment with decision analysis in the development of a watershed management plan for the Greater Vancouver Water District in British Columbia, Canada. Assessment endpoints were developed, ecological inventory data were collected, and watershed models were developed to characterize the existing and future condition of 3 watersheds in terms of the potential risks to water quality. Stressors to water quality include sedimentation processes (landslides, streambank erosion) and forest disturbance (wildfire, major insect or disease outbreak). Three landscape-level risk management alternatives were developed to reflect different degrees of management intervention. Each alternative was evaluated under different scenarios and analyzed by explicitly examining value-based trade-offs among water quality, environmental, financial, and social endpoints. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate how the integration of ecological risk assessment and decision analysis approaches can support decision makers in watershed management.

AB  - Untreated hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) was discharged into the Tone River in the central area of Japan, and the risk management plan in the watershed area has been strengthened because HMT is the precursor of formaldehyde (FA) regulated by Japanese water supply law. The release of HMT could occur not only in steady but also in unsteady environmental conditions. In this context, no quantitative environmental risk assessments have dealt with the combined events of FA precursor outflow and natural disasters, such as a massive tsunami attack. In this study, we estimated the time course changes of HMT concentrations at the near water treatment plant (WTP) intakes due to tsunami run-up in the river after HMT discharge from facilities along the river during a massive tsunami attack, then potential ecological and health impacts were estimated. This method has a strong analytical ability to reveal the relationship between wave source and inland water run-up in consideration of 3D density flow. For ecological risk, the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) was employed. We found that HMT concentration would not reach a level of concern even after the accident. For potential health risk in terms of the possible maximum inlet concentration of HMT at the WTP, the FA formation amount was 5.3 x 10(-2) mg/L, which was below the water quality standard.

AB  - The diversity of phytoplankton traits provides a powerful means of addressing ecological questions and can be adopted to simplify and predict the community structure and the function of the multiple environmental filters that operate in the different ecosystems. We evaluated the response of phytoplankton functional groups in samples from two subtropical rivers, identifying the main environmental filters associated with the presence of the different groups and their functional traits during a seasonal cycle. Using multivariate analysis, we found environmental dissimilarity that was predicted by the presence of different functional groups (FGs) in the two rivers. Six FGs were recorded: J (chlorophyceans chlorococcales), M (colonial cyanobacteria), N (desmids), W1 (euglenophyceans), X2 (flagellated unicellular chlorophyceans) and F (flagellated colonial chlorophyceans). The FGs J, M and N were exclusive to Cascavel River, while X2 and F were exclusive to Quati River. The FG W1 was recorded in both rivers; however, its greatest contribution was in Quati River. Thus, the FGs reflected the environmental dissimilarity, mainly related to the conditions of water flux, conductivity, light availability and depth of the environments. Based on these results, the functional groups are considered to provide a relevant tool in phytoplankton ecology, offering a practical means of investigating the relationship between phytoplankton and ecosystem functioning, and contributing to the management and conservation of biodiversity in lotic environments.

AB  - The present investigation was carried out to evaluate the toxic effects of traditional Ethiopian fish poisoning plant Birbira [vernacular name (local native language, Amharic); Milletia ferruginea] seed extract on aquatic macroinvertebrates, Baetidae (Mayflies) and Hydropsychidae (Caddisflies), under laboratory conditions. In Ethiopia, toxic plant; Milletia ferruginea pulverized seeds have been used for fish poisoning since time immemorial. Macroinvertebrates are important biological indicators of alteration in the natural water sources. Milletia ferruginea seed extract was applied at concentrations of 125, 250, 500 1000 and 2000 ppm on Hydropsychididae whereas Baetidae were exposed at various concentrations viz., 31.25, 62.5, 125, 250 & 500 ppm. Milletia ferruginea seeds crude extract of lethal doses (LC50 and LC90) required for Baetidae 49.29 mg/l and 172.52 mg/l were respectively and the respective doses (LC50 and LC90) against Hydropsychidae were 679.64 mg/l and 2383.93 mg/l. The present investigation end result demonstrated that Milletia ferruginea seed extracts were extremely toxic to Baetidae than Hydropsychididae. As a result, application of Milletia ferruginea seed extracts into the rivers/streams for fish poisoning possibly leads to contamination and disruption of food chain in the aquatic ecosystem. Therefore, the concerned authorities should launch appropriate awareness campaign among the local inhabitants and fisherman about adverse effect of Birbira seed extracts. Furthermore, providing alternative ecofriendly techniques for fish harvesting may possibly bring constructive out come in the near future.

AB  - A broad range of perspectives exists regarding the interpretation of potentially adverse ecological changes in ecological risk assessments conducted under Superfund and RCRA. While USEPA's Proposed Guidelines for Ecological Risk Assessment recommend determining whether predicted changes are adverse based on the nature of effects, intensity of effects, spatial scale, temporal scale, and potential for recovery, the guidelines do not provide specific standards for judging adversity. Hence, implementation of the proposed guidelines varies with each risk manager's subjective judgments regarding the relative importance of each of these five criteria. In an effort to increase consistency in the scientific interpretation of ecological risk assessments, the following practices are recommended. First, measures of effects should focus on levels of ecological organization that are more complex than the individual organism. Second, multiple lines of evidence should be evaluated for each assessment endpoint, Third, bioequivalence testing should be used in place of traditional statistical testing (e.g., Student t-test) because the goal of bioequivalence testing is to answer the biologically relevant question of whether measurements differ by, at most, a biologically small amount. Fourth, in defining biologically small differences, site-specific and species-specific conditions should be considered to the greatest extent possible. Fifth, where the outcomes of multiple lines of evidence contradict one another, the risk assessor should employ a quantitative approach to weighing the evidence based on the scientific defensibility of each measure of effect.

AB  - Metagenomics in agricultural research allows for searching for bioindicators of soil health to characterize changes caused by management practices. Cover cropping (CC) improves soil health by mitigating nutrient losses, yet the benefits depend on the tillage system used. Field studies searching for indicator taxa within these systems are scarce and narrow in their scope. Our goal was to identify bioindicators of soil health from microbes that were responsive to CC (three levels) and tillage (chisel tillage, no-till) treatments after five years under field conditions. We used rRNA gene-based analysis via Illumina HiSeq2500 technology with QIIME 2.0 processing to characterize the microbial communities. Our results indicated that CC and tillage differentially changed the relative abundances (RAs) of the copiotrophic and oligotrophic guilds. Corn-soybean rotations with legume-grass CC increased the RA of copiotrophic decomposers more than rotations with grass CC, whereas rotations with only bare fallows favored stress-tolerant oligotrophs, including nitrifiers and denitrifiers. Unlike bacteria, fewer indicator fungi and archaea were detected; fungi were poorly identified, and their responses were inconsistent, while the archaea RA increased under bare fallow treatments. This is primary information that allows for understanding the potential for managing the soil community compositions using cover crops to reduce nutrient losses to the environment.

AB  - Here, we expand on the term "ecomimicry" to be an umbrella concept for an approach to adaptive ecosystem-based management of social-ecological systems that simultaneously optimizes multiple ecosystem services for the benefit of people and place. In this context, we define ecomimicry as a strategy for developing and managing cultural landscapes, built upon a deep understanding of the structure and function of ecosystems, that harnesses ecosystem processes for the purpose of balancing and sustaining key ecosystem services, rather than maximizing one service (e.g., food production) to the detriment of others. Ecomimicry arises through novel, place-based innovations or is adopted from elsewhere and adapted to local conditions. Similarly, precontact Hawaiian social-ecological systems integrated a variety of ecomimicry schema to engender a complex system of adaptive resource management that enhanced biocultural diversity and supported resilient food systems, ultimately sustaining a thriving human population. In addition to presenting a synopsis of how ecomimicry was employed in the design and management of Hawaiian social-ecological systems, we identify and characterize specific ecomimicry applications. Within this context, we explore a revival of ecomimicry for biological conservation, biocultural restoration, resilience, and food security. We conclude with a discussion of how revitalizing such an approach in the restoration of social-ecological systems may address issues of conservation and sustainability in the Anthropocene.

AB  - Zooplanktonic communities are important components in trophic chain considering primary producers and other levels. In addition, some species are sensitive or tolerant to organic pollution. Here we test the hypothesis that species composition varies according to the eutrophication gradient. We sought to establish which environmental factors are responsible for the variation of the species distribution. This study aimed to characterize zooplankton community and to establish a link between water quality in Sao Paulo State reservoirs. Samples were collected through vertical hauls with plankton net (68 pm) in seven water bodies. All specimens were identified with specific literature and counted in Sedgwick rafter chamber. Abiotic and biotic data were analyzed by a canonical correspondence analysis. Atotal of 67 taxa was identified, being Rotifera predominant. The reservoirs exhibited eutrophic conditions mainly Salto Grande, Barra Bonita and Broa. The results point out the rotifers Trichocerca longiseta (Schrank, 1802), Hexarthra sp., Brachiounus spp. and Keratella tropica (Apstein, 1907) followed eutrophication gradient. Additionally, microcrustaceans such as Notodiaptomus, Mesocyclops, Metacyclops and Diaphanos soma occurred in eutrophic reservoirs. On other hand, the cladocerans Ceriodaphnia cornuta (Sars, 1886) and Bosminopsis deitersi Richard, 1895 were considered indicators of better water quality due to relationship with transparency. The results point out that some indicator species are effective in environmental monitoring without reject physico-chemical and biological analysis.

AB  - Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) systems are as important today for the survival and well-being of many indigenous peoples as they ever were. These ways of knowing have much to contribute at a time of marked climate change. As indigenous peoples have sustained exposure to natural resources and phenomena in particular places over time, they are privy to the cumulative knowledge on the location and timing of a host of significant environmental events and processes. Not only do their intimate experiences of seasonal weather conditions, tides and currents, species, and environmental indicators contribute to a better understanding of the nature, rate, and intensity of climate change, but TEK systems can potentially contribute to more effective planning and decision making regarding resilience and adaptation to climate change. Furthermore, the values of respect and recognition of kinship with other species that are often embodied in these systems can serve to remind all of us about the imperative to conserve and protect these other species if we are to survive as humans. We identify some of the more obvious areas where TEK systems can provide important insights for climate change planners in British Columbia, Canada as well as some of the potential challenges to attempting to integrate TEK into mainstream planning for climate change.

AB  - The Atlantic Forest is a conservation hotspot due to its elevated level of biodiversity and current state of degradation. Some areas of Atlantic Forest have been replaced by eucalyptus monocultures in Brazil. Soil arthropods can be important indicators for assessing the recomposition of native forests after disturbs. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that exist differences in the composition and structure of soil arthropod communities among two plantations of eucalyptus (Corymbia citriodora) in different stages of natural regeneration of Atlantic forest (YP = Young Plantation and MP = Mature Plantation, in less and more advanced stage of regeneration, respectively) and a fragment of Atlantic forest (FOREST), in wet and dry seasons, in Uniao Biological Reserve, Brazil, using pitfalls. Archaeognatha, Diplura, Opilionida, and Thysanura were restricted to the FOREST, while Diptera, Isoptera, and Orthoptera were favored by the microclimatic conditions in eucalyptus plantations. Soil arthropod community in FOREST was more complex than those in eucalyptus plantations. In general, soil arthropod communities showed higher total abundance and richness of groups, while equability decreased, as regeneration of Atlantic forest advanced in eucalyptus plantations, making this community more similar to that observed in the FOREST. The average total abundance, average richness, and total richness of soil arthropods were higher in the wet season in all areas, but the opposite occurred for the equability. Soil arthropod community improved with the regeneration of native forest species under the eucalyptus plantations.

AB  - The nitrogen isotope of soil is of emerging significance as an indicator of climatic change and biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen in nature systems. In this paper, the nitrogen content and isotopic composition of modern ecosystems from arid and semiarid Loess Plateau in northwestern China, including plant roots and surface soil, were determined to investigate trends in delta N-15 variation of plant roots and soil along a precipitation and temperature gradient in northwestern China under the East Asian Monsoon climate condition. The delta N-15 values of surface soil from the study area vary from -1.2aEuro degrees to 5.8aEuro degrees but from -5.1aEuro degrees to 1.9aEuro degrees in the plant roots. Our results indicate that (1) although the isotopic compositions of both plant roots and surface soil change with a similar trend along the climate gradient, the apparent nitrogen difference between plant roots and soil existed, with Delta delta N-15 values ranging from 0.3aEuro degrees to 7.2aEuro degrees with average of 4.1aEuro degrees and (2) mean annual precipitation (MAP) is the dominant factor for isotopic composition of plant-soil nitrogen in the Loess Plateau, and the delta N-15 values are less correlated with MAT; we suggest that nitrogen isotopic composition of soil is a potential tracer for environmental changes.

AB  - The Thau lagoon differs from other mediterranean lagoon sites in the apparent complexity of its benthic Community structures, which seem to result from the relative complexity of its physical environment.
   A statistical analysis of the relationship between the abundances and biomasses of benthic taxa and the lagoonal hydrodynamic characteristics was carried out. An ACE-type statistical algorithm is used to expose the non-linear relationships in multiple regressions. Polychaete and crustacean biomasses along with mollusc densities at 15 sampling stations are considered as dependent variables. The granulometric fraction of the sediment below 40 mu as well as hydrodynamic descriptors such as kinetic energy and the exchange term H2V2, resulting from a numerical modeling of circulation forced by stochastic winds, are considered as predictors.
   The results demonstrate that the exchanges resulting from the hydrodynamic conditions within the watermass have a dominant beneficial influence on the development of each of the zoological groups considered. In addition, the importance of the sedimentary substrate is confirmed, but gives an interesting non-linear result, with a threshold between 3 and 6 % of the fraction of fine particles below 40 mu. Apart from the quantification of this sedimentological indicator it appears that the dominant influence of the hydrodynamic exchange processes throughout the lagoon on the development of the benthic biological structures, quite independently of any bathymetric considerations, could give a new insight into the spatial organization of benthic communities in lagoonal ecosystems.

AB  - Marine litter is composed mainly of plastics and is recognized as a serious threat to marine ecosystems. Ecotoxicological approaches have started elucidating the potential severity of microplastics (MPs) in controlled laboratory studies with pristine materials but no information exists on marine environmental microlitter as a whole. Here, we characterized the litter in the coastal Northern Tyrrhenian sea and in the stomach of two fish species of socio-economic importance, and exposed primary cell cultures of mucosal and lymphoid organs to marine microlitter for evaluating possible cytotoxic effects. An average of 0.30 +/- 0.02 microlitter items m(-3) was found in water samples. mu FT-IR analysis revealed that plastic particles, namely HDPE, polyamide and polypropylene were present in 100% and 83.3% of Merluccius merluccius and Manus harhaats analyzed, which overall ingested 14.67 +/- 4.10 and 5.50 +/- 1.97 items/individual, respectively. Moreover, microlitter was confirmed as a vector of microorganisms. lastly, the apical endpoint of viability was found to be significantly reduced in splenic cells exposed in vino to two microlitter conditions. Considering the role of the spleen in the mounting of adaptive immune responses, our results warrant more indepth investigations for clarifying the actual susceptibility of these two species to anthropogenic microlitter.

AB  - Green space, mainly forests, shrubs, and grasslands, provides essential ecosystem services for human well-being. Based on multi-source data and using the Maximum Entropy model and Geographical Information System (GIS) tools, this research comprehensively assesses the supply and demand of recreational services from green space in Beijing. The supply of recreational services in Beijing is influenced by natural and human factors, showing large spatial variability. The supply level of mountainous areas with good natural geographical conditions and intact ecological landscape is significantly higher than that of plain areas with reduced vegetation and overexploitation. Residents have a high demand for recreational services in green space landscape and low demand in non-green space landscape. The quantitative balance pattern of supply and demand varies greatly, and most areas show the state of undersupply. The spatial matching pattern of supply and demand varies significantly too, and the mismatch is apparent. Spatial allocation should be more carefully considered than the aggregated supply and demand. Differentiated development strategies such as ecological reshaping, ecological development, restoration, and protection should be implemented for different areas in the future of planning and management in urban green areas. This will optimize and balance the supply-demand matching pattern for recreational services and promote the effective improvement of ecosystem service functions and residents' ecological welfare.

AB  - Mosses are sensitive and precise bioindicators of heavy metals contamination of the environment. They accumulate in their tissues large amounts of these elements than do higher plants. The aim of this study was to present the influence of environmental pollution on quantitative relations of heavy metals and cationic equilibrium in tissues of mosses: Pleurozium schreberi, Hylocomium splendens and Hypnum cupressiforme. Twelve sampling sites were selected in the area of Lower Silesia (Poland), diverse in respect of pollution degree determined for dust fall and contents of metals in dust. The contents of Ca, K, Na, Mg, Al, Mn, Fe, Cu, Pb, Ni, Cd, and Zn have been examined in the mosses. Significant differences in the elements contents of mosses between the examined sites, and between moss species were found. This differentiation affects the cationic equilibrium. It is expressed by weighed sum of square roots of relative cation concentrations. The quantitative relations between contents of elements in mosses depended on species and pollution level. These relations and accumulation of metals in moss tissues is the indicator of environmental pollution, which influences the ecological condition of mosses and their occurrence in the given area. The air contaminated by heavy metals causes stress and the decline of moss populations, and can be of significance for their survival. The results of this type of investigations are of importance for the active protection of mosses and their biotopes.

AB  - Microbial activity has been invoked to explain anomalous oxygen isotope compositions of phosphate mineral deposits as well as fossil biogenic apatite. Results of laboratory experiments on enzyme-mediated reactions of phosphate and microbially mediated degradation of organic matter, an important mechanism for the regeneration of dissolved phosphate in modern porewaters, demonstrate that significant exchange of oxygen isotopes between phosphate and water accompanies the hydrolytic cleavage of organically bound phosphate as well as the metabolism of inorganic orthophosphate. Evaluation of the oxygen isotope systematics of microbially mediated reactions of phosphate suggests that oxygen isotope exchange between phosphate and water mediated by bacteria is governed by equilibrium rather than kinetic factors. Under certain conditions, the microbially mediated exchange appears to result in complete re-equilibration of oxygen isotopes between phosphate and water and in other instances equilibrium exchange may be masked by inheritance of phosphate-oxygen from the organic substrate. Analogous microbial processes in natural sediments may be important in; the release of dissolved phosphate to pore fluids, precipitation of authigenic apatite, and in the diagenetic alteration of phosphorite deposits and biogenic apatite. These results have important implications for paleoclimatological and paleoenvironmental studies in which oxygen isotope ratios of biogenic phosphate are used as paleotemperature indicators, as well as for studies employing phosphate oxygen isotopes as a tracer of P transport and cycling in the environment.

AB  - Strawberry Anthracnose Fruit Rot (AFR) is one of the main limiting factors for strawberry production industry worldwide including Iran. Due to the restrictions associated with fungicides application across strawberry fields, their adverse effects on environment and the possible fungicides resistance development among fungal strains of the pathogen, the use of resistant cultivars is considered the most effective method for the management of this disease. In this study, reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars were evaluated against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, causing strawberry AFR using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. According to the results of this study, the strawberry cultivars showed different reactions to the disease depending on the inoculation of their leaf, fruit, and crown with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions. However, fruit-based assay was a better indicator of AFR disease susceptibility due to nature of AFR disease caused by C. nymphaeae. Overall, 'Blakemore' and 'Kurdistan' cultivars were significantly more resistant compared with others, except 'Aliso', 'Mrak', 'Diamant', 'Yallova', 'New Kurdistan', 'Mac Donance' and 'Ten Beauty', respectively. On the contrary, 'Gaviota' cultivar was significantly the most susceptible than the rest, except 'Camarosa'. The common commercial cultivars grown in Iran including 'Camarosa', 'Paros', 'Pajaro', and 'Queen Eliza' were categorized on the list of susceptible and highly susceptible cultivars in this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the reaction of some commercial strawberry cultivars against C. nymphaeae causing strawberry AFR.

AB  - An experiment with the enrichment of acid organic-rich mountain-meadow soils (Umbric Leptosols) of alpine ecosystems with mineral nutrients has demonstrated that the contents of organic carbon, total nitrogen, and labile organic compounds are stable and tolerant towards long-term (20 years) application of mineral fertilizers. Only the following direct effects are well pronounced: an increase in the content of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus after the application of corresponding fertilizers, as well as a rise in pH as a result of liming. Plants are more sensitive indicators of changes in the conditions of nitrogen nutrition. They are characterized by active absorption of additional nitrogen, and the isotopic composition of nitrogen in them becomes heavier. The degree of these effects depends on the initial nitrogen availability. In addition to these direct effects, changes in the nitrogen status of plants also reflect changes in the transformation of nitrogen-containing compounds in soil and in the nitrogen nutrition of plants taking place due to an increased availability of phosphorus and lower acidity under the most phosphorus-depleted and most acid conditions, respectively. These impacts lead to the mobilization of soil organic nitrogen and are likely to reduce the role of mycorrhiza in plant nitrogen nutrition. As a result, a heavier isotopic composition of nitrogen is formed in some plant species.

AB  - Across broad geographic scales, ecological indicators for fish assemblages should represent causal ecological processes, be sensitive enough to show patterns across the landscape, and reflect underlying biotic or abiotic conditions that influence those patterns. We assessed the responses of commonly applied ecological indicators for lake fish assemblages (mean body size, catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE), and normalized length size spectrum (NLSS) slope) to regional (climate, water chemistry, and watershed stress due to human activities) and local (lake morphometry, water quality, and angling pressure) ecological and anthropogenic variables. The indicators were estimated using fish assemblage catch data acquired via a standardized gillnetting protocol implemented within 693 lakes in Ontario, Canada. To our knowledge, our study is the first size-based or catch-based indicator evaluation to include detailed observations of angling pressure on hundreds of inland lakes. Boosted regression tree models showed that CPUE of large-bodied organisms and NLSS slope best described underlying patterns in the regional and local variables. Models developed with a mix of regional and local variables performed better than models developed with regional or local variables alone. The relative influences of the variables and responses varied among indicators, but in general, ecological variables had greater influence on the indicators than anthropogenic variables. These results emphasize the complex and multiscaled nature of factors and ecological processes affecting body size, habitat-community production, and trophic dynamics in lake fish assemblages.

AB  - Crocetane, an irregular C-20 isoprenoid, in sediments generally associated with gas hydrate settings, is a molecular indicator for the anaerobic oxidation of methane. Green sulfur bacteria (GSB) are the main source for specific aromatic carotenoids (e.g. isorenieratane) in sedimentary environments and are molecular indicators of photic zone euxinia (PZE). The present study comprises a detailed molecular and isotopic study of crocetane and GSB derived carotenoids in Devonian sediments of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) covering a range of thermal maturities. In addition, a series of oils generated from Devonian Source rocks of the basin have been analysed for crocetane. Crocetane was found in ten sediments from the WCSB and in seven Devonian WCSB crude oils. Its abundance was found to increase with thermal maturity, whereas the components derived from C-40 derived carotenoids decrease steadily. We were not able to identify 2, 6, 10, 15, 19-pentamethylicosane (PMI) neither in the Duvemay Formation sediments nor in the WCSB crude oils, consistent with previous findings. The preferred proposed natural product precursor for crocetane is thus GSB derived carotenoids. This is corroborated by their similar structural features and the delta C-13 value of combined crocetane and phytane in these samples. However, contributions from other carotenoids cannot be fully excluded. Crocetane can provide evidence for PZE conditions in highly mature samples and crude oils of Devonian age.

AB  - Zones of nutrient enrichment beneath shrubs, the so called `fertile islands', are the result of a range of interacting physical and biotic concentrating mechanisms. These concentrating mechanisms lead to specific spatial patterns of soil properties across a landscape and it has been suggested that disruption of the normal patterns into more aggregated `fertile islands' might be a useful index of desertification in semi-arid regions. The objective of this paper was to determine whether `fertile islands' are as characteristic a feature of succulent deserts as they are of shrub dominated deserts. Results indicate that, even in a community dominated by succulent species fertile islands develop under extremely arid conditions and that the degree of development is dependent on plant dynamics. Long-lived species showed greater concentration effects. However, the patterns of nutrient accretion in islands are very different to shrub invaded grasslands in North America. In particular nitrogen accretion dominated the `fertile islands' in Namaqualand, and we suggest that these islands are more ephemeral than carbon and phosphorus dominated islands reported for other systems. These more dynamic islands are a consequence of rapid community dynamics since the Namaqualand region is characterised by many short-lived perennials which turnover generations very rapidly in response to environmental conditions. Using the development of `fertile islands' to assess desertification as applied elsewhere might be inappropriate in Namaqualand because of the different patterns of community dynamics underlying the formation and characteristics of these islands.

AB  - San Pedro Martir island is of high biological, ecological, and fishery importance and was declared a biosphere reserve in 2002. This island is the most oceanic in the Gulf of California, and information on its rocky reefs is scarce. The present study aimed to generate the first list of conspicuous invertebrate and fish species based on in situ observations and to examine the community structure of the shallow rocky reefs of the reserve. In addition, we estimated the ecological indicators of richness, abundance, Shannon diversity, and Pielou evenness to evaluate the conservation status of the biosphere reserve. Data were collected annually from 2007 to 2017 through 2,192 underwater SCUBA transects. A total of 35 species of invertebrates and 73 species of fish were recorded. Most of the species are widely distributed along the eastern Pacific. Overall, 64% of the species found in this study are commercially important, and 11 species have been listed as protected. The abundance of commercially important invertebrate species (i.e., the sea cucumber Isostichopus fuscus and the spiny oyster Spondylus limbatus) is decreasing, while commercially important fish species have maintained their abundance with periods of increase. The ecological indicators and the abundance and size of the commercial species indicate that the reserve is in good condition while meeting its conservation objectives.

AB  - The aim of the paper was to present the procedure of building neighborhood resilience to climate threats, embedded in planning (from the strategic to local level) and design process and focused on usage of natural adaptive potential. The presented approach encompasses: (1) the strategic identification of focal areas in terms of climate adaptation needs, (2) comprehensive diagnosis of local ecological vulnerability and natural adaptive potential to build adaptive capacity, and (3) incorporation of natural adaptive potential through an identified set of planning and design tools. For diagnosis and strategic environmental impact assessment, the multicriteria analysis has been elaborated. The described procedure is applied to the City of Warsaw on the strategic level, by elaboration of the ranking of districts in terms of priority to take adaptation actions based on climatic threats, demographic vulnerability, and assessment of Warsaw Green Infrastructure potential. For further analysis at the planning and design stage, the district with the most urgent adaptation needs has been chosen, and within its borders, two neighborhoods (existing and planned one) with diagnosed ecological sensitivity were selected. Both case studies were analyzed in terms of environmental conditions, urban structure, and planning provisions. It enabled identification of existing natural adaptive potential and assessment of its use. As a result, propositions for enhancing neighborhood resilience to climate change were suggested.

AB  - Heat waves, defined as events associating high temperatures with severe drought, are expected to become increasingly recurrent. Research has focused heavily on the impacts of drought and temperature increase on soil functioning and microbial diversity, but little attention has been paid to soil microbial community responses to combined heat-drought stresses. Heat waves, which combine heat and drought stresses, may induce different microbial responses to those observed in studies focusing on heat or drought alone. Microbial recovery strategies to withstand heat-drought conditions, along with patterns of microbial functional redundancy and complex interactions with the soil physical-chemical-biological interface may have marked effects on soil ecosystem functioning, particularly in agroecosystems through the rhizosphere. To better under stand how heat waves affect soil ecosystem functioning, we advocate the development of mechanistic approaches integrating individual to community level and biophysicochemical studies on the indirect effects of combined heat-drought stresses in microbial communities, observed through soil environment parameters in experimental and field studies. The challenge will be to define trait-based functional indicators of the microbial community response to heat waves, particularly the potential interrelatedness between the traits responsible for tolerance to drought and heat.

AB  - Chemical measures combined with biological data (biomarkers) are recommended in monitoring programs of marine environments. In the present research, the use of multiples biogeochemical indicators allowed interrelating different environmental measurements to deepen the knowledge of the quality/status of the intertidal flat from Puerto Rosales (Bahia Blanca estuary, Argentina) subjected to anthropogenic pressure. The sediments from this site presented a eutrophic status and high organic matter concentration with high nutritional value for the benthic community. The TPR/TCH ratio (similar to 10) would evidence the untreated sewage discharge contribution and increments in protein content due to the complexation of nitrogen during phytodetritus accumulation and degradation. Trace metals levels in the fine sediments were lower than those recommended by international guides for uncontaminated sites. In the sediments, except Cu, all metals analyzed were rarely associated with adverse biological effects. Finally, metallothioneins levels in the burrowing crab Neohelice granulata were lower than those found in the literature and significantly higher in females than in males. Even though the different analyses and indices performed indicate that this intertidal flat is in good environmental condition, the wastewater discharge influenced it. Thus, it is advisable to continue with this kind of study by applying multi-combined proxies in this and other impacted tidal flats.

AB  - The Patia region (Cauca, Colombia) is an area that is vulnerable to anthropic interventions and natural phenomena; this condition motivated the realization of this study, which reflects the ecological dynamics of using butterflies as biological indicator organisms. This research evaluated the effects of the cattle ranching matrix on the community of diurnal butterflies (Lepidoptera: Rhopalocera), in two fragments of Patia dry forest, Cauca: Las Martas and La Pachuca. Two capture methods were used: entomological net and van Someren Rydon traps primed with fish and decomposed banana, and established in two transects of 300 m each, for each fragment. Sampling was carried out from September 2014 to February 2015. Between the two fragments were 679 individuals distributed in six families: Nymphalidae (61.12 %), Pieridae (19.00 %), Hesperiidae (13.99 %), Lycaenidae (2.21 %), Papilionidae 2.65 %) and Riodinidae (1.03 %), 14 subfamilies and 81 species. The Jaccard coefficient of 0.43 showed similarity among the diurnal lepidopteran community, which shared 35 species of the total recorded. The sampling efficiency was between 48.38 and 67.9 %, which suggesting continuity in the sampling of the fragments. It is concluded that a strong effect of extensive cattle ranching exists in the community of diurnal Lepidoptera, however, the species that were registered as euritopes and stenotopes may be key to developing conservation plans based on biological corridors.

AB  - Arable soil is a functional unit whose condition is vital to crop production, but also to ecosystems at large owing to the significant role of soil in global nutrient cycles and balances. The soil quality concept recognises the concern for the sustainability of current arable land use practices. It integrates soil chemical, physical and biological properties, and takes account of the interaction of soil with water and air. This paper reviews the soil quality concept and its applications and discusses the importance of the concept for the assessment of Finnish arable soils. Many aspects of the chemical quality of arable soil are already well known in Finland. In contrast, follow-up of the physical and biological soil components, which are increasingly seen as important features of soil quality, is rudimentary. For monitoring of the soil quality at different scales - field, regional, national and global a suitable set of indicators needs to be identified. In this paper particular attention is paid to the potential importance and usefulness of selected biological indicators. It is clear that more basic research is needed to provide scientists and advisors with a solid basis for transmitting reliable information on soil quality. While the soil quality concept has been justifiably criticised, it has clear merits in the integrated handling of the soil entity and in highlighting the environmental aspects of arable soil quality.

AB  - Daphnia magna is a widely adopted biological indicator for studying the environmental toxicity in aquatic ecosystems. Due to the tiny size and appearance similarity of Daphnia most behavioral tracking systems can only record the behavioral movement of a single individual. In this work, a novel behavioral tracking scheme is proposed to track the group movement of Daphnia and record the accurate trajectory of each individual. Individual position, motion estimation and appearance similarity are incorporated to solve the multiple objects tracking problem. Optical flow is utilized to estimate individual motion and identify each individual in occlusions. Normalized cross correlation is employed to measure appearance similarity of Daphnia individuals. According to these feature movement trajectories are assigned to each individual by linear optimization. The main advantage of the proposed method is to segment individual Daphnia from occluded images according to the appearance and motion characters. Consequently, the success rate of tracking under occlusions could be significantly improved. The proposed method was tested on 8 video clips which captured in two different observation conditions. The correct identification ratio reached 94.74% and the average success ratio was 87.68%. The comparison tests proved that our method was superior to a well-known multiple object tracking method in dealing with occlusions. The proposed Daphnia tracking scheme was reliable and could provide accurate movement information for behavioral and environmental studies.

AB  - Despite decades of reduced nutrient inputs, Lake of the Woods, a large, shallow boreal lake on the US-Canadian border, shows little evidence of water quality improvements in the pelagic system. Here we analyzed sediments from 6 sites in the southern basin for diverse biogeochemical (loss-on-ignition, biogenic silica, pigments) and microfossil (diatoms, chrysophytes) remains to reconstruct the environmental history of the lake. Our objectives were to quantify the magnitude and direction of historical trophic change and evaluate reasons for an apparent lack of basin recovery following documented nutrient diversion. Evidence came from fossil indicator profiles and comparisons of these long-term trends with historical land use and monitoring data. Results indicate major changes in algal communities during and following peak nutrient loading in the mid-20th century as well as more recent increases in colonial cyanobacteria and high-nutrient diatomtaxa. Combined, fossil indicators reflect an anthropogenically enriched system that has undergone substantial ecological change, particularly since similar to 1980, due to multiple drivers. Physical changes in lake thermal regime resulting from climate warming may be exacerbating internal phosphorus release from sediments, thereby lowering nitrogen: phosphorus ratios and enhancing cyanobacterial abundance. These drivers of lake condition in the lake may apply to other large shallow lakes that exhibit only limited biological recovery from reduced external nutrient loading.

AB  - The increasing rate of human-induced environmental changes on coastal marine ecosystems has created a demand for effective descriptors, in particular for those suitable for monitoring the status of seagrass meadows. Growing evidence has supported the useful application of biochemical and genetic descriptors such as secondary metabolite synthesis, photosynthetic activity and genetic diversity. In the present study, we have investigated the effectiveness of different descriptors (traditional, biochemical and genetic) in monitoring seagrass meadow conservation status. The Posidonia oceanica meadow of Monterosso al Mare (Ligurian sea, NW Mediterranean) was subjected to the measurement of bed density, leaf biometry, total phenols, soluble protein and photosynthetic pigment content as well as to RAPD marker analysis. This suite of descriptors provided evidence of their effectiveness and convenient application as markers of the conservation status of P. oceanica and/or other seagrasses. Biochemical/genetic descriptors and those obtained by traditional methods depicted a well conserved meadow with seasonal variability and, particularly in summer, indicated a healthier condition in a portion of the bed (station C), which was in agreement with the physical and sedimentological features of the station. Our results support the usefulness of introducing biochemical and genetic approaches to seagrass monitoring programs since they are effective indicators of plant physiological stress and environmental disturbance.

AB  - The creation of protected areas is not always determined by technical and/or environmental criteria, thereby undermining their effectiveness in protecting local biodiversity. The aim of this study was to check the potentiality of the protected area named Monumento Natural Grota do Angico, in the state of Sergipe, for aspects of landscape and to point possible threats, in order to support conservation strategies for maintaining biodiversity in this protected area. A protocol for the evaluation of priority fragments for conservation has been adapted. The indicators were derived from studies carried out on site and a survey of invasive alien plant species conducted in an area of 251 ha. Then, the circularity index was calculated for the Monument. The values obtained by the protocol were considered typical for areas with low risks to conservation. The landscape structure of the MONA Grota do Angico proved to be unsatisfactory for the maintenance of a large species diversity, being small as compared to other areas and elongated, showing a circularity index of only 0.17 (on scale of 0 to 1). However, the preserve protects part of the Sao Francisco River Valley and connects with two local protected areas that are part of an important regional ecological corridor. Some threats found, such as wildfires, deforestation, invasive alien species and cattle, demand monitoring. We conclude that in general the MONA Grota do Angico shows conditions to house considerable biodiversity, since threats are monitored and managed.

AB  - The EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) is structured into eleven descriptors of good environmental status (GES). For each descriptor the current status of the marine environment should be assessed against its GES using ecosystem criteria and indicators. Within Descriptor 3 (D3) the MSFD addresses the status of exploited fish stocks according to three criteria (exploitation rate, stock size and size structure). This study performed an MSFD-compliant assessment of exploited fish stocks in the North Sea by aggregating data from analytical stock assessments and scientific research surveys to calculate indicator metrics for each criterion within each stock time-series. A stock achieved GES, when each indicator for each criterion had a good status. Of 43 assessed fish stock suggested by the EU Data Collection Framework, 63% (27) achieved GES. Though the MSFD explicitly demands that all exploited fish stocks achieve GES, this demand may be challenged by reality, because the status of exploited stocks depends not only on fishing impacts, but also on environmental conditions and ecological interactions. Therefore an alternative approach based on binomial distributions is presented to define limits for GES at the descriptor level. The implications and pitfalls of the applied assessment methods are discussed.

AB  - Introduction: According to the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center and the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center, the number of soldiers who have sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI) has risen dramatically over the past decade. Studies have shown that brain damage can be exacerbated if blood loss occurs (often occurring in polytrauma). As blood supply is critical for brain function and survival, TBI patients must be properly resuscitated to maintain blood volume, blood pressure, and cerebral perfusion. Recent studies have suggested that blood loss can damage the vascular endothelium and enhance blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Brain endothelial cells and the tight junctions between them are key structural components of the BBB. As the BBB is critical for isolating the brain from potential pathogens and for regulating the influx of molecules into the brain, evaluation of resuscitation fluids for their efficacy to improve BBB function has clinical relevance. Although whole blood and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) contain the essential coagulation factors, ions, and other factors, the transport and storage of these products in remote, austere environments can be challenging. The use of spray-dried plasma (SDP) has several advantages including storage at ambient temperature, can be readily reconstituted before use, and infectious materials can be inactivated during the drying process. In this study, we compared FFP and SDP for their effects on blood pressure, cerebral blood flow, BBB integrity, and markers of endothelial cells and tight junction proteins, in TBI animals with blood loss. Materials and methods: All procedures were reviewed and approved by the UTHealth animal welfare committee. Sprague Dawley rats received controlled cortical impact brain injury followed by removal of 25% blood volume. Animals were resuscitated 40 minutes later with either FFP or concentrated SDP (Resusix) Heart rate and blood pressure were monitored continuously using catheters implanted into the femoral artery. Cerebral perfusion was assessed using a scanning laser Doppler device. Twenty-four hours after the injury and resuscitation with either FFP or SDP, BBB integrity were monitored by measuring the amount of Evans Blue dye in the injured brain following its intravenous administration. As this dye is excluded from the uninjured brain, its presence in the injured brain is an indicator of BBB breakdown. In addition, von Willebrand Factor immunohistochemistry was used to examine endothelial cell loss, whereas claudin-5 immunohistochemistry was used to assess the loss of tight junctions, in FFP- and SDP-resuscitated TBI animals. Results: Our results show that post-TBI resuscitation with FFP and SDP had similar influences on cardiovascular physiology and cerebral perfusion. Resuscitation with SDP after TBI was found to decrease BBB permeability as indicated by reduced Evans Blue dye extravasation, and increased levels of von Willebrand Factor and claudin-5, as compared to resuscitation with FFP. Conclusions: These preclinical results show that resuscitation with SDP may be superior to FFP, and support the further evaluation of this product as a resuscitation fluid for polytrauma patients with TBI.

AB  - Amongst the existing forest types in Europe, the specific biological function of water is nowhere more distinctive than in the lowland forest ecosystems. Consequently no existing forest types are more shaped by historic hydrologic conditions, altered by manmade deviations from the natural water regime and vulnerable to consequences of global warming. The lowermost parts of the lowland forests, the wetlands, present the transitional zones between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems i.e. ponds, lakes, streams and rivers. Nowadays, due to excessive urbanization and the spread of agriculture, the total area of lowland forests and wetlands has been significantly reduced. One of the largest complexes of alluvial floodplain wetlands and lowland forests in Europe are situated in the South-East Europe, in the Sava and Drava River basins, tributaries to the Danube River The Sava River is a unique example of a river where the floodplains are still intact, supporting both flood alleviation and biodiversity. Continental lowland forests in Croatia cover an area of more than 200.000 ha with a significant role in forestry production, flood reduction, recharging groundwater reserves, as well as filtering pollutants. The natural forest vegetation consists of mainly hardwood tree species such as the common oak (Quercus robur L.), field ash (Fraxinus excelsior Vahl.), common hornbeam (Carpinus betulus L.) and softwood species such as black alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Geartn.), poplars (Populus sp.) and willows (Salix sp.). For the biological diversity of lowland forests and attached wetlands is strongly important specific combination of hydrology and soils. The development of these forests in history was determined by regular seasonal alternations of groundwater tables (hydro period) and periodic flooding. This paper presents the possibilities for the re-establishment of the water regime of lowland forests as one option to reduce the impact of climate change in the future. To reduce negative impacts of anthropogenic alternations in the groundwater regime from the past and to attenuate slow down future very possible prolongation of droughts and water scarcity in the lowlands, various forest managerial and engineering practices could be considered. Basically, there are potentially two main contrasted measures of soil water balance manipulation: drainage of soils (through drainage ditches and channels) which contribute to decreasing the groundwater tables and forest management i.e. (tendering and thinning) which contribute to increased soil water content and increase in the groundwater level. Through these water table management practices, the amount of soil water required for the survival of lowland forests could be maintained to some degree to attenuate the negative hydrologic trends and natural hazards such as droughts. The comprehensive methodological review of activities that must precede such reconstruction activities are presented. As the initial segment all the major components of floodplain ecosystems - the morphology of the terrain, hydrography, soils stratigraphy, vegetation and anthropogenic influences - should be assessed. As a next step methodological options towards how to obtain the knowledge of the natural water regime prior anthropogenic hydrotechnical activities which caused the creation of the ecosystem in its current form are presented. For this purpose the morphology of hydromorphic soils i.e. relict indicators of natural water regime in lowland habitats are assessed.
   The next step includes the spatial determination of critical areas orhot spots, threatened by excessive falls in the groundwater level on which specific measures can be applied to return to natural water regime conditions (i.e. water retention in dry riverbeds).

AB  - Alister Hardy conceived the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) survey in the 1920s as a means of mapping near-surface plankton in space and time, interpreting the changing fortunes of the fisheries and relating plankton changes to hydrometeorology and climatic change. The seed he planted has grown to become the most extensive long-term survey of marine organisms in the world and the breadth of his vision becomes ever more apparent. The survey has now run for over 70 years and its value increases with every passing decade. Operating from 'ships of opportunity' the machines used are robust, reliable and easy to handle. Wherever possible, all the sampling and analytical methods have not been changed to maintain the consistency of the time series. Computerisation and the development of new statistical approaches have increased our ability to handle the large quantities of information generated and enhance the sensitivity of the data analyses. This overview, based on almost 900 papers, recounts the various phases in the history of the survey. It starts with the Indicator Survey (1921-1934), the deployment of the first CPR on the Discovery Expedition (1924-1927) and the early CPR survey in the North Sea (1931-1939). The survey reopened in 1946 after the Second World War and expanded across the North Atlantic to North America from 1959. Taxonomic studies were initiated and an emphasis was placed on patterns of distribution, which were seen to reflect the varying oceanographic conditions. The years 1968-1976 saw further expansion with operations even in the American Great Lakes, publication of a Plankton Atlas and initial evidence for a downward trend in plankton biomass. At about this time electronic instrumentation was attached to CPRs to make additional measurements and work was started on the development of a new generation of undulating Continuous Plankton and Environmental Recorders (CPERs). In 1976 the survey moved to Plymouth. Scientific priorities in the UK changed in the subsequent decade and funding became more difficult to secure even though some of the CPR papers being published at the time are now regarded as classics in plankton ecology. In 1988 the UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) decided to close the survey. An international rescue operation led to the creation of the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science (SAHFOS) in 1990, which has continued with consortium funding from a number of countries, and from 1999 again included NERC. The scientific rationale of the survey has gained credibility as concern over climate change and other anthropogenic effects has grown and as the key role that plankton plays as an indicator of large-scale environmental conditions becomes ever more apparent. Recently, the survey became an integral component of the Global Ocean Observation System (GOOS) and expanded into the North Pacific. It plays a complementary role in many large international and multidisciplinary projects and is providing inspiration, advice and support to daughter surveys elsewhere in the world. At the start of a new millennium, Hardy's vision from the 1920s is a powerful driving force not just in international biological oceanography, but in global environmental science.

AB  - The release of contaminants as herbicides, fungicides and insecticides into the environment has been listed as one of the six major contributors to the global decline of reptiles. Although reptiles may face severe risk from contaminants due to their ecology and physiology, they are currently less studied than other vertebrate groups. In the present work, we investigated if and how different types of field treatment (conventional and organic) affected the health status of Italian wall lizard (Podarcis siculus) individuals in central Italy. We chose a multi-biomarker approach that evaluated the biological responses of lizards to the treatment by means of AChE activity in the nervous system, biotransformation enzymes activities and oxidative stress in the liver, micronuclei frequency measured in the erythrocytes, and rate of intestinal parasitic infection. Our findings showed evidence of effects of treatment in conventional areas and between sexes with significant oxidative stress due to hydroxyl radicals, that caused DNA damage. No difference of intestinal parasite infections was found among treatments. Podarcis siculus seems to be a good bioindicator in ecotoxicological studies and potentially in risk assessment of pesticides, although further analyses in laboratory and in the field are needed to achieve more accurate quantification of specific pesticide effects in relation to known exposure history and to understand if other mechanisms were involved in the toxicity and detoxification process of pesticides for this species.

AB  - Global environmental changes can happen quickly or over extended periods and have compounding effects. Indigenous communities experience environmental changes that can lead to a decline in quality of life, illness or disease, and unwelcome cultural adaptations that extend to future generations. Due to limited resources and political marginalization, members of these communities may not be able to respond to or prevent these conditions. Cultural connections to the land and community, along with limited resources, impact Indigenous peoples' willingness and ability to relocate to different geographic locations experiencing less damaging ecological changes or environmental risk. In this article, we respond to the Special Issue prompt probing "[m]ethods in which Indigenous communities engage within their environment and on the land to conduct research". We begin by describing environmental change, followed by a scoping review of Photovoice studies focused on environmental issues. Environmental changes affecting Indigenous groups are discussed, including a case study and a discussion of the ways that Photovoice can support and honor Indigenous peoples' connection to the natural environment. This article is not intended to be an exhaustive review, but rather seeks to understand how Photovoice is being used to respond to and document environmental change, and how such visual methodologies can be used in Indigenous communities.

AB  - Headwater streams drain large proportions of landscapes and represent a large proportion of stream habitat. Understanding their ecology requires more comparative data from the smallest streams. We describe dynamics of benthic organic material (BOM) and invertebrate assemblages in an order-2 Australian tropical stream and compare samples from orders-1 and 2 sites. Litterfall and, especially, stream discharge determined BOM standing stock. Most material was in the > 1 mm fraction, pools stored more than riffles, and order-1 sites more than order-2. BOM increased in the dry season but was depleted by wet-season spates. Retention was greater in years without major spates, when riffle-pool stream sections were largely ecologically isolated. Invertebrate richness was greater in riffles than pools and in order-2 than order-1 sites, with overlap in composition. Current velocity was the primary variable determining distributions in order-2 sites, with particulate organic matter (63-250 mu m) the main variable in order-1 sites. However, explanatory relationships were weak because of unusually benign conditions during the sampling period. We need more globally comprehensive spatially explicit assessment of the ecosystem dynamics of headwater streams to predict effects of environmental change. Assessments over extended periods are necessary to capture the variability of even apparently predictable systems.

AB  - Birds as a great and valuable group of vertebrates constitute a part of the world's ecosystems. Francolin F. francolinus belongs to the poultry family, and like other members of the family, it is hunted by humans because of the beauty and tender meat, although it is a protected bird. Jazinak corridor, with an area of about 130,000 hectares, is located in the southeastern part of Zabola city in the north of Sistan and Baluchestan province. The drought crises of Sistan in recent years have transformed the environmental conditions by changing the ecological indicators, and lack of food has reduced the bird's desire to mate. The aim of this study was to examine the threatening and destructing factors associated with the habitat of francolin in Sistan region-Jazinak corridor. The research method was analytically and descriptively aided by field observations, and it was conducted using satellite images, questionnaires, and climatic parameters. The obtained results show that the drought has made a devastating strike on the population of this bird by destroying the farming, agriculture, and shrub lands which where used to be the actual environment, refuge, and the place of reproduction for it. In fact, the biggest impact of drought on francolin's population is the destruction of its habitat. Hence, the remaining population of the francolin species requires a strong support.

Landscape pattern metrics were estimated in order to reveal the change in habitats and present the properties of the landscape. 30 pattern indicators on class and pattern levels, which are important to show human-environment interaction, were analyzed in order to indicate the features of the landscape such as area, side, shape and dispersion. To this end, LANDSAT TM/7-ETM/8-OLI satellite images of 1987 and 2013 were classified for laying the foundations of the analysis. Analyses showed that between 1987 and 2013, complicated shape features, increase in edge habitats, de-growth in core areas and eventually fragmentation in landscape have been dominant. Heterogenic structure in landscape has increased. This points not to the self-functioning of the landscape, but to the domination of human intervention over the landscape. Particularly, due to urban growth and sprawl, fragmentation, isolation and habitat loss in croplands have increased. This study sets forth the usefulness of remote sensing, GIS and landscape metrics in understanding how urban dynamics and ecosystems change in developing urban politics.

AB  - Aquatic insects are ecological indicators of human disturbance and currently there is the tendency to use the functional approach as a potential tool to evaluate water quality. Insects can change the food acquisition mode and the type according to environmental conditions. This study aims to evaluate the influence of the agricultural and mining impacts upon the diversity and dominance of aquatic insect feeding functional groups and trophic guilds found upstream in the Chinchina River (Caldas, Colombia). Two localities were selected, one with mining and one with agriculture activities, in each locality we evaluated a reference and an impacted creek. A total of 8239 individuals were collected using a Surber net; these are grouped into eight orders, 36 families and 71 morphospecies ((C) over capn = 100%). The intestinal content of the specimens whom belong to the nine most abundant genera of aquatic insects was analyzed and classified as: shredders, collectors, predators, scrapers, and filterers. No changes were noted regards to the diet between impacted and reference areas, possibly due to resource availability. Agricultural activity presented the strongest negative effect on the diversity of the group. This result may be linked to the complete loss of riparian vegetation due the immediate proximity of the crops to the studied streams, and to the use of agrochemicals.

AB  - Models provide useful insights into conservation and resource management issues and solutions. Their use to date has highlighted conditions under which no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) may help us to achieve the goals of ecosystem-based management by reducing pressures, and where they might fail to achieve desired goals. For example, static reserve designs are unlikely to achieve desired objectives when applied to mobile species or when compromised by climate-related ecosystem restructuring and range shifts. Modelling tools allow planners to explore a range of options, such as basing MPAs on the presence of dynamic oceanic features, and to evaluate the potential future impacts of alternative interventions compared with 'no-action' counterfactuals, under a range of environmental and development scenarios. The modelling environment allows the analyst to test if indicators and management strategies are robust to uncertainties in how the ecosystem (and the broader human-ecosystem combination) operates, including the direct and indirect ecological effects of protection. Moreover, modelling results can be presented at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and relative to ecological, economic and social objectives. This helps to reveal potential 'surprises', such as regime shifts, trophic cascades and bottlenecks in human responses. Using illustrative examples, this paper briefly covers the history of the use of simulation models for evaluating MPA options, and discusses their utility and limitations for informing protected area management in the marine realm.

AB  - The paper explores the role of natural resource accounting and calculations as tools for inducing movement towards ecologically sound policy making. We draw from the theoretical debates in social studies of science and technology (STS) to understand how calculations gain their power in real-world decision-making. Through in-depth case analysis of a local energy production decision in Finland, we study how and under what conditions calculative methods related to environmental valuation affect the rationalities applied in policy decisions. On the basis of our analysis, we claim that new calculative rationalities do not become significant through changing ways of thinking alone. There is a need for shift of calculative framing. This shift requires active promotion by powerful actors and furthermore, new framings need to become embedded in the rules of the game of decision making. Our analysis suggests that the methods of STS can provide a valuable tool for economists' creation of richer understanding of the dynamics between calculative rationalities and the institutions of decision-making. In-depth case analysis of decision making involving the use of natural resources brings out the multitude of ways in which calculations can take part in or be excluded from the making of natural resource policy.

AB  - Hong Kong's coastal waters afford a marginal environment for coral reef growth, with high seasonal and short-term variability in water temperatures (ranging from < 14 degrees C in winter to 31 degrees C in summer), and low summer salinity (as low as 15 psu) due to runoff associated with the Asian wet monsoon season and the Pearl River Delta. Yet Hong Kong hosts 84 reef-building coral species in 28 genera of 12 families of the Scleractinia, distributed in 5 broad communities with strong geographic and environmental affinities and key indicator species. Coral communities farthest from the influence of the Pearl River Delta have relatively high sea bed coverage and species diversity (30 to 50% coverage, and > 30 spp. per site), and also host some large, old corals. X-radiographs of a core of one massive Porites colony confirms similar to 200 yr of growth, with 2 short-term periods of mortality, hidden in the skeleton by overgrowth. Very low linear extension rates (< 4 mm yr(-1)) in this coral and 2 others are anomalous for Porites corals and are indicative of the high-stress environment. Low growth rates suggest that other Hong Kong corals, despite the harsh environmental conditions, may also live for centuries, contributing to the development of 'incipient reefs'.

AB  - The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) has, as its ultimate aim, a reduction in the concentrations of hazardous substances in the marine environment, i.e. 'background' values. Hence, the determination of natural background levels of heavy metals, to distinguish between natural element concentrations and anthropogenically-influenced concentrations, is highly relevant. Some studies have shown the convenience in the derivation of local background levels, especially if they are necessary for environmental assessment. Nevertheless, although such studies exist for sediments, there are only a few previous investigations on metal background values in sea water. Likewise, there is not any standard procedure to determine such levels in waters, nor general agreement on the statistical methodologies to be applied. In this contribution, background levels of heavy metals (As, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn), in estuarine and coastal waters within the Basque Country (northern Spain), according to ranges in salinity, are estimated using statistical tools. Ni and Pb have been considered elsewhere (2455/2001/EC) as priority substances under the WFD. Hence, this approach can assist further in the determination of water reference conditions, to assess chemical and physico-chemical status in other European countries; this, affects, ultimately, the ecological status, as defined within the WFD.

AB  - Explosive blasting to construct boat channels across reef platforms is widespread in the Pacific Islands. This study describes the first ecological impact assessment of this form of development, examining effects on intertidal molluscs, crustaceans and algae, as well as physical characteristics of the substratum. There were some increases and some decreases in the species richness of mobile invertebrates and sessile organisms, abundance of mobile invertebrates, and cover of sessile organisms, depending on the channel examined. That is, although we could detect effects we could not detect general effects, either in terms of the magnitude or the direction of the response. The 18 significant effects detected on organisms were almost equally divided between increases and decreases at channel sites compared to controls. The effects that did arise tended to be localised (less than 20 m from channel) and in most cases were small in magnitude, compared to the natural site to site variation along the reef platform. We suggest that the types of effects observed relate to the individual hydrological and physical habitat conditions at each channel site, as well as the type or age of channels, but a more extensive survey is needed to test this. In conclusion, channels do appear to have long-term ecological effects on intertidal organisms, but their magnitude and spatial extent suggest that this alone is not a major environmental problem on the scale of whole atolls.

AB  - The present study originated with the expansion of the boardwalk within the urban and port area of Manzanillo, Mexico. Prior to civil works related to the placement of tetrapods, surveys of potential sites for the relocation of benthic organisms in alternative areas were carried out.
   Based on indicators of the physical-chemical environment and biotic factors, nine areas with potential for relocation were evaluated. The areas of greatest potential were associated with environments located away from the influence of the port environment.
   A total of 13,559 benthic organisms belonging to 68 species associated with three main substratum types (rocky, sandy, and mixed) were collected. There were no differences in the ecological indices between the three substrata.
   The proximity of the collection area to the influence of port traffic and sources of pollution associated with the physical environment could be an important factor that affects ecological indices and the reduction in the abundance of some protected species and species of commercial interest.
   The success of collection and relocation processes depends on minimizing possible errors, especially during transportation, when overcrowding, handling, and damage resulting from variable physico-chemical conditions should be avoided.
   Through a scheme of actions based on ecological principles, management actions, and civil engineering technology, it was possible to carry out mitigation, conservation, and habitat improvement actions in coastal marine environments exposed to anthropogenic impacts.

AB  - The occurrence of microplastics (MPs) as emerging contaminants in the environment may cause changes in water or sediment characteristics, and further affect their biogeochemical cycles. Thus, insights into the interactions between dissolved organic matter (DOM) and MPs are essential for the assessment of environmental impacts of MPs in ecosystems. Integrating spectroscopic methods with chemometric analyses, this work explored the chemical and microstructural changes of DOM-MP complex to reveal the mechanism of DOM-MP interaction at a molecular level. MPs were found to interact with the aromatic structure of DOM via pi-pi conjugation, then be entrapped in the DOM polymers by the carboxyl groups and C=O bonds, constituting a highly conjugated co-polymer with increased electron density. This induced the fluorescence intensity increase in DOM. The interaction affinity of DOM-MP was highly dependent on the MP size and solution pH. This work offers a new insight into the impact of MP discharge on environment and may provide an analytical framework for evaluating MP hetero-aggregation and the roles of MPs in the transportation of other contaminants. Furthermore, the integrated methods used in this work exhibit potential applications in exploring the fragmentation processes of MPs and formation of secondary MPs under natural conditions.

AB  - The proprietary concept is presented of assimilative capacity assessment of aquatic ecosystems, which are pollution recipients from both point and diffuse sources. The assimilative capacity may serve as a basis for determining the maximum ecologically permissible pollutant loads. Existing methods of setting the conditions of pollutant discharge into surface water recipients are predominantly based on pollutant limit values in wastewater. These are established on the basis of technological capabilities. Such an approach, however, does not ensure the ecological safety of surface waters as it does not take into account the ecological functioning mechanisms of separate aquatic ecosystems. Considering the above, the assimilative capacity of surface waters was defined as the amount of pollution that might be accumulated, transformed in biochemical processes and discharged to the outside of the ecosystem without disturbing its ecological equilibrium. Examples of assimilative capacity calculations for selected marine areas ofthe Baltic Sea were presented in terms of various anthropogenic pollutants, e.g. trace metals, benzopyrene, polychlorinated biphenyls and nutrients. Analysis of calculation results revealed that assimilative capacity of the Baltic Sea in its various areas depended on local hydromorphological and hydrobiological properties and was getting exhausted due to the loads of copper and lead compounds as well as polychlorinated biphenyls. In contrast, there are still significant ecological reserves present in the individual areas of the Sea with respect to the loads of zinc, cadmium, mercury and mineral nutrients.

AB  - In the dynamic environments targeted for marine renewable energy extraction, such as tidal channels, the natural distribution of fish and behavioural impacts of marine renewable energy installations (MREIs) are poorly understood. This study builds on recent methodological developments to reveal the behaviour of fish schools using data collected by a seabed-mounted echosounder deployed in extreme tidal flows and in the wake of a MREI (composed of the foundation of a full-scale tidal stream energy turbine). The results show a significant change (p < 0.001) in the vertical distribution of fish schools in the vicinity of a MREI compared to a nearby control location representative of the natural conditions. The MREI is associated with an overall increased rate of fish school observations (+ 74%), particularly at night (+ 163%) and in the MREI wake flow (+ 378%), related to the disruption of natural diurnal behavioural patterns in school characteristics (size, relative density, and distance from seabed). These results indicate an attraction effect of the MREI, and show that the aggregation and vertical distribution of fish in the modified flow conditions is dependent on tidal phase with evidence of avoidance of the MREI depth range during peak flow velocities. The behavioural responses observed in this study provide new information relevant to the environmental impact assessment of marine renewable energy developments and highlight priorities for further research.

AB  - The incorporation of metabolic carbon (C-m) into shells of mollusks has been used as an indicator of animal condition and availability of food resources in estuarine and freshwater settings. This study examines C-m in Bathymodiolus childressi, a marine cold seep mussel dependent on methanotrophic symbionts. As seeps develop, nature, and go quiescent, methane supply will vary and affect the amount of metabolic carbon deposited into the growing shell. B. childressi (n = 136) were live-collected from two seep sites over a 17 year period in the Northern Gulf of Mexico to investigate whether changes in C-m were detectable between sites and across years. Significant differences in C-m were observed between mussel populations at Brine Pool (15.4 +/- 0.4%) and Bush Hill (10.3 +/- 0.3%). C-m also changed significantly within each site across year (Bush Hill 1991: 12.2 +/- 0.5%, 1992: 17.3 +/- 0.8%) and decadal time scales (Brine Pool 1989: 15.5 +/- 0.7%, 2006: 19.5 +/- 0.7%). These findings agree with previous studies that found mussel condition was higher at Brine Pool and correlate well with a trophic mixing model that indicated significantly higher methane source utilization at the Brine Pool (65 +/- 1.1%) than at Bush Hill (49 +/- 1.6%). Further development of this method should allow for assessment of C-m in shell assemblages as an indicator of historical resource availability at both active and former cold seep sites.

KW  - Robustness
AB  - Over the past decades, the Asia-Pacific Rim has exhibited an unprecedented high degree of economic and geographic dynamics. Clearly, cities in this region display heterogeneity in terms of economic performance, technological innovativeness, environmental conditions, and cultural recognition and interaction. It is, therefore, interesting to develop an efficiency ranking of the multi-dimensional performance of these large cities so as to identify 'super cities'. The first aim of this paper is now to undertake a multi-faceted performance ranking of large cities in the Asia-Pacific region using a data envelopment analysis (DEA). However, there appears to be a wide variety of DEAs in the recent literature. And therefore, a second aim of the present paper is to perform a sensitivity analysis on the type of DEA employed, so as to test the robustness of the base ranking obtained from a standard DEA. A third aim of the paper is related to the question how much the ranking obtained by a DEA is influenced by the internal characteristics of the underlying data system. This calls for a sensitivity analysis of the precision or nature of the data used in the DEA. A fourth aim of the paper is to present a performance improvement projection based on the original DEA model and our new projection model for inefficient cities. These four aims of the research will be empirically addressed by a comprehensive data set on 7 quantitative main indicators regarding economic performance, technological innovativeness, environmental conditions, and cultural recognition and interaction for 13 Asia-Pacific super cities.

AB  - The stability of CuO nanoparticles (NPs) is expected to play a key role in the environmental risk assessment of nanotoxicity in aquatic systems. In this study, the effect of alginate (model polysaccharides) on the stability of CuO NPs in various environmentally relevant ionic strength conditions was investigated by using time-resolved dynamic light scattering. Significant aggregation of CuO NPs was observed in the presence of both monovalent and divalent cations. The critical coagulation concentrations (CCC) were 54.5 and 2.9 mM for NaNO3 and Ca(NO3)(2), respectively. The presence of alginate slowed nano-CuO aggregation rates over the entire NaNO3 concentration range due to the combined electrostatic and steric effect. High concentrations of Ca2+ (> 6 mM) resulted in stronger adsorption of alginate onto CuO NPs; however, enhanced aggregation of CuO NPs occurred simultaneously under the same conditions. Spectroscopic analysis revealed that the bridging interaction of alginate with Ca2+ might be an important mechanism for the enhanced aggregation. Furthermore, significant coagulation of the alginate molecules was observed in solutions of high Ca2+ concentrations, indicating a hetero-aggregation mechanism between the alginate-covered CuO NPs and the unabsorbed alginate. These results suggested a different aggregation mechanism of NPs might co-exist in aqueous systems enriched with natural organic matter, which should be taken into consideration in future studies.

AB  - Effective environmental assessment and management requires quantifiable biodiversity targets. Biodiversity benchmarks define these targets by focusing on specific biodiversity metrics, such as species richness. However, setting fixed targets can be challenging because many biodiversity metrics are highly variable, both spatially and temporally. We present a multivariate, hierarchical Bayesian method to estimate biodiversity benchmarks based on the species richness and cover of native terrestrial vegetation growth forms. This approach uses existing data to quantify the empirical distributions of species richness and cover within growth forms, and we use the upper quantiles of these distributions to estimate contemporary, "best-on-offer" biodiversity benchmarks. Importantly, we allow benchmarks to differ among vegetation types, regions, and seasons, and with changes in recent rainfall. We apply our method to data collected over 30 yr at similar to 35,000 floristic plots in southeastern Australia. Our estimated benchmarks were broadly consistent with existing expert-elicited benchmarks, available for a small subset of vegetation types. However, in comparison with expert-elicited benchmarks, our data-driven approach is transparent, repeatable, and updatable; accommodates important spatial and temporal variation; aligns modeled benchmarks directly with field data and the concept of best-on-offer benchmarks; and, where many benchmarks are required, is likely to be more efficient. Our approach is general and could be used broadly to estimate biodiversity targets from existing data in highly variable environments, which is especially relevant given rapid changes in global environmental conditions.

AB  - The goal of this article was to generate a method of regional scale ecological risk assessment using an adaptation Relative Risk Model (RRM). As a case study we performed a quantitative, regional risk assessment of an invasive species, the European green crab (Carcinus maenas) at Cherry Point, Washington, USA. The conceptual model was modified from the RRM and incorporates the structure of the hierarchical patch dynamic paradigm. The ranks and filters were integrated to determine the relative contribution of each source of C. maenas to risk as well as the risk to selected biological endpoints, habitats and sub-regions for two source scenarios: (1) current conditions (2004) and (2) future conditions during an El Nino year. The results suggest that the habitat and endpoint with the greatest risk are the eelgrass habitat and the juvenile Dungeness crab, respectively. The Cherry Point subregion was identified as the area having the most risk in the first source scenario, while the Lummi Bay sub-region is most at risk during an El Nino event. The risk of impacts is substantially higher for all endpoints, habitats and sub-regions when El Nino-driven current dispersal is considered. The methodology applied in this case study can be modified and applied to determine the risk of introduction and impacts of other invasive species to the Strait of Georgia, Puget Sound, and other coastal areas.

AB  - The discovery of a tusk and a rib of a straight-tusked elephant within layer 13 II-2c3 of the famous Lower Palaeolithic archaeological site Schoningen (district Helmstedt, Lower-Saxony, Germany) provided the reason for studying the climatic and ecological conditions of this part of the Middle Pleistocene Reinsdorf sequence in high resolution in relation to new chronometric data. Sediment, pollen, aquatic microfossil (diatoms, ostracods, gyrogonites of charophytes) and micro mammalian analyses provide evidence for a strong environmental change and landscape opening following the post-temperate boreal forest phase of the Reinsdorf Interglacial. Palynological and palaeontological evidence from this horizon suggest increasing dryness and seasonality. The high proportions of non-arboreal pollen including Poaceae as well as a major decrease of thermophile tree taxa indicate the development of zonal steppe environments. The assemblage of small mammal remains includes indicators of temperate as well as cold climatic conditions. A bone tool together with flint artefacts clearly show the presence of hominins in this context. Based on palaeoecological evidence and new luminescence dating, previous correlations of the Reinsdorf sequence to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 9 and thus of the interglacial sediments to MIS 9e are confirmed and the onset of the first post-interglacial steppe phase represented by layer 13 II-2c3 to MIS 9d is proposed.

AB  - Prior studies exploring the quantitative relationship between landscape structure metrics and the ecological condition of receiving waters have used a variety of sampling units (e.g., a watershed, or a buffer around a sampling station) at a variety of spatial scales to generate landscape metrics resulting in little consensus on which scales best describe land-water relationships. Additionally, the majority of these studies have focused on freshwater systems and it is not clear whether results are transferable to estuarine and marine systems. We examined how sampling unit scale controls the relationship between landscape structure and sediment metal concentrations, in small estuarine systems in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. We varied the spatial extent of the contributing watersheds used to calculate landscape structure and assessed linear relationships between estuarine sediment metal concentrations and the total area of developed and agricultural lands at each scale. Area of developed lands was consistently related to sediment metals while total agricultural land was not. Developed land had strongest associations with lead and copper; weakest with arsenic and chromium; and moderate associations with cadmium, mercury, and zinc. Local (i.e., less than 15-20 km from a sampling station) land uses have a greater impact than more distant land uses on the amount of toxic metals reaching estuarine sediments.

AB  - The general environmental conditions of Santa Giusta Lagoon, an important Sardinian coastal lagoon often affected by dystrophic crises, are examined. The study considers both the monitoring data collected over the past ten years on the relevant water quality parameters and the preliminary results on the structure and heavy metal content of the surface sediments of the lagoon. These data emphasised its elevated trophic level, due to the excessive presence of plant nutrients in water, and a relative low level of heavy metal contamination. At the moment, the eutrophy - brought about the urban and industrial wastes from Oristano and Santa Giusta can be considered the main environmental issue of the lagoon.

AB  - The landscape geoecology aims at a systemic and integrated comprehension of physical-natural and anthropic components. It cooperates to identify and map landscape units, as well as to define indicators that establish their geoecological diagnosis mitigating measurements for preservation and use. The objective is to determine the state and geoecological diagnosis of landscapes of the Formoso River Watershed, located in the municipality of Bonito/MS, Brazil. The methodology consists of four stages: (i) the organization to define the study area and worked themes; (ii) the inventory and analysis characterizing the rocks, soils, relief, and anthropic use to define the landscape units; (iii) the diagnosis to establish the condition and geoecological diagnosis of landscapes; and (iv) the prognosis and proposals to define recommendations, envisioning trend, and desired scenarios for the watershed. The delimitation, classification, and mapping of landscape units, on a scale of 1:100,000, allow to identify the existing landscape heterogeneity. Thus, the condition and geoecological diagnosis are determined highlighting that extensive areas of "Altered Landscapes" potentialize the current watershed environmental problems: a fact that contributes to define future development scenarios, as well as recommendations to ensure a harmonious use to preserve the landscapes. The present work aims to contribute to the advancement of landscape geoecology and the study of tropical karst landscapes in a theoretical- methodological and practical way. Moreover, it is essential to support public power decision making, and assist researchers, institutions in charge of conservation and tourism to search solutions to watershed current and future environmental problems.

AB  - Pierce-sucking insects, such as plant bugs or stink bugs, cause damage in cotton fields worldwide. A novel genetically engineered (GE) cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) is protected against hemipteran pests and thrips by producing the modifiedBacillus thuringiensis(Bt) mCry51Aa2 protein. Herbivores that consume insect-protected GE crops, and their natural enemies, can be exposed to plant-produced insecticidal proteins. We investigated tritrophic interactions to evaluate the potential impact of the novelBtcotton on a non-target herbivore, the spider miteTetranychus urticae, and on a generalist predator, the pirate bugOrius majusculus. Pirate bugs belong to the same insect order as the target pests and might thus be adversely affected by mCry51Aa2. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays showed that levels of mCry51Aa2 inT. urticaewere one order of magnitude, and those inO. majusculuswere three orders of magnitude lower than inBtcotton leaves.O. majusculusnymphs fed with spider mites collected fromBtcotton had lower survival, increased developmental time, and reduced fecundity compared to nymphs fed spider mites from non-Btnear-isogenic cotton. BecauseBtcotton did not affect the survival and growth of the spider mites, we conclude that indirect prey-quality mediated effects of theBtcotton on the predatory bugs are unlikely and thatO. majusculusare directly affected by theBtprotein. Follow-up studies are indicated to assess whether the effects observed under worst-case conditions are mitigated under more realistic exposure conditions where alternative prey with lowBtprotein levels is available.

AB  - Guidelines of ecological risk assessment (ERA) used worldwide, based on S-shaped threshold dose-response curve, fail to consider hormesis, a biphasic dose-response model represented as a J-shaped or an inverted U-shaped curve, that occurs in real-life environment. Now that humans are routinely exposed to chemicals below the threshold where hormetic stimulation prevails, it is noteworthy that over-strictness about chemical control also means a waste of limited resources. So hormesis leads to the gap between guidelines with S-shaped model and reality with hormesis model concerning ERA. In this study, hormetic effects of sulfachloropyridazine (SCP) on the bioluminescence of Aliivibrio fischeri (A. f) under 41 conditions to simulate the real environment were investigated and compared with ERA practice by some parameters, such as no observed effect concentration (NOEC), hormetic-stimulatory range (HSR) and goal concentration (GC). Not only is the reproducibility of hormesis in real-life contexts confirmed, binomial distribution (p = 0.644> 0.05) of the relative position of GC and HSR is also found, revealing a 50% probability for GC to falls in HSR, which proves the over-strictness of ERA both qualitatively and quantitatively. This study provides a novel view for ERA that hormetic principles should dominate, and conditions where S-shaped dose-response model works should be singled out on a specific basis to bridge the hormesis-induced gap.

AB  - The development of iron-ore deposits is accompanied by the excavation formation of considerable dimensions in the underground space and to ensure high technical and economic indicators of extraction, especially when developing high-grade iron ore, it is necessary to take into account the nature of the geological structure of the massif on the indicators of their dilution. It is established that when the chambers are worked out on a junction with hanging wall waste, the indices of ore dilution with the adjacent strata are 1.7 times higher than on a junction with the foot wall of the deposit. The tendencies and causes of variability of volume of extracted ore dilution with the adjacent strata in different geological structure parts of the ore deposits are revealed, the ore basin across the pitch is characterized by a general evolving trend of the rock strength of the hanging wall and ore basin angle of incidence decreasing and increasing the thickness of the deposit from the northern side to the southern one. It has been established that the concentration of hanging rocks caving and extracted ore dilution indices is enhanced by changing their morphological composition, reducing the strength and stability of these rocks, reducing the ore basin angle of incidence, and increasing the ore deposit thickness. The obtained results allow us to lay the foundations for optimizing the parameters of the development system and the rational procedure for breaking up ore reserves in the chambers under the changing mining and geological conditions of field development.

AB  - Water quality in lowland lentic system was evaluated through the use of aquatic macroinvertebrates as bioindicators, and their relationship with basic physicochemical factors was considered; thus, two biotopes were established for identifying both groups of macroinvertebrates, one being the population associated with macrophytes (AM) and the other being benthic (B). As a result, 46 families of macroinvertebrates were collected, with Hydrobiidae, Chironomidae, Thiaridae and Polymitarcyidae being the most abundant in the system. In addition, families with high tolerance to extreme conditions, such as Ceratopogonidae, Chironomidae and Syrphidae, were found, as well as some families with low tolerance to these conditions, such as Caenidae and Leptoceridae. The first biotope presented 7.189 individuals (50.42%) and the second 7.056 (49.5%), for a total of 14.259 individuals. Biotope AM presented 100% of the richness, while biotope B was significantly less rich, with 15 families, which represent 32,06%. In order to evaluate the families found in the lowland lentic system, their distribution in the ranges of variation of the physicochemical factors and tolerance levels was taken into account. As a consequence, a new score table was established, where this system obtained a total score of 207 with an average of 166 per sampling station, suggesting signs of contamination. Finally, these results allow an adaptation of the BMWP (Biological Monitoring Working Party) index to be proposed, including the lowland lentic systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Artisanal fisheries represents an important source of employment and income for many Mediterranean coastal communities, as well as an important cultural and traditional identity factor at a regional level. However, despite its importance, it is generally under-studied, in both ecological and socio-economic terms, so hampering the chance of developing sustainable and integrated management measures. At present, on the West coast of the Adriatic Sea, within the three-mile area, artisanal fisheries and hydraulic dredging are the only approved commercial fishing activities. This study confirmed the importance of the artisanal fisheries in this area, representing a multitarget and multigear activity. Despite the 39 exploited species, however, we found high vulnerability both for species (76% of total catches depend upon only three species cuttlefish, mantis shrimp, and sole) and thermal affinity groups (cold and temperate species contributed to the entire catches). Furthermore, our data showed that fishing effort and CPUE values were greater than those reported at the regional level, and also indicated that the discard rate was lower than in other Adriatic areas. Regarding ecological effects, the two trophodynamic indicators that we applied showed a sustainable situation, but scenarios of possible changes in environmental or fishing effort conditions highlighted the proximity of the stock to the unsustainability threshold. Our findings suggest the need for an adequate management strategy to cope with possible future changes in population boundaries and conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The changes in fresh water quality are reflected, over time, in the structure of the biocenosis by adjusting the composition, the abundance and the spatial distribution of species, in an attempt to maintain a constant equilibrium. It is difficult to identify this equilibrium just by analysing the physicochemical measurements because they represent water quality conditions of the moment, while the analysis based on biological indicators which are reflecting the composition of macrozoobenthos populations are showing the conditions from the sampling moment and, also, from the past. In our study, water and macroinvertebrates samples were taken from three sections of Uz River, Bacau County, Romania, respecting maximum development periods, between years 2007 and 2009. The locations chosen are covering all types of water courses and possible sources of pollution in the area and the period includes an important flood event that took place in the basin in March 2009. The measured physicochemical parameters and the determined biological indices were analysed using descriptive statistics, bivariate correlations and Partial Least Square Regression (PLRS) in order to highlight seasonal and location variations, to identify the correlations between them and to assess the PLRS algorithm as a method to generate a model for predicting ecological status of fresh water. By comparison with descriptive statistics, PLSR algorithm proved to be able to highlight fine variations in values, in fact, the accuracy of the model is improving in case of anthropogenic influences.

AB  - Allothrombium pulvinum is a predatory mite capable of controlling aphid pests in agricultural and natural ecosystems. In this study, proteinase, carbohydrase and lipase activities were determined in the mite's gut using general and specific substrates, inhibitors and activators. The adult mites were dissected and their guts were removed and used as the enzyme source after homogenization and centrifugation. Gut pH of 5.3 was obtained in adults using pH dye indicators. Gut extracts showed an optimum proteolysis activity against haemoglobin under acidic condition (pH 3). The most effective inhibitor of proteinase activity was the cysteine proteinase inhibitor, E-64 [L-trans-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)-butane]. The optimum pH for acidic proteinase activity; the inhibition of proteinase activity by E-64; and increased proteinase activity in the presence of the activator L-cysteine revealed the presence of acidic proteinases, specifically cysteine proteinases, in the mite gut. Proteinase zymogram analysis showed at least three bands of proteinase activity in the gut extract. alpha-Amylase was optimally active against starch substrate at pH 5. The maximum activity of glucosidases (alpha and beta) and galactosidases (alpha and beta) occurred at pH 5 and pH 4, respectively. Zymogram analysis revealed at least two bands of activity for alpha-glucosidase and one band of activity for beta-glucosidase. Lipase activity was also determined at pH 2-8 and the activity increased under alkaline conditions.

AB  - Dental stress markers such as enamel hypoplasia and caries are suitable indicators of population health and lifestyle, although they must be recorded and interpreted carefully. To date, they have been predominantly studied in adult samples, whereas juvenile remains are also affected by these lesions. In this study, dental enamel hypoplasia and caries were both evaluated on 613 nonadult individuals from four early mediaeval Moravian and Frankish skeletal series, who had experienced contrasting environments and lifestyles. The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between these biological traits and living conditions, and how this is manifested in the juvenile dental remains.
   Significant differences between populations were found in stress markers, dental lesions and the way these were manifested. Exposure to stressful conditions varies between urban and rural populations and is related to age groups. Although the children under investigation seem to have had different diets, it is difficult to distinguish the biological contribution (different enamel susceptibility) from the lifestyle contribution (different food, environment) in the formation of caries. Moreover, such studies must be interpreted carefully due to the possibility of intra- and inter-observer errors and the subjectivity of the scoring techniques.
   Nevertheless, this study also demonstrates that results of an investigation of juvenile skeletal remains can be as informative as a study of adults and that juvenile skeletons can be included in large bioarchaeological population studies.

AB  - Phenotypic flexibility is a phenomenon where physiological functions in animals are reversibly adjusted in response to ecological constraints. Research usually focuses on effects of single constraints, but under natural conditions animals face a multitude of restrictions acting simultaneously, and potentially generating conflicting demands on the phenotype. We investigated the conflicting demands of low temperatures and a low quality diet on the phenotype of a shorebird, the red knot Calidris canutus. We tested the effects of switching diet from a high quality trout food to low quality hard-shelled bivalves in captive birds acclimated to temperatures reflecting natural winter conditions. Feeding on bivalves generated a digestive constraint forcing the birds to increase the height and width of their gizzard by 66% and 71%, respectively, over 30 days. The change in gizzard size was associated with an initial 15% loss of body mass and a reduction in size of the pectoral muscles by 11%. Because pectoral muscle size determines summit metabolic rate (M-sum, an indicator of cold endurance), measured M-sum declined by 9%. Therefore, although the birds were acclimated to cold, gizzard growth led to a loss of cold endurance. We propose that cold-acclimated knots facing a digestive constraint made a phenotypic compromise by giving-up cold hardiness for digestive capacity. Field studies suggest that phenotypic compromises occur in free-living red knots as well and help improve survival.

AB  - Nowadays it is extremely important to understand ecosystem function and its dynamics to predict future changes and consequently to perform appropriate measures. Hydromeliorations and subsequent decrease in groundwater table are thought to be a major reason for a decline in the vitality of black alder (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn.) wetland forests in Northeastern Slovenia. In this study radial increments of trees were used as indicators of black alder forest function and its disturbances. The aim of the study was to build a model of annual radial increments of black alder trees, to use this model to identify environmental attributes that most importantly affect ecosystem's function and to predict changes in the forest function under different scenarios of environmental conditions in the future. The model was induced with a machine learning algorithm CIPER and it was based on the data about site conditions and applied management measures in the past 35 years. Groundwater levels in combination with the duration of sun radiation were identified as the most important environmental attributes affecting annual radial increments. Radial increments were the lowest in very wet and cloudy years. On the other hand, radial increments were decreased under drought stress as well. Changes in groundwater level and in duration of sun radiation, as well as increased oscillations of groundwater level, all cause important increase in oscillations of modeled radial increments, indicating higher stress. Radial increments were further negatively affected by late white frosts in the spring. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Benthic foraminifera were sampled monthly during a one-year period in order to examine their biological response to the environmental factors in the Ubatuba Bay (northern coast of S (a) over tildeo Paulo State, Brazil). The area is a popular tourist destination with a population that varies during the year, as does the untreated sewage carried into the bay by the rivers. Four sites were analysed. Each station is near one of the rivers that discharge into the bay. Biological data were analysed with multivariate and univariate techniques. The influence of the abiotic parameters on the foraminiferal fauna was inferred through statistical methods and time correlation functions. Geochemical and populational parameter differences allowed the sites to be separated into two groups according to their stress conditions. One group was dominated by Ammonia tepida-a herbivore species-and showed higher densities indicating a more productive and less contaminated location. The other one was dominated by Buliminella elegantissima-a detritivore species. Species diversity did not seem to be a good indicator of environmental health in this area due to the low densities and the high dominance of few species. Nevertheless, density and richness were used as evidence of local productivity and environmental conditions. Quasi-azoic moments related to the high degree of contamination were observed. Anthropogenic effects were stronger in the austral summer period, when sewage input through the rivers increases due to mass tourism.

AB  - This study focused on the influence of polluted environment on various indicators of Betula pendula Roth and their applicability to the bioindication of the condition of urban environments in one of the largest industrial cities of Ukraine in the steppe zone, namely Kryvyi Rih. Our investigations have been carried out for three years (2016-2018) in eight B. pendula plantations exposed to different levels of aerotechnogenic loading: to a low pollution level - in Kryvyi Rih Botanical Garden of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (control), Poliana Kazok Square and Heroiv ATO Park, to an average pollution level - along three highways with heavy traffic and those exposed to a high pollution level - near the enterprises of Private JSC 'Northern Iron Ore Dressing Works'(Northern GZK) and Public JSC 'ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih'. Morphometric, anatomical and statistical methods were used to identify the most sensitive indicators of the impact of air pollutants. As a result of this research, changes associated with greater level of technogenic pollution were revealed in the morphological and anatomical parameters of the leaf blade, namely: reduction in the length of the petiole to 14.3%, in the length of the leaf blade to 8.4% and its width to 12.8%; a decrease in length, width and area of the stomata up to 29.4%, 25.9%, 48.1%, respectively; an increase in thickness of the leaf blade to 23.0% and its tissues, as well as the stomata density per 1 mm(2) of the leaf to 47.3%. We also registered a decrease in the length of male catkins to 7.4% and an increase in their width to 13.7% associated with greater environmental pollution. The maximum and minimum values of the indicators were recorded near the mining and processing works and close to metallurgical plants. In addition, in order to determine the most sensitive indicators of B. pendula response to urban pollution, we carried out a comparative analysis of all the studied parameters and those, the results of which were published earlier. As a result of this analysis, these indicators were ranked according to the level of differences in relation to the control values in decreasing order: differences in 1.5 and more times in comparison with the control - seed germination, curved leaf apex, fluctuating asymmetry, crown volume, pollen viability, the amount of abnormal pollen, vital state of trees, seed quality, crown area; 25-50% differences from control - stomata area, thickness of the lower epidermis, stomata density on leaf blade, seed productivity, pollen fertility, width of fruit (female) catkins, number of scales in fruit (female) catkins, thickness of palisade parenchyma, tree height, stomata length, pollen tube length, trunk diameter at the height of 1.3 m, thickness of the upper epidermis, stomata width; a 10-24% change in indicators - leaf thickness, length of fruit (female) catkin petiole, weight of 1000 seeds, leaf petiole length, male catkin width, leaf blade width, fruit (female) catkin length; the differences from control are less than 10% - the thickness of the spongy parenchyma, the polar axis of pollen, the leaf length, the equatorial diameter of pollen, the length of male catkins and the purity of the seeds.

AB  - The ecological risk of changes in the content of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in plankton of lakes due to global warming is assessed. The analyzed hazards are temperature, dissolved phosphorus and nitrogen, and the phyto- and zooplankton structure. The main risks are related not only to the temperature increase, but indirect effects of warming. The critical link in PUFA risk assessment is the phytoplankton structure due to the particularly favorable growth conditions for cyanobacteria in nutrient rich waters in shallow lakes and reservoirs.

AB  - Lake Bardawil, similar to the other Mediterranean Egyptian lakes, is a unique wetland, separated from the Mediterranean Sea by a narrow sandbar with very restricted water exchange that allowed the development of a shallow-hypersaline lagoon. Late Pleistocene tectonics activities divided the lake into two main basins; the eastern and western basins. Twelve surface sediment samples were collected along the Lake and subjected to sediment texture and benthic foraminiferal analyses. In general, benthic foraminifera were abundant in the surface sediments of Lake Bardawil and were characterized by low diversity. The statistical analysis revealed two biotopes that distinguished between the eastern and western basins' environments. The eastern basin biotopes were characterized by fine bottom sediments with the predominance of salinity-tolerant assemblages, thus demonstrating hypersaline stressful restricted environment. The western biotope exhibited coarser bottom sediments associated with relatively narrow salinity-tolerant assemblages. This reflected sandy and less saline sediment of uncontaminated environments, as the western basin was exposed to active hydrodynamic regime that developed more magnitudes of water exchange with the Eastern Mediterranean Sea through the western inlet. Based on the results of this study, the biomonitoring of Lake Bardawil could be assessed by the analysis of its benthic foraminifera as a bioindicator tool that may help in the improvement of the Lake's conditions.

AB  - The Roatan Spiny-tailed Iguana (Ctenosaura oedirhina) is an endangered species endemic to only two islands in the Bay of Honduras and a few of its surrounding cays. Ctenosaura oedirhina is currently threatened by different impacts, including habitat modification, invasive predators, and illegal collection and harvesting. Although previous work has monitored population numbers, animal distributions, and genetic variation, very little is known about the reproductive ecology and physiology of the species. Physiological indicators provide valuable information regarding the health of animals and populations. Commonly used metrics include circulating hormone concentrations, energetic indicators, and immunological indices. However, the aforementioned physiological measures can also be difficult to interpret because they are not static but rather vary according to sex, season, reproductive state, and body condition. Therefore, to understand the health status of an individual better, it is important to concomitantly measure multiple related and relevant physiological systems, and to examine these responses under different individual and environmental contexts (e.g., reproductive state, site). In the current study, we measured circulating plasma oxidative stress markers and energy metabolites in five populations of Roatan Spiny-tailed Iguanas during the prenesting season. We found significant physiological variation in females according to breeding state, and males according to population. Understanding the natural variation in the physiology of free-living animals will allow us to determine the significance of physiological measures such as health indicators in the future and thus better manage these threatened populations.

AB  - Phototrophic primary producers are regarded as valuable indicators in aquatic habitats, since they are spread in a wide range of environmental conditions. However, the communities harbored by extreme ecosystems such as the saline lakes have been scarcely investigated with respect to their diversity and roles in the ecosystem functioning. The present study investigates the structure, diversity, and distribution of autotrophs from 19 lakes located in the Transylvanian Basin (Romania). Overall, 83 aquatic taxa were identified, belonging to Bacillariophyta (67), Cyanobacteria (10), Chlorophyta (4), Euglenophyta (1), and Xanthophyta (1). Standardized limnological methods were employed for sampling and analyses: measurements of morphometric, physical and chemical parameters, sampling techniques, optical microscopy identification of taxa and multivariate processing of data. Because saline lakes typically sustain undiversified biotic communities, usually well adapted to extreme conditions, we hypothesized that: (1) The main environmental driver of taxonomic diversity (expressed as species richness) would be the salinity; and (2) the same halophilic dominant taxa would occur in all hypersaline lakes (TDS > 50 g L-1). However, our results disproved both statements. Firstly, salinity was found to be an important driver of taxa diversity, but only subsequent to high habitat heterogeneity, lake area and nutrient concentrations. Secondly, high percentages of halotolerant, and not halophilic species were found, together with increased numbers of rare species (appearing in only one lake). Thus, the present study helps improve the current knowledge on the diversity of primary producers from saline lakes, opening new perspectives in understanding the functioning of such extreme environments.

AB  - A study probing the optimization of PO42- and NO32- concentrations in benthic epilithic diatom cultures as biological indicators in predicting the trophic status and water quality conditions of the Swartpruit River was undertaken. Diatom materials were collected from November 2014 - February 2015 from the river and cultivated in an optimized growth medium with 0.003, 0.005, 0.01, 0.015, 0.2, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2,.025, 0.3, 0.4 mg/L PO42- and 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.0, 9.0, 10, 12, 13 mg/L NO32-) amounts, respectively. The results revealed that optimization of PO42- and NO32- concentrations in the growth media encouraged corresponding fluctuations in the taxonomic profiles and abundance of diatom assemblage cultures and was plausibly applied in determining the trophic status and water quality condition of the river. Principal component analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between diatom diversity and optimized phosphate and nitrate concentrations in an ordination biplot revealed 45.62% and 37.93 % variations in the data. We anticipate that the methodology and data analysis presented in this report could be applied in predicting the trophic status and water quality of any inland freshwater resource like the Swartspruit River, which undergoes seasonal harmful algal bloom.

AB  - Determining if the vast soil health degradations across the seven major soil groups (orders) of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) can be managed on the basis of a one-size-fits-all or location-specific approach is limited by a lack of soil group-based understanding of soil health degradations. We used the relationship between changes in nematode population dynamics relative to food and reproduction (enrichment, EI) and resistance to disturbance (structure, SI) indices to characterize the soil food web (SFW) and soil health conditions of Ferralsol, Lithosol and Nitosol soil groups in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi. We applied bivariate correlations of EI, SI, soil pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), and texture (sand, silt and clay) to identify integrated indicator parameters, and principal component analysis (PCA) to determine how all measured parameters, soil groups, and countries align. A total of 512 georeferenced soil samples from disturbed (agricultural) and undisturbed (natural vegetation) landscapes were analyzed. Nematode trophic group abundance was low and varied by soil group, landscape and country. The resource-limited and degraded SFW conditions separated by soil groups and by country. EI and SI correlation with SOC varied by landscape, soil group or country. PCA alignment showed separation of soil groups within and across countries. The study developed the first biophysicochemical proof-of-concept that the soil groups need to be treated separately when formulating scalable soil health management strategies in SSA.

AB  - Ice-free areas of maritime Antarctica (MA) are undergoing rapid environmental adjustment due to climate change because glaciers retreated. In recently deglaciated areas, sensitive indicators related to soil can be used as proxies of the transition phase from glacial to nonglacial conditions at paraglacial coastal systems. This work aims at comprehending how paraglacial coastal land systems respond to adjustment processes in highly dynamic deglaciated areas, based on net ecosystem exchange, soil temperature (ST), and soil moisture (SM) temporal series in two different vegetation communities on a paraglacial coastal land system in MA. We selected a moss community (MC) and a mixed community with mosses and lichens (MLC). MC is located on a hydromorphic area with buffered ST regime, compared with MLC, where greater SM variation range and freezing conditions were observed. MC and MLC are currently acting as an atmospheric CO2 sink. In this work, MC showed a greater capacity of CO2 uptake during measurements (711.20 g CO2 m(-2)). In this part of Antarctica, where a recent trend of decreasing ST occurs, less permafrost and surface land degradation, combined with enhanced carbon storage, are expected. However, in the long term, following the readjustment of the paraglacial period, thawing is expected, coupled with permafrost degradation and carbon release to the atmosphere, under the predicted warming scenario in MA.

AB  - Geomorphological features are essential parts of the environment and they represent an important conditioning factor for the development and distribution of certain biological assemblages, as well as for a variety of human activities. However, environmental geomorphology usually receives very limited or no attention at all in the process of environmental impact assessment (EIA). Nevertheless, the site selection process for hazardous wastes in environmental impact studies for individual projects plays an essential role. In order to determine the most suitable site in a region for municipal/hazardous wastes, several criteria are used, including geology, groundwater condition, climate, and land use. The present work describes a methodology taking advantage of environmental geomorphological features, and reducing these criteria in the site selection procedure in land disposal of waste; in addition, a case study is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology. The validity of the adopted site screening method is explained. This methodology comprises the use of a single geomorphological map to locate suitable landfilling sites for hazardous waste, instead of using separate maps for geological features, climatic features (temperature, precipitation, and speed and direction of the prevailing wind), slope and erosion. Furthermore, the present study is compared with a previous study performed in the GAP region, where the use of land resources is crucial for agricultural and water management purposes. The application of the described selection process and the verified method in this region shows that the adopted method and detailed criteria are valid.

AB  - Capsule Regrowth rate of tail feathers is more strongly affected compared to feather length and symmetry.
   Aims To assess the value of avian feathers as bioindicators.
   Methods The origin and persistence of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in homologous pairs of regrowing feathers was studied in captive birds under different levels of environmental stress, respresented by exposure to lead (Pb). Homologous feathers of individually housed birds were plucked synchronously or with a delay of seven days. We measured growth rate, regeneration time, final size and FA of regrown feathers and related them to Pb stress.
   Results Asymmetry decreased as feathers reached their final length. This was not due to compensatory growth but rather a consequence of the programmed growth trajectory of single feathers. Tail feathers grown under higher Pb pollution showed increased regeneration times, decreased growth rates and shorter lengths, but no changes in development times nor in FA. For differences between both (i) original and induced feathers and (ii) control and Pb treatment, effect sizes of parameters related to feather development (growth bar width, growth rate, regeneration and development time) were consistently larger than those related to the resulting phenotype (feather length and FA).
   Conclusions Growth bar widths in particular provide an applicable, sensitive and reliable indicator of adverse conditions such as Pb pollution and experimental conditions. In general, phenotypic characteristics that retrospectively allow estimation of growth rates may be more suitable for monitoring environmental stress than sizes or asymmetries of full-grown traits.

AB  - The geochemical behavior of the top 70 cm of permeable reef hat sediments on Checker Reef, Oahu, Hawai'i was examined using: spatial and temporal changes in pore water O-2, NO3-, NO2-, NH4+, and N2O concentrations. The shallow depth of the sediment-water interface relative to the height of waves propagating across the reef creates an environment in which pore water mixing and transport are dominated by wave-induced mechanisms. Dissolved oxygen penetrated 15-50 cm in the four sites studied. The depth-integrated concentration of dissolved oxygen was greater under larger wave conditions and in more permeable sediments, which suggests that dissolved oxygen may be a good indicator of the relationship between sediment metabolism and the physical nature of the sediment environment. The absence of any subsurface N2O maxima, limited temporal variability in pore water N2O concentrations, and vertically coherent profiles of O-2, NO3-, NO2-, and N2O suggest that suboxic processes are typically restricted to spatial scales that are smaller than for oxic processes in these sediments. The geochemical response of the sediments to a natural perturbation was monitored by examining the composition of pore waters immediately following a large wave event and for several weeks thereafter. Significant changes in the depth-integrated concentrations of O-2, NO3-, NO2-, and NH4+ were observed following the perturbation; however, only changes in NO3- lasted for several weeks after the event, whereas most other species returned to previous conditions within two weeks or less.

AB  - Paleoecological and historical insights about the origin and fire history of an ecological feature can indicate the most effective management techniques to preserve that feature's current condition. The Cutler grasslands, consisting of about 800 ha of nearly homogeneous stands of Calamagrostis canadensis (Michx.) Beauv (bluejoint reedgrass) on rolling hills, is the most extensive example of this ecosystem known in Maine. A pollen stratigraphy from an adjacent bog contained no indicators of open, grassland conditions before the land was cleared by European settlers. Deeds and historic writings are consistent with a mid-nineteenth-century origin of the grasslands by means of fire. Maine Forest Service records, forest-type maps, and aerial photographs show that the grassland-forest ecotone has barely shifted since at least 1940 in spite of a lack of extensive fires since at least 1967. Fire apparently has not been the critical factor in the maintenance of a majority of the grasslands but may have resulted in the creation of new areas of grassland. On many logged or burned sites in Alaska and western Canada, C. canadensis impedes tree regeneration by shading, by producing a thick mat of dead stems, which prevents tree seeds from reaching soil before germinating, by competition for water and nutrients, and by insulating the ground and thus delaying soil warming in the spring. The same processes probably act to perpetuate the open grasslands in Cutler. This study suggests that a low-input management plan may be most appropriate for the site.

AB  - Varved sediments provide a unique opportunity to track the history of eutrophication and oxygen conditions in lacustrine environments. The well-preserved varves indicate hypoxic/anoxic conditions in hypolimnetic waters. Sediment records from three lakes (Dubie, Salno and Wasoskie) located in northern Poland were investigated to determine the drivers that led to the development of varves in the topmost parts of the sediment profiles. We distinguished lithozones characterized by different sedimentary structures in each sediment core. Age-depth models for each sediment record were established using varve counting and isotope dating. Additionally, an independent marker of the Askja-1875 CE tephra supported the dating of sediments from Lake Wasoskie. Ordination analysis applied to a set of geochemical data enabled identification of three groups of proxies representing the variability in deposition of different material within the lakes: i) terrestrial minerogenic material, ii) organic matter, and iii) carbonates. Our data show that the onset of varve preservation occurred asynchronously in the investigated lakes (from the late 19th century to the mid-20th century) and that the transition from homogeneous to varved sediments was gradual and occurred over several decades. These transformations were consistent with the variability of the proxies, indicating cultural eutrophication and showing a strong relationship with the history of human-induced land-use changes in the catchments. This study shows that wellpreserved varves in the topmost sediments of many lakes are geological evidence of human activity.

AB  - Most evidence about the hygienic condition of halal food is derived from studies conducted in Muslim-majority countries, not western countries. Because context of practice is different in Muslim-majority countries, it is difficult to apply these findings to western countries, such as the United States. We aimed to determine the hygienic condition of beef carcasses and environmental surfaces in two U.S. halal beef slaughterhouses over a 12-month period. Each month between November 2016 and October 2017 samples were collected = 432 carcass samples (pre- and post-evisceration)] and 59 surface samples (slaughter hall floor, brisket saw, and offal table). All carcass and surface samples were analyzed for detectable levels of four indicator organisms - aerobic plate count (APC), Enterobacteriaceae count (EC), total coliform count (TCC), and generic Escherichia coli (ECC). All indicator organisms (APC, ECC, TCC, and EC) in samples collected from both plants were within acceptable limits based on USDA microbiological guidelines of beef carcasses. Significant differences (P < 0.001) in the detectable levels of indicator organisms between pre- and post-evisceration were shown in plant B but not plant A. A significant difference (P < 0.01) in detectable levels of all indicator organisms was shown between winter and summer. Levels were higher during the summer (June-September) in pre-evisceration samples at both plants compared to samples collected in the winter (December-February). These findings can be used to inform food safety interventions targeting halal beef slaughter operations in the United States.

AB  - The monitoring of existing coastal protection work and comparing the actual performance with the predicted one is one of the methods for developing coastal engineering processes. A comprehensible example, which clearly demonstrates the value of this monitoring process, could be found in the coastal protection works of El Agami resort area, Egypt. A group of seven detached breakwaters were constructed in front of the study area aiming to improve the beach condition with consideration for swimming capability. This is in addition to a temporary harbor to facilitate execution of the breakwaters. Deposition of seagrass and an undesirable temporary harbor are part of the coastal area problems.
   The implicit sediment transport two-dimension (ImSedTran-2D) numerical model, prototype data during the period from October 2002 to October 2003, and the empirical design relationships were used to study the environmental impact assessment of the breakwaters. Accordingly, a decision was made to eliminate the temporary harbor.
   The study area was observed to be quite stable, even with the detached breakwaters. This could be attributed to the orientation of the shoreline and its offshore submerged ridge, which extends parallel to the shoreline. Removing the harbor improves the ecosystem of the zone just behind the western breakwater by clearing out and stopping the deposition of the seagrass in this area with its negative effect on beach condition. The study area can be considered an ideal case because the empirical relationships, the prototype data, and the numerical model give more or less the same results.

AB  - Chemical signals are difficult to fake because they are often directly associated with phenotype and physiological condition, and hence likely to be honest signals for intraspecific communication. Chemical signals may be modified after release by the sender or by the environment. The proximate and ultimate signal meanings are dependent not only on the condition of the sender, but also on the physiological status of the receiver. Understanding the relationships and linkage among signal modality, signal function and receiver response is an essential first step before using natural signals for animal care and conservation. Our studies on chemical communication in Asian and African elephants combine observational and experimental work in captive and wild settings to further this understanding. Recent discoveries of pheromones in Asian elephants and the biochemistry of these compounds provide strong evidence that such chemical signals are honest indicators of reproductive status. Chemically identifying the signals and verifying their functional context with statistically robust behavioural studies are essential aspects for understanding the communication system. Additionally, the investigative process of discovering, identifying and verifying the function of chemical signals among captive elephants offers safe and stimulating enrichments. The knowledge garnered from such studies has potential conservation benefits for managing wild elephant populations. A firm foundation of scientific information is required for successful behavioural investigations and applied conservation and enrichment components. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The increasing number of chemicals used by society requires accessible, easy to implement tools to perform screening-level ecological risk assessments. However, field data to calibrate and validate screening tools is challenging to obtain for many watersheds. Thus, the evaluation must be done under data limited conditions. Here we employ a fate and transport model, OrganoFate, to predict environmental concentrations of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) as well as a number of pesticides. CECs evaluated include antibacterial compounds sulfamethoxazole and triclocarban and a flame-retardant tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCPP). We also evaluated widely used pesticides chlorpyrifos, bifenthrin and esfenvalerate. We predict concentrations of the contaminants in high-risk watersheds which were dominated by either urban or agricultural development and have small aquatic compartments. Screening-level predictions were in good agreement with observed concentrations in surface water and sediment. Maximum predicted concentrations were close to the highest observed concentrations for CECs, only -0.1 mu g/L greater for sulfamethoxazole and triclocarban concentrations, and for TDCPP <5 mu g/L higher. ChemFate was also employed to screen possible aquatic health impacts. Results demonstrated possible CEC aquatic health risk for TDCPP and triclocarban (risk quotients of 0.9 and 1.1 respectively). For pesticides, exceedance of effect (EC50) and lethal (LC50) endpoints was predicted for various taxonomic groups which include aquatic invertebrates, fish, amphibians, and benthic organisms.

AB  - Two vitality index approaches have been demonstrated to be good proxies of discard survival in similar fishing and environmental conditions: Reflex Action Mortality Predictors combined with injuries (RI) scores that measure the proportion of impaired reflexes and injuries, and a simpler, quicker, but less precise approach based on ordinal categories related to fish body movements and injuries (semi-quantitative assessment, SQA). This study assessed and compared these two approaches for five species (two flatfishes, skates, a seabass and a catshark) discarded in a coastal otter trawl fishery in the Bay of Biscay. All species displayed good vitality status according to both indices and were not very sensitive to the fishing nor their biological conditions. Still, flatfishes were more sensitive to discarding while the catshark was very resistant. Furthermore, depending on species, the impairment of some reflexes and injuries were associated to stressing factors, highlighting the potential of the approach but also the complexity involved in building a relevant score. The SQA index was highly correlated with the RI score and was sensitive to more sources of stressing factors for similar predictive performance. While the relevance of these two approaches should be ultimately determined by the strength and consistency of their association with discard survival, these results suggest that the RI approach was not more effective than SQA despite the extra labour and time involved in collecting the data.

AB  - Microorganisms respond rapidly to changing environmental conditions. Therefore microbes are generally considered as sensitive indicators of soil health. The aim of this study was to assess the biological fertility status and sustainability of three differently managed agricultural soils by using microbial indicators. Management practices involved a soil with minimum treatment (biodynamic); a soil characterized by periodic application of manure and chemical fertilizer (manure); and a soil characterized by depurated and stabilized organic sludge amendment (sludge). Samples were taken four times during a year, at two depths: 0-15 and 15-30 cm. An extensive characterization of soil organic matter was carried out. Biochemical parameters included metabolic quotient, mineralization quotient and kinetic parameters of microbial decomposition of soil organic matter. Community level physiological profile analysis (CLPP) was used to investigate soil microbial energetic strategies adopted in differently managed soils. Total amounts of fungi and bacteria were determined by direct microscopy. Indicators related to labile and humic organic matter fractions suggest significantly lower soil fertility and lower sustainability in the sludge amended treatment. Differences between the biodynamic treatment and Manure treatment were less consistent. Eco-physiological quotients and kinetic parameters of C-mineralization indicated a steady state in the biodynamic treatment and stressed conditions in the sludge treatment. Microbial communities seem to adopt a typically K-strategy (persistent) in the biodynamic treatment and a typically r-strategy (opportunists) in the sludge treatment. Manure management shows an intermediate result: the superficial layer is characterized by r-strategrists and the deeper layer by K-strategists.

AB  - Coastal zones are key interconnectors of terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Due to the degradation and fragmentation of coastal wetlands, there is an urgent need to develop assessment methodology to compare the health of wetland ecosystems at different spatial scales. This will help efficiently develop and implement protections using easy-to-access ecosystem health data. This study aims to understand the spatial distribution of coastal and inland wetland health for China's coastal regions. A Wetland Health Index (WHI) was developed to provide a basis for policy and decision making. Four utilization models-Long Term Model, Open Model, Nature Reserve Model, and Protected and Economic Model-were defined in the context of China's coastal regions to specifically examine wetland health. Results show that the average WHI score was 63.6 with the range of 44.8-84.3 for 35 National Nature Reserves (NNRs), and the southern NNRs generally performed better than the northern NNRs. The wetlands in the southern provinces/municipalities are relatively healthier than their northern counterparts. The competent authority has slight influence on WHI scores but duration of conservation establishment does not show a clear correlation. With increasing economic activity, the differences in health conditions (WHI scores) of China's coastal regions also increase. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or economic intensification does not relate to WHI scores. Appropriate trade-offs between wetland management and economic development could contribute to improve health conditions, conservation and utilization of coastal and inland wetlands.

AB  - Species distribution models (SDM) link species occurrence with a suite of environmental predictors and provide an estimate of habitat quality when the variable set captures the biological requirements of the species. SDMs are inherently more complex when they include components of a species' ecology such as conspecific attraction and behavioral flexibility to exploit resources that vary across time and space. Wading birds are highly mobile, demonstrate flexible habitat selection, and respond quickly to changes in habitat quality; thus serving as important indicator species for wetland systems. We developed a spatio-temporal, multi-SDM framework using Great Egret (Ardea alba), White Ibis (Eudocimus albus), and Wood Stork (Mycteria Americana) distributions over a decadal gradient of environmental conditions to predict species-specific abundance across space and locations used on the landscape over time. In models of temporal dynamics, species demonstrated conditional preferences for resources based on resource levels linked to differing temporal scales. Wading bird abundance was highest when prey production from optimal periods of inundation was concentrated in shallow depths. Similar responses were observed in models predicting locations used over time, accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Species clustered in response to differing habitat conditions, indicating that social attraction can co-vary with foraging strategy, water-level changes, and habitat quality. This modeling framework can be applied to evaluate the multi-annual resource pulses occurring in real-time, climate change scenarios, or restorative hydrological regimes by tracking changing seasonal and annual distribution and abundance of high quality foraging patches.

AB  - To investigate the role of substrate enrichment on larval growth and performance, white sturgeon, Acipenser transmontanus, were reared for 12dph (the pre-feeding stage) in the presence and absence of enriched substrates (i.e. structurally complex media). Following this period, larval sturgeon were transferred to holding tanks with unenriched substrate (lacking structural complexity) and reared for an additional 30days, during which time health and performance indicators (growth, U-crit, startle response reaction time) and whole body lipid composition were assessed at 15 and 18 degrees C. Sturgeon reared on unenriched substrates tended to grow more slowly (up to 40% reduced mass at 40dph) with a lower condition factor (5-15% lower between 8 and 40dph), but also exhibited delayed gut development and reduced rate of yolksac absorption (at 15dph) than those reared with enriched substrates. Whole body lipid composition was significantly altered with substrate enrichment, although the biological relevance of these changes is unknown. White sturgeon reared without exposure to enriched substrates at some temperatures and developmental phases demonstrated modest reductions in aerobic (similar to 20-30% lower U-crit) and startle response performance (similar to 5-10% slower reaction time) at 15 and 30dph. Overall, most effects were influenced by rearing temperatures and parentage, such that differences were not statistically significant under all conditions. Clearly, however, substrate enrichment plays an important role in development of white sturgeon during early life stages.

AB  - Understanding the relationship between environmental factors and public health is critical to improving sustainability at a sub-national level. Proposals to evaluate the status of environmental health in a region must consider factors including the diversity of indicators, geographical scale, incomplete or inaccurate data and the need for focused methodologies that capture the complexity of this subject. This paper presents the design of a system based on expert knowledge to assess environmental sanitation in cities in the Algarve region of Portugal. It was used fuzzy logic to assess uncertainties in the system. Conceptually, the use of fuzzy sets theory is simple and can integrate human expertise. The current proposal demonstrates the usefulness of aggregating information and opinion-based classifications to categorize municipalities according to their environmental health characteristics. The analysis shows that improved environmental sanitation conditions have been observed in municipalities located in the region's center. In the west, municipalities have worse conditions not only in environmental health but also in other sustainability indicators. A main feature of the system, presented here, is the ability for users to select variables to be considered by experts and opinion-makers without re-modeling, which allows the system to be adapted to different situations and scenarios. Therefore, the assessment method based on fuzzy logic is useful to investigators looking for a more systemic assessment of sustainability. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Canada is a large nation, approximately 1 billion hectares in size, and until recently, no national assessment of forest fragmentation had been undertaken. To assess national level biodiversity and ecosystem condition, national drivers of forest fragmentation are identified as being either primarily natural (e. g., resulting from wildfires, water features, or topography), or primarily anthropogenic (e. g., resulting from urbanization or roads and associated activities such as forest harvesting and oil and gas exploration). The relative importance of each of these fragmentation drivers within Canada's ten forested ecozones, which occupy approximately 650 million ha, is assessed using ecozone summaries and standard scores. Forest pattern metrics were generated from a Landsat-derived land cover product and fragmentation drivers were characterized using available national datasets. Through this analysis, we combine and portray the relative importance of forest patches with spatial layers indicative of natural and anthropogenically induced conditions as driving various fragmentation regimes over the forested area of Canada. The forest fragmentation in Canada can be characterized primarily by natural drivers, whereas fragmentation regimes attributable to anthropogenic drivers are typically regionally located and related to industrial activities and access (i.e., roads). We identify three scenarios in our results that characterize forest fragmentation in Canada: ecozones with similar forest patterns but different drivers; ecozones with similar patterns and drivers; and finally, ecozones with both different patterns and different drivers. Our findings indicate that national assessments of forest fragmentation should account for both natural (and inherent) and anthropogenic sources of fragmentation.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the situation and trends regarding prevalence of underweight, overweight, and undernourished populations worldwide. Thus, we defend that the conditions of hunger, underweight, overweight, and obesity are seen as anomalies resulting from nutritional and dietary food insecurity related to the concept of malnutrition.
   Design/methodology/approach - This investigation was conducted through an ecological study, using indicators related to undernourishment, underweight, and overweight. Data, obtained through the WHO and United Nations, were analyzed through scatter plots and angular coefficient from linear regression.
   Findings - Evidence suggests that some nations have high levels of undernourished and overweight populations at the same time. Results showed a significant reduction in the prevalence of underweight children and a significant increase in the prevalence of overweight children worldwide. Western Pacific has shown declining trends in both overweight and underweight children. Southern Africa has shown a strong increase in its child overweight population and no downward trend in its underweight child population.
   Practical implications - The authors defend that programs and actions better aligned to diagnoses of some countries that face problems related to both underweight and overweight/obesity conditions are needed. This investigation can help public and private efforts to combat underweight and overweight diagnoses worldwide.
   Originality/value - The authors present evidence of the co-occurrence of underweight and overweight in child populations worldwide. Thus, the authors show alarming trends regarding to these diagnoses.

AB  - The development of a minimally invasive multiplexed monitoring system for rapid analysis of biologically-relevant molecules could offer individuals suffering from chronic medical conditions facile assessment of their immediate physiological state. Furthermore, it could serve as a research tool for analysis of complex, multifactorial medical conditions. In order for such a multianalyte sensor to be realized, it must be minimally invasive, sampling of interstitial fluid must occur without pain or harm to the user, and analysis must be rapid as well as selective.
   Initially developed for pain-free drug delivery, microneedles have been used to deliver vaccines and pharmacologic agents (e.g., insulin) through the skin.(1-2) Since these devices access the interstitial space, microneedles that are integrated with microelectrodes can be used as transdermal electrochemical sensors. Selective detection of glucose, glutamate, lactate, hydrogen peroxide, and ascorbic acid has been demonstrated using integrated microneedle-electrode devices with carbon fibers, modified carbon pastes, and platinum-coated polymer microneedles serving as transducing elements.(3-7,8)
   This microneedle sensor technology has enabled a novel and sophisticated analytical approach for in situ and simultaneous detection of multiple analytes. Multiplexing offers the possibility of monitoring complex microenvironments, which are otherwise difficult to characterize in a rapid and minimally invasive manner. For example, this technology could be utilized for simultaneous monitoring of extracellular levels of, glucose, lactate and pH,(9) which are important metabolic indicators of disease states(7,10-14) (e.g., cancer proliferation) and exercise-induced acidosis.(15)

AB  - Polar bears (Ursus maritimus Phipps, 1774) are exposed to heavy metal and lipophilic contaminants that are known to bioaccumulate and biomagnify. Few studies concurrently report both chemical classes in the same individuals and are thus unable to assess drivers of observed tissue concentrations, and the potential adverse biological responses to combined exposures. We examined blood concentrations of mercury (Hg) and the sum of seven polychlorinated biphenyls (Sigma 7PCB) from free-ranging Southern Beaufort Sea polar bears to assess which factors contributed to variations among cohorts (adult males, adult females, young) during spring. Concentrations of Hg ranged from 10.3 to 228.0 ng/g wet mass, but mean concentrations were similar between males and females independent of age. Concentrations of Sigma 7PCB (range 2.0-132.8 ng/g wet mass) were greater among females and young than among males. Toxicant concentrations were related to packed cell delta N-15, an estimate of trophic position, after the inclusion of packed cell delta C-13. Concentrations of Sigma 7PCB were also positively correlated with concentrations of neutral lipids (triglycerides and free fatty acids) and inversely correlated to body condition indices. Elevated concentrations of toxicants and lower body condition indices in females and young compared with males may be a sentinel to a changing arctic environment. Further assessment of the potential adverse health impacts of contaminants and nutritional stress in these cohorts is warranted.

AB  - The perennial Kallada River originates at Karimalai-Kodakkal in the Southern part of Sahyadri (Western Ghats), running through Kollam, Pathanamthitta, and Trivandrum districts of Kerala, India. One of the crucial World Bank aided and the most significant Irrigation projects in Kerala is centred on the Kallada River, and now this project is benefited for in 92 villages. However, it is essential to monitor the water quality of the Kallada River. The focus of the present study is to assess the water quality of the Kallada River using caddisflies (Trichoptera) as well as physicochemical parameters of water. Samples of caddisflies and water were collected from 6 sites in the river to monitor water quality during the pre-monsoon season. Altogether, more than 3000 specimens belonging to 5 different taxa were recorded. A multivariate statistical approach was applied to study the influences of the water quality on caddisflies fauna. The results indicate that the upstream supported community abundance than the downstream. Less abundance of caddisflies was observed in the midstream and downstream sites Punalur and West Kallada, respectively. Caddisflies were absent in the sixth site Koivila, resulting from saltwater intrusion from the Ashtamudy estuary and various anthropogenic activities such as boating, civic effluents, and fishing. Upstream sites showed good water quality conditions and caddisfly abundance. The Kallada River is under threat of anthropogenic disturbances, especially in the mid and downstream sections. The caddisfly assemblage proved to be suitable in identifying variations in water quality conditions in the Kallada River because of their significant responses to environmental fluctuations.

AB  - Data obtained from the calcareous nannofossils, distributed in the upper part of the Pabdeh Formation (Priabonian-Rupelian) and the lower part of the Asmari Formation (Chattian) in the Bid-Zard section, were used to investigate the Eocene to Oligocene palaeoenvironmental conditions in the southwest of Izeh, southwestern Iran (eastern Tethys). The upper part of the Pabdeh Formation was composed of shale, thin-bedded pelagic limestone and dolostone, which is disconformably overlain by the Asmari Formation. For the first time, 29 species of calcareous nannofossils belonging to 13 genera were identified in the studied section. The calcareous nannofossils in the upper part of the Pabdeh Formation indicate the Isthmolithus recurvus Zone/Sphenolithus pseudoradians Zone (combined zone), Ericsonia subdisticha Zone, Helicosphaera reticulata Zone and Sphenolithus praedistentus Zone, from the Priabonian to the Rupelian. The Sphenolithus ciperoensis Zone of the Chattian was identified in the lower part of the Asmari Formation. Calcareous nannofossil stratigraphy across the upper Eocene-Oligocene interval also reveals a disconformity at the Rupelian/Chattian transition due to a bio-event. Shallowing of the basin and environmental changes in this part of the Tethyan domain could have led to the lithostratigraphic and biostratigraphic changes. In fact, during the late Eocene to late Oligocene, marine phytoplankton was sensitive to climate changes such as decreasing temperature, as well as possibly to a nutrient increase and changes in basin depth.

AB  - The inclusion of omics data into water quality monitoring programs is being considered to help alleviate the growing threat to water resources and ecosystem services. Despite the increasing need, the biological early warning system (BEWS), the widely used real-time water quality monitoring system, does not currently incorporate omics information, despite that metabolomics is a highly sensitive indicator of organism health and stress. We examined Daphnia magna metabolomics, which is the analysis of small molecules in living D. magna, as a potential water quality parameter for incorporation in the BEWS. The concentrations of 24 metabolites were measured with changes in water quality and variation of metabolite abundances was compared within and between conditions. Age-dependent monitoring revealed that matured individuals older than 8 days are appropriate model organisms for monitoring based on their low metabolomic variation as compared to younger daphnids. Hourly monitoring of metabolic variability and regulation under ambient and starved conditions demonstrated the rapid and sensitive detection of nutritional changes. Moreover, the metabolomic dysregulation due to exposure to the pollutant propranolol was also observed. By integrating all the observations, we found that the D. magna metabolome is a sensitive and useful parameter for detecting water quality changes and how these alter the function of keystone organisms. As such, this metabolomics-based framework is applicable to BEWS and highlights the beneficial advantages of integrating biomolecular and apical endpoint observations for enhanced performance in biomonitoring programs.

AB  - Peat bogs are highly endangered ecosystems worldwide. In the Western Balkans, they represent fragmented habitat patches, where insect diversity and implications for the habitat loss are poorly known. Carabid beetles and ants, widely used environmental indicators, were sampled by pitfall trapping in the largest and oldest Croatian peat bog and at its edges. We found that tyrphobiontic bog specialist species were absent in both taxonomic groups, which is likely due to biogeographical limitation for dispersal of these species into this region. With this study, tyrphophilous typical of bogs species have been recognised as environmental indicators in the Western Balkans peat bogs. Assemblages of both taxa were strongly affected by specific conditions in the peat bog high soil moisture and Sphagnum moss dominance, showing that edges are more favourable habitats for both taxa. Overall, carabid beetle activity density was significantly higher at the edge than at the peat bog, while species richness increased for both taxa at the edge, but not significantly. Spatial distribution of tyrphophilous species differed between studied taxa, with ants being more abundant in the peat bog, and carabid beetles at the edge. Additionally, some stenotopic and globally endangered species preferred edges. Occurrence of tyrphophilous and globally endangered species highlights the great conservation value of peat bog habitats in the Western Balkans. However, successional changes in vegetation are changing hydrological conditions of the peat bog. Here we suggest active conservation measures to preserve these unique soil invertebrate zoocoenoses.

AB  - Nowadays, monitoring focuses on the primary compounds and does not include degradation products formed during various biological and chemical processes. Transformation products may have the same effects to human health and the environment or sometimes they can be more toxic than the parent compound. Unfortunately, knowledge about the formation of degradation products is still limited, however, can be very important for the environmental risk assessment. Firstly, the photodegradation kinetic of amlodipine was investigated in two experimental conditions: during the exposure to solar radiation and during the exposure to the light emitted by the xenon lamp. In all cases degradation of amlodipine followed a pseudo-first-order kinetics. In the next step, identification of transformation products of amlodipine formed during the exposure to xenon lamp irradiation was performed using ultra high performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS). As a result sixteen photoproducts were identified, their structures were elucidated and ultimately the transformation pathway was proposed. Fifteen compounds (out of 16 photoproducts) were newly identified and reported here for the first time; some of those compounds were formed from the first photoproduct, amlodipine pyridine derivative. Several analytes were formed only in acidic or basic conditions. Furthermore, the occurrence of amlodipine and its identified degradation products was investigated in environmental waters. Only one out of 16 compounds was found in wastewater effluent. The possibility of the sorption of examined analytes to sewage sludge particles was discussed based on QSAR.

AB  - The common fig (Ficus carica L.) was introduced into Mexico by Spanish Franciscan missionaries in the 16th century. It is widely assumed that Mexican figs are the Spanish cultivar Black Mission. We collected and propagated 12 fig plants from six landraces from different states in Central Mexico that represent different climate. All of them were grown in a greenhouse at Universidad Autonoma Chapingo, in the State of Mexico. During the experimental period, the greenhouse had an average temperature and relative humidity of 29.2 degrees +/- 5.4 degrees C (SEM) and 78.1 +/- 6.7% (SEM), respectively. Morphological characterization was done following a selected set of quantitative and qualitative descriptors established by the IPGRI. DNA analysis was based on a combination of ISSR and RFLP markers. We observed great diversity mainly in fruit weight (28.1-96.2 g), fruit shape (ovoid, pyriform), and neck length (0.97-3.80 cm), which could not be explained by environmental conditions such as temperature and relative humidity. The Nei and Li/Dice similarity coefficient between landraces was determined by cluster analysis using the UPGMA method. Based on the morphological characterization and DNA fingerprinting data presented in this study, our results showed that after hundreds of years, black figs have adapted to local environmental condition in Central Mexico, yielding at least six clearly distinct landraces that represent valuable and previously undescribed genetic diversity. We also suggested names for those landraces according to their location and established a basis for further agronomic and molecular characterization of fig landraces.

AB  - This study investigates the relationships between the spring phytoplankton community and environmental factors in the Brazil-Malvinas confluence region. Phytoplankton community composition was determined by the high performance liquid chromatography/CHEMTAX approach, complemented with microscopic examination. Abiotic factors included temperature, salinity, dissolved inorganic macronutrients (ammonium, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate and silicate), water column stability and upper mixed layer depth (UMLD). These environmental variables were reasonably informative to explain the variability of the phytoplankton communities (44 of variation explained). Cluster and canonical correspondence analyses allowed discrimination of four zones (coastal, Sub-Antarctic, tropical and intermediate zones), also identifiable in the TS diagrams and in the nutrient spatial distribution patterns. The presence of nutrient-rich Sub-Antarctic waters was a major oceanographic feature, associated with diatoms and dinoflagellates. However, in the Sub-Antarctic zone, biomass was particularly low, probably as a result of grazing pressure, as suggested by chemical and biological indicators. In contrast, in oligotrophic tropical waters, phytoplankton was mainly composed by small nanoflagellates and cyanobacteria. A large intermediate zone was also dominated by nanoflagellates, mainly Phaeocystis antarctica, probably favored by strong water column stability. The coastal zone exhibited fairly similar conditions to those in the intermediate zone, but with deeper UMLD, a favorable condition for diatom growth. These results emphasize the importance of the properties of water masses and also biological processes such as grazing in structuring phytoplankton communities in the region.

AB  - Agricultural production in the Canadian Prairies is expected to be negatively affected as climate change projections for the region indicate warmer temperatures, greater incidence and severity of extreme weather events, and reduced water availability and soil moisture. To understand climate change adaption, it is important to explore the learning process that underlies farmer's adaptation practices in the region. Prairie farmers' learning was analyzed using Transformative Learning Theory whereby learning is categorized into three types: instrumental, communicative, and transformative. All producers learned instrumentally to some degree, but farmers who placed less emphasis on maximizing economic returns generally showed secondary learning outcomes correlating economic and environmental benefits. Communicative learning was mainly limited to producer-producer dialogue to the exclusion of other organizational and institutional players in the agricultural system. Critical reflection was explored as an important precursor to transformative learning. Strong evidence of transformative learning was rare (observed in 11% of farmers), but indicators of transformative learning were diverse and was observed in 43% of farmers. Transformative learning is believed to be important for flexible decision-making and autonomous thinking, making it advantageous for responding to changing environmental conditions. The analysis shows that a large number of information sources, and communication of information in an experiential and observable way, is conducive to transformative learning. Adaptation to environmental uncertainty, resulting from changing climatic conditions, may be most effectively dealt with when individual farmers undergo transformative learning whereby underlying assumptions that govern actions, values, and claims to knowledge are questioned.

AB  - In Italy, many lichen species rare at the national level share their ecological requirements with Lobarla pulmonaria. The aim of this work is to test this lichen as a potential indicator for assessing forest sites which are worthy of conservation for lichens in Italy. The hypothesis to be tested is that stands hosting large and viable populations of this lichen also host nationally rare and sensitive lichen species. The study was carried out in two large forested areas of Italy under different bioclimatic conditions and with different forest types: Cansiglio Forest, in NE Italy, and Cilento in SW Italy. Three types of stands characterized by different abundance levels of L. pulmonaria were identified in each site. Ten plots for each type of stand were surveyed in each site, Macrolichens were surveyed on a total of 180 trees. The abundance of L. pulmonaria proved to be a valuable indicator of forest stands hosting nationally rare lichen species and cyanolichens in different forest types and in different bioclimatic conditions. Significant differences in species richness, in the occurrence and abundance of nationally rare lichen species and cyanolichens, and in species composition were found in both sites among stands with different levels of L. pulmonaria. Results are expected to Contribute to the development of more lichen-oriented criteria in nature protection policies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - National Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) for zinc used for the assessment of ecological status in freshwaters have been shown to vary by over two orders of magnitude across 25 European countries. Such variability is unlikely to reflect consistent ecological protection or environmental relevance. Recent European technical guidance on EQS derivation gives an opportunity to derive protective metrics for zinc that are relevant to national water chemistry conditions. To derive a zinc EQS relevant to national water chemistry conditions and account for bioavailability, the new technical guidance requires high-quality spatial and temporal monitoring data. These data must be of water samples with concurrent measures of pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and calcium, the parameters that most influence zinc bioavailability in freshwaters. A national bioavailability-based zinc EQS for France has been derived from Biotic Ligand Model calculations undertaken for freshwaters samples from 4645 sites (22,000 samples with concurrent measures of pH, DOC, calcium) in 96 regions. An EQS of 11.3 mu g Zn L(-1)was derived based on sensitive waters from the Bretagne region typically of circumneutral pH and relatively low DOC and low dissolved calcium. The least sensitive waters to zinc exposures in France are found in the Hauts-De-France, higher pH values than those in Bretagne, similar dissolved organic carbon and higher dissolved calcium. An indicative assessment of compliance showed that across France, 2% of the sites would exceed this bioavailability-based EQS.

AB  - Agriculture is one of the major drivers of ecological degradation in river basins. Excluding stock (cows and sheep) from grazing riverbanks and accessing rivers is one of the most common river restoration activities. To be effective, stock exclusion must be maintained indefinitely. In Australia, and elsewhere, stock exclusion projects are most commonly implemented by establishing voluntary agreements between landholders and government agencies. This study examined the extent to which landholders in 3 catchment management authority (CMA) regions in southeast Australia maintain stock exclusion from waterways, whether vegetation on riverbanks recovered, and the effectiveness of assessment methods. It was found that nearly half of landholders continue to graze stock on the riverbank. There has been some success with improving the condition of riparian vegetation. Sites with full stock exclusion contain the pre-European abundance of juvenile trees, and sites with continued grazing contain significantly lower abundance of juvenile trees. Establishing the effectiveness of management was made more difficult by the inconsistent methods used by the different CMAs. Stock exclusion projects implemented with voluntary agreements have the potential to succeed if oversight is improved between government agencies and CMAs and between CMAs and landholders. Projects will be easier to assess if regional authorities use consistent methods of assessment. Voluntary agreements are only suitable for environmental management if projects are monitored, maintained, and assessed appropriately. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2019;15:237-247. (c) 2018 SETAC

AB  - Neochetina eichhorniae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is one herbivore associated to Eichhornia crassipes and E. azurea floating meadows in native areas. The aims of this study were: (1) to evaluate the feeding preference of adults of N. eichhorniae under natural conditions, using native species of macrophytes that coexist with the two host plants, and (2) to assess feeding preference in relation to nitrogen, phosphorous and lignin content as indicators of the nutritive value of the leaves. The plant species included in this study were: E. crassipes, E. azurea, Oxycaryum cubense, Thalia multiflora, Salvinia biloba, Pistia stratiotes, Ludwigia peploides and Nymphaea prolifera. Double and multiple-feeding choice tests were performed under natural conditions, using feeding rations, including and excluding the host plants. Total damaged area per macrophyte and leaf area damaged by weevil were quantified and correlated with the different nutritional values of leaves. The host plants, with damage area varied between 115 and 284.76 mm(2), were the most preferred plants. There was a positive correlation between the damage area and the leaf nitrogen content of the plant species. Feeding preference was unrelated to either phosphorous and lignin content or L: N ratio. Neochetina eichhorniae have high specificity for both host plants, which leaves had high nitrogen content. Because the effect of the nutritive value on the feeding preference of invertebrate herbivores from the subtropical aquatic systems remain still unknown, these results are an preliminary contribution.

AB  - The health state of nestlings can be a useful bioindicator of the quality of the environment in which they are reared, but, to enable detection of responses to environmental change, the variation of health parameters under natural conditions should be evaluated. We describe the variation of morphological, biochemical, and hematological variables in relation to time of sampling, hatching date, brood size and type, and year in nestlings of two populations of Great Tits (Parus major) in Choupal, Portugal, and Wytham, United Kingdom. The influence of these health variables on nestlings, survival to firstwinter and recruitment into the breeding population was assessed in Wytham. Variation in plasma protein, total plasma cholinesterase (ChE), and acetylcholinesterase activities reflected circadian rhythms. Hatching date affected total plasma ChE and butyry1cholinesterase (BuChE) activities, and levels of red-blood-cell hemoglobin (Hb) and hernatocrit (HCT). In Choupal, HCT increased with brood size. Nestlings in Choupal had significantly lower protein and Hb levels, and higher glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, during a drier year. Second-brood nestlings had significantly lower levels of Hb and HCT. Of the studied variables, only plasma BuChE and red-blood-cell GSH-Px activities were related to nestlings' survival to first winter and recruitment. Received 13 November 2007, accepted 6 June 2008.

AB  - Understanding how biodiversity is influenced by changing atmospheric conditions is important for conservation, public policy and environmental health. In a recent study, an impact on two of the most abundant lichens in Europe (Parmelia sulcata and Hypogymnia physodes) was recorded at Burnham Beeches lying 40 km west of London (UK) during unusual atmospheric conditions whilst other species remained unaffected. Bark and soil chemistry also influence lichen vitality and community composition. Correlations between element concentrations and element ratios in different samples help understand element cycling. To study this further, the multi-element content of the lichen P. sulcata and bark sampled in 2000 from 16 oak (Quercus robur) trees at Burnham Beeches was compared with the same elements determined in 24 surface soils sampled in 2005 from beneath the same trees. Soil pH ranged from 4.1 to 6.7. Highly significant correlations (p<0.001) for Mn/Ca ratios in lichen versus bark, soil versus bark and soil versus lichen samples confirmed cycling via the soil-tree-lichen system. Similar Mn/Ca ratios were reported in coniferous forests where high Mn concentrations were shown to limit epiphytic lichen abundance. Soil acidification influences element bioavailability and bark chemistry in Burnham Beeches with implications for lichen diversity and health. Recovery was recorded in P. sulcata, including regeneration within monitoring quadrats. Biological systems are well known to be influenced by pollution episodes. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The effects of excess nitrogen fertilization on the structure of Scots-pine needles (Pinus sylvestris) were examined in Finnish Lapland. The trees were fertilized with calcium ammonium-nitrate, and the levels of nitrogen applied were 0, 75, 150, 250, 500 and 1000 kg N/ha, respectively. The thickness and width of the needle and thicknesses of the tissues were measured, and the conditions of various celltypes were classified at the light-microscopy level. In addition, the areas of the cell organelles were measured and the conditions of the chloroplasts and other cell compartments observed at the ultrastructural level. Larger needles and a thicker adaxial mesophyll were observed following excess N application (250-1000 kg N/ha). The natural xeromorphic structure of the conifer needles became more mesomorphic, possibly influencing the protection afforded against environmental stresses. A high level of nitrogen fertilization caused changes in the central cylinder, especially in the vascular bundle and the scler-enchyma. The needle nitrogen concentration was high in the highly fertilized trees and the boron concentration was simultaneously extremely low. As a consequence of the changes In the central cylinder, photoassimilate transport from the mesophyll to the phloem may be disturbed at high fertilization levels. The changes at the ultrastructural level, i.e. injuries to the chloroplast thylakoids and the plasma membrane, and the formation of lipid accumulations, were indicators of the adverse effects of excess nitrogen. With an increasing atmospheric-nitrogen load, lower nitrogen fertilization levels in pine forests naturally adapted to low soil N should be considered in forest management.

AB  - In recent times, the supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO(2)) process has attracted increasing attention in fabricating diverse materials due to the attractive features of environmentally benign nature and economically promising character. Owing to these unique characteristics and high-penetrability, as well as diffusivity conditions of scCO(2), this high-pressure technology, with mild operation conditions, cost-effective, and non-toxic, among others, is often applied to fabricate various organic and inorganic-based materials, resulting in the unique crystal architectures (amorphous, crystalline, and heterojunction), tunable architectures (nanoparticles, nanosheets, and aerogels) for diverse applications. In this review, we give an emphasis on the fabrication of various inorganic-based materials, highlighting the recent research on the driving factors for improving the quality of fabrication in scCO(2), procedures for production and dispersion in scCO(2), as well as common indicators utilized to assess quality and processing ability of materials. Next, we highlight the effects of specific properties of scCO(2) towards synthesizing the highly functional inorganic-based nanomaterials. Finally, we summarize this compilation with interesting perspectives, aiming to arouse a more comprehensive utilization of scCO(2) to broaden the horizon in exploring the green/eco-friendly processing of such versatile inorganic-based materials. Together, we firmly believe that this compilation endeavors to disclose the latent capability and universal prevalence of scCO(2) in the synthesis and processing of inorganic-based materials.

AB  - Defining the ecological impacts of water extraction from free-flowing river systems in altered landscapes is challenging as multiple stressors (e.g., flow regime alteration, increased sedimentation) may have simultaneous effects and attributing causality is problematic. This multiple-stressor context has been acknowledged in environmental flows science, but is often neglected when it comes to examining flow-ecology relationships, and setting and implementing environmental flows. We examined the impacts of land and water use on rivers in the upper Ringarooma River catchment in Tasmania (south-east Australia), which contains intensively irrigated agriculture, to support implementation of a water management plan. Temporal and spatial and trends in river condition were assessed using benthic macroinvertebrates as bioindicators. Relationships between macroinvertebrate community structure and environmental variables were examined using univariate and multivariate analyses, focusing on the impacts of agricultural land use and water use. Structural changes in macroinvertebrate communities in rivers in the catchment indicated temporal and spatial declines in the ecological condition of some stretches of river associated with agricultural land and water use. Moreover, water extraction appeared to exacerbate impairment associated with agricultural land use (e.g., reduced macroinvertebrate density, more flow-avoiding taxa). The findings of our catchment-specific bioassessments will underpin decision-making during the implementation of the Ringarooma water management plan, and highlight the need to consider compounding impacts of land and water use in environmental flows and water planning in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - A semi-empirical model has been used to estimate total net primary productivity, canopy transpiration and the water use efficiency under actual and future climate projections (B1 and A2 IPCC Scenarios) of two deciduous (Fagus sylvatica, Quercus cerris) and one evergreen tree species (Quercus ilex) growing in Italy. In response to changes in the air temperature, the two deciduous species showed a strong reduction of NPP values, whereas the evergreen one showed very limited reductions. Under future warmer conditions, Q. ilex proved to be the best adapted species, probably for its drought-tolerant water-saving strategy, while Q. cerris suffered a reduction of transpiration, due to stomatal closure which was sensitive to the change of evaporative demand. Water Use Efficiency (WUE) values did not increase in the B1 and A2 scenarios, indicating a non-conservative water-saving strategy, which likely affected the distribution pattern of Q. cerris under these conditions. Similar functional behaviour have been noted for F. sylvatica, although this species adopted a water spending strategy, typical of species growing in mesic environments, that could represent a risk for survival of beech population under extreme air temperature change. In this respect, the reduced suitable area for this species under the A2 scenario could reduce the possibilities of an upward shift toward higher altitudes.

AB  - Subterranean ecosystems often harbour unique and specialised biocoenoses of considerable scientific interest and high potential conservation value. In view of the peculiar species assemblage in the abandoned tunnels of a talc mine complex in the north-western Italian Alps (Germanasca Valley, Province of Turin, NW Italy), the aims of the present work were (i) to investigate the subterranean invertebrate fauna, (ii) to assess the impact of tourism activities on the invertebrate fauna, and (iii) to assess the conservation value of the terrestrial invertebrate community and associated habitats. The study was carried out at four sites: one tunnel restored for tourism purposes; two abandoned tunnels; and a wild cave. The results of several statistical analyses, including ANOVA, PCA and CCA, showed that the eutrophic conditions induced by past human activity could improve the quality of the subterranean habitat. On the other hand, a massive intervention for tourism purposes could seriously jeopardise the survival of the most sensitive species. The increased thermic instability and mean temperature had a significant negative effect on the local populations of cave-dwelling arthropods, whose ecological optimum is determined primarily by low thermic instability, cold temperatures and intermediate conditions of eutrophy. On the basis of our results we strongly recommend to avoid thermic isolation of any part of tunnels, as it is the primary factor affecting the most sensitive species. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

AB  - We examined a suite of paleoindicators in Pb-210-dated sediment cores to determine the historical course of primary production, eutrophication, and oxygen stress in the coastal ocean adjacent to the plumes of the Mississippi and Atchafalaya rivers. The assumption that hypoxia is a natural feature of the coastal ecosystem in the northern Gulf of Mexico influenced by the discharge of the Mississippi River system is not supported by paleoindicators in accumulated sediments. There is a propensity for the ecosystem to develop hypoxia because of the high discharge of the Mississippi River and physical dynamics on the continental shelf that support stratification. However, paleoindicators of eutrophication and oxygen conditions record recent anthropogenic influences. The evidence for increased carbon production and accumulation comes from diatoms and their remnants, marine-origin carbon in the sediments, and phytoplankton pigments. Surrogates for oxygen condition, including mineral, isotopic, microfossil, and phytoplankton pigment indicators, indicate worsening oxygen stress. The changes are more apparent in areas of present chronic hypoxia and are coincident with the increasing nitrogen loads from the Mississippi River system beginning in the 1950s. Longer-term shifts in offshore ecology parallel landscape changes within the watershed in the last two centuries. The temporal shifts in this coastal ecosystem parallel the time sequence of similarly eutrophied coastal waters globally and coincide nicely with sediment analyses from other locations.

AB  - The inventory diversity of Coleoptera (Insecta) of an anthropized landscape in the Biome Araucaria. The species richness, taxonomic composition, rare species, and taxonomic constancy at family level were studied in communities of Coleoptera in Vila Velha, Ponta Grossa, Parana, as part of PROVIVE project. The data were gathered through malaise traps in the understory stratum of five sites with different floristic conditions product of anthropogenic effects, from Septernber/1999 to August/2000. The 52 weeks sampling in the five sites produced 10,822 specimens of 1,659 species. All areas present high species richness and high diversity as indicated by various indices. The area in advanced condition of vegetation succession was less rich than ones in early/middle stage. According to different species richness estimators, the number of observed species could be increased by 22-123% if more time colleting effort had been made. The early successional stage areas were richer in rare species (singletons, doubletons and uniques) than the more preserved ones. In the five areas there were a taxonomic constancy among the richest families (Curculionidae, Chrysomelidae, Cerambycidae, Staphylinidae, Mordelidae, Elateridae, Scarabaeidae, Coccinellidae and Tenebrionidae) involving 60% of the total species as observed with the specimens abundance. If the existence of this pattern is confirmed, it will be easier and faster to study Coleoptera communities and soon apply this order as a forest environmental indicator taxon.

AB  - The toxicity and estrogenicity of a final treated municipal effluent was examined while flowing through a constructed wetland in north-central Texas. USA. Fish data were collected, and a baseline wetland characterization was performed to assess wetland treatment potential for these effluent properties. Vitellogenin (VTG), gonadosomatic index (GSI), hepatosomatic index (HSI), and secondary sexual characteristics were biomarkers used in fish models to assess aqueous estrogenicity. Biological indicators used to assess overall fish health included hematocrit and condition factor. Estrogenic nature of final sewage treatment works effluent was screened. concurrent with a three-week fish exposure, via gas chromatography/mass spectrometry for target estrogenic compounds, including 17 beta -estradiol, ethynylestradiol, bisphenol A, nonylphenolic compounds, phthalates, and DDT. The VTG in Pimephales promelas was measured after exposure at four sites in a treatment wetland and was significantly elevated (p < 0.0001) in fish exposed at the inflow site. The GSIs were significantly less (alpha = 0.001) at the inflow site. At wetland sites closest to the inflow, secondary sexual characteristics, tubercle numbers, and fatpad thickness were less (alpha = 0.0001) than in laboratory controls. The HSIs and density of male breeding stripes were not significantly different from those of laboratory controls. However, elevated HSIs were found at the inflow site. Hematocrit and condition factors were both less (alpha = 0.001) in effluent-ex posed fish at wetland sites closer to the inflow than in control fish or fish further downstream.

AB  - Anthropogenic derived stressors are known to affect seagrasses. Cymodocea nodosa, a widespread sea grass in the Mediterranean Sea with high phenotypic plasticity, is known to acclimatize rapidly to prevailing environmental conditions. To use this species in the biomonitoring of anthropogenic stress, physiological (effective quantum yield of photosystem II [Delta F/Fm'], maximum quantum yield [Fv/Fm], and maximum fluorescence [Fm]), phenological (leaf length and width, number of leaves per shoot), and biochemical (Chl-a, and Carbon, Nitrogen, Phosphorus contents of leaves) metrics were measured between two meadows under different levels of anthropogenic influence in the Kavala Gulf, North Aegean Sea. To reduce bias and separate seasonality from anthropogenic stress responses the physiological parameters were measured under constant laboratory conditions and a hierarchical sampling design was employed. Two well-described meadows, one pristine (Brasidas) and one under significant anthropogenic stress (Nea Karvali), were sampled on six occasions between June 2007 and March 2009 at three spatial scales ranging from hundreds of meters (area) to kilometer (site) to 10s of kilometers (meadow). Of the twelve metrics measured, N-content and Fm were the most effective at discriminating between the two C. nodosa meadows and, therefore, should be considered as promising bioindicators. Statistically significant differences were identified between the cold and hot periods for almost all metrics measured, suggesting that seasonality is a key driver of the observed responses.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to present part of the research results in developing an adaptation process to cope with flood risk in coastal cities under the impact of climate change variability and rapid urbanization in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.
   Design/methodology/approach - Two main assessment tools applied in this research are rapid vulnerability assessment and tool for environmental assessment and management.
   Findings - Under the same natural conditions, people living in more urbanized districts suffer with more inundation and risks from polluted floodwater than those who live in less urbanized districts. Notwithstanding, people in lower urbanized districts are more vulnerable since they have a low capacity to cope with flood and pollution due to flood-prone living conditions, poverty and lack of awareness on the changing variability and water pollution. Gender analysis in this research has found that men and women play different roles in coping with hazards, and women suffer with more risks than men especially in term of health, sexual harassment, and increasing responsibility.
   Practical implications - The adaptation process should focus on integrating vulnerability assessment findings appropriately with the assessment tools and gender analysis in order to develop as well as implement adaptation measures effectively and efficiently. This adaptation process should also be applied for other countries having different contexts of development under different levels of projected climate change-related risks.
   Originality/value - This research contributes in developing the process on adaptation to possible hazards related to climate change, especially for coastal communities of Vietnam and developing countries where the urbanization process is increasing rapidly.

AB  - This paper refers to the effects of large-scale seasonal fluctuations as well as experimentally induced small-scale variations of soil temperature and moisture on the structural and functional characteristics of a soil nematode community from a Greek Mediterranean grassland. Two levels of soil temperature, with a mean difference of 1.4 degrees C, and two levels of moisture (2.3 % difference in water content) were created. The experiment lasted for a six-month period (from July to December).
   All nematode community parameters vary significantly with season, with the exception of the environmental constant (C-env), which reflects the intensity of competition. The Maturity Index (MI) is affected only by seasonally fluctuating soil conditions, while the Plant Parasite Index (PPI) is affected only by the small-scale differences in soil temperature and moisture. The high value (1.48) of bacterivorous to fungivorous ratio (B/F) indicates mainly bacterial mediated decomposition, resulting in good soil fertility. The B/F ratio is affected both by large and small-scale changes in soil conditions. Diversity and richness show dependence on seasonal variations as well as on small changes in temperature, while no effect of moisture is recorded. The correlations between nematode community parameters, microflora parameters and soil nitrogen pools show independence of nematode parameters from soil N-pools (N-organic and N-inorganic) and parameters relating to microflora, as well as strong dependence on microbially-bounded nitrogen.

AB  - Unlike Lake Urmia, its two neighbor lakes with similar climate and size have experienced stabilized condition over the past decades. Actually, greater impact of anthropological activities, compared to climatological parameters, on hydrological and ecological systems of Lake Urmia has been stated in the literature. In this paper, the impact of a recently constructed causeway on this lake is studied using environmental impact assessment approach. This study evaluates different alternatives for future re-development plans and clearly proves the importance of preliminary environmental studies during the design development phase of infrastructure projects. The depth-averaged flow module of NASIR finite volume solver was utilized to simulate the horizontal flow patterns in Lake Urmia. Considering hydrological and meteorological parameters, different scenarios regarding location and number of causeway openings (current opening location, opening in the middle of causeway, and 2 openings) were compared to the condition before causeway construction. Discharge values of 21 streams, average monthly evaporation of 5.93 mm/day and average monthly precipitation of 0.4 m/day were considered as input data of the developed model. The simulation results showed that horizontal flow circulations occur mostly on the southern part of the lake and the causeway opening variations generally affect the form of these circulations. In the scenario with causeway and only one opening in the middle, flow circulations present the most comparability to the lake's flow circulation pattern before causeway construction, whereas the scenario with 2 openings has the least similarities.

AB  - Various uncertainties are involved in the representation of processes that characterize interactions among societal needs, ecosystem functioning, and hydrological conditions. Here we develop an empirical uncertainty assessment of water security indicators that characterize scarcity and vulnerability, based on a multimodel and resampling framework. We consider several uncertainty sources including those related to (i) observed streamflow data; (ii) hydrological model structure; (iii) residual analysis; (iv) the method for defining Environmental Flow Requirement; (v) the definition of critical conditions for water provision; and (vi) the critical demand imposed by human activities. We estimate the overall hydrological model uncertainty by means of a residual bootstrap resampling approach, and by uncertainty propagation through different methodological arrangements applied to a 291 km(2) agricultural basin within the Cantareira water supply system in Brazil. Together, the two-component hydrograph residual analysis and the block bootstrap resampling approach result in a more accurate and precise estimate of the uncertainty (95% confidence intervals) in the simulated time series. We then compare the uncertainty estimates associated with water security indicators using a multimodel framework and the uncertainty estimates provided by each model uncertainty estimation approach. The range of values obtained for the water security indicators suggests that the models/methods are robust and performs well in a range of plausible situations. The method is general and can be easily extended, thereby forming the basis for meaningful support to end-users facing water resource challenges by enabling them to incorporate a viable uncertainty analysis into a robust decision-making process.

AB  - The distribution patterns of epiphytic diatom assemblages in three montane mires in central China were investigated to examine their relationships with selected environmental variables (pH and depth to water table, DWT). Two of the mires are considered to be in good ecological condition (Dajiuhu and Qizimeishan Mires) while Erxianyan Mire is extensively affected by acid deposition and human activities. A total of 206 taxa belonging to 56 genera were found in 44 Sphagnum samples. Multivariate analysis revealed that pH and DWT were significantly correlated with diatom distribution. In Erxianyan Mire, the characteristic taxa (Eunotia minor and Eunotia intermedia) had lower pH optima and may therefore be useful indicators of highly-acidic conditions. In Dajiuhu Mire, the dominant species had higher pH optima, and abundant xerotolerant taxa (Hantzschia amphioxys, Pinnularia borealis, Luticola mutica and Diadesmis contenta) were observed. In the partial canonical correspondence analyses with mire location as a covariable, the correlation between diatom data and pH was insignificant, likely because pH differences between mires were greater than those within mires. In contrast, diatom data were significantly correlated with DWT, suggesting that diatoms are good sensors of hydrological variability along the hollow to hummock gradient. Together, these data can expand current autecological information for these potential diatom indicator species, which is critical for refining our interpretations of bio-monitoring and palaeolimnological studies in montane mires.

AB  - Benthic foraminifera (protists) have long been recognized as sensitive indicators in studies on natural and human-induced environmental, paleo-environmental, and climate change. These wide-ranging applications are founded on more than a century of field-based investigations in which environmental data were related to species distributions, and have subsequently been refined by the development of chemical proxies and a variety of culture-based studies. The recent discovery of foraminiferal propagule banks that occur in the fine-sediment fraction of marine depositional settings provides a novel experimental tool for examining the ecology of benthic foraminifera, their processes of dispersal, and the responses of multi-species assemblages to changing environmental conditions. In the 'propagule method' presented here, we use experimental arrays in which foraminifera are grown from propagule banks under different controlled abiotic conditions. We examined the roles of temperature, salinity, and site (exposed vs. protected) in structuring coastal assemblages and show that, because individual species respond differently, distinct assemblages grew from the same propagule bank under different environmental regimes. Temperature was the most important factor distinguishing experimental assemblages, whereas exposure of the collection site (e.g. to waves and currents, that promote or limit species dispersal to and from each site) was most important in determining species richness. The diversity of the propagule bank therefore imparts resilience to foraminiferal associations and provides a rapid-response mechanism for changing environments. This method further provides a tool for documenting changes in coastal assemblages that potentially result from warming or cooling climates.

AB  - The compost bedded pack barns is a loose housing confinement system for dairy cows, which aims to provide greater comfort in the resting area. Therefore, objective of this review was to investigate the environment, behavior and welfare aspects of dairy cows in the compost bedded pack barns system. The system is characterized by the large collective bed area, in which the objective is the composting of that area. In this way, the ideal bed management is the key point to the success of this system. In addition to daily revolving, an efficient ventilation system is required to perform the air exchange in the shed, and maintain adequate bed humidity levels, while maintaining a comfortable dry environment for the cows to lie down. The ventilation system also has great importance in the cows' thermal comfort. In seasons of high average temperatures, ventilation reduces possible stress situations, raising the animals' welfare level. Another characteristic of compost bedded pack barns is the greater spacing per animal in the bed area, allowing animals to express naturally the behavior of lying down and decrease the competition among animals. The compost bedded pack barns system presents the potential to provide comfort and welfare for dairy cows. However, good bed management and microclimatic environmental conditions are necessary. However, further studies are needed at the national level to provide more information on the ideal management of the system under climatic conditions in Brazil and the cows' behavior in the system.

AB  - Side scanning evaluation technology (SSET) is a visual inspection technique for sewer pipelines. It provides both frontal and 360 degree images of the interior surface of the pipe wall. Image-based pipe defect classification has been widely used for rating sewage structural conditions. The classification of defects in sewer pipe is of vital importance for maintaining the sewerage systems. Usually, a human operator identifies the defect types from the acquired images. However, the diagnosis can be easily influenced by the subjective human factors. To overcome such limitations, a reliable automated sewer pipe defect classification is highly desirable. In this paper, a sewer pipe defect classification based on ensemble methods is proposed. Due to the natural shape irregularities of pipe defects and the complexity of imaging environments, pipe defect images are highly variable. A feature extraction procedure consisting of contourlet transform and the maximum response filter bank is implemented in the proposed method. A feature vector is generated with the statistical features derived from the outputs of contourlet transform and maximum response filter bank. Four ensemble classifiers are trained to classify the feature vector to assign a defect type to the input pipe image. The best ensemble method, namely RobBoot, achieves the highest classification rates in the experiments with 239 pipe images obtained by the SSET inspection. The effectiveness and performance of the proposed method are demonstrated by comparing with other state-of-the-art techniques.

AB  - Throughout the Proterozoic delta 13C values for preserved n-alkyl lipids are more positive than for syngenetic kerogen. This pattern is the inverse of biosynthetic expectations. It has been suggested that this isotopic inversion results from selective preservation of lipids from 13C-enriched heterotrophic populations, while the bulk of kerogen derives from primary producers. Here, we formulate a degradation model to calculate the 13C content of sedimentary total organic carbon and lipid. The model addresses two scenarios. The first scenario explores preferential preservation of heterotrophic lipid, thereby quantifying the existing hypothesis. In the second, we suggest that an inverse signature could be the result of prokaryotic phytoplankton contributing the majority of the total ecosystem biomass. Photosynthetic prokaryotes bearing a relative 13C enrichment would contribute much of the resulting preserved lipids, while primary eukaryotic biomass would dominate the total organic carbon. We find that our hypothesis of a mixed primary producer community generates inverse isotopic patterns while placing far fewer requirements on specific degradation conditions. It also provides a possible explanation as to why there are large variations in the 13C content of the isoprenoid lipids pristane and phytane relative to n-alkyl lipid, while the difference between n-alkyl lipid and kerogen is more constant. Our results suggest that the disappearance of the inverse 13C signature in the late Ediacaran is a natural consequence of the fundamental shift to oceans in which export production has a higher ratio of eukaryotic biomass.

T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
LA  - English
AB  - A five year Environmental Monitoring Programme (EMP) was set up in east-Australian coastal waters to determine the environmental effects of diverting most of Sydney's primary treated sewage from cliff face outfalls to diffuser outfall systems some 3 km offshore in 60-80 m of water. Many component EMT studies adopted Before and After Control Impact (BACI and 'beyond BACI') designs, to isolate outfall impacts on the marine ecosystem from background variability. Although seasonal patterns dominated ambient conditions in coastal waters, long-term climatic signals, such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), were apparent during the EMT. The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) indicated the two year post-commissioning study period of 1991-1993 was dominated by an El Nino episode, while the 1989-1990 pre-commissioning period experienced a La Nina episode. Anomalous rainfall conditions and ocean temperature structure were associated with these episodes with respect to long-term records. Rainfall patterns suggested that the pre-commissioning period experienced high rainfall causing an increased incidence of stormwater pollution in coastal waters. Effects of the lower rain levels during post-commissioning phase were, however, outweighed by the dramatic improvements due to the commissioning of the deepwater outfalls. Decreased thermal stratification was experienced during the winter months of the 1992-1993 El Nino episode, and promoted increased dilutions associated with a greater frequency in sewage plume surfacing. There was, however, no apparent short-term effect of this change in plume behaviour on the marine environment as measured by EMP indicators. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Coastal regions can be very sensitive areas depending on their environmental conditions. The best indicator of this situation is the shoreline that has changed over the years. The Mediterranean is an inner sea with a long sandy beach. This beach, which had completely natural conditions in the past, has been under the influence of different uses in recent years including agricultural and other man-made uses. In this study, the aim was to evaluate the coastal movement pattern over the period between 1948 and 2020 (72 years) under different uses according to the current situation. Part of the 4.5 km long coastline that constitutes the study area is subject to industrial use (Track 2) and the other part remains natural (Track 1). It was observed that the pattern determined in the Track 1 field was more regular than the situation in Track 2, and the coastal change in all time intervals was created by the sea. On the other hand, it was observed that the shoreline change in Track 2 was more irregular and that the change in the shoreline between 1969 and 1985 was on the sea side compared to the current coastline (2020), and the others remained on the land side. The results showed that the uses in the coastal zone have affected the change in the shoreline over the years and that these patterns of change can be determined with appropriate dated and scaled aerial photographs and satellite data.

AB  - Nucleic acid-derived indices such as RNA/DNA ratios have been successfully applied as ecophysiological indicators to assess growth, nutritional condition and health status in marine organisms given that they provide a measure of tissue protein reserves, which is known to vary depending on changes in the environment. Yet, the use of these biochemical indices on highly mobile large predators is scarce. In this study, we tested the applicability of using nucleic acids to provide insights on the ecophysiological traits of two marine mammal species (common bottlenose dolphins and short-finned pilot whales) and explored potential related factors (species, sex, season, and residency pattern), using skin tissue (obtained from biopsy darts) of apparently healthy and adult free-ranging animals. Significantly higher RNA/DNA ratios were obtained for bottlenose dolphins (p<0.001), and for visitor pilot whales when compared with resident pilot whales (p=0.001). No significant changes were found between the sexes. Based on the percentile approach, the samples contain individuals in a general good condition (as the 10(th) percentile is not closer to the mean than the 75(th) percentile), suggesting that the studied region of Macaronesia may be considered an adequate habitat. The combination of this effective tool with genetic sexing and photographic-identification provided an overall picture of ecosystem health, and although with some limitations and still being a first approach, it has the applicability to be used in other top predators and ecosystems.

AB  - A fundamental hypothesis for the evolution and maintenance of ornamental traits is that ornaments convey information to choosing females about the quality of prospective mates. A diverse array of ornaments (e. g., colors, morphological features, and behaviors) has been associated with a wide range of measures of individual quality, but decades of study of such indicator traits have failed to produce general mechanisms of honest signaling. Here, I propose that efficiency of cellular respiration, as a product of mitochondrial function, underlies the associations between ornamentation and performance for a broad range of traits across taxa. A large biomedical literature documents the fundamental biochemical links between oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the process of metabolism, the function of the immune system, the synthesis of proteins, and the development and function of the nervous system. The production of virtually all ornaments whose expressions have been demonstrated to be condition-dependent is directly affected by the efficiency of cellular respiration, suggesting that the signaling of respiratory efficiency may be the primary function of such traits. Furthermore, the production of ornaments links to stress-response systems, including particularly the neuroendocrine system, through mitochondrial function, thereby makes ornamental traits effective signals of the capacity to withstand environmental perturbations. The identification of a unifying mechanism of honest signaling holds the potential to connect many heretofore-disparate fields of study related to stress and ornamentation, including neuroendocrinology, respiratory physiology, metabolic physiology, and immunology.

AB  - A probabilistic model was used to simulate the short- and long-term reliability of the treatment plant in relation to the sedimentation of activated sludge. In this model, it was assumed that the quantity and quality of wastewater flowing into the treatment plant and weather conditions are stochastic. While, the control variables are: the activated sludge concentration, the oxygen concentration in the nitrification chamber and the coagulant dose. The model includes the possibility of failure of wastewater quality analyzers, which are also of random nature. The probabilistic model presented in the paper consists of three components. The first of them is a classification model to identify the sedimentation capacity of activated sludge. The second component consists of generators of quantity, quality of wastewater, as well as weather conditions based on the Monte Carlo method. The third component is a failure generator for wastewater quality analyzers at the inlet to a wastewater treatment plant. Using the developed probabilistic model at work, a number of bioreactor optimization strategies were analyzed in a long-term (1 y) perspective. The analyzes carried out confirmed that the proposed probabilistic model is a valuable tool for optimizing the operation of wastewater treatment plants and allows the assessment of the impact of dynamic changes in the reactor control variables on the reliability of the facility's operation in long-term and short-term.

AB  - Soil food webs, which are responsible for relevant ecological functions in agroecosystems such as nutrient cycling and pest and disease suppression, represent a crucial aspect of agricultural sustainability. We studied soil properties and microfaunal food web diversity and functioning in six paired organic and conventional fields located in Central Spain to assess the effects of organic farming on soil diversity and functioning in semi-arid conditions. We hypothesized that organic farming may enhance functioning of soil food webs. Our results showed larger differences between crop types, namely olive groves and vineyards, than between farming scheme, i.e. organic and conventional fields, and few benefits of organic farming in terms of soil fertility. Soil properties (total N, C, and P, available P and K, electrical conductivity, NH4+, NO3-, soil moisture, pH) tended to present higher values in vineyards than in olive groves and in conventional than in organic fields. Some plant-parasitic nematodes were associated to organic fields, especially in vineyards, and all soils fell within a degraded soil food web condition, with low Structure and Enrichment Index values. Nematode metabolic footprints showed relevant seasonal dynamics, with the more intensive herbivore activity in spring. We conclude that the lack of conventional pesticides and mineral fertilizers is probably not enough to improve soil conservation in semi-arid Mediterranean agroecosystems, and thus active soil conservation practices, as reduced tillage or cover cropping, are required to increase agroecosystem sustainability.

AB  - Oceanographical processes, such as upwelling, induce variations in nutrient availability in marine ecosystems, and evidence indicates that nutrient input can strongly influence the physiological activities, structure, and dynamics of marine communities. Intertidal organisms have long been considered ideal study units in which to quantify the relationship of physical variations and differential energy allocations in specimens that undergo environmental variations, such as observed with nutrient availability. In habitats with differential nutrient input (upwelling versus non-upwelling), both food availability (algae abundance) and seasonal gonadal and foot weight variations were determined in the keyhole limpet Fissurella crassa. Gonadal weight is used as a measure of reproduction allocation whereas foot weight is an indirect indicator of energy allocation towards survival. RNA: DNA ratio in limpets was used as an indicator of biosynthetic capability. Our results indicate that, in general, algae abundance, muscular foot weight, and gonadal weight were higher in upwelling sites during all seasons studied. The same result was found for RNA: DNA ratios. Energetic allocation in animals that inhabit intertidal upwelling habitats supported a constant allocation towards reproduction and soft tissues. In contrast, animals that inhabit non-upwelling habitats showed important energetic restrictions associated with higher water temperature and lower food availability. Our results clearly show that in the keyhole limpet F. crassa food availability is a more important determinant of an individual's condition than a physical variation such as environment temperature.

AB  - The use of lake macrophytes for ecological quality assessments usually seeks to indicate the degree of anthropogenic impact, but few of these schemes implicitly consider impacts of alien weeds. LakeSPI (submerged plant indicators) uses indicators of habitat degradation for macrophytes but also incorporates the degree of impact from alien weeds. Application of LakeSPI to 195 New Zealand lakes provided a dataset to examine how component metrics responded over gradients of anthropogenic pressures, and consider whether weed invasion was merely a 'passenger' of habitat degradation, or represented an additional pressure. As expected, metrics measuring depth, and diversity of native vegetation negatively correlated with independent measures of lake eutrophy and were also relatively well explained (69-78% variation) by multiple regression with lake and catchment attributes that included proxies for anthropogenic pressure. In contrast, metrics for invasive impact were largely de-coupled from eutrophication, and poorly explained (31%) by the multiple regression. The response of native vegetation metrics to invasive impact measures varied, with the strongest detected interaction relating to native displacement by increased weed occupation of the vegetated zone. Interactions between invasion and lake trophic status were also discerned, with the extent of weed occupation having a more substantial outcome for the presence of charophyte meadows in low productivity lakes than in more productive lakes. These results suggest weed invasion should be considered as an additional source of anthropogenic pressure, and incorporated in macrophyte bioassessment schemes for a more complete differentiation of lake ecological condition.

AB  - Circadian clocks synchronize internal processes with environmental cycles to ensure optimal timing of biological events on daily and seasonal time scales. External light and temperature cues set the core molecular oscillator to local conditions. In Arabidopsis, EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3) is thought to act as an evening-specific repressor of light signals to the clock, thus serving a zeitnehmer function. Circadian rhythms were examined in completely dark-grown, or etiolated, null elf3-1 seedlings, with the clock entrained by thermocycles, to evaluate whether the elf3 mutant phenotype was light-dependent. Circadian rhythms were absent from etiolated elf3-1 seedlings after exposure to temperature cycles, and this mutant failed to exhibit classic indicators of entrainment by temperature cues, consistent with global clock dysfunction or strong perturbation of temperature signaling in this background. Warm temperature pulses failed to elicit acute induction of temperature responsive genes in elf3-1. In fact, warm temperature-responsive genes remained in a constitutively "ON" state because of clock dysfunction and, therefore, were insensitive to temperature signals in the normal time of day-specific manner. These results show ELF3 is broadly required for circadian clock function regardless of light conditions, where ELF3 activity is needed by the core oscillator to allow progression from day to night during either light or temperature entrainment. Furthermore, robust circadian rhythms appear to be a prerequisite for etiolated seedlings to respond correctly to temperature signals.

AB  - The halophilic archaeon Haloarcula marismortui contains three ribosomal RNA operons, designated rrnA, rrnB, and rrnC. Operons A and C are virtually identical, whereas operon B presents a high divergence in nucleotide sequence, having up to 135 nucleotide polymorphisms among the three 16S, 23S, and 5S ribosomal RNA genes. Quantitative PCR and structural analyses have been performed to elucidate whether the presence of this intragenomic heterogeneity could be an adaptation to the variable environmental conditions in the natural habitat of H. marismortui. Variation in salt concentration did not affect expression but variation in incubation temperature did produce significant changes, with operon B displaying an expression level four times higher than the other two together at 50 degrees C and three times lower at 15 degrees C. We show that the putative promoter region of operon B is also different. In addition, the predicted secondary structure of these genes indicated that they have distinct stabilities at different temperatures and a mutant strain lacking operon B grew slower at high temperatures. This study supports the idea that divergent rRNA genes can be adaptive, with different variants being functional under different environmental conditions (e.g., temperature). The same phenomenon could take place in other halophiles or thermophiles with intragenomic rDNA heterogeneity, where the use of 16S rDNA as a phylogenetic marker and indicator of biodiversity should be used with caution.

AB  - Simple Summary Brick kilns are difficult environments in which to maintain a high level of equid welfare, with equids experiencing poor nutrition, inadequate veterinary care, wounds and musculoskeletal problems from ill-fitting equipment used to transport heavy loads-all of which are exacerbated by hot and dusty working conditions. The Equid Assessment, Research and Scoping (EARS) tool was used to understand the health, behaviour, nutrition, housing and working conditions of working equids in Nepalese brick kilns to better understand ways of improving their welfare. The information gathered using the EARS tool was summarised using the Welfare Aggregation and Guidance (WAG) tool to pinpoint areas of welfare concern and suggest possible mitigation strategies. Overall, results indicate that to improve the welfare of equids working in Nepalese brick kilns, there should be better access to clean water, both when working and stabled, which would improve nutritional welfare. Equipment should be removed during rest periods, which may reduce the number of scars and swellings observed. There should be improvements to the housing regime to allow the equids to rest and recuperate. We show that the attitudes of handlers towards their equid has an impact on the welfare conditions of the equid and suggest training programs to address this, specifically focusing on the impacts of using harmful practices such as hobbling or tethering. Equids fulfil many different roles within communities. In low- to middle-income countries (LMICs), in addition to providing a source of income, equids also provide essential transport of food, water, and goods to resource-limited and/or isolated communities that might otherwise lack access. The aim of this investigation was to understand the welfare conditions that donkeys, mules, and horses are exposed to whilst working in Nepalese brick kilns. To understand the welfare conditions of equids in Nepalese brick kilns, the Welfare Aggregation and Guidance (WAG) tool in conjunction with the Equid Assessment, Research and Scoping (EARS) tool was used to understand the health, behaviour, nutrition, living and working conditions in brick kilns. Further analysis of individual EARS responses focused on key indicator questions relating to demographic information was used to investigate specific areas of welfare concern and attitudes of handlers towards their equids. Trained staff carried out welfare assessments between December 2018 and April 2019. The information gathered using the EARS tool was summarised using the WAG tool to pinpoint areas of welfare concern and suggest possible strategies to mitigate poor welfare conditions and suggest areas to improve the welfare of equids. Overall, the results indicate that to improve the welfare of equids working in Nepalese brick kilns, there should be better provision of clean water, both when working and stabled, equipment should be removed and shade provided during rest periods, with improvements made to housing to allow the equids to rest and recuperate when not working. Further work should also focus on collaborating with owners and equid handlers to improve their attitudes and practices towards their equids. Such improvements can be implemented via training of equid handlers and kiln owners whilst using the EARS and WAG tools to provide a sound basis on which to monitor the effectiveness and impact of education programs on equid welfare.

AB  - Beach erosion is a natural process that occurs when conveying sediment away from the shoreline is not balanced by depositing new material on the shoreline. This is a problem that is causing beach areas to decline. To avoid beach erosion and flooding, a sea wall and groin have been built. Shoreline evolution prediction is used to investigate the beach topography in the future. There are three phenomena give a large effect to the coastal structure such as the erosion, the accretion and the water level changes. To investigate of beach erosion and beach deposition is needed qualitative understanding of idealized shoreline response to the governing process. In this research, we introduce a governing equation of a one-dimensional shoreline evolution model when a couple of groins is added. The introduced model is a transient one-line model. The manipulation of physical parameters for the model is introduced. The setting method of the initial condition and the boundary conditions techniques when a couple of groin structure effect are also proposed. The traditional forward time centered space method and the unconditionally stable Saulyev finite difference methods are employed to approximate the incremental model in each year. The proposed numerical models give practically simulation for long-term shoreline evolution investigation. The proposed simulation can be used to predict the efficiency of a groin system construction in a local beach. The model is a tool for environment impact assessment of a installing groin structure project.

AB  - In recent years, a number of wearable approaches have been introduced for objective monitoring of cigarette smoking based on monitoring of hand gestures, breathing or cigarette lighting events. However, non-reactive, objective and accurate measurement of everyday cigarette consumption in the wild remains a challenge. This study utilizes a wearable sensor system (Personal Automatic Cigarette Tracker 2.0, PACT2.0) and proposes a method that integrates information from an instrumented lighter and a 6-axis Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) on the wrist for accurate detection of smoking events. The PACT2.0 was utilized in a study of 35 moderate to heavy smokers in both controlled (1.5-2 h) and unconstrained free-living conditions (similar to 24 h). The collected dataset contained approximately 871 h of IMU data, 463 lighting events, and 443 cigarettes. The proposed method identified smoking events from the cigarette lighter data and estimated puff counts by detecting hand-to-mouth gestures (HMG) in the IMU data by a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation on the data from the controlled portion of the study achieved high accuracy and F1-score of smoking event detection and estimation of puff counts (97%/98% and 93%/86%, respectively). The results of validation in free-living demonstrate 84.9% agreement with self-reported cigarettes. These results suggest that an IMU and instrumented lighter may potentially be used in studies of smoking behavior under natural conditions.

AB  - In many regions of the world, intensive livestock farming has become a significant source of organic river pollution. As the international meat trade is growing rapidly, the environmental impacts of meat production within one country can occur either domestically or internationally. The goal of this paper is to quantify the impacts of the international meat trade on global organic river pollution at multiple scales (national, regional and gridded). Using the biological oxygen demand (BOD) as an overall indicator of organic river pollution, we compute the spatially distributed organic pollution in global river networks with and without a meat trade, where the without-trade scenario assumes that meat imports are replaced by local production. Our analysis reveals a reduction in the livestock population and production of organic pollutants at the global scale as a result of the international meat trade. However, the actual environmental impact of trade, as quantified by in-stream BOD concentrations, is negative; i. e. we find a slight increase in polluted river segments. More importantly, our results show large spatial variability in local (grid-scale) impacts that do not correlate with local changes in BOD loading, which illustrates: (1) the significance of accounting for the spatial heterogeneity of hydrological processes along river networks, and (2) the limited value of looking at country-level or global averages when estimating the actual impacts of trade on the environment.

AB  - The observation of phenological events can be used as biological indicator of environmental changes, especially from the perspective of climate change. In boreal forests, the onset of the bud burst is a key factor in the length of the growing season. With current climate change, the major factors limiting the growth of boreal trees (i.e., temperature and nitrogen availability) are changing and studies on mature trees are limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of soil warming and increased nitrogen (N) deposition on bud burst of mature black spruce [Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP]. From 2008 onwards, an experimental manipulation of these environmental growth conditions was conducted in two stands (BER and SIM) at different altitudes in the boreal forest of Quebec, Canada. An increase in soil temperature (H treatment) and a canopy application of artificial rain enriched with nitrogen (N treatment) were performed. Observations of bud phenology were made during May-July 2012 and 2013. In BER, H treatment caused an anticipation (estimated as 1-3 days); while N treatment, a delay (estimated as 1-2 days but only in 2012) in bud burst. No treatments effect was significant in SIM. It has been demonstrated that soil temperature and N availability can play an important role in affecting bud burst in black spruce but the effects of these environmental factors on growth are closely linked with site conditions.

AB  - The Amazon coastal zone is characterized by high levels of hydrodynamic energy influenced by both marine and continental processes. This region commands a great deal of interest from economic, social, and environmental viewpoints, and is affected by the interaction of a number of natural and anthropogenic processes, which have a direct influence on the conditions found on local beaches. The present study analyzed the quality of the beaches of the Amazonian city of Sao Luis, considering natural (climatic, morphodynamic, and hydrological processes) and social (occupation of the land and types of services and infrastructure) conditions. A system of beach classification was also used to assess coastal quality regarding both natural and socioeconomic characteristics. The results of the study indicate that the local beaches are being occupied increasingly by urban development, which is affecting the equilibrium of depositional systems, primarily through the occupation of dunes and cliffs. In addition, the local water quality has been affected by the lack of an adequate public sanitation system and the presence of numerous illegal sewers on the beaches, which contribute to the elevation of thermotolerant coliform concentrations above the limit permitted under Brazilian legislation. These features contributed to the classification of the sites as regular quality beaches, according to the indices applied in this study. The lack of local urban planning has caused serious social and environmental problems and effective management plans for this sector of the Amazon coast are urgently needed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The epiphytic lichen Evernia prunastri is sensitive to air pollution and reacted by total retreat to the worsening of air quality during the peak of SO2 pollution in Central Europe (1950s-1990). Since 1990, after a significant decrease in air pollution, epiphytic lichens recolonized previously polluted areas, including E. prunastri. We investigated the physiological status of E. prunastri, transplanted for six months in 34 sites in the urban area of Bratislava (Slovakia) under current conditions. The content of chlorophylls, cortical and medullar secondary metabolites and soluble proteins were explored. We then examined the relationship of these parameters with the environmental quality status, reflected by the diversity of epiphytic lichens. The results showed that the physiological status of E. prunastri did not change significantly after exposure. Positive correlations were found between lichen diversity in the sampling sites and physiological parameters (photosynthetic pigments and phaeophytinization quotient) in the transplants. Transplants from sampling sites with a greater proportion of nitrophilous lichens displayed a decrease in photosynthetic pigments. Sites where E. prunastri naturally occurred had a lower proportion of nitrophilous species in comparison to sites where E. prunastri was not present. This suggests that the indicator species E. prunastri may also recolonize sites with low eutrophication in urban environments under decreased air pollution, and the information on its presence can help to assess the pressure caused by nitrogen excess.

AB  - The vibration generated by tractor field operations will seriously affect the comfort and health of the driver. The low frequency vibration generated by the engine and ground excitation is similar to the natural frequency of human organs. Long term operation in this environment will resonate with the organs and affect drivers' health. To investigate this possibility, in this paper we carried out a collection experiment of human physiological indicators relevant to vibration fatigue. Four physiological signals of surface electromyography, skin electricity, skin temperature, and photoplethysmography signal were collected while the subjects experienced vibration. Several features of physiological signals as well as the law of signal features changing with fatigue are studied. The test results show that with the increase of human fatigue, the overall physiological parameters show the following trends: The median frequency of the human body surface electromyography and the slope of skin surface temperature decreases, the value of skin conductivity and the mean value of the photoplethysmography signal increases. Furthermore, this paper proposes a vibration comfort evaluation method based on multiple physiological parameters of the human body. An artificial neural network model is trained with test samples, and the prediction accuracy rate reaches 88.9%. Finally, the vibration conditions are changed by the shock-absorbing suspension of a tractor, verifying the effectiveness of the physiological signal changing with the vibration of the human body. The established prediction model can also be used to objectively reflect the discomfort of the human body under different working conditions and provide a basis for structural design optimization.

AB  - Efficiently evaluating industrial activities plays an essential role in determining the extent to which human-ecosystem interactions may lead to species loss, disrupted community dynamics, and degraded ecosystems. Intertidal habitats offer a unique opportunity in this regard, as they are species rich ecosystems that exhibit rapid community turnover and pronounced responses to ecological disturbances. In an attempt to use these dynamic communities to identify the impact storage of harvested logs is having on the Kitimat River estuary, surveys evaluating the biotic and abiotic conditions within surrounding mudflats were conducted. The intertidal mudflats of the Kitimat River Estuary varied spatially and temporally, and with differences in the infaunal community, as well as the abiotic sediment conditions between reference mudflats, and mudflats potentially impacted by logging activities. While these differences were pronounced, we cannot at this time link these differences to the logging activities at impacted sites. We also observed evidence that suggests that the infaunal community of these intertidal mudflats have changed substantially since the 1970s, with the establishment of a community of polychaetes, as well as the appearance of the invasive clam Mya arenaria, and the invasive Cumacea Nippoleucon hinumensis. Beyond contrasting impacted and reference mudflats, the current health of these mudflats, as indicated by the infaunal community assemblage, is currently unclear. More research is required to determine if organic enrichment has occurred at these habitats, as well as to further elucidate the current health of these intertidal mudflats.

AB  - Remotely-sensed climate data records (CDRs) provide a basis for spatially distributed global climate model (GCM) inputs and validation methods. GCMs can take advantage of land surface models (LSMs), which aim to resolve surface energy, water and carbon budgets and hence these LSMs present important boundary conditions at the land-atmosphere interface. Pertinently, satellite data assimilation approaches are essential for improved land surface modelling for northern high latitudes ecosystems where permafrost degradation is reported to be ongoing. Permafrost, however, is an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) that cannot directly be monitored from space.
   Here, we advocate that CDRs, such as those compiled under the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) programme, may be used in combination with permafrost models to improve our understanding of permafrost extent and degradation in a changing climate system. We describe the current types of remotely-sensed surface feature products that are widely used as indicators for permafrost related features. Furthermore, we highlight issues of using these site-specific permafrost proxies related to spatial scale, as well as the uncertainties in establishing present-day permafrost extent itself.
   Our assessment of the key ECVs that impact on permafrost, demonstrates how models that incorporate EO CDRs have the potential to boost our knowledge of permafrost conditions through better parametrisation of the thermal regime of permafrost soils. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In southern Africa arable soils are limited due to low rainfall and are threatened by anthropogenic activities like agriculture and mining making it susceptible to degradation. The aim of this study is to review the existing information available with regards to soil contamination and its possible threats towards biodiversity and quality of southern African soils. Some of the issues being addressed in this paper include the focus areas of ecotoxicological research in southern African countries, levels of contaminants in soils, the impacts of climate on soil animals and the representativity of standardised test species. In order to address this, we report on a literature search, which was done to determine the main focus areas of soil ecotoxicological research, highlighting strengths and research needs in comparison to approaches elsewhere in the world. Further, to address if the risk assessment approaches of Europe and the USA are valid for southern African environmental conditions; this in the light of differences in temperature, rainfall and fauna. It is concluded that risk assessment, procedures for Europe and the USA were based on non-southern African conditions making it necessary to rethink risk assessment studies; although limited, in southern Africa. We recommend future research that has to be undertaken to address these issues. This research should include investigating species sensitivities in responses to contamination and including insects likes ants and termites in ecological risk assessment studies.

AB  - The vegetation of Bavarian Forest National Park as an expression of site conditions and stand dynamics
   Since ca. 25 yrs. the forests of Bavarian Forest National Parks have been subject to natural stand dynamics following large-scale disturbances by windfall and bark beetle infestation. This development as well as new hypotheses concerning the potential natural vegetation of the park gave rise to a systematic study of vegetation. 181 vegetation plots were localised based on a stratified random design securing balanced sampling of six major site types (vegetation map) and six stages of stand development (forest inventory), and analysed by ordination and semi-automatical table sorting. Vegetation patterns were interpreted by correlation with environmental variables measured on site and derived from GIS. The main vegetation gradient was attributed to nutrient (notably base cation) availability, followed by temperature and moisture gradients. The vegetation types (Galio-Fagetum, Luzulo-Fagetum, Calamagrostio-Fagetum, Calamagrostio-Piceetum, Luzulo-Abietetum, Galio-Abietetum) could be delimited more or less distinctly along these gradients. Stand dynamics had minor effects on the composition of ground vegetation, with only mortal and juvenile stages showing increased incidence of nitrophilous indicators of disturbance, which generally were more frequent on soils rich in base cations. The importance of hygrophilous Abies alba forests (Luzulo- and Galio-Abietetum) on relatively rich hygromorphic soils in valleys and on lower slopes was confirmed. The soil information in an existing site map proved to be too imprecise with respect to moisture and nutrient availability to allow exact prediction of vegetation types.

AB  - Wild bees are key ecosystem components making their decline a cause for concern. An effective measure to increase wild bee diversity is to enhance plant diversity. However, the effect on bee diversity of augmenting plant diversity depends on site-specific environmental conditions. We aimed to make spatial predictions of where: (a) environmental conditions maximize bee diversity, so that such areas can be prioritized for augmenting plant diversity; and (b) populations of threatened wild bee species are most likely to occur. We surveyed bee communities in traditionally managed hay meadows in SE Norway and modelled bee diversity as a function of climate, habitat area, and distance to nesting substrates. We used independent data to validate our predictions and found that plant and predicted bee species richness together explained 76% and 69% of the variation in observed solitary bee species richness in forested and agricultural ecosystems, respectively. In urban areas, the predicted bee species richness alone explained 31% of the variation in observed solitary bee species richness. Using data from online species occurrence records, we found that - compared to species of lower conservation concern - threatened solitary bee species were more typically recorded in areas with a high predicted solitary bee species richness. We show that spatial predictions of bee diversity can identify sites where augmenting plant diversity is likely to be most effective. Maps of predicted bee diversity can guide species surveys and monitoring projects and increase the chances of locating populations of threatened bees.

AB  - Protozoans are valuable indicators of the wastewater biological treatment process and are used in a variety of water resource recovery facilities (WRRF). The aim of this study was to determine the applicability of the Sludge Biotic Index (SBI) as an indicator of activated sludge purification efficiency during different influent loadings: municipal wastewater (M) and municipal wastewater combined with industrial wastewater from a sugar refinery (M + S). Despite the higher organic load during the M + S period, purification efficiency was higher for BOD5, compared with the M period. SBI values were high during both periods, indicating stable sludge, excellent biological activity, and good to very good performance. According to the share of indicator taxa, better conditions of activated sludge were found during the M + S period. Protozoan abundance differed between the two study periods, as well as purification efficiency for some parameters. Certain taxa showed a significant correlation with purification efficiency for specific parameters. Although SBI is a useful tool for estimating activated sludge health, it should be used in combination with additional indicator metrics and/or a species-specific approach.
   Practitioner points
   Activated sludge can have high purification efficiency during the co-treatment of industrial and municipal wastewater.
   The Sludge Biotic Index is applicable as an indicator of activated sludge condition during the treatment of municipal and sugar refinery wastewaters.
   A combination of indicators and a species-specific approach can give better estimation of the health of activated sludge.

AB  - Shellfish production areas are often located in shallow estuarine and coastal systems impacted by fluxes of faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) that exhibit extreme spatial and temporal variability. FIO abundance and distribution in the marine environment are determined by the combined effects of light intensity, water mixing, sewage content and suspended particulate matter. Favourable conditions for FIO survival are low solar radiation, low temperature, low salinity, low densities of micro-predators and high levels of organic matter. Rainfall is the parameter most commonly associated with peak levels of FIOs. Resuspension of contaminated sediments in the water column dominates FIO distribution in shallow and depositional estuaries during storm conditions. Water/flesh FIO ratios may differ between shellfish growing waters because salinities and water temperatures also influence filter-feeding activity. Data are lacking on the role of biological processes on FIOs uptake and clearance in shellfish, particularly during periods of good water quality. FIO accumulation is usually of higher magnitude in mussels and cockles than in oysters and surf clams. It is proposed that differences in FIO accumulation rates are associated with the biological activity and the position of shellfish in the water column in relation to the location of impacting pollution sources. Accurate information on catchment hydrology, land uses, FIO loads from sewerage-related sources and livestock production areas are required to adequately characterise the microbiological status of shellfisheries.

A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach has been taken that naturally accounts for critical flow and dispersion processes in urban areas, such as channeling, lofting, vertical mixing and turbulence, by solving the steady-state, Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. Rapid generation of high quality cityscape volume meshes is attained by a unique voxel-based model generator that directly interfaces with common Geographic Information Systems (GIS) file formats. The flow and turbulence fields are obtained by solving the steady-state RANS equations using a collocated, pressure-based approach formulated for unstructured and polyhedral mesh elements. Turbulence modeling is based upon the Renormalization Group variant of the k-epsilon model (k-epsilon RNG). Neutrally buoyant simulations are made by prescribing velocity boundary condition profiles found by a power-law relationship, while turbulence quantities boundary conditions are defined by a prescribed mixing length in conjunction with the assumption of turbulence equilibrium. Dispersion fields are computed by solving an unsteady transport equation of a dilute gas, formulated in a Eulerian framework, using the velocity and turbulence fields found from the steady-state RANS solution. In this paper the model is explained and detailed comparisons of predicted to experimentally obtained velocity, turbulence and dispersion fields are made to neutrally stable wind tunnel and hydraulic flume experiments.

CP  - 1st Symposium on the Mid-Atlantic Integrated Assessment Program (MAIA)
AB  - In order to examine the condition of biota in Atlantic coast estuaries, "Contaminant Exposure and Effects-Terrestrial Vertebrates" database (CEE-TV) has been compiled through computerized search of published literature, review of existing databases, and solicitation of unpublished reports from conservation agencies, private groups, and universities. Summary information has been entered into the database, including species, collection date (1965-present), site coordinates, estuary name, hydrologic unit code, sample matrix, contaminant concentrations, biomarker and bioindicator responses, and reference source, utilizing a 98-field character and numeric format. Currently, the CEE-TV database contains 3699 geo-referenced records representing 190 vertebrate species and > 140,000 individuals residing in estuaries from Maine through Florida. This relational database can be directly queried or imported into a Geographic Information System to examine spatial patterns, identify data gaps and areas of concern, generate hypotheses, and focus ecotoxicological field assessments. Information on birds made up the vast majority (83%) of the database, with only a modicum of data on amphibians (< 0.1%). Of the > 75,000 chemical compounds in commerce, only 118 commonly measured environmental contaminants were quantified in tissues of terrestrial vertebrates. There were no CEE-TV data records in 15 of the 67 estuaries located along the Atlantic coast and Florida Gulf coast. The CEE-TV database has a number of potential applications including focusing biomonitoring efforts to generate critically needed ecotoxicological data in the numerous "gaps" along the coast, reducing uncertainty about contaminant risk, identifying areas for mitigation, restoration or special management, and ranking ecological conditions of estuaries.

AB  - The removal of trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) from treated wastewater and impacted surface water through managed aquifer recharge (MAR) has been extensively studied under a variety of water quality and operating conditions and at various experimental scales. The primary mechanism thought to dictate removal over the long term is biodegradation by microorganisms present in the system. This review of removal percentages observed in biologically active filtration systems reported in the peer-reviewed literature may serve as the basis to identify future indicators for persistence, as well as variable and efficient removal in MAR systems. A noticeable variation in reported removal percentages (standard deviation above 30%) was observed for 24 of the 49 most commonly studied TOrCs. Such variations suggest a rather inconsistent capacity of biologically active filter systems to remove these TOrCs. Therefore, operational parameters such as the change in dissolved organic carbon (Delta DOC) during treatment, hydraulic retention time (HRT), filter material, and redox conditions were correlated to the associated TOrC removal percentages to determine whether a data-based relationship could be elucidated. Interestingly, 11 out of the 24 compounds demonstrated increased removal with increasing Delta DOC concentrations. Furthermore, 10 compounds exhibited a positive correlation with HRT. Based on the evaluated data, a minimum HRT of 0.5-1 day is recommended for removal of most compounds. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Competition between individuals belonging to the same species is a universal feature of natural populations and is the process underpinning organismal adaptation. Despite its importance, still comparatively little is known about the genetic variation responsible for competitive traits. Here, we measured the phenotypic variation and quantitative genetics parameters for two fitness-related traits-egg-to-adult viability and development time-across a panel of Drosophila strains under varying larval densities. Both traits exhibited substantial genetic variation at all larval densities, as well as significant genotype-by-environment interactions (GEIs). GEI was attributable to changes in the rank order of reaction norms for both traits, and additionally to differences in the between-line variance for development time. The coefficient of genetic variation increased under stress conditions for development time, while it was higher at both high and low densities for viability. While development time also correlated negatively with fitness at high larval densities-meaning that fast developers have high fitness-there was no correlation with fitness at low density. This result suggests that GEI may be a common feature of fitness-related genetic variation and, further, that trait values under noncompetitive conditions could be poor indicators of individual fitness. The latter point could have significant implications for animal and plant breeding programs, as well as for conservation genetics.

AB  - Butyltin compounds (BTs), including tributyltin (TBT) and its degradation products, dibutyltin and monobutyltin, have been found in a diversity of aquatic systems and causing toxic effects in target and nontarget organisms. They enter in coastal systems through different sources (as antifouling paints, industrial effluents, etc.) where they interact with biotic and abiotic components, and their distribution is commonly determined by the morphological and hydrodynamic conditions of the coastal systems. In this study, we discuss the contamination by BTs on a spatial scale (eight estuaries with three subareas each) and in different compartments of the estuaries (sediments, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and estuarine catfish tissues (liver and gills). Lower concentrations of BTs were found in the sediments (n.d. to 338 ng g(-1)) in comparison to studies before a ban of TBT in antifouling paints was enacted, mostly indicating an old input or preservation related with sediment properties and composition. For SPM samples (n.d. to 175 ng L-1) as well as in fish tissues (n.d. to 1426 ng g(-1)), the presence of these compounds was frequent, especially in the fish due to their movement throughout the estuaries and the potential to assess point sources of BTs. These results indicate that BTs persist in the environment, with variation in amounts between investigated estuaries and even at locations inside the same estuary, because of ideal preservation conditions, transport to remote areas, and input from different sources.

AB  - Water-limited ecosystems, covering similar to 50% of the global land, are controlled primarily by hydrologic factors. Because climate change is predicted to markedly alter current hydroclimatic conditions later this century, a better hydrological indicator of ecosystem performance is warranted to improve understanding of hydrological controls on vegetation and to predict changes in the future. Here we show that the observed total water storage anomaly (TWSA) from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) can serve as this indicator. Using the Australian mainland as a case study, where ecosystems are generally water limited, we found that GRACE-observed TWSA can explain changes in surface greenness (as measured by the normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) both interannually and seasonally. In addition, we found that TWSA shows a significant decreasing trend during the millennium drought from 1997 through 2009 in the region. However, decline in annual mean NDVI during the same period was mainly driven by decline in annual minimum monthly NDVI, whereas annual maximum monthly NDVI remained relatively constant across biomes. This phenomenon reveals an intrinsic sensitivity of ecosystems to water availability that drought-induced reductions in surface greenness are more likely expressed through its influence on vegetation during lower NDVI months, whereas ecosystem activities tend to recover to their maximum level during periods when the combined environmental conditions favor vegetation growth within a year despite the context of the prolonged drought.

AB  - Mexico has the greatest richness of Agave species, distributed in diverse environments. In order to contribute to the knowledge on ways to tolerate moisture constraints, the effect of two water potential (Psi) in the substrate (-0.7 and -3.5 MPa) on growth, biomass allocation, leaf thickness and proline content in two species of the subgenus Littaea (A. lechuguilla and A. striata), and six of the subgenus Agave (A. americana var. marginata, A. angust(olia subsp. tequilana, A. asperrima, A. cupreata, A. duranguesis and A. salmiana), recognized for its economic and ecological importance, was evaluated during 14 months and under greenhouse conditions. Low moisture inhibited biomass accumulation in the eighth species; despite this, growth (number of leaves and plant coverage) kept in those more adapted to aridity or with broader environmental tolerant limits as A. angustifolia subsp. tequilana, A. duranguensis, A. lechuguilla, and A. salmiana. The limiting Psi promoted greater biomass allocation to roots at expense of leaves in some species, and duplication of radical proline in species of the subgenus Agave. The modification of biomass allocation and the increase of proline, as forms to tolerate moisture restriction, presented only in part of the species studied. In contrast, maintaining the thickness of the sheet (indicator of turgidity) was a general reaction to limiting Psi. Agave species have diverse physiological and biochemical responses, which reflect its wide tolerance to adverse environmental conditions and explains the wide ecological distribution of the genus.

AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated the geomorphic complexity and wide range of hydrologic regimes found in alpine headwater channels that provide complex habitats for aquatic taxa. These geohydrologic elements are fundamental to better understand patterns in species assemblages and indicator taxa and are necessary to aquatic monitoring protocols that aim to track changes in physical conditions. Complex physical variables shape many biological and ecological traits, including life history strategies, but these mechanisms can only be understood if critical physical variables are adequately represented within the sampling framework. To better align sampling design protocols with current geohydrologic knowledge, we present a conceptual framework that incorporates regional-scale conditions, basin-scale longitudinal profiles, valley-scale glacial macroform structure, valley segment-scale (i.e., colluvial, alluvial, and bedrock), and reach-scale channel types. At the valley segment- and reach-scales, these hierarchical levels are associated with differences in streamflow and sediment regime, water source contribution and water temperature. Examples of linked physical-ecological hypotheses placed in a landscape context and a case study using the proposed framework are presented to demonstrate the usefulness of this approach for monitoring complex temporal and spatial patterns and processes in glaciated basins. This approach is meant to aid in comparisons between mountain regions on a global scale and to improve management of potentially endangered alpine species affected by climate change and other stressors.

AB  - Phylogenetic clustering of species within plant communities can be expected to result from environmental filtering acting on an evolutionary-conserved plant trait. One such a candidate trait is the embryo to seed-size ratio (E:S). A high E:S may allow faster germination immediately after imbibition, and is therefore assumed to be advantageous in dry habitats. In this study the hypothesis was tested that habitat filtering driven by soil moisture conditions and acting on seed germination and seedling establishment is an important ecological mechanism in structuring temperate plant communities.
   Vegetation samplings were performed in three habitats located within 200 km of each other in western Europe: Ellenberg indicator values showed that the habitats selected differed substantially in terms of soil moisture and light availability. E.S ratio and seed mass data for all genera were obtained from literature. Data were analysed using recently developed phylogenetic methods.
   Genera with a similar E:S tend to co-occur, as low and high E:S genera dominate in moist and dry habitats, respectively. A phylogenetically clustered pattern of community structure was evident, and dispersion of E:S was positively related to phylogenetic dispersion.
   The phenotypically and phylogenetically clustered pattern indicates that E:S-mediated habitat filtering is an important assembly process structuring the plant community of the temperate climate habitats studied.

AB  - Management of large herbivores could be improved by investing less effort in estimating absolute abundance and more effort tracking variation over time of indicators of ecological change (IEC) describing animal performance, herbivore impact on habitat, and relative animal abundance. To describe relative changes in animal abundance, monitoring trends in numbers through indices may constitute a useful and low cost method, especially at large spatial scales. Reliability of indices to detect trends should be evaluated before they are used in wildlife management. We compared population trends estimated from spotlight counts, a standard census method for deer populations, with population size estimates of a red deer Cervus elaphus population monitored using Capture-Mark-Recapture (CMR) methodology. We found a strong negative effect of conditions of observation (e.g. rainfall) on both the number of animals (-24.4%) and the number of groups (-31.6%) seen per kilometre. After controlling for observation conditions, we found that these two abundance indices were linearly correlated with CMR estimates, with the group-based index being better correlated (r = 0.75) than the individual-based index (r = 0.68). These consistent trends between indices and CM R estimates provide support in using standardised spotlight counts as an IEC describing relative changes in abundance for the monitoring and management of red deer populations.

AB  - Filter feeders are important components in coastal ecosystems where they remove suspended food particles from the water A key to the understanding of spatial and temporal variations in pelagic biomass is knowledge of the circumstances under which filter feeding takes place. Frequently changing salinities caused by water exchange between the highly saline North Sea and the brackish Baltic create density-driven currents that are of great importance not only for the extent of grazing impact exerted by benthic filter-feeding macroinvertebrates (e.g. bivalves, ascidians and polychaetes), but also for the performance of pelagic filter feeders such as jellyfish and their zooplankton prey organisms. There is good evidence that the feeding demands and effectiveness of filter feeders explain variations in plankton biomass. in a recent project the hydrodynamic conditions in a Danish fjord (Kerteminde Fjord/Kertinge Nor) were brought into focus where it was found that the interaction between hydraulic processes and filter-feeding organisms (ascidians and jellyfish) could explain otherwise unaccountably large variations in the phytoplankton biomass. The interaction between hydrography and filter feeders is typically overlooked although of great importance for marine monitoring programmes using parameters such as phytoplankton biomass routinely in the assessment of environmental conditions.

AB  - The present work encompasses the production of biodiesel from an inexpensive waste, viz., used rice bran oil (URBO) through concurrent esterification and transesterification reactions employing the prepared waste duck bone (WDB)-derived natural hydroxyapatite (NAHAp) supported vanadium impregnated solid catalyst (VNAHAp). The optimal VNAHAp catalyst possessed 92.23 m(2)/g surface area which was much superior to 61.46 m(2)/g of the V-catalyst (VCHAp) prepared using commercially available hydroxyapatite (CHAp). The optimal (Box-Behnken design) concurrent trans/esterification reaction conditions for biodiesel (FAME) production from URBO and methanol were 5 wt.% catalyst concentration, 8:1 methanol/URBO mole ratio, and 35 wt% NH4VO3 loaded VNAHAp (35VNAHAp) catalyst that resulted in 99.05% FAME yield deploying a low-energy infrared radiator assisted batch reactor (LIRABR) which ensured significantly high FAME yield at milder temperature (60 degrees C) and in shorter reaction time (30 min) compared to a conventionally heated batch reactor. The product biodiesel and its blend with commercial diesel conformed to ASTM D7467-10 specifications. The life cycle assessment (LCA) of the entire process advocated superior sustainability of the biodiesel production using 35VNAHAp catalyst in the LIRABR compared to their conventional counterparts. Valorization of two potential wastes, viz., URBO and WDB, under milder process conditions involving LIRABR and 35VNAHAp resulted in lower environmental impacts, thus rendering a sustainable biodiesel production process towards a greener earth.

AB  - Human-induced changes of the environment and their possible impacts on temperate forest understory plant communities have been examined in many studies. However, the relative contribution of individual environmental factors to these changes in the herb layer is still unclear. In this study, we used vegetation survey data covering a time period of 21 years and collected from 143 permanent plots in the Northern Limestone Alps, Austria. Data on soil chemistry (49 plots), light condition (51 plots), soil temperature and moisture (four and six plots), disturbance (all plots), climate (one station in a clearing area), and airborne sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) deposition (two forest stands) were available for analyses. We used these data together with plot mean Ellenberg indicator values in a path analysis to attribute their relative contributions to observed vegetation changes. Our analysis reveals a strong directional shift of the forest understory plant community. We found strong evidence for a recovery of the ground-layer vegetation from acidification as response to decreased S deposition. We did not observe a community response to atmospheric N deposition, but we found a response to altered climatic conditions (thermophilization and drying). The path analysis revealed that changes in the light regime, which were related to small-scale disturbances, had most influence on herb layer community shifts. Thermophilization and drying were identified as drivers of understory community changes independent of disturbance events.

AB  - Predicting progeny performance from parental genetic divergence can potentially enhance the efficiency of supportive breeding programmes and facilitate risk assessment. Yet, experimental testing of the effects of breeding distance on offspring performance remains rare, especially in wild populations of vertebrates. Recent studies have demonstrated that embryos of salmonid fish are sensitive indicators of additive genetic variance for viability traits. We therefore used gametes of wild brown trout (Salmo trutta) from five genetically distinct populations of a river catchment in Switzerland, and used a full factorial design to produce over 2,000 embryos in 100 different crosses with varying genetic distances (F-ST range 0.005-0.035). Customized egg capsules allowed recording the survival of individual embryos until hatching under natural field conditions. Our breeding design enabled us to evaluate the role of the environment, of genetic and non-genetic parental contributions, and of interactions between these factors, on embryo viability. We found that embryo survival was strongly affected by maternal environmental (i.e. non-genetic) effects and by the microenvironment, i.e. by the location within the gravel. However, embryo survival was not predicted by population divergence, parental allelic dissimilarity, or heterozygosity, neither in the field nor under laboratory conditions. Our findings suggest that the genetic effects of inter-population hybridization within a genetically differentiated meta-population can be minor in comparison to environmental effects.

AB  - Heat-shock proteins (Hsp) or stress proteins are strong candidates for biomarkers of environmental pollution since they are activated very early in the cascade of cellular events that follow toxic exposure and at concentrations below the lethal dose. Included in a test battery comprised of different bioassays, Hsp induction could provide a general purpose tier I indicator of pollution. Still, little is known on the induction of Hsp under different environmental conditions. In the present study we have made use of an Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) to detect the synthesis of Hsp70 in Raphidocelis subcapitata in response to changes in pH, temperature, humic acids, nitrates and phosphates. The results show that algae respond to these changes in the environment by a transient increase in Hsp70 levels, the extend of which is dependent on the actual parameter under investigation. Out of these five parameters studied, only temperature and possibly pH were able to induce acquired tolerance, i.e. algae grown at a pH or at a temperature different from control conditions were shown to have acquired resistance to a subsequent challenge with Zn (10(-5) M). Adjustment of the pH and temperature in two physico-chemically different natural surface waters was demonstrated to be sufficient to obtain similar induction patterns of Hsp70 upon exposure to zinc. These results qualify Hsp70 as a good biomonitor for environmental pollution provided essential environmental parameters such as pH and temperature are kept constant. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - Pine wilt disease (PWD) is one of the most serious conifer diseases, with further expansion expected under ongoing climate change. Sustainable forest management and effective pest control of pine forests therefore requires rigorous exploration of potential PWD risk areas under current and future climate conditions. To predict potential PWD risk areas in Japan, we constructed an inhomogeneous Poisson point process (IPP) model, which allows the use of strongly biased data. We examined both current and near-future climatic conditions (2026-2050, five general circulation model under two representative concentration pathways [RCPs]). Occurrence data were obtained on three different spatial scales (national, regional and local) along with eight bioclimatic variables. The resultant model was able to correct the data bias caused by using these three different data sources and showed high predictive power as follows: (1) potential risk areas will increase more than the current PWD distribution; (2) mean annual temperature will have the highest effect of the eight predictor variables; (3) high-risk areas will expand northwards and/or upwards in the near future, at a maximum of ca. + 58.6% under RCP 8.5 and a minimum of ca. + 15.9% under RCP 2.6 and low risk areas will decrease. The high-resolution PWD risk maps created with the IPP model will therefore aid future pest control and forest management strategies at local, regional, and national scales.

AB  - Many of the ecological processes in the riparian forests and streams across the Pacific Northwest have become impaired through production forestry practices common prior to the 1990s. Some of these practices included forest harvest without stream buffers, removal of instream wood, road construction and use, and harvesting large proportions of watersheds. Passive ecological restoration (the use of natural processes of succession and disturbance to alleviate anthropogenic impacts over time) is a common practice used in the management of riparian forests previously subjected to production forestry. Eighteen years after the implementation of passive restoration of riparian forests, we used four common stream indicators (stream temperature, canopy closure, instream wood, and salmonid densities) to assess the effects of restoration in small fish-bearing streams. Summer stream temperatures have decreased below unmanaged reference levels, whereas riparian forest canopy closure has increased beyond that in reference watersheds. Instream wood and age-1 or older salmonids appear to be either stable at reduced levels or declining, compared with production forestry and unmanaged reference watersheds. Overall, second-growth riparian forests need more time to develop allowing more light into streams (increasing primary productivity), while also allowing for the continuous recruitment of larger pieces of instream wood (improving habitat for salmonids). Using only passive restoration, stream conditions in second-growth forests are unlikely to increase salmonid production in the near future.

AB  - The relevance of the research is related to the need for environmental monitoring of subarctic zone soils change in the Tyumen region at the stage of developing hydrocarbon deposits in modern conditions of transformation of the region into strategic base of Russia.
   The aim of the research is to evaluate the transformation of physical state and chemical composition of soils in subarctic zone of the Tyumen region under the influence of natural conditions and technogenic stress.
   Methods: landscape-geochemical and statistical, soil-geochemical studies, methods for determining chemical composition of organic and inorganic pollutants of soils, decoding of space images.
   Results. it is shown, that under the influence of anthropogenic load, which began in 1972, synlitogenic soils of floodplain are the most resistant to physical transformation and post-lithogenic soils (-) podzols (- )are the least resistant. The structure of soils, determined by the features of their formation and transformation should be considered the indicator of physical stability of soils. Podzols are the most susceptible to chemical transformations (on heavy metals), and floodplain soils and organogenic soils are the least susceptible; on organic matter( )(-) the soils of floodplains and organogenic soils, respectively. The indicator of chemical stability of soils is their ability to accumulate, move, release and transform inorganic and organic contamination. The area of physically transformed soils of this site at the stage of industrial development of the territory since 1972 has increased from 10,734 km(2) (2008) to 11,705 km(2) (2012).

AB  - Among abalone species that were once harvested along the California coastline, red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) supports the remaining recreational fishery. To support development of a red abalone fishery management plan, non-governmental organizations have initiated expanded data collection and developed fishery management strategies. The latter is the subject of this study, as we present a management strategy evaluation (MSE) of a multi-indicator decision tree. The decision tree relies on landings from each of 56 fishing sites and length frequency information collected during fishery-independent diver surveys at a subset of sites. The decision tree was designed to cope with existing data limitations and to ensure that localized meta-population dynamics were adequately considered in decision-making. It was also necessary to balance the potential for localized abundance changes with the practical issue of implementing fishery regulations at larger spatial scales. The MSE demonstrated that undesirably low stock sizes could be avoided while also continuing to maintain a viable fishery, even under environmental conditions that are detrimental to abalone populations. Under less-severe environmental conditions, stock size was maintained, on average, above the biomass associated with production of maximum sustainable yield. Our discussion centers on steps that were taken to refine the decision tree and to incorporate feedback from scientists and stakeholders and to facilitate transparent evaluation of management options.

AB  - To improve the ecological relevance of environmental risk assessment, an improved understanding is needed of 1) the influence of environmental conditions on the toxicity of pollutants, and 2) the effect of these factors in combination with possible interpopulation variability. The influences of salinity and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on the accumulation and effect of copper (Cu) to settled mussels were investigated with mussels from a North Sea and a Baltic Sea population. We found that both populations were equally Cu-sensitive, even though the Baltic Sea population lives in suboptimal conditions. Baltic Sea mussels, however, accumulated more Cu. This suggests that these populations may have different ways of coping with excess Cu. The influence of salinity on Cu toxicity to settled mussels was limited for both populations. An increase in DOC did not decrease the Cu accumulation or effect in either population. This suggests that DOC-Cu complexes are bioavailable for settled mussels. These findings are in contrast with previous research which indicated that DOC decreased the toxicity and accumulation of Cu in the D-larvae life stage. As a consequence, the mussel larval stage is not the most Cu-sensitive life stage at high DOC concentrations. Furthermore, a DOC correction factor for Cu toxicity cannot be used for settled mussels. This should be accounted for in future marine Cu environmental risk assessment. (C) 2017 SETAC

AB  - In the Mississippi River Alluvial Valley (MAV), complete alteration of river-floodplain hydrology allowed for widespread conversion of forested bottomlands to intensive agriculture, resulting in nearly 80% forest loss. Governmental programs have attempted to restore forest habitat and functions within this altered landscape by the methods of tree planting (afforestation) and local hydrologic enhancement on reclaimed croplands. Early assessments identified factors that influenced whether planting plus tree colonization could establish an overstory community similar to natural bottomland forests. The extent to which afforested sites develop typical understory vegetation has not been evaluated, yet understory composition may be indicative of restored site conditions. As part of a broad study quantifying the ecosystem services gained from restoration efforts, understory vegetation was compared between 37 afforested sites and 26 mature forest sites. Differences in vegetation attributes for species growth forms, wetland indicator classes, and native status were tested with univariate analyses; floristic composition data were analyzed by multivariate techniques. Understory vegetation of restoration sites was generally hydrophytic, but species composition differed from that of mature bottomland forest because of young successional age and differing responses of plant growth forms. Attribute and floristic variation among restoration sites was related to variation in canopy development and local wetness conditions, which in turn reflected both intrinsic site features and outcomes of restoration practices. Thus, understory vegetation is a useful indicator of functional progress in floodplain forest restoration.

AB  - Most spatial modelling of climate change impacts on permafrost has been conducted at half-degree latitude/longitude or coarser spatial resolution. At such coarse resolution, topographic effects on insolation cannot be considered accurately and the results are not suitable for land-use planning and ecological assessment. Here we mapped climate change impacts on permafrost from 1968 to 2100 at 10m resolution using a process-based model for Ivvavik National Park, an Arctic region with complex terrain in northern Yukon, Canada. Soil and drainage conditions were defined based on ecosystem types, which were mapped using SPOT imagery. Leaf area indices were mapped using Landsat imagery and the ecosystem map. Climate distribution was estimated based on elevation and station observations, and the effects of topography on insolation were calculated based on slope, aspect and viewshed. To reduce computation time, we clustered climate distribution and topographic effects on insolation into discrete types. The modelled active-layer thickness and permafrost distribution were comparable with field observations and other studies. The map portrayed large variations in active-layer thickness, with ecosystem types being the most important controlling variable, followed by climate, including topographic effects on insolation. The results show deepening in active-layer thickness and progressive degradation of permafrost, although permafrost will persist in most of the park during the 21st century. This study also shows that ground conditions and climate scenarios are the major sources of uncertainty for high-resolution permafrost mapping.

AB  - The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) establishes a framework for the protection and improvement of estuarine and coastal waters, trying to achieve 'good surface water status at the latest 15 years after the date of entry into force of this Directive'. One of the biological elements that should be analysed is the benthos and, as such, the WFD normative definitions describe the aspects of the benthic communities that must be included in the ecological status assessment of a water body. Therefore, it is essential to include, in the assessment, the different metrics that address those parameters identified in the normative definitions for each of the ecological status classes. In this contribution the use of the AMBI, richness and diversity, combined with the use, in a further development, of factor analysis together with discriminant analysis, is presented as an objective tool (named here M-AMBI) in assessing ecological quality status. This assessment requires previous classification of water bodies and typologies, together with the definition of reference conditions; this is undertaken in this contribution using historical data, expert judgement and multivariate analysis. The study has been undertaken by examining changes in benthic communities in the Basque Country, over the last decade, as a case-study, to demonstrate the accuracy and potential of these methodologies.

AB  - Date palm is the most important species of the palm family (Palmaceae), used to generate income for the local population. However, the growth of date palm in arid regions implies an abusive use of chemical fertilizers, which has harmful consequences on the environment and biological properties of the soil. These compounds are not optimally uptaken by date palm due to poor soil characteristics such as soil structure, high pH value, and low organic matter. Hence, seeking a sustainable alternative is an urgent necessity. Compost, mycorrhizal consortium (MycENA16), and Pantoea agglomerans strain were used to promote date palm growth under greenhouse conditions. Growth assessment was carried out by root colonization determination, growth parameter measurement, and mineral nutrition analysis. After 10 months of culture, root colonization with MycENA16 was very important (82% for frequency and 68% for intensity) and all mycorrhizal structures were observed within the roots. Despite the compost amendment, the colonization rate was not significantly affected. The growth rate of stem diameter was increased by 563% compared to the control plants. Besides, root fresh and dry weights were increased by 793% and 120%, respectively, only when compost was enriched with P. agglomerans. Total chlorophyll and leaf mineral content were significantly increased compared to control. The best results of growth parameters and foliar nutrition were obtained when MycENA16, P. agglomerans, and compost functioned synergistically. These amendments should have a crucial effect on date palm growth, especially at the acclimatization stage, and a high success under field conditions.

AB  - Cloud point extraction (CPE) is a simple, safe and environment-friendly technique used in the preparation of various samples. It was primarily developed for the assessment of environmental samples, especially analyzed for metals. Recently, this technique has been used in the extraction and determination of various chemical compounds (e.g., drugs, pesticides and vitamins), in various matrices (e.g., human plasma, human serum, milk and urine). In this review, we show that CPE is a reliable method of extraction and can be used in analytical laboratories in combination with other techniques that can be used in the determination of drugs and other chemicals in the human biological matrix. According to the literature, a combination of different methods provides good recovery and can be used in the simultaneous determination of many drugs in a single analysis. CPE can be optimized by changing its conditions (e.g., type of surfactant used, incubation temperature, pH and the addition of salts). In this review, we present the optimized CPE methods used in the determination of various pharmaceuticals and describe how the conditions affect the performance of extraction. This data might support future designing of the new CPE applications that are simple and more accurate. We compared CPE with other extraction methods and also showed the advantages and disadvantages of various extraction techniques along with a discussion on their environmental impact. According to the publications reviewed, it is obvious that CPE is an easy, safe, rapid and inexpensive method of extraction.

AB  - The temporal distribution pattern of zooplankton communities was studied in coastal waters of the northern Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh, during a 1-year period of investigation (May 2014-April 2015). Throughout the investigation, a total of 38 zooplankton species were recorded, in details 22 holoplankton and 16 mero-plankton species. Copepods (Acartia dame, Acartia tonsa, Cyclops biscuspidatus, and Canthocalanus pauper), amphipods (Grandidierella megnae), shrimps (Penaeus indicus and Penaeus merguiensis), Acetes (Acetes indicus), and mysids (Americamysis bahai) were the dominant zooplankton taxa. The maximum abundance of total zooplankton and species richness was recorded in monsoon season whereas abundance of holo-plankton and species diversity was recorded in winter. Multivariate analyses revealed that the temporal pattern of species distribution of zooplankton communities significantly differed among the four seasons. RELATE analysis signified that temporal variation in species distribution and community structure of zooplankton significantly correlated with ecological condition of water. Moreover, BEST matching analysis indicated that NO2-N along with salinity, rainfall, transparency, TDS, TSS and pH were the main driving forces for these temporal variations in species distribution and community composition of zooplankton communities. Finally, correlation analysis showed that species evenness and diversity significantly correlated with salinity, transparency and TDS. These results suggest that zooplankton distribution pattern might be shaped by ecological condition of water in such marine ecosystem and may potentially be used as bioindicators of marine water quality.

AB  - Cold-water coral (CWC) ecosystems occur worldwide and play a major role in the ocean's carbonate budget and atmospheric CO2 balance since the Danian (similar to 65m.y.ago). However their temporal and spatial evolution against climatic and oceanographic variability is still unclear. For the first time, we combine the main macrofaunal components of a sediment core from a CWC mound of the Melilla Mounds Field in the Eastern Alboran Sea with the associated microfauna and we highlight the importance of foraminifera and ostracods as indicators ofCWC mound evolution in the paleorecord. Abundances of macrofauna along the core reveal alternating periods dominated by distinct CWC taxa (mostly Lophelia pertusa, Madrepora oculata) that correspond to major shifts in foraminiferal and ostracod assemblages. The period dominated byM. oculata coincides with a period characterized by increased export of refractory organic matter to the seafloor and rather unstable oceanographic conditions at the benthic boundary layer with periodically decreased water energy and oxygenation, variable bottom water temperature/density and increased sediment flow. The microfaunal and geochemical data strongly suggest thatM. oculata and in particular Dendrophylliidae show a higher tolerance to environmental changes than L. pertusa. Finally, we show evidence for sustained CWC growth during the Allered-Younger-Dryas in the Eastern Alboran Sea and that this period corresponds to stable benthic conditions with cold/dense and well oxygenated bottom waters, high fluxes of labile organic matter and relatively strong bottom current

AB  - Widespread mangrove degradation Coupled with the increasing awareness of the importance of these coastal forests have spurred many attempts to restore mangroves but without concomitant assessment of recovery (or otherwise) at the ecosystem level in many areas. This paper reviews literature on the recovery of restored mangrove ecosystems using relevant functional indicators. While stand structure in mangrove stands is dependent on age, site conditions and silvicultural management, published data indicates that stem densities are higher in restored mangroves than comparable natural stands; the converse is true for basal area. Biomass increment rates have been found to be higher in younger stands than older stands (e.g. 12 t ha(-1) year(-1) for a 12 years plantation compared to 5.1 t ha(-1) year(-1) for a 80-year-old plantation). Disparities in patterns of tree species recruitment into the restored stands have been observed with some stands having linear recruitment rates with time (hence enhancing stand complexity), while some older stands completely lacked the understorey. Biodiversity assessments Suggest that some fauna species are more responsive to mangrove degradation (e.g. herbivorous crabs and mollusks in general), and thus mangrove restoration encourages the return of such species, in some cases to levels equivalent to those in comparable natural stands. The paper finally recommends various mangrove restoration pathways in a functional framework dependent on site conditions and emphasizes community involvement and ecosystem level monitoring as integral components of restoration projects.

AB  - The concept of soil quality is relevant to a range of human-induced disturbances on soil; our objective was to examine the impact of clear-cutting on soil quality conditions in six Mixedwood (Populus tremuloides-Picea glauca) stands in Central Saskatchewan, Canada. Soil quality conditions at two short-term (1 to 5 years) and four medium-term (6 to 20 years) clear-cut sites were compared to eight mature Mixedwood sites. All sites had a similar, albeit complex, distribution of soil and parent sediments. No major differences were observed between the short-term clear-cut sites and the mature Mixedwood sites. At the medium-term sites, substantial losses of soil organic carbon (24%), soil nitrogen (27%), and LFH thickness (28%) were observed, along with decreases in the soil surface (0 to 15 cm layer) of exchangeable calcium and magnesium (30%), soluble organic P (15%), and cation exchange capacity and base saturation (20%). The losses were much lower in the 15 to 45 cm layer of the soil. Overall, the levels of these soil components observed at the clear-cut sites were within the natural or undisturbed range as assessed at the mature Mixedwood sites; however the amounts of soil organic carbon and nitrogen at the clear-cut sites were lower than the natural range. Although the absolute levels of loss of soil organic carbon and nitrogen were much lower than in typical agricultural landscapes, the long-term ecological significance of the losses in these forested landscapes remains a concern.

AB  - We generate a series of novel indicators of spatially explicit watershed permeability and runoff characteristics to examine the relationship between land cover and water temperature parameters in a rapidly urbanizing watershed. Our framework provides a readily adaptable method to examine the thermal sensitivity of streams based upon the underlying geomorphological and surface characteristics of drainage basins. Using four model groups each using a different landscape characteristic weighting scheme (Model Group 1: areal averages; Model Group 2: inverse distance by total flow length; Model Group 3: overland distance to stream network and distance squared; Model Group 4: proportional flow accumulation), we examined the predictive capacity of 19 variables, including combinations of simplified land cover, elevation, slope, and flow accumulation, on five stream thermal properties: seven day moving average of daily minimum and maximum, seasonal mean temperature, a novel metric of thermal 'flashiness', and total days with maximum temperature exceeding 17.8 degrees C. We find that the use of spatially explicit landscape indicators combining watershed processes improves the performance of regressions for predicting a number of ecologically relevant stream temperature variables. Improved indicators of watershed condition lend themselves for rapid investigation of the relationship between stream thermal conditions and landscape characteristics in watersheds modified by human land uses, ultimately providing a more hydrologically meaningful indicator for the impacts of landscape change.

AB  - Humid tropical forest soils are characterized by warm temperatures, abundant rainfall, and high rates of biological activity that vary considerably in both space and time. These conditions, together with finely textured soils typical of humid tropical forests lead to periodic low redox conditions, even in well-drained upland environments. The relationship between redox and biogeochemical processes has been studied for decades in saturated environments like wetlands and sediments, but much less is known about redox dynamics in upland soils. The goal of this study was to understand the spatial variability of redox sensitive biogeochemistry within and across two forest types at the ends of a high rainfall gradient (3500 to 5000 mm y(-1)) in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico. The two sites differed significantly in average soil chemical and physical properties, but the scale of variability was similar across sites, with greater variability in soil gas concentrations than extractable Fe and P. Soil P and Fe pools and trace gas concentrations were more strongly correlated with each other and exhibited more spatial structure at the wetter site. While the within-site relationships among these redox sensitive variables were typically weak, the relationships across sites were much stronger. We provide a conceptual model that elucidates how the strength of the relationships between indicators of redox-sensitive biogeochemical processes depends on the spatial scale of analysis.

AB  - Populations of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar have experienced precipitous declines in abundance since the 1970s. This decline has been associated with reduced numbers of adult salmon returning to fresh water from their marine migration, i.e., their marine return rates (MRR). Thus, understanding the factors that affect MRR is of crucial conservation importance. The authors used a state-space model with a 13-year time series of individually tagged salmon mark-recapture histories on the River Frome, southern England, to test the effect of smolt body length on their MRR. In addition to smolt length, the model tested for the influence of environmental covariates that were representative of the conditions experienced by the smolts in the early stages of their seaward migration, i.e., from the lower river to the estuary exit. The model indicated that, even when accounting for environmental covariates, smolt body length was an important predictor of MRR. Although larger smolts have a higher probability of returning to their natal river as adults than smaller smolts, and one-sea-winter salmon have a survival rate twice as high as multi-sea-winter salmon, the actual biological mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon remain uncertain. These results have important applications for salmon conservation, as efforts to bolster salmon populations in the freshwater environment should consider methods to improve smolt quality (i.e., body size) as well as smolt quantity.

AB  - There is increasing interest in effects of radionuclides on non-human species, but methods for studying such effects are not well developed. The aims of the current study were to investigate the effects of uranium mine-affected sediments on non-biting midge Chironomus riparius and to compare sensitivity of different endpoints. The midge larvae were exposed in controlled laboratory conditions to sediments from two ponds downstream from an abandoned uranium mine and a reference pond not receiving water from the mining site. Quartz sand was used as an additional control. Developmental effects were assessed by evaluating emergence of adult midges, body mass, and fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in the length of wing upper vein. FA has been suggested to be a sensitive indicator of developmental instability, but the results of previous studies are inconsistent. In the present study, no difference in FA was observed between the treatment groups, but time to emergence was significantly delayed in the contaminated sediments. The approach used in this study (laboratory experiments with sediments from a contaminated site) avoids confounding due to uncontrolled environmental variables and adaptation to long-term contamination, which may mask effects on natural populations. Using this approach, we found no effects on FA of wing length. Time to emergence, in contrast, was found to be a more sensitive endpoint. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Global climate change increases uncertainty in sustained functioning of forest ecosystems. Forest canopies are a key link between terrestrial ecosystems, the atmosphere, and climate. Here, we introduce research presented at the 66th meeting of the Ecological Society of Japan in the symposium "Structure and function of forest canopies under climate change." Old-growth forest carbon stores are the largest and may be the most vulnerable to climate change as the balance between sequestration and emission could easily be tipped. Detailed structural analysis of individual large, old trees shows they are allocating wood to the trunk and crown in patterns that cannot be deduced from ground, thus can be used to more accurately quantify total forest carbon and sequestration. Slowly migrating species sensitive to novel climatic conditions will have to acclimate at the individual level. Accounting for physiological responses of trees to climate change will improve predictions of future species distributions and subsequent functioning of forest ecosystems. Field experiments manipulating temperature and precipitation show how trees compensate physiologically to mitigate for higher temperatures and drought. However, it is difficult to measure acclimation responses over long timeframes. Intraindividual trait variation is proposed as an indicator of acclimation potential of trees to future conditions and suggests that acclimation potential may vary among regional populations within a species. Integrating whole-tree structural data with physiological data offers a promising avenue for understanding how trees will respond to climatic shifts.

AB  - The documentation of reducing conditions in soils is important in the study, monitoring, and delineation of hydric soils and wetlands. Over the last decade, IRIS (Indicator of Reduction In Soils) technology has moved from the periphery into common use in hydric soils studies. Their appeal has been their ease of use and their conceptual simplicity, and IRIS technology has been approved by the US National Technical Committee for Hydric Soils (NTCHS). Recent developments in IRIS applications have also utilized Mn oxide paint, in addition to Fe oxide paint. While IRIS technology has encompassed a variety of forms, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubes are used most commonly. There are, however, challenges when using traditional PVC IRIS tubes. These include: (1) difficulty in acquiring a two-dimensional image from a three-dimensional cylindrical structure; (2) abrasion or scratching of the tubes during transport and on insertion (especially in sandy or dense soil conditions); (3) expense of shipping due to their weight and size; (4) long term storage issues; (5) general environmental and/or sustainability concerns with using non-reusable plastic tubing. This paper describes a system for the delivery and installation of oxide-coated plastic films in soils. Field testing of both Fe-coated and Mn-coated devices demonstrates that data provided by films does not differ significantly from data provided by tubes. However, many of the problems and issues that have plagued the use of IRIS tubes are eliminated by use of IRIS films.

In order to explore arthropods' life-history strategies in relation to enhanced spatial heterogeneity of the Mediterranean ecosystems, metapopulation characteristics were considered and different habitat quality regimes, in terms of dominant microclimatic conditions, were taken into account. Environmental stochasticity, in temperature and humidity was incorporated into the model, and an elasticity analysis was conducted to quantify contribution of different life-history traits to metapopulation growth rate. The application of the model revealed well-known life-cycle characteristics of Mediterranean arthropods, such as seasonally fluctuating population sizes and skewing phenologies, a fact that confirms models' reliability. Furthermore, the model seems able to elucidate controversial points of the animals' life-cycle development, such as the long-term maintenance of populations in the field and the underlying mechanisms related to the adjustment to the specific features of the Mediterranean ecosystem. Subpopulations inhabiting various microsites display different dynamics and the interaction between these subpopulations, via dispersion, seems to be able to ensure stochastic equilibrium for the system. Dispersal appears to play a decisive role, allowing arthropods to conform to spatial severities and habitats fragmentation, rescuing individuals and recolonizing previously extinct habitats.

AB  - In the condition of sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE), the brain neuroinflammatory response is considered as one of the most critical mechanisms of tissue damage and impaired cerebral homeostasis. The main cell population of the brain responsible for the immune surveillance is microglia, and its phagocytic activity is a fundamental function providing both homeostatic and damaging properties.
   The aim of this study was to determine the immunohistochemical and ultrastructural specificity of the phagocytosis activation in different rat brain regions in the conditions of experimental sepsis.
   Materials and methods. The study was conducted in Wistar rats: 5 sham-operated animals and 20 rats with cecum ligation and puncture (CLP). The immunohistochemical study of CD68 expression in the cortex, white matter, hippocampus, thalamus, caudate/putamen was carried out in the period of 20-48 h postoperatively. The cerebral cortex was examined using transmission electron microscopy.
   Results. Beginning from the 20th h after CLP, there was a significant dynamic increase in the values of the relative area of CD68 expression, the number of immunopositive cells, as well as the percentage of immunopositive cells with amoeboid morphology in all animals of the CLP group, with a predominance of the indicators in the lethal group of rats. The highest levels of phagocytic activity were noted in the white matter and caudate/putamen in both the survived and non-survived animals. Ultrastructurally, the microgliocytes of the lethal group were characterized by signs of actively phagocytic cells and extensive glial-neuronal interaction; phagocytosing microglia in the survived animals showed an active involvement in the processes of necrotic debris elimination into the vasculature.
   Conclusions. In the conditions of SAE, there is the early and dynamic increase in phagocytosis activation with the predominant localization in the brain white matter and caudate/putamen, which could conceivably indicate a special role of these brain areas in the mechanisms of neuroinflammatory response in the conditions of systemic inflammation. In the brain of non-survived animals, the phagocytosis indices are higher than in the group of survivors, which most likely indicates a natural response of microglia to more pronounced destructive processes, but it does not preclude a concurrent neurotoxic activity of CD68-positive cells on the surrounding tissue elements.

AB  - Forest litter emits CO2 into the atmosphere, but there are few studies on the subject and it is important to generate this information to improve inventories of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Methods to quantify this emission are performed in situ during long periods of measurements and others require the use of high cost instruments; some measure the loss of organic matter over time and others are indirect and are based on measurements dependent on weather conditions. The aim of this study was to generate a standardized operation protocol (PEO, its Spanish acronym) to measure the CO2 emission potential of in vitro litter using a manometric respirometer (OxiTop OC110(circle dot) in a maximum time of 10 d incubation. Litter samples were collected in a Quercus spp forest in Tequexquinahuac, Estado de Mexico, at the beginning of 2012. The experimental design was completely randomized, treatments were incubations (25 degrees C) with four litter moisture percentages (20, 40, 60 and 80 % dry weight) and four sample sizes (5, 10, 20, 40 g), and each treatment was replicated three times. Based on the data ANOVA was performed and treatment means were compared with the Tukey test (p <= 0.05). The response variables were: CO2 emission, CO2 emission rate and percentage of oxidized carbon compared to total carbon at the start of incubation. The optimum conditions for the measurement were 10 g sample and 60 % humidity. Under these conditions the maximum CO2 emission was recorded (23 554 mg CO2 kg(-1)) as well as the lowest standard deviation (331 mg CO2 kg(-1)), the lowest of the 16 treatments resulting from combining sample sizes and moisture percentage. In these conditions the percentage of carbon emitted compared to the initial carbon was the highest (5.26 %). The measurement of respiration in such assay depends on the humidity of the sample and the availability of oxygen present in the system, which is the condition for determining the optimal operating environment using the OxiTop OC. The data generated by OxiTop are indicators of the potential emission of CO2 by different types of litter and have a similar value to that of the incubations performed to evaluate the potential mineralization of nitrogen.

AB  - Effects of climate change on the ecosystem productivity and water fluxes have been studied in various types of experiments. However, it is still largely unknown whether and how the experimental approach itself affects the results of such studies. We employed two contrasting experimental approaches, using high-precision weighable monolithic lysimeters, over a period of 4 years to identify and compare the responses of water fluxes and aboveground biomass to climate change in permanent grassland. The first, manipulative, approach is based on controlled increases of atmospheric CO2 concentration and surface temperature. The second, observational, approach uses data from a space-fortime substitution along a gradient of climatic conditions. The Budyko framework was used to identify if the soil ecosystem is energy limited or water limited.
   Elevated temperature reduced the amount of non-rainfall water, particularly during the growing season in both approaches. In energy-limited grassland ecosystems, elevated temperature increased the actual evapotranspiration and decreased aboveground biomass. As a consequence, elevated temperature led to decreasing seepage rates in energy-limited systems. Under water-limited conditions in dry periods, elevated temperature aggravated water stress and, thus, resulted in reduced actual evapotranspiration. The already small seepage rates of the drier soils remained almost unaffected under these conditions compared to soils under wetter conditions. Elevated atmospheric CO2 reduced both actual evapotranspiration and aboveground biomass in the manipulative experiment and, therefore, led to a clear increase and change in seasonality of seepage. As expected, the aboveground biomass productivity and ecosystem efficiency indicators of the water-limited ecosystems were negatively correlated with an increase in aridity, while the trend was unclear for the energy-limited ecosystems.
   In both experimental approaches, the responses of soil water fluxes and biomass production mainly depend on the ecosystems' status with respect to energy or water limitation. To thoroughly understand the ecosystem response to climate change and be able to identify tipping points, experiments need to embrace sufficiently extreme boundary conditions and explore responses to individual and multiple drivers, such as temperature, CO2 concentration, and precipitation, including non-rainfall water. In this regard, manipulative and observational climate change experiments complement one another and, thus, should be combined in the investigation of climate change effects on grassland.

AB  - Asian dust storms (ADS) and PM2.5 (particle pollution) events have an evident influence on air quality in Taiwan. However, the synoptic weather patterns and atmospheric conditions on ADS days are not entirely similar to those related to PM2.5 event days. The aim of this study is to clarify the weather characteristics such as synoptic weather patterns, long-range transport paths, and stagnant conditions that precipitate PM2.5 events. Air quality and meteorological data from 2006 to 2013 were obtained from government-owned observation stations, and the mixing height was estimated in relation to the Nozaki planetary boundary layer height. This study used back trajectories as simulated gridded analysis data, which were based on kinematic trajectory analysis using NASA's GMAO (Global Modeling Assimilation Office) and NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction) analyses. For testing the differences between means of two large, independent samples, the confidence interval of a common statistical indicator was employed. The results show that in comparison to low PM2.5 level days, weather features such as stagnant conditions, including low mixing height and low wind speed, low rainfall amount, and high solar hours, are favorable for inducing PM2.5 events. Eighty percent of the synoptic weather patterns on PM2.5 days were associated with either polar continental high pressure, a high-pressure system in mainland China moving from the continent to the sea, or a stationary front stretching from southern China to the East Sea, and moving eastwards. More than 81% of the contributing factors of the causes of PM2.5 events were found to be related to stagnant conditions. The pattern of the contributing factors causing the maximum-recorded concentration of PM2.5, (73.90 mu g/m(3)) was attributed to local emissions, and a long-range transport time that was extended for a longer period over the land than over the sea. The synoptic weather patterns were also found to affect the spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentrations in the basin. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. This study included two designs of furnished cages for 16 hens; H-cages divided into two apartments by a partition with pop holes in the middle of the cage, and fully open O-cages, without a partition. The hypothesis was that in this rather large group of birds the pop hole partition would benefit the birds by allowing them to avoid or escape from potential cannibals, feather-peckers or aggressive hens. All cages had two nests, two perches and one litter box.
   2. A total of 10 cages (5 H and 5 O) were stocked with Lohmann Selected Leghorn (LSL) and 8 cages (4 H and 4 O) with Hy-Line W36. No birds were beak-trimmed.
   3. Heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratios, duration of tonic immobility (TI) and exterior appearance (scoring of plumage condition and wounds at comb or around cloaca) were used as indicators of well-being. Total mortality and deaths due to cannibalism were also recorded.
   4. Visits to nests and passages through partition pop holes were studied in samples of 35 and 21 birds, respectively, using a technique based on passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags.
   5. Cage design (H- vs O-cage) had no effect on the welfare traits chosen.
   6. Hy-Line birds showed higher H/L ratios, longer duration of TI and better plumage condition than LSL birds. These differences are discussed in terms of stress thresholds and copying strategies.
   7. On days when a hen made visits to nests, the visiting frequency was 1.4 and the total time in the nest was 41 min on average. Hens made use of the pop hole passages between 1 and 8 times per hen and day.
   8. Overall low levels of aggression, lack of injuries or deaths due to cannibalism, and plumage condition indicating moderate feather pecking, together imply a low need to escape. The pop holes were used frequently and birds distributed well between compartments showing that the system worked well. However, at this group size there was no evidence in the measured traits that H-cages provided a better housing environment.

AB  - Paleoenvironmental conditions of the sediments of the Cretaceous Codo Formation in Brazil are still being debated. The main point of controversy is whether they were deposited in a strictly marine environment or under lacustrine conditions of varying salinity. In this study, organic facies and biomarker analyses were performed on samples from the Codo Formation in the Sao Luis Basin, northwest Brazil, to reconstruct the paleoenvironmental conditions, the origin, and the thermal maturity of the organic matter. Four types of palynofacies associations (PI - amorphous organic matter, PII - amorphous organic matter+sporomorphs, PIII - phytoclasts, and IV - marine palynomorphs) were identified. The total organic carbon (TOC) content exhibits a strong correlation (rho = 0.75, p <.05) with amorphous organic matter (AOM) content suggesting that AOM is the main factor controlling TOC in the stratigraphic section, and that increases in the AOM contribution were associated with an increase in the water column and expansion of reducing conditions that favored organic matter preservation. The TOC and total sulfur (TS) plots suggest that there were salinity variations in the depositional environment. The identification of marine palynomorphs (Subtilisphaera genus) are indicative of several local marine incursions. The n-alkane distribution (unimodal and bimodal) confirmed the presence of strong input of higher plant components (phytoclast-dominated Palynofacies III) and the bacterially-reworked organic material (Palynofacies I/II). The aquatic terrestrial (ATR), terrigenous/aquatic (TAR), and proxy for aquatic macrophytes (P-aq) ratios suggest autochthonous (Palynofacies I and II) and allochthonous (Palynofacies III) organic matter, and eutrophic and submerged-floating plants. Based on palynofacies associations and biomarkers we conclude that the depositional environment ranged from an anoxic/reducing to dysoxic/oxic within a closed-lacustrine system having a stratified water column. High evaporation rates favored a decrease in the water column and an increase in salinity, allowing the precipitation of salt by evaporation (CaCO3 > 80%). The thermal maturity indicators including vitrinite reflectance (%Ro), spore color index (SCI), Ts/(Ts + Tm) ratios, and C-29 20S/(20S + 20R) and C-29 beta beta/(alpha alpha + beta beta) indicate that the organic matter is immature to marginally mature.

AB  - We conducted a case study of National Centers for Environmental Prediction Climate Forecast System version 2 seasonal model forecast performance over Indonesia in predicting the dry conditions in 2015 that led to severe fire, in comparison to the non-El Nino dry season conditions of 2016. Forecasts of the Drought Code (DC) component of Indonesia's Fire Danger Rating System were examined across the entire equatorial Asia region and for the primary burning regions within it. Our results show that early warning lead times of high observed DC in September and October 2015 varied considerably for different regions. High DC over Southern Kalimantan and Southern New Guinea were predicted with 180 day lead times, whereas Southern Sumatra had lead times of up to only 60 days, which we attribute to the absence in the forecasts of an eastward decrease in Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures. This case study provides the starting point for longer-term evaluation of seasonal fire danger rating forecasts over Indonesia.
   Plain Language Summary During the 2015 El Nino, drier-than-normal conditions led to human-caused fires getting out of control over Indonesia's fire prone regions in Sumatra and Kalimantan, and on the island of New Guinea. Recent analyses have shown that the 2015 CO2-equivalent biomass burning emissions for all of Indonesia were in between the 2013 annual fossil fuel CO2 emissions of Japan and India. Millions of people were exposed to hazardous air quality levels for weeks, and, at its peak, a plume of pollution from the fires stretched halfway around the world at the equator. In this study, we examined how far in advance the dangerously dry conditions could have been anticipated over different fire prone regions. We used forecasts from a coupled atmosphere-ocean model to compute 180-day forecasts of a fire danger indicator used by the Indonesian government. We found that dry conditions could have been anticipated at least 60 days in advance over Sumatra, and at least 180 days in advance over Kalimantan and New Guinea. Our analysis serves as the starting point for the development of early warning systems for fire managers in Indonesia.

TI  - The use of simultaneous chemical precipitation in modified activated sludge systems exhibiting biological excess phosphate removal - Part 5: Experimental periods using a ferrous-ferric chloride blend

KW  - MODEL
AB  - A blend of ferrous chloride and ferric chloride (FeCl2-FeCl3) was simultaneously dosed into an activated sludge system at pilot scale in order to test the effect on biological P removal. Additional removal due to chemical precipitation was measured as the difference in system P removal between parallel test and control systems. Both systems strongly exhibited biological excess P removal (BEPR). The extent of P release in me anaerobic reactors of the two systems was compared by mass balance, as one indicator of the relative "magnitude" of BEPR. Phosphorus fractionation of the mixed liquor also served as an indicator of the biological and chemical mechanisms. Evidence was found that the BEPR mechanism is partially inhibited by simultaneous FeCl2-FeCl3 addition, even in the absence of effluent phosphate limitation. However, the degree of inhibition was relatively low, ranging from 3 to 25% (approximately) for Fe doses in the range ca. 10 to 20 mg/l as Fe, with an average system P removal of 14 to 18 mgP/l in the control. FeCl2-FeCl3 dosing in this range was sufficient to produce additional P removal of the order of 1 to 8 mgP/l over periods of one to seven sludge ages per experimental period, depending on the experimental conditions. Sustained operation of the BEPR mechanism in the presence of FeCl2-FeCl3 was possible over a continuous period of seven sludge ages, under conditions in which effluent phosphate was at least partially limiting. Under such conditions, the chemical and biological mechanisms appear to be "disadvantaged" to approximately the same extent, as evidenced by the apparent stoichiometry of Fe:P for the chemical precipitation and magnitude of the poly P containing fractions measured for the biological mechanism. This suggested mat the biological mechanism is able to compete effectively with the chemical mechanism under conditions of low reactor phosphate concentrations (similar to1 mgP/l orthoP) for sustained periods. However. the presence of simultaneous chemical precipitant significantly reduces the extent to which the biological P removal potential is utilised under P-limiting conditions. This could explain the difficulty sometimes reported in the control of full-scale activated sludge systems with simultaneous precipitant addition where a very low affluent P concentration (<1 mgP/l) has to be achieved.

AB  - Environmental gradients may influence a plant's physiological status and morphology, which in turn may affect plantplant interactions. However, little is known about the relationship between environmental variation, physiological and morphological variability of plants and variation in the balance between competition and facilitation. Mountain ranges in dry environments have opposing altitudinal environmental gradients of temperature and aridity, which limit plant growth at high and low elevations. This makes them particularly suitable for exploring the relationships between environmental conditions, plant phenotype and plantplant interactions. We hypothesized that different environmental stressors will differently affect the physiological status of a nurse plant. This, then, manifests itself as variation in nurse plant morphological traits, which in turn mediates plantplant interactions by altering microhabitat conditions for the nurse and associated species. In an observational study, we measured a series of functional traits of Arenaria tetraquetra cushions as indicators of its physiological status (e.g. specific leaf area, relative water content) and morphology (e.g. cushion compactness, size). Measurements were taken along the entire elevation range where A.tetraquetra occurs. Furthermore, we analysed how these functional traits related to soil properties beneath cushions and the number of associated species and individuals compared with open areas. Cushions at high elevation showed good physiological status; they were compact and large, had higher soil water and organic matter content compared with open areas and showed the strongest facilitation effect of the whole elevation gradient that is, the highest increase in species richness and abundance of beneficiaries compared with open areas. Physiological data at low elevation indicated stressful abiotic conditions for A.tetraquetra, which formed loose and small cushions. These cushions showed less improved soil conditions and had reduced facilitative effects compared with those at high elevation. Synthesis. Functional traits of the nurse species varied distinctively along the two opposing stress gradients, in parallel to the magnitude of differences in microenvironmental conditions between cushions and the surrounding open area, and also to the facilitation effect of cushions. Our data, therefore, provides a strong demonstration of the generally overlooked importance of a nurse plant's vigour and morphology for its facilitative effects.

AB  - The dendrochronological studies were carried out on very well preserved sub-fossil pine wood found in the biogenic deposits of the Rucianka raised bog (NE Poland). Local floating chronologies, covering the period 990-460 cal BC, were dated on the basis of radiocarbon analyses. Growth depressions in annual tree-ring widths indicated periodical deterioration of the environmental conditions, which affected tree growth. Identified germination and dying-off phases (GDO) should be related to the wetter climatic periods. The extinction of trees took place during periods of higher groundwater level which, in turn, caused favourable conditions for growth of young pines.

AB  - A geochemical approach combining chemical and mineralogical studies together with pH-dependent leaching experiments was applied to carry out an environmental risk assessment analysis of copper metallurgical slags. Two groups of Cu-metallurgical slags were investigated: historical (HS) and modern slags including shaft furnace slag (SFS), granulated slag (GS) and lead slag (LS) representing various smelting technologies. The metallic elements composition (Cu, Zn and Pb) of the slags, especially their distribution in mineral phases as well as their leachability at different pH conditions were determined. The slags display different chemical (e.g., Cu; HS: 5657 mg/kg; SFS: 2687 mg/kg; GS: 11,425 mg/kg, LS: 10,915 mg/kg) and phase composition, with various impurities of metallic elements in different quantities. Consequently, these materials show different leachability of metallic compounds when exposed to various pH conditions (2-13). HS and SFS slags are mainly composed of synthetic analogues of silicates such as fayalite (HS) and diopside (SFS) as well as minor sulphides. GS is an amorphous material composed of glass containing copper droplets, whereas LS is an exceptional slag type corresponding to a matte and characterized by a volumetrically major sulphides and a minor fayalite content. pH-dependent leaching experiments revealed that high concentrations of Cu, Zn and Pb may be released during leaching. Aggressive acidic conditions (pH 2) were found to be the least stable for the analysed materials, e.g., Cu: up to 5873 mg/kg for GS; Zn: up to 8919 mg/kg for LS, Pb: up to 17,186 mg/kg for LS. Alkaline pH (12-13), being generally less aggressive for slags than acidic conditions, also showed that significant amounts of metals may be mobilized (e.g., Cu: up to 114 mg/kg for HS; Zn: up to 243 mg/kg for LS; Pb: up to 5539 mg/kg for LS). pH conditions close to neutral (7-8) and those with slightly alkaline pH (10.5) appear to be the most stable for the analysed materials.

AB  - Sediments and water columns in the Los Angeles Outer Harbor (CA, USA), a major port behind a breakwater, contain DDTs and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from a nearby Superfund site, and contaminants brought in by ships, boats, stormwater, a river, and a wastewater outfall. White croaker and queenfish, a bottom feeder and a water column feeder, respectively, are two bioindicators for this marine ecosystem. Their condition as populations of fish is assumed to be robust for this role at all times. The present study tests this benign assumption amid progressively increasing DDT/PCB levels in their tissues. The results, as shown by progressively shrinking gonads, show a less than robust white croaker population particularly. Although the males are generally larger than the females, the length (standard [SL] or total [TL]) and body mass (BM) of 80 white croakers collected over 8 years were found to be similar irrespective of gender (177 mm, 212 mm, and 114 g, respectively). Queenfish (67) did not show such similarity over the same period (female: 152 mm SL, 177 mm TL, 56 g BM; male: 145 mm SL, 172 mm TL, 50 g BM). The site-specific expressions/values capturing the current conditions of these fish populations are SL = 0.835[TL] - 1.68 (r(2) = 0.914, n = 68) and SL = 0.891[TL] - 8.88 (r(2) = 0.961, n = 50) for white croaker and queenfish, respectively. In the allometric growth equation BM = a[SL](b), a and b are 2.83 and 2.49 x 10(-4) (r(2) = 0.817) for white croakers, and 6.10 and 2.73 x 10(-5) (r(2) = 0.825) for queenfish, respectively. The relative coefficients of condition K-n are 0.97 +/- 0.07 and 1.01 +/- 0.12 for white croakers and queenfish, respectively. Molecular-level studies are needed to establish definitively the links between DDT/PCB bioaccumulation in fish tissues and the robustness of the fish populations. Environ Toxicol Chem 2022;00:1-17.

Parameters of reproduction as the basis for the adaptation of this species to the environmental conditions were considered in detail. Nesting terms of penduline tit are extended, and reproductive indicators are characterized by the high seasonal variability. The main factor responsible for the reduction in the productivity of the penduline tit population in all the parts of its range is clutch desertion. Unfavorable weather conditions along with the original mating system of this species can be the causes of this phenomenon.

AB  - Palynological and sedimentological data from a core extracted from Lake Eteza shed new light on the Holocene vegetation and climate history in KwaZulu-Natal and can be linked to regional and global climate change. A 2072 cm core with nineteen radiocarbon dates and chronological extrapolation to the bottom of the sequence suggests that sedimentation started ca. 10200 cal yrs BP. Between ca. 10200 and 6800 cal yrs BP pollen indicators point to a change from intermediately humid conditions to comparatively drier grassy environments. This is in good agreement with Sea Surface Temperature (SST) fluctuations from a core in the Mozambique Channel which influence precipitation in coastal KwaZulu-Natal, and the beginning of the Holocene Thermal Maximum ca. 10500 cal yrs BP. The lower section of the core corresponds to gradually increasing Holocene sea levels along the coast and development of freshwater or estuarine conditions at Lake Eteza. The middle Holocene (ca. 6800-3600 cal yrs BP), when the sea level reached its highest stand and SST peak, indicate humid climatic conditions that favoured an increase of forest trees, e.g. Podocarpus, and undergrowth plants like Issoglossa. As a consequence of higher precipitation and increase of the water table, conditions were favourable for the spread of mangrove, swamp and possibly riverine forest. During the late Holocene after ca. 3600 cal yrs BP a decrease of Podocarpus and other trees as well as an increase of Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae, grasses and Phoenix coincide with a return to lower sea levels and drier conditions. The decrease of all trees including Phoenix at ca. 700 cal yrs BP, accompanied by rapid sedimentation rates, possibly reflect forest clearing and upland erosion induced by activities of Iron Age settlers. A dry period at the globally recognized onset of the Little Ice Age might have contributed to these changes. Late Iron Age settlers have probably already introduced Zea mays, which was detected in the profile since ca. 210 BP. The appearance of neophytes like Pinus, Casuarina and pollen of Ambrosia-type in the youngest sediments indicates increased disturbance of European settlements and land use since ca. 100 cal yrs BP.

AB  - Various interventions need to be done in riverbeds for achieving certain goals (recreational, economic, flood prevention). However, they should have a low impact on river environments. This paper analyses the effects of a rise in the upstream water levels as an indicator of the impacts magnitude. We found that such an intervention can generate low impacts if it does no result in arise of the water levels. The study was carried out considering two rivers in the North East of Romania: Siret and Bahlui. The conditions in which various interventions can have low impacts were identified by analyzing two possible situations: a river water intake and a discharge sill with flap gate.

AB  - Background: Reactive oxygen species are formed through the electron transfer reactions in the mitochondria and chloroplasts and rapidly converted to H2O2. Therefore, H2O2 as a more stable ROS can be considered as an indicator of cellular stress and it can be used in a steady state to monitor intracellular stress level. In this regard, the increasing use of various nanoparticles, most of which are associated with biological systems, arc essential to be studied for their possible adverse effects. We measured the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in samples collected before and after the treatment with silver nanoparticles by a novel method and optimized this method for the living tissue.
   Methods: In this study, we evaluated the endogenous H2O2 production from Pyricularia oryzae tissue under normal and stress conditions (such as after treatment with nanoparticles) by spectrophotometric assay. The method used is based on instant reaction of hydrogen peroxide with vanadium pentoxide in sulfuric acid solution, forming a peroxovanadate complex that has a maximum absorption at 454 nm. This method was also compared with other methods.
   Results: The results of this method compared with other methods in the same tissue showed that the method is simple, inexpensive and more efficient, and the complex is stable for several hours and can be used for a variety of H2O2 concentrations. Also, the detection range of the mentioned method equals with high-sensitivity methods such as available commercial kits. Furthermore, this method can also measure higher values of H2O2.
   Conclusion: The optimized methods for measuring the H2O2 concentration with vanadium pentoxide in sulfuric acid solution by the colorimetric method are simple, efficient, rapid, accurate, cost-effective and do not have problems of other methods. The measurements using this method in Pyricularia oryzae under oxidative stress showed that the created oxidative stress caused by the use of silver nanopartieles increased H2O2 in fungal tissue. H2O2 is the SOD reaction product that is later decomposed by CAT. This method is able to measure H2O2 in different ranges and under normal and stress conditions which are indicative of antioxidant defense. Therefore, we recommend it to the researchers in similar conditions.

AB  - The feasibility of using the Barn Owl (Tyto alba guttata) to monitor environmental quality in the Netherlands was investigated, using Cd, Cu, Pb, Mn, and Fe as indicators for environmental contamination.
   Throughout 1992, bird-watchers, volunteers, and officials submitted 53 birds. The age and geographical distribution of these birds formed a representative sample of the population. The following interrelationships were investigated: cause of death, nutrient reserve, age, time of death, place of death, body measurements, sex, condition, and heavy metal concentration in kidney, liver, and tibia.
   Twenty-eight animals had died after collisions. Fifteen Barn Owls died of exhaustion. In total, twenty-four birds were exhausted, with coccidiosis or other parasitic gastrointestinal infections. The condition of the birds showed that as the birds' condition worsened, fat reserves were depleted before protein reserves. Significant linear relationships were found between decreasing protein reserves and decreasing dry weights of the liver, kidney, flight muscle and heart, but not of the tibia. An asymptotic, nonlinear relation was observed between dry organ weight and fat reserve. This suggested that fat reserves were only found when protein reserves exceeded 15% of the body mass at starvation. Concentrations of Cu and Fe in liver and kidney rose as protein reserves fell; the total content of Cu and Fe per organ, however, remained constant. The Mn concentration of these organs remained constant; Mn content increased with increasing organ sizes. Neither Cd nor Pb showed a clear relationship with parameters of body condition. The ratio between the organ content of Pb or Cd and the dry organ weight, however, revealed some birds from contaminated habitats.
   The findings suggested that concentrations of environmental contaminants Should be measured on a dry weight basis. Furthermore, depending on the pharmacokinetic characteristics of a contaminant, the total content of that contaminant per organ can be more informative than the concentration. In this one year sample of Barn Owls, no indications were found of toxic levels of Cd, Cu, Pb, Mn, or Fe in the Netherlands.
   It is concluded that the Barn Owl is a suitable biomonitor. Furthermore, a network of volunteers can produce an informative sample of the Barn Owl population without interfering with the population.

AB  - The aim of this study is a synthesis of current knowledge on the mechanism and control of stereotypies in animals. These behaviors depend on animal species, breeds and environmental conditions. The stereotypies occur as a result of environmental discomfort. This causes emotional disturbances in psychic processes under conditions of chronic stress, improper feeding and lack of positive external stimulations. Stereotypies are connected with changed levels of serotonine, opiods, dopamine and other catecholamines in the area of the central nervous system. Current efforts in the treatment of these pathological behaviors depend on improvements of animal welfare, supply of respective training, limited surgery and pharmacological treatment, which is based on neurochemical regulation drugs.

AB  - We use results of a 3-D photochemistry/transport model for ozone formation in Mexico City during events in 1997 to investigate ambient concentrations of reactive nitrogen in relation to ozone-precursor sensitivity. Previous results from other locations suggest that ratios such as O-3/NOy and H2O2/HNO3 might provide measurement-based indicators for NOx-sensitive or VOC-sensitive conditions. Mexico City presents a different environment due to its high concentrations of VOC and high level of pollutants in general. The model predicts a correlation between PAN and O-3 with relatively high PAN/O-3 (0.07), which is still lower than measured values. The model PAN is comparable with results from a model for Paris but much higher than were found in Nashville in both models and measurements. The difference is due in part to the lower temperature in Mexico City relative to Nashville. Model HNO3 in Mexico City is unusually low for an urban area and PAN/HNO3 is very high, probably due to the high ratio of reactivity-weighted VOC to NOx. The model predicts that VOC-sensitive chemistry in Mexico is associated with high NOx, NOy and NOx/NOy and with low O-3/NOy and H2O2/HNO3, suggesting that these indicators work well for Mexico City. The relation between ozone-precursor sensitivity and either O-3/NOz or O-3/HNO3 is more ambiguous. VOC-sensitive conditions are associated with higher O-3/HNO3 than would be found in NOx-sensitive conditions, but model O-3/HNO3 associated with both NOx-sensitive and VOC-sensitive chemistry is higher in Mexico than in other cities. The model predicts a mixed pattern of ozone-precursor sensitivity in Mexico City, with VOC-sensitive conditions in the morning and NOx-sensitive in the afternoon, in contrast to results from other models for more recent events that predicted strongly VOC-sensitive conditions throughout the day. The difference in predicted ozone-precursor sensitivity is most likely due to different emission rates and to changes in emissions over time. The model with mixed sensitivity predicts much lower ambient NOx and NOx/NOy than the strongly VOC-sensitive model.

AB  - Background. Melatonin is a hormone substance that exists in various living organisms. Since it was discovered in the pineal gland of cattle in 1956, the function of melatonin in animals has been roughly clarified. Nevertheless, in plants, the research on melatonin is still insufficient. Hulless barley (Hordeum vulgare L. var. nudum hook. f.) is a crop that originates from cultivated barley in the east, usually grown on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, becoming the most important food crop in this area. Although the genome and transcriptome research of highland barley has gradually increased recently years, there are still many problems about how hulless barley adapts to the cold climate of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
   Methods. In this study, we set three temperature conditions 25 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 5 degrees C hulless barley seedlings, and at the same time soaked the hulless barley seeds with a 1 mu M melatonin solution for 12 hours before the hulless barley seeds germinated. Afterwards, the growth and physiological indicators of hulless barley seedlings under different treatment conditions were determined. Meanwhile, the qRT-PCR method was used to determine the transcription level of the hulless barley circadian clock genes under different treatment conditions under continuous light conditions.
   Results. The results showed the possible mechanism by which melatonin pretreatment can promote the growth of hulless barley under cold stress conditions by studying the effect of melatonin on the rhythm of the circadian clock system and some physiological indicators. The results revealed that the application of 1 mu M melatonin could alleviate the growth inhibition of hulless barley seedlings caused by cold stress. In addition, exogenous melatonin could also restore the circadian rhythmic oscillation of circadian clock genes, such as HvCCA1 and HvTOC1, whose circadian rhythmic phenotypes were lost due to environmental cold stress. Additionally, the results confirmed that exogenous melatonin even reduced the accumulation of key physiological indicators under cold stress, including malondialdehyde and soluble sugars.
   Discussion. Overall, these findings revealed an important mechanism that exogenous melatonin alleviated the inhibition of plant vegetative growths either by restoring the disrupted circadian rhythmic expression oscillations of clock genes, or by regulating the accumulation profiles of pivotal physiological indicators under cold stress.

AB  - Environmental monitoring, as a prerequisite for environmental risk assessment, is crucial in developing nations from Africa, Latin America, South East Asia, or Melanesia, where conspicuously most of the World's mining activity concentrates. One of the most important environmental problems relates to the disposal of mine concentrates to river systems (e.g., Irian Jaya or Papua New Guinea). However, environmental monitoring is severely restricted in developing countries due to the chronic lack of funds. This paper explores the potential for a wider use of Field Portable X-Ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy instruments (FPXRFs) in fast, real-time, cost-effective environmental surveys for heavy metal dispersal in developing countries, where access to fully equipped geochemical labs is not usually a viable option. We simulated a scenario resembling conditions to be found in a remote region affected by mining-derived metal pollution where no proper laboratory facilities existed. We used an OXFORD X-MET 3000TX XRF analyzer under quasi-realistic conditions, relying solely on the instrument to allow geochemical characterization of a highly polluted Pb-Zn old mining district in the Alcudian Valley of central Spain. Our results for Pb, Zn, Cu, As, and Cd from 12 mine sites showed an excellent performance of the instrument, both under real-time and laboratory conditions. Furthermore, the instrument proved to be fit to endure a variety of field operational conditions and was able to deal with different types of samples, including tailings, soils, and stream sediments. Thus, taking into account the affordability of FPXRFs in relation to bench-top laboratory metal analyzers and their operational simplicity, we suggest that these portable instruments should become 'the equipment of choice' for environmental monitoring in developing countries. In this respect, FPXRFs satisfy the system-independence criterion for sustainable development, i.e., the instrument can stand alone and do its job with few or no other supporting facilities or devices. We go further on these matters providing some hints on how FPXRFs could become widely available via international cooperation, and the technical and social benefits that such equipments could bring to foreign aid recipient countries.

AB  - The metabolic activity of cells of brown seaweed was studied. The metabolic activity of cells of F. vesiculosus increased in an oil-polluted environment. The period of formation of the response to the addition of a toxicant depends on conditions in the algal habitat. Metabolic activity increased during several minutes in samples that were taken from a clean area and on the third day of exposure in samples from an oilpolluted area. The level of metabolic activity of cells of F. vesiculosus can be used as an indicator of the presence of stress factors in the algal habitat.

AB  - We define a set of universal, irreducible and essential set of material conditions for achieving basic human wellbeing, along with indicators and quantitative thresholds, which can be operationalized for societies based on local customs and preferences. We draw support for this decent living standard (DLS) from different accounts of basic justice, including the capability approach and basic needs. The DLS goes beyond existing multidimensional poverty indicators by comprehensively addressing living conditions and the means of social participation. The DLS offers a normative basis to develop minimum wage and reference budgets, and to assess the environmental impacts, such as climate change, of eradicating poverty.

AB  - Despite the many approaches to study differential splicing from RNA-seq, many challenges remain unsolved, including computing capacity and sequencing depth requirements. Here we present SUPPA2, a new method that addresses these challenges, and enables streamlined analysis across multiple conditions taking into account biological variability. Using experimental and simulated data, we show that SUPPA2 achieves higher accuracy compared to other methods, especially at low sequencing depth and short read length. We use SUPPA2 to identify novel Transformer2-regulated exons, novel microexons induced during differentiation of bipolar neurons, and novel intron retention events during erythroblast differentiation.

AB  - Octopus maya is a valuable endemic species of the Yucatan Peninsula (YP). This area can be divided into distinct regions depending on the presence of cold waters associated to upwelling events during spring and summer. This study was designed to determine if the physiological and immunological condition of O. maya show a relationship with variation of the sea surface temperature associated with the seasonal upwelling. A total of 117 organisms were collected from February to July in three fishing zones: Ria Lagartos located in the upwelling zone; Seybaplaya corresponding to the non-upwelling zone, and Sisal, the transitional zone. The organisms were examined in terms of physiological (total weight, the weight of the gonad and digestive gland, osmotic pressure, hemocyanin, protein, glucose, and cholesterol concentrations in plasma), and immunological variables (total hemocyte count, hemagglutination, phenoloxidase system activity, total phenoloxidase plasma activity, and lysozyme activity). Multivariate one-way ANOVA showed overall significant differences between groups of octopus by month/zone of capture, indicating that the physiological-immunological condition of O. maya is related to a temperature gradient. Wild octopuses captured at the upwelling zone and the transitional zone (Ria Lagartos and Sisal) in February, March, and April -with temperatures lower than 27 degrees C- were in better conditions: larger size, high concentrations of hemocyanin, and low activity of the phenoloxidase system. Octopuses captured in the warmer waters (28-30 degrees C) of the non-upwelling and transitional zones (Seybaplaya and Sisal) during June and July, could be reflecting the metabolic stress through immunological compensation mechanisms with higher activity of the phenoloxidase system, despite having a lower concentration of hemocytes, hemocyanin, and proteins. Although the movement of individual O. maya along the YP throughout their life cycle has not yet been determined, direct development and benthic behavior could limit the mobility of the organisms in such a way that their physiological and immunological condition might reflect adaptation to the regional environment. This information could help understand the performance of octopuses in their distribution area, which sustains an important fishery.

AB  - This article reviews current knowledge about welfare implications of keel bone damage in laying hens. As an initial part, we shortly describe the different conditions and present major risk factors as well as findings on the prevalence of the conditions. Keel bone damage is found in all types of commercial production, however with varying prevalence across systems, countries, and age of the hens. In general, the understanding of animal welfare is influenced by value-based ideas about what is important or desirable for animals to have a good life. This review covers different types of welfare indicators, including measures of affective states, basic health, and functioning as well as natural living of the birds, thereby including the typical public welfare concerns. Laying hens with keel bone fractures show marked behavioral differences in highly motivated behavior, such as perching, nest use, and locomotion, indicating reduced mobility and potentially negative affective states. It remains unclear whether keel bone fractures affect hen mortality, but there seem to be relations between the fractures and other clinical indicators of reduced welfare. Evidence of several types showing pain involvement in fractured keel bones has been published, strongly suggesting that fractures are a source of pain, at least for weeks after the occurrence. In addition, negative effects of fractures have been found in egg production. Irrespective of the underlying welfare concern, available scientific evidence showed that keel bone fractures reduce the welfare of layers in modern production systems. Due to the limited research into the welfare implications of keel bone deviation, evidence of the consequences of this condition is not as comprehensive and clear. However, indications have been found that keel bone deviations have a negative impact on the welfare of laying hens. In order to reduce the occurrence of the conditions as well as to examine how the affected birds should be treated, more research into the welfare implications of keel bone damage is needed. Research should focus on effects of genetic lines, genetic selection, housing, and nutrition for the development, prevalence, and severity of these conditions, preferably conducted as longitudinal and/or transnational studies.

AB  - Wintering Cape May Warblers (Dendroica tigrina) were studied in three habitats along an altitudinal gradient in the Dominican Republic. Results of this study are some of the first to link both population responses and individual condition of nonbreeding birds to prevailing ecological conditions across divergent habitats. Our data suggest that Cape May Warblers are habitat generalists and generally unspecialized resource opportunists, but that differences in food resources result in competitive interactions, sex and age class segregation, and differences in site fidelity and physiological condition among habitats. Diet of the Cape May Warbler varied between habitats: in desert, Cape Mays were primarily insectivores; in dry forest, they foraged primarily on homopteran honeydew; in pine forest, they were principally frugivores. Abundance of warblers as measured by mist-net captures was highest in pine forest sites. Males were more common than females in pine habitat, whereas there was a female-biased sex ratio in other sites. Adult birds were more common in the desert and the pine forest, but there was a bias toward immature birds in dry forest habitat. Overwinter site persistence was 76% in pine, but only 28% and 33% in dry forest and desert, respectively. Annual return rate averaged 57% and did not vary significantly among habitats. Adjusted body mass of site-persistent birds was highest in pine and dry forest and lowest in desert. Pectoral muscle mass scores increased in the pine forest throughout the sampling period, whereas muscle mass scores decreased in the desert. These data suggest that, among the habitats sampled, pine was preferred. It is likely that stability and predictability of resources. particularly fruiting Trema trees and nectar sources, attracted dominant Cape May Warblers to pine forests and kept them as site-persistent individuals in good body condition. In contrast, dry forest may have been suboptimal, unless an individual was able to hold and defend a tree with honeydew-producing homopteran scale insects. Desert thorn scrub was seemingly suboptimal because resources were consistently scarce, and conditions became increasingly difficult during the late-winter dry period.

AB  - This paper attempts to analyze the links between urban poverty and environment, with special emphasis for the case of the Norte Grande Argentino in the 2011-2016 period. For this purpose, the environmental conditions experienced by poor people and their situation in relation to the non-poor are analyzed, using indicators related to household sanitary conditions, housing location, and sources of energy used. In all cases with data provided by the Permanent Household Survey published by the National Institute of Statistics and Census. The results indicate that poor face a more deteriorated environment than the non-poor and that this situation worsens in the Norte Grande Argentino in relation to the rest of the country.

AB  - This paper reviews the relationship between objective and subjective quality of life indicators. It proposes that the interaction of these variables occurs within a system that homeostatically maintains subjective quality of life within a narrow range. Due to the capacity of this system to adapt to varying environmental circumstances, the objective and subjective indicators are normally poorly correlated. However, it is also proposed that very poor objective conditions can defeat homeostasis and, once this occurs, the objective and subjective indicators display stronger covariation. Empirical data are provided to support this model and the implications for understanding the QOL construct are discussed.

AB  - Paleoecologic interpretation of Cretaceous benthic foraminiferal assemblages is frequently problematic because of the lack of modem indicator species. Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian to Coniacian) assemblages of the Nkalagu area in Southern Nigeria (Lower Benue Trough) were analyzed paleoecologically and compared with isochronous assemblages of the Upper Benue Trough (Futuk and Ashaka). The analyzed sections are forming a transect from near shore to oceanic environments and therefore represent paleocological gradients. Late Cenomanian assemblages of the Nkalagu area are Continuously dominated by Ammobaculites spp.. Diversity is constantly low and a dysoxic to suboxic. normal marine. inner shelf environment can be assumed for this section. The Middle Turonian to Coniacian Sections at Nkalagu yielded various arenaceous and calcareous species. The most common genera are: Ammobaculites, Flabellammina, Gabonita, Gavelinella, Haplophragmoides. Nonionella, Planulina. Praebulimina Trochammina. Middle to early Late Turonian sediments at Nkalagu were deposited at paleo-waterdepths of about 600 m. latest Turonian sediments at c. 250 m and Coniacian sediments at c. 600 m. Latest Turonian assemblages indicate unstable, alternating oxygen-rich and oxygen depleted conditions (suboxic to low oxic). changing to more stable conditions in the Coniacian at Nkalagu. The successive deepening indicated by the foraminiferal assemblages documents a change of the depositional environment from inner shelf to upper bathyal in the lower portion of the Benue Trough during the Cenomanian to Coniacian interval. Inner shelf assemblages from the Upper Benue Trough (Futuk and Ashaka localities) Vary between brackish and normal marine conditions. Aminobaculites, Haplophragmoides and Gavelinella are the most frequent genera at Futuk. while additional Occurrences of Ammotium. Reophax and Saccammina are indicative for brackish conditions at Ashaka. The application of a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), embracing assemblages from the entire Benue Trough. enables the separation of different depositional environments with partly similar species content. In the present case, CCA is able to distinguish between brackish and normal marine conditions among shallow water assemblages. and between shelf and bathyal depths among normal marine depositional environments. CCA might therefore be used in settings with largely endemic associations and/or without modern species for calibration of assemblages. such as the Cretaceous Benue Trough.

AB  - Anadromous brown trout (Salmo trutta) were sampled at spawning in six Norwegian rivers, located between 58 and 64-degrees-N. Sea age at first maturity was significantly influenced by the growth rate at sea, but not by the growth rate in the river. Between rivers, sea age at maturity declined with increasing smolt age. Within rivers, brown trout from upper stretches smoltified at an older age and matured at an older sea age than brown trout from the lower stretches. Males matured at a younger sea age than females. Smolt age, sex and environmental conditions accounted for about 30% of the overall variation in sea age at first maturity.

AB  - The Upper Triassic successions in the Qiangtang Basin are important targets for petroleum exploration, although they are poorly understood at present. The black mudstones collected from well QZ-16 are the deepest Upper Triassic source rocks to date and have over-mature organic matter (OM) (Ro > 2). In this study, the total organic carbon (TOC) and systematic inorganic geochemistry were determined to reconstruct depositional conditions (palaeoclimate, palaeosalinity, primary productivity, redox conditions, sedimentation rate, and detrital influx) and to assess the OM accumulation mechanism. The TOC contents of the Bagong Fm. mudstones first decrease and then increase from bottom to top (Unit A to Unit D), and Unit C has the lowest TOC contents. These mudstones have relatively obvious correlations between TOC content and the palaeosalinity proxy (Sr/Ba), redox indexes (U/Al, V/Al, Mo/Al, U/Th, and V/Cr) and sedimentation rate indicator ((La/Yb)N), which indicate that OM accumulation was dominated by both high salinity and a slow sedimentation rate in a dysoxic environment. The high Al2O3/TiO2 ratios indicate that the provenance of these mudstones was primarily from felsic igneous rocks. High detrital influx of felsic igneous rock provenance would have diluted the OM and inhibited OM preservation, as evidenced by the negative correlations between TOC content and detrital influx parameters, including SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, and K2O. The primary productivity (P/Al and Ba/Al) is poorly correlated with TOC for these mudstones, suggesting that its effect on OM accumulation was negligible or limited. The relatively high TOC contents of mudstones from Units A and B are mainly related to the interaction of dysoxic conditions, a highsalinity water column, slow sedimentation rates, and a low detrital influx. An oxidizing water column with low salinity and a relatively high detrital influx and sedimentation rate upward in Unit C led to greater OM degradation and dilution and the lowest TOC contents. The significant TOC content fluctuations in Unit D may be related to vertical variations in the depositional conditions.

AB  - Birds respond rapidly to changes in both habitat and climate conditions and thus are good indicators of the ecological effects of a changing climate, which may include warmer temperatures, changing habitat conditions, and increased frequency and magnitude of extreme events like drought. We investigated how a widespread tree mortality event concurrent with a severe drought influenced the avian community of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. We assessed and compared the separate effects of climate stresses and altered habitat conditions on the avian community and used this information to evaluate the changes that are likely to occur in the near future. We built tree mortality maps from freely available Landsat imagery with Google Earth Engine. We analyzed avian point counts from 2010 to 2016 in the southern Sierra Nevada, to model temperature, water deficit, and tree mortality effects on the abundances of 45 bird species, and then used these models to project abundances into the future based on three climate projections. A large portion of the avian community, 47%, had a positive relationship with temperature increase, compared to 20% that responded negatively. More species (36%) declined with drier conditions than increased (29%). More species declined in response to high tree mortality (36%) than increased (9%). A preponderance of species adapted to colder temperatures (higher elevation) had negative responses to high tree mortality and water deficit, but positive responses to increasing temperature. We projected the highest total bird abundances in the future under the warmest climate scenario that we considered, but habitat modification (e.g., tree mortality) and water deficit could offset the positive influence of temperature for many species. As other studies have shown, climate warming may lead to substantial but idiosyncratic effects on wildlife species that could result in community composition shifts. We conclude that future climate conditions may not have a universally negative effect on biodiversity in the Sierra Nevada, but probable vegetation changes and increased likelihood of extreme events such as drought should be incorporated into climate-smart forest and wildlife management decisions.

AB  - Although riparian buffers are an important aspect of forest management in the boreal forest of Canada, little is known about the habitat conditions within buffers, due in part to complex edge effects in response to both the upland clearcut and the stream. We investigated microclimatic conditions and bryophyte growth and vitality in seven locations between the stream edge and 60 m into the upland undisturbed conifer forests and at the clearcut sites with riparian buffer 30 km northwest of Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada. We hypothesized that the growth and vitality of a pleurocarpous moss, Hylocomium splendens, and an acrocarpous moss, Polytrichum commune, would be directly related to the microclimatic gradients detected. We further hypothesized that sensitivity of the bryophytes to environmental factors will vary depending on their life form type, i.e., pleurocarpous moss will respond differently than the acrocarpous moss. Both bryophyte species were transplanted in pots and placed at 10-m intervals along 60-m transects perpendicular to the stream across the buffer. and undisturbed sites. Bryophyte growth, cover, and vitality, as well as microclimatic parameters and plant cover, were measured over the summer in 2003.
   The riparian buffers were simultaneously affected by microclimatic gradients extending from both the clearcut edge and the riparian-upland ecotonal edge. Both bryophyte species responded to changes in the microclimatic conditions. However, vapor pressure deficit (VPD) was the most important factor influencing the growth of H. splendens, whereas for P. commune growth soil moisture was most important. Our study confirms earlier findings that interior forest bryophytes such as H. splendens can be used as indicators to monitor edge effects and biodiversity recovery following forest harvesting. We demonstrate that growth and vitality of these bryophytes reflect the prevailing near-ground microclimatic conditions at the forest edges. Abundance estimates of such bryophytes can be used to determine the depth of edge effects across both ecotonal edges (e.g., riparian-upland forest edge) and anthropogenically created edges (e.g., clearcut edge). Forest management practices must consider depth of edge in determining the appropriate width of riparian buffers that would be necessary to sustain biodiversity and associated values at the land/water interface.

AB  - We introduce two simple models of forward-backward stochastic differential equations with a singular terminal condition and we explain how and why they appear naturally as models for the valuation of CO2 emission allowances. Single phase cap-and-trade schemes lead readily to terminal conditions given by indicator functions of the forward component, and using fine partial differential equations estimates, we show that the existence theory of these equations, as well as the properties of the candidates for solution, depend strongly upon the characteristics of the forward dynamics. Finally, we give a first order Taylor expansion and show how to numerically calibrate some of these models for the purpose of CO2 option pricing.

AB  - Bubas bubalus (Oliver) is an important agent of dung dispersal in pasture habitats.  Newly emerged females show little differentiation in their single ovariole.  When environmental conditions are favorable (after rainfall and with mild temperatures), the oocytes mature sequentially.  There is a significant correlation in size between the terminal and subterminal oocyte.  When the terminal oocyte is laid, it leaves a yellow body inside the neck of the ovariole (calix).  Yellow body accumulates as the laying period progresses.  During adult life in response to stress, B. bubalus females resorb the oocytes; this resorption can be from either inside or outside the ovarioles.  The latter is more frequent, and it suggests an important adaptive advantage.

TI  - COASTAL DUNES AS INDICATORS OF ENVIRONMENTAL-CHANGE
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE

AB  - The many special characteristics of coastal dunes and coastal dune fields make them significant and sensitive indicators of changing conditions in the coastal zone.  The coastal zone marks the transition of marine to terrestrial environments.  It is thus particularly sensitive to changes in either or both of these systems.  Coastal dune systems are useful indicators of environmental conditions in the coastal zone mainly because dunes are 'soft landforms' which respond rapidly to the dynamic driving forces which make them.  The dune systems adapt themselves to the stress field of the winds which are primarily responsible for forming them, and in doing so they record in their morphological shape and other relationships some of the distinctive features of the environmental driving forces.

AB  - Multiple time scales are the intrinsic nature of complex systems and can be revealed through single molecule photon statistical analysis. The standard Poisson indicator defined by the time-averaged initial condition measures photon bunching and antibunching but cannot be directly related to multiple time scales. A new indicator defined by the event-averaged initial condition is proposed to detect the deviation from the renewal behavior and to directly probe the effects of conformational fluctuations. Detailed calculations of modulated two-level systems are carried out using the transfer matrix method to demonstrate the difference between the two indicators. The relationship between ensemble-averaged survival probabilities and photon statistics is also explored in the context of single molecule measurements.

AB  - Starting from different definitions of the term 'sustainability', various concepts of sustainability assessment are presented and their inherent limitations discussed. One method of sustainability assessment is the use of ecological indicators, of which bio-indicators are a sub-group, including indicator species. The concept of 'ELLENBERG indicators', a phyto-sociological approach for using indicator plants, is introduced. They are most appropriate for sustainability assessment of agricultural land use systems at local level. Analyzing the composition of weed societies permits trend detection of the soil status. The correlation between site conditions and weed composition is being investigated in three research areas in the Andean highlands in Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia, comparing altitudinal and latitudinal gradients of climatic conditions as well as different soil types.

AB  - Near surface disposal of low- and intermediate-level radioactive wastes (LILW) requires evaluating the field conditions of the candidate site. However, assessment of the site conditions may be challenging due to the limited prior knowledge of some remote sites, and various multi-disciplinary data requirements at any given site. These situations arise in China as in the rest of the industrialized world, particularly since a regional strategy for LILW disposal has been implemented to protect humans and the environment. This paper presents a demonstration of the site assessment process through a case study focusing mainly on the geologic, hydrogeologic and geochemical characteristics of the candidate site.
   A joint on-site and laboratory investigation, supplemented by numerical modeling, was implemented in this assessment. Results indicate that no fault is present in the site area, although there are some minor joints and fractures, primarily showing a north-south trend. Most of the joints are filled with quartz deposits and would thus function hydraulically as impervious barriers. Investigation of local hydrologic boundaries has shown that the candidate site represents an essentially isolated hydrogeologic unit, and that little or no groundwater flow occurs across its boundaries on the north or east, or across the hilly areas to the south. Groundwater in the site area is recharged by precipitation and discharges primarily by evapo-transpiration and surface flow through a narrow outlet to the west. Groundwater flows slowly from the hilly area to the foot of the hills and discharges mainly into the inner brooks and marshes. Some groundwater circulates in deeper granite in a slower manner. The vadose zone in the site was investigated specially for their significant capability for restraining the transport of radionuclides. Results indicate that the vadose zone is up to 38 m in thickness and is made up of alluvial clay soils and very highly weathered granite. The vadose zone has low saturated hydraulic conductivities on the order of 10(-5) cm/s and in this respect is well-suited for the disposal of LILW. The saturated formations are primarily made up of silt and moderately-to-slightly weathered granite, which exhibit even lower hydraulic conductivities, on the order of 10(-6) cm/s, also favorable for restraining the transport of radionuclides. Chemical analyses indicate that the groundwaters at the site are of the HCO3-Na center dot Ca and HCO3 center dot SO4-Na center dot Ca types and are weakly corrosive to concrete and steel. Geochemical analyses indicate that the rock and soil materials (particularly weathered granite) at the site contain very small fractions of colloidal particles and exhibit low Cation Exchange Capacities (CEC), and would therefore have limited capacity for sorption of radionuclides.
   Groundwater flow and solute transport models of the candidate site have been developed using MODFLOW and MT3DMS, incorporating the data obtained during the assessment program. Calibration was based on the available measured groundwater level fluctuations and tracer concentrations from in situ dispersion tests. The longitudinal dispersion coefficient as determined in calibration is equal to 5.0 x 10(-3) m(2)/d. Numerical sensitivity analyses indicate that the hydraulic conductivity and the longitudinal dispersion coefficient are the key parameters controlling the transport of radionuclides, while the numerical model is not sensitive to changes in the effective porosity and the specific yield. Preliminary predictions have been performed with the calibrated model both for the natural setting of the site and the graded site in which the valleys of the site are backfilled with low permeable materials. Results indicate that the proposed site grading increases the safety of the site for disposal of LILW by reducing both the groundwater level and the hydraulic gradient and that radionuclide transport would not likely be a problem or cause groundwater contamination. Although there are some problems remaining to be addressed in future work, the conclusion of the assessment is that the conditions at this site are appropriate for LILW disposal. This study provides an example of the procedures necessary in an assessment of site conditions relevant to the safe disposal of LILW. Such an assessment is crucial to the site selection process and to subsequent environmental impact assessment. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration offers a vital opportunity to advance scaled-up, integrated approaches that reverse ecosystem degradation, biodiversity loss, and climate disruption and deterioration. Combining tools across disciplines is essential to addressing these interwoven, global crises through inclusive, equitable strategies with demonstrable socio-economic benefits. Tools and initiatives described here, including the EcoHealth Network, the System of Environmental Economic Accounting Ecosystem Accounting and its application through the INCASE project in Ireland, and the Natural Capital Project, present ready-made approaches to engage with policymakers and stakeholders in a transparent way. These examples are working to yield accurate indicators revealing the true costs and benefits of restoration policies and projects in both environmental and social terms. We highlight that collaborative efforts, particularly engagement between ecologists, economists, and other stakeholders, are essential to inform the ongoing development of fit-for-purpose natural capital approaches, and that synergies between natural capital and restoration approaches can be further strengthened to raise awareness of, and progress, restoration projects on the scale the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration envisages. We also reflect on the term "natural capital," which is often misunderstood as implying that monetary metrics should take preference over non-monetary arguments or considerations, thereby presenting a barrier to engagement for some ecologists, environmentalists, and stakeholders. Natural capital approaches offer us opportunities to track and support the necessary changes to expand and embed the culture of restoration into decision-making across sectors, highlighting multiple benefits for society and economy.

AB  - Financial institutions are indirectly exposed to risks associated with the impacts and dependencies on natural capital and ecosystem services of the companies that they invest in, lend to, and insure. This is particularly true for banks lending to agriculture: a sector with both significant impacts and critical dependencies on natural capital. Bank lending is a vital source of new finance for the sector, which is essential to achieve sustainable intensification targets. Yet current credit decision-making practice is still based on conventional financial and management indicators, lacking any systematic assessment of natural capital risks, especially those associated with dependencies. Operationalising natural capital risk assessment requires practicable indicators and data to evaluate the most material natural capital risks for a given sub-sector and geography, but it is unclear to what extent these are available. We assess the practicability of natural capital dependency risk indicators and data sources for a critical case study of Australian sheep production. We find that at least moderately practicable indicators and data sources are available to assess the 11 major dependency risks that are material for this industry. Challenges remain in determining risk thresholds for most indicators, and quantifying risk impacts on profitability.

AB  - Earthworms contribute to a wide range of process that underpin soil function and ecosystem services and are an important component of a soil's natural capital stocks. With increasing interest in soil health, it is important to better understand the type of earthworm community required to enhance soil functions. This is of particular interest in New Zealand where pasture systems are dominated by exotic earthworm species and low ecological diversity. Two separate mesocosm experiments were established to explore the interaction between earthworm abundance and ecological diversity as it influences soil functions. Experimental increases in earthworm abundance increased soil macroporosity and water infiltration, increased plant nitrogen (N) and plant growth. Although some benefits were observed at the lowest earthworm abundances, the greatest benefits were seen at the higher abundances. Earthworm ecological diversity is also critical to ensure soil functions are optimised. For example, the single species of Aporrectodea caliginosa alone was not able to improve water infiltration or pasture production. However, when this species was found in combination with Aporrectodea longa, there was positive influence on soil functions despite the abundance of A. longa itself not increasing. This study highlights the importance of including a measure of ecological diversity alongside a measure of abundance to assess soil biological health.

AB  - Emergy analysis is a thermodynamically based approach to assess the performance of systems and it is a useful tool for environmental decision-making. The kelp resource (Lessonia nigrescens Bory) is the basis for one of the main benthic fisheries of northern Chile, in both economic and social terms. The Atacama coastal kelp fishery is most important at the national level. To better understand the long-term changes in the environmental and socioeconomic factors that govern the sustainability of the resource, emergy synthesis was used to evaluate the performance of the L. nigrescens kelp fishery, based on data from 2000, 2014, and 2018. These emergy assessments show that over this period, the empower base (R) supporting intertidal kelp beds decreased 41%, the annual emergy used in the fishing effort (F) increased by an order of magnitude, and the total emergy used in the fishing system (Y) decreased by 39%. The values of the Landings/Fishing Effort Ratio (EYR) showed a general tendency to decrease, as the Emergy Investment Ratio (EIR) increased. The economic exchange of emergy indicates that in 2014 the extractors/collectors operating the algae fishery obtained the greatest emergy gain by trading. The analysis of the emergy indicators explained the long-term changes in the sustainability of the kelp resource and the emergy balance of the economic transactions over the last 20 years. In addition, the emergy evaluation results can be used as a complement to traditional planning methods, to design and implement system-based, resource management measures to ensure a sustainable and healthy kelp fishery.

AB  - The System of Environmental-Economic Accounting - Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA EA) provides an integrated statistical framework which organizes spatially explicit data on environmental quality, natural capital and ecosystem services and links this information to economic activities such as agriculture. In this paper we assess how the SEEA EA can support the monitoring and evaluation of environmental objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). We focus on the Netherlands, for which an elaborate set of SEEA EA accounts has been published, and the themes of nitrogen pollution and farmland biodiversity. We studied the completeness of indicators included in the accounts, their quality and analysed how the accounts could support agri-environmental reporting, agri-environmental measures effectiveness assessments, and results-based payments to farmers. As a reference we used the Driving forces - Pressures - State - Impacts - Responses (DPSIR) framework. The Dutch SEEA EA accounts only include half of the indicators which we considered essential to assess the effects of farming on natural capital and ecosystem services for the two studied environmental themes. However, most gaps in the accounts could be filled with other publicly available environmental monitoring data. Regarding N pollution, the availability and reliability of indicators at landscape and farm scales are not sufficient to support the assessment of agri-environmental measures effectiveness and results-based payments to decrease N pollution. The accounts have a higher potential to support the assessment of measures to conserve farmland biodiversity, in particular due to high resolution maps of ecosystem extent and ecosystem services flows. The potential of the SEEA EA accounts may be more limited in other countries where ecosystem accounting has only recently started. However, the SEEA EA is also implemented at the European Union scale, so that SEEA EA indicators will gradually become available for all European countries. To enhance the relevance of the SEEA EA in the agrienvironmental policy area, we recommend to integrate information on farming emissions (externalities) recorded in the SEEA Central Framework with SEEA EA accounts and evaluate the applicability of SEEA EA accounts for case studies at landscape and farm scales. Our research shows that the Dutch SEEA EA accounts, complemented with other data sources, have potential to strongly enhance the CAP monitoring and evaluation framework but further steps need to be taken to fill data gaps.

AB  - Human activities in middle-income regions (MIRs) accelerate the appropriation of natural capital (NC) through production and living activities. The environmental changes caused by these activities in turn have an impact on human development and challenge the human adaptability of MIRs. Therefore, it is very important to realize the decoupling of NC and human development. This study takes China's Shaanxi Province as a case and establishes a research framework that decouples the human development index (HDI) from the perspective of NC stock and flow. Shaanxi is evaluated based on an analysis of the changing HDI and measuring changes in NC indicators from 2005 to 2018. The state of decoupling between the HDI and NC utilization levels is also discussed. The results show that the average annual growth of the HDI and per capita ecological footprint is 1.54% and 3.22%, respectively. The rate of consumption of the NC stock is greater than the rate of NC flow consumption. The HDI and the three-dimensional ecological footprint have not achieved real decoupling, and the changes in the two are the same as those in the left half of the inverted U-shaped environmental Kuznets curve. However, the inflection point has not been reached. This shows that the NC and HDI in Shaanxi have not achieved decoupling, and rapid NC changes hinder the ability to improve human well-being. This discovery helps MIRs focus on the role of restoration ecosystems in supporting regional human development and respond to the challenge of insufficient human adaptability due to excessive consumption of NC.

AB  - This study proposes water-carbon-ecological footprints to form footprint family indicators for identifying the ecological compensation and regional development equilibrium in the Triangle of Central China (TOCC). The occupation of natural capital stock and flow consumption can be illustrated using a three-dimensional ecological footprint model, and Gini coefficient is integrated into the evaluation framework for fairness measurement from various aspects. Quantificational ecological compensation standards can be given with considering indicators associated with ecological resource conversion efficiency and willingness to pay. Results reveal that ecological and carbon footprints in the TOCC demonstrate rising trends from 2000 to 2015, while its water footprint presents a fluctuating trend. The majority of average Gini coefficients exceed the threshold value of 0.4 under different footprints, thereby indicating poor overall fairness of regional development. Water footprint in Jingmen, Xiangtan, and Yichun show relatively higher compensation expenses, while Yichang, Zhuzhou, and Fuzhou exhibit higher received compensation values compared with other cities. Carbon footprint in Wuhan, Loudi, and Xinyu indicate high compensation expenses due to their overuse of biological resources. Maximum amounts of compensation expense appear in Nanchang and Wuhan from the perspective of ecological footprint. This study can provide a theoretical reference for sustainable development in the TOCC by performing a comparative analysis with Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration and developed countries.

AB  - Increased emphasis on the natural capital approach in the UK has led to greater demand for methods that link economic sectors with elements of natural capital, and that can provide evidence for sustainable management of the environment. However, factors describing the supply of benefits, and their links with economic sectors, are not well defined. This study develops a novel framework that investigates how the combination of different forms of capital (natural, financial, social, manufactured or human) provide a potential supply of benefits, and how changes in quality or extent of natural capital affects supply. Factors affecting the delivery of benefits are analysed, and indicators for each factor are selected. Indicators are ranked and weighted, and benefit supply is represented as a novel, composite index. The composite supply index is then linked as an input to a related economic sector. This framework is applied for the first time to four benefits from the marine environment in the UK: seafood, offshore wind energy, wildlife watching and water sports. The approach is compatible with national accounts, natural capital accounts, and established ecosystem service classifications. This study shows how linking economic sectors with benefits can provide new evidence in support of marine management.

AB  - The environmental footprint (EF) indicator has emerged as a tool to measure human demand for productive land and water and it is used for the evaluation of the impact of products or economic activities on the environment. There are many indicators that are used in the decision making for the investment in the power sector, however, predominant are the economic indicators which underestimate the depreciation of natural capital (environment) and the value added generated by the public services. Many research studies have been carried out in an attempt to demonstrate the versatility of the EF by extending its applicability not only to environmental assessment, but also to use it, among other economic indicators, when assessing sustainable investment. Sustainable investment (SI) combines fundamental analysis and engagement with an evaluation of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) factors. The purpose of this article is, upon evaluating the EF, to identify the opportunities for the EF reduction through sustainable investment in the electricity production sector in EU countries. Environmental footprint analysis has been performed by using sustainable process index program SPIonExcel (SPI), which is one of the methods in the EF family. SPI is a useful tool for assessing ecological problems and finding sustainable solutions in the life cycle of energy production process. This research has revealed that the function of the footprint reduction depends directly on investments in renewable energy source (RES) technologies, but not all investments can be sustainable. Countries mainly invest in the development of wind energy and solar PV technologies and gradually reduce their inland production capacities from fossil fuel. Although SI in RES technologies reduces the EF, this is not enough to reduce it substantially because there are limitations for installing new power capacities. Consequently, countries tend to invest in the development of electricity networks. The conclusion can be drawn as follows: the reduction of the EF of electricity could be achieved by developing RES technologies since the major part of electricity is produced by using non-renewable resources. It is essential to develop new technologies as soon as possible in order to reduce EF as much as possible, and this can only be achieved through systematic sustainable investment.

AB  - Drawing lessons from the System of Environmental and Economic Accounting Central Framework (SEEA-CF) and Experimental Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EEA), China is carrying out a pilot project for ecosystem accounting at the provincial level. Compiling and applying the principles, methods and ecosystem accounts of natural capital accounting in Northwest cities are new explorations. This study considers the degradation and fragility of the urban ecosystem in Xi'an and discusses urban natural resource (NR) accounting in terms of the physical quantity and monetary value. We took Xi'an as a case to demonstrate how to use the SEEA to analyze NR changes and the effectiveness of local eco-environmental management policies based on the characteristics of cities. The results show that, compared with using the physical quantity, calculating the monetary value according to NR restoration obligation, NR maintenance obligation better reflects the utilization level of urban NR, measures resource depletion and degradation, and maximizes the utility of the accounting results. This study focuses on using NR accounting methods for urban water resources, land resources and mineral resources, and evaluating ecosystem services for purposes of ecological restoration. It lays a foundation for consolidating urban gross ecosystem product accounting results in line with the SEEA and provides support for future study.

AB  - Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the most widely used measure of economic performance world-wide. Where longrun economic sustainability and human well-being are concerned, GDP can provide misleading policy advice. While the limitations of GDP are discussed conceptually in the literature, we provide a quantitative example demonstrating the implications of using only GDP to inform policy design. In the context of Colombia's post-conflict development, we show that continuing the recent trend of increasing deforestation reflects positively on GDP by about US$59 million by 2035. However, when we consider the natural capital assets and environmental quality that underpin economic growth summarized by the Genuine Savings indicator of wealth, reducing deforestation and enhancing agricultural productivity results in a more prosperous and sustainable post-conflict future for Colombia with a US $48 billion increase in wealth. Policy makers relying only on GDP as a guide to policy effectiveness risk undermining their country's development prospects and inter-generational well-being which is at the very core of sustainable development. While natural capital accounting sheds light on past economy-environment interactions, future looking integrated analytical frameworks such as that presented in this paper are required to evaluate policies on the basis of their potential impacts on sustainable economic development and wealth.

AB  - Economists and ecologists have worked for decades on measuring sustainability by supplementing or adjusting traditional economic indicators such as GDP. Given the threats to humanity from climate change, environmental degradation, and biodiversity loss, it is vital to incorporate values of natural capital into national economic decision-making. This review focuses on how natural capital applications, historically applied from local to global scales, address national-scale concerns. However, natural capital data and accounts have been only partially developed in most countries, given a lack of common metrics and monetary values. Existing accounts are often incomplete in both the types of natural capital and ecosystems they include (e.g., water, land, different ecosystem types) and the values they measure (e.g., market vs. nonmarket values). While it is important to continue work to embed natural capital into national economic accounts, the need for practical tools to analyze environmental problems is more urgent. We review alternative options for incorporating natural capital into national-scale decision-making and make recommendations for countries where the data, capacity, and political will to conduct formal natural capital accounting are lacking.

AB  - We present methods and results of country-based natural capital assessments for four ecosystem services (ES) in Italy. The spatial mapping and the assessment have been carried out in both physical and monetary terms for (i) crop pollination, (ii) outdoor recreation, (iii) flood regulation (iv) and water provision, using the ARIES (Artificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services) technology, which provides and integrates the necessary data and models. Extent, supply and use accounting tables have been developed for the same ecosystem services in line with the United Nations System of Environmental Economic Accounting (UN-SEEA) guidelines and Experimental Ecosystem Accounting (EEA) initiative. This work represents a first official and nationwide assessment of ecosystem services for the Italian Government in accomplishment of the Italian law n. 221/2015, applying a variety of different models and economic valuation methods to provide systematic and replicable information on natural capital through national accounting tables. We find that land management and maintenance of the countryside and forestland, which represent the typical Italian landscape, are fundamental. Our application also identifies several modelling challenges that need to be addressed before a methodological path for integrated ecosystem and economic accounting may be considered rigorous and reliable.

AB  - The System of Environmental-Economic Accounting for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (SEEA AFF) offers the possibility to assess and report detailed accounts for primary industries while establishing important linkages with relevant ecosystem services, in line with the SEEA Experimental Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA EEA). In this paper, crop products and crop provision as ecosystem service are coherently merged to build a sustainability scoreboard for selected crops in European countries. The sustainability scoreboard uses the SEEA AFF accounts for crop products with data inputs from FAOSTAT and the Integrated system of Natural Capital Accounts (INCA) of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) for ecosystem services. The combined FAO-JRC accounting table described in this paper provides a common ground and measurement tool towards a sustainability scoreboard, useful to analyse how relevant economic, social and environmental components behave by country. This newly derived sustainability scoreboard presents significant differences with respect to analyses based on standard agricultural statistics. Lack of sufficiently accurate data remains the major limitation to current fuller implementation of the sustainability scoreboard. However reasonable assumption can be made that ongoing international data collection processes (including FAO questionnaires) integrated with Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis will supply in the near future additional relevant and applicable information.

AB  - Since the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment was published, a plethora of ecosystem service frameworks have been developed to conceptualise the links between the natural environment and society. The intended geographic scales of application, the policy/practice context, and the scientific disciplines involved have driven variations in how the frameworks are constructed. However, the frameworks are homogenous in that they have been created predominately based on expert opinions and views of how ecosystem services are structured. Here, we use the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES) to examine the extent to which frameworks capture people's values for British woodlands. Our findings reveal several disparities between how experts and the public conceptualise ecosystem services. The considerable refinement and specificity provided by CICES does not align with public values (e.g. some provisioning, and regulation and maintenance, services), which tend to be more generalised. We also demonstrate differences in values explained by social characteristics (e.g. ethnicity) that need to be accounted for in decision-making processes. Moving forwards, we need to consider how society views the services derived from nature and reflect this in frameworks to ensure ecosystem service approaches are effective, transparent and widely supported.

AB  - The long-term management of natural capital is essential for the stable and resilient flow of ecosystem services for future generations facing climatic uncertainty. Understanding its resilience to extreme natural events, using biological principles, and integrating them into more holistic systems-wide modelling techniques is crucial to evaluate and design the wider economic impacts from alternative management interventions. Here we developed a probabilistic and system-wide bio-economic model to measure extreme economic impacts from natural events using the financial concept of Value at Risk. We have applied the new extreme economic impact metric to measure the economy-wide impact from the disruption of mountain-biking recreational services in the Whakarewarewa peri-urban forest in Rotorua, New Zealand from a potential windthrow event. We identified that extreme natural events, such as windthrows, could exert a substantial impact on the urban forest-dependent regional economy. This impact could potentially be intensified by the CO2 forest fertilization effects predicted under future climate scenarios and by adopting low-intensity silvicultural regimes currently rewarded by national climate change mitigation policies. Some of the insights from this study could be the precursors to develop robust adaptation strategies using robust decision-making techniques considering inclusive environmental-economic accounting frameworks.

AB  - We develop and link the Integrated Economic-Environmental Modeling (IEEM) Platform to ecosystem services modeling (ESM). The IEEM+ESM Platform is an innovative decision-making framework for exploring complex public policy goals and elucidating synergies and trade-offs between alternative policy portfolios. The IEEM+ESM approach is powerful in its ability to shed light on (i) change in land use and ecosystem services driven by public policy and the supply and demand responses of businesses and households; and (ii) impacts on standard economic indicators of concern to Ministries of Finance such as gross domestic product and employment, as well as changes in wealth and ecosystem services. The IEEM+ESM approach is being adopted rapidly and by the end of 2020, IEEM+ESM Platforms will be implemented for about 25 countries. To demonstrate the in sights generated by the IEEM+ESM approach, we apply it to the analysis of alternative green growth strategies in Rwanda, a country that has made strong progress in reducing poverty and enhancing economic growth in the last 15 years. The case of Rwanda is particularly compelling as it faces intense pressure on its natural capital base and ecosystem services, already with the highest population density in Africa, which is projected to double by 2050. In applying IEEM+ESM and comparing the outcomes of Rwanda's green growth policies, increasing fertilization of agricultural crops shows the largest economic gains but also trade-offs in environmental quality reflected through higher nutrient export and reduced water quality. Combining crop fertilization with forest plantations better balances critical ecosystem services and their role in underpinning economic development as Rwanda progresses toward its target of middle-income status by 2035. This application to Rwanda's green growth strategy demonstrates the value-added of the IEEM+ESM approach in generating results that speak to both economic outcomes and impacts on market and non-market ecosystem services.

AB  - Businesses are increasingly called upon to contribute to efforts to protect biodiversity and natural capital. Our article presents the results of an action research conducted with a major company in the environmental sector that has been experimenting with innovative services dedicated to ecosystem management. We show the specific organizational and social challenges the company faced in upscaling this strategy due to its path dependency to its historical value creation model, and to the collective action issues that characterize biodiversity management. We introduce a new interdisciplinary theoretical framework for the development of what we refer to as "business models for ecosystem management services," defined by the very central place they give to the achievement of measurable biodiversity performances. We then propose four such new business models designed through participatory methods that combine in a unique way a corporate value creation model with an ecological value cocreation model at the ecosystem level.

AB  - Emergy analysis is an environmental accounting method used to comprehensively measure the sustainability of human and natural systems. This procedure is able to evaluate system's relationship with its surroundings by considering all contributions from similar units. According to these objectives, Emergy analysis shape as a procedure able to provide integrated information about natural and human-driven resources supporting ecological functions and economic activities. In particular, Environmental Accounting Emergy-based provides a measure of Natural Capital (biophysical value of stocked biomass) in terms of natural resources consumption required to support generation of goods and fruition of services. The purpose of this work is to illustrate the procedural and methodological approaches, with field-testing of materials and methods, necessary to carry out an environmental accounting analysis in a Marine Protected Area (MPA). The investigation has been performed in a Mediterranean coastal MPA ("Isole Ciclopi", SE Sicily, Italy) in order to provide a scenery of performance, impact and environmental sustainability of the activities carried on the MPA in relation to the renewable natural resources present. We show the extent to which a cost-benefit approach can assess the productivity of investing in environmental management and conservation. This integrated methodology may in fact help scientists, policy-makers and local managers to implement ecosystem administration according to the principles of sustainable development.

AB  - Coastal and marine natural capital stocks provide a bundle of ecosystem services vital to humans. The delivery of these benefits depends on the protection and sustainable management of natural capital through effective nature conservation strategies. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are recognized worldwide as important tools to protect biodiversity while ensuring the delivery of ecosystem services and promoting sustainable human activities. Following the results of a national project aimed at assessing the value of natural capital in the Italian MPAs, in this study we assessed the value of marine natural capital stocks in the Gulf of Naples and Campania Region (Southern Italy) based on a biophysical and trophodynamic accounting model. The assessment focused on four macro-habitats: sciaphilic hard bottom (SHB), photophilic hard bottom (PHB), soft bottom (SB), and Posidonia oceanica seagrass bed (PSB). The total biophysical value of natural capital stocks related to the total area of the Gulf of Naples and Campania Region was 5.70.10(20) sej and 3.10.10(21) sej, while the total economic value was 795.92 and 4323.16 Me Although the SHB habitat only represents about 4% and 1% of the total marine area of the Gulf of Naples and Campania Region, it contributes by 28% and 7% to the total value of natural capital. These figures reflect the high convergence of natural input flows into the marine ecosystem for the generation of the SHB habitat, highlighting the importance of proper measures and actions for its protection. In addition, the calculated values of natural capital stocks were combined with the bionomic map of the Gulf of Naples and Campania Region to show the spatial distribution of natural capital value. The outcomes of this study can support local managers and policy makers in charge for implementing nature conservation strategies aimed at ensuring the sustainable use of marine resources.

AB  - The emergence of politically driven bioeconomy strategies worldwide calls for considering the ecological issues associated with bio-based products. Traditionally, life cycle analysis (LCA) approaches are key tools used to assess impacts through product life cycles, but they present limitations regarding the accounting of multiple ecosystem service-related issues, at both the land-use and supply chain levels. Based on a systematic review of empirical articles, this study provides insights on using LCA assessments to account for ecosystem service-related impacts in the context of bioeconomy activities. We address the following research questions: what is the state of the art of the literature performing LCA assessments of forest-based bioeconomy activities, including the temporal distribution, the geographic areas and products/processes at study, and the approaches and methods used? 2. Which impacts and related midpoints are considered by the reviewed studies and what types of ecosystem service- related information do they bear? Out of over 600 articles found through the Scopus search, 155 were deemed relevant for the review. The literature focuses on North-America and Europe. Most of the articles assessed the environmental impact of lower-value biomass uses. Climate change was assessed in over 90% of the studies, while issues related to ozone, eutrophication, human toxicity, resource depletion, acidification, and environmental toxicity were assessed in 40% to 60% of the studies. While the impact categories accounted for in the reviewed LCA studies bear information relevant to certain provisioning and regulating services, several ecosystem services (especially cultural ones) remain unaccounted for. The implications of our study are relevant for professionals working in the ecosystem services, circular bioeconomy, and/or LCA communities. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The EU 2020 Biodiversity Strategy requests EU Member States to map and assess ecosystem services within national territories, and to promote and integrate these values into policy-making. This calls for standardized and harmonized data, indicators, and methods to assess ecosystem services within national boundaries. Current approaches for assessing ecosystem services often oversimplify cross-scale heterogeneity, sacrificing the spatial and thematic detail required to support the needs and expectations of decision-makers at different levels. Hence, nationally harmonized models for mapping and quantifying ecosystem services are needed. This paper presents the Natural Capital Model (NC-Model), a spatially-explicit set of models for quantifying and mapping ecosystem services within the Netherlands. Its aim is to support the integration of ecosystem services within spatial planning and policy-making at the national level, contributing to the fulfilment of national and international environmental policy targets. Models introduce previously unexplored combinations of explanatory variables for modelling ecosystem functions and the socioeconomic benefits they accrue, making use of publicly-available and high-resolution spatial data. To capture spatial and thematic heterogeneity across the urban-rural gradient, the NC-Model comprises a subset of ecosystem service models tailored to the urban environment. To demonstrate the model's application, we expand on six urban ecosystem service models and implement them to quantify and map ecosystem services for Municipality of Amsterdam. High-resolution ecosystem supply and use maps provide detailed spatial information useful for supporting spatial planners and decision-makers who wish to optimize the allocation of natural elements while supporting the needs of citizens. They paint a picture on the interlinkages that exist between natural elements, ecological functions, and socioeconomic well-being in a friendly manner, tailored to various audiences with differing priorities. Their open-access nature enables their customization, supporting the sharing of knowledge and data to endorse ecosystem service modelling efforts by external parties within and outside the Netherlands.

AB  - In either case of ecological and biocapacity surplus or deficit, the precautionary effort toward optimizing the natural capital posits a potential framework for environmental sustainability. In studying the environmental account of fertility, marriage, and technological advancement in the USA and Canada, the autoregressive distributed lad-bound testing is employed over the experimental period 1990-2014. Importantly, the study revealed that the interaction of fertility and marriage exerts a significant and negative impact of biocapacity in both the USA and Canada and in short run and long run. Moreover, while the impact of energy use in both countries is significant and positive in both the short and long run, the magnitude of the impact is almost negligible. Similarly, an improvement in technological advancement in the countries is empirically observed to cause a decline in the biocapacity in both the long and short term. These posit that both energy use and technological advancement in Canada and the USA do not necessarily improve the productive capacity of the countries ecosystems. In general, the study provides policy frameworks for stakeholders toward addressing the environmental peculiarity of the USA (a biocapacity debtor) and Canada (a biocapacity creditor).

AB  - The integration of ecosystem services and accounting systems can help different stakeholders understand the economic implications of environmental impacts. Any such integration requires clear understanding of how ecosystem services may match and integrate with traditional accounts. The Experimental Ecosystem Accounts (EEA) of the System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounts (SEEA) is developing quickly with applications at different administrative levels. One emerging feature is lack of agreement on conceptual notions and definitions that could reconcile different approaches. Some basic issues can be developed and solved only once a theoretical basis has been established. Since the first step of any application is to identify which ecosystem services to account for, this paper explores whether and to what extent the theoretical frameworks behind ecosystem services classification systems match the theoretical framework behind the SEEA EEA. This attempt first tackles the conceptual framework on the accounting side, then the conceptual framework on the ecosystem services classification side. Combining the two sides, it is possible to visualize matches or mismatches and to infer a few consequences and implications. Ecosystem services classification systems can guide separation of infra-ecosystem processes from final ecosystem services, and help disentangle ecosystem services from benefits, key requirements for integrating accounts.

AB  - In this study, an operational tool for environmental accounting is proposed to assess natural capital value and to obtain a budget encompassing ecosystem services, putting into practice the notion of "ecosystem services cascade". The accounting system is based on a previous framework (EAMPA project) developed for MPAs. The tool implements some additional features bringing significant improvement of the framework in order to achieve sustainability. At this purpose two parallel accounts, ecological and economic, are developed and then compared aiming at achieving a net benefit from both domains. The economic approach considers, together to financial revenues and costs, all the direct and indirect benefits from MPA's ecosystem services fruition. The ecological approach is formulated so that results are obtained under a strong sustainability perspective and direct impacts on MPA natural capital, associated with ecosystem services fruition by MPA's customers, are taken into account and included into the budget.

AB  - Urban growth causes numerous threats to human well-being, as a consequence of the loss and degradation of urban and peri-urban green spaces. This research aims to investigate the possible role of green infrastructures (GIs), as providers of ecosystem services, in enhancing urban well-being in the 116 Italian provincial capital cities. The analysis has been based on the conceptual model proposed by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) (2005) to explain how the four categories of ecosystem services (supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural) and the components of human well-being are interrelated. In order to perform the assessment, the most suitable indicators of social capital and green infrastructures have been identified from the panel of indices and indicators provided by national official statistics. The corresponding analysis has highlighted that northern Italian cities are characterized by simple but well-managed green infrastructures and wooded areas, with the highest level of social cohesion and inclusion associated with a high value of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. The southern part of the country is characterized mainly by "Historical greens" and high levels of health and social security but low levels of income, social inclusion and cohesion. This research represents a first attempt to link the different typologies of green infrastructures with the provision of ecosystem services. Given the recognized contribution of GIs in preserving natural habitats in an urban context, the SLOSS (single large or several small) debate, typically applied for conservation purposes, could also be appropriate for GIs. Therefore, it could be necessary to investigate whether fewer large nature preserves (large urban parks), or a patchwork of smaller green areas can better enhance human well-being in an urban context.

AB  - Natural capital is a limited and irreplaceable factor for human welfare and sustainability. Natural capital includes natural capital flow and natural capital stock. When natural capital flow cannot meet the needs of regional development, it begins to consume natural capital stock. Therefore, the assessment of the current utilization status of natural capital flows and stocks is not only the basis for regional ecological construction evaluation but also an important indicator of the effectiveness of regional sustainable development strategies. This study uses the three-dimensional ecological footprint model to systematically and comprehensively evaluate the utilization status of natural capital flows and stocks in Hainan Province from 2005 to 2016. The driving factors behind changes in the natural capital stock are revealed using a partial least squares method. Our results indicate the following. (1) The per capita ecological footprint of Hainan Province is increasing at an annual rate of 3.87%, and the per capita ecological deficit is increasing at an annual rate of 5.85%. The ecological footprints are mainly composed of cropland and forest land and the account composition is dominated by the biological and energy accounts; (2) The growth of water body natural capital flow promotes the total natural capital flow consumption of Hainan Province from 2005 to 2016 with an annual average of 0.41%. The natural capital flow consumption is mainly in the north, northeast and southwestern cities and counties, and the growth rate of natural capital flow consumption is greatest in the central mountainous region; (3) The consumption of total natural capital stock is growing at an average annual rate of 4.49%, from a value of 2.97 times the sustainable resource consumption of Hainan Province in 2005, increasing to a factor of 4.81 times in 2016. The natural capital stock consumption is mainly in the north and northeast in terms of quantity and growth rate; (4) The secondary industries, the year-end resident population, the total energy consumption and the total investment in fixed assets are the natural capital stock consumption of Hainan Province. These findings can provide a scientific reference for the formulation of Hainan's economic development and environmental protection policies to promote the coordinated and sustainable development of social, economic and environmental aspects of Hainan Province.

AB  - Natural capital assets are currently under pressure globally. This pressure may result in changes in the function of ecological systems and associated ecosystem services, resulting in changes in the benefits derived by people. The loss of natural capital also translates into economic and business risk. While advances have been made to understand and classify ecosystem services, the linkages between such services and the natural capital assets that combine to enable service provision are less well established. An agreed classification of natural capital assets is required to standardise their identification, description and measurement, and support action to reduce and mitigate the pressures they are under. Here, we evaluate the main systems classifying the environment into natural capital assets, against a number of requirements for decision making, showing that to date, we lack a unified classification encompassing all aspects of the natural environment. We have thus amended and consolidated existing classifications and propose a new hierarchical classification, which allows standardisation of use within public and private sector natural capital assessments. Promoting a common understanding is key in measuring and monitoring the value of assets and will enable more consistent and holistic decision making in relation to the management of natural capital.

AB  - The natural environment is now commonly viewed as a form of capital asset, or natural capital. Also included are ecosystems that provide important goods and services to the economy. Managing natural capital has consequences for sustainable development. However, there are contrasting weak versus strong sustainability views, which in turn have implications for green' accounting. Natural resource-based sovereign wealth funds have emerged as key financial instruments for compensating resource depreciation with greater economy-wide investments. Recent scientific evidence recommends demarcating safe operating spaces' to limit exploitation of critical global biophysical subsystems or processes. These challenges suggest that the concept of natural capital is pivotal to sound policy.

AB  - This paper develops and operationalizes the integrated economic-environmental modelling (IEEM) platform which integrates environmental data organized under the first international system of environmental economic accounting with a powerful dynamic economy-wide modelling approach. IEEM enables the ex-ante economic analysis of policies on the economy and the environment in a quantitative, comprehensive and consistent framework. IEEM elucidates the two-way interrelationships between the economy and environment, considering how economic activities depend on the environment as a source of inputs and as a sink for their outputs. In addition to standard economic impact indicators such as gross domestic product, income and employment, IEEM generates indicators that describe policy impacts on the use of environmental resources, wealth and environmental quality which together determine prospects for future economic growth and well-being. To illustrate the analytical capabilities of IEEM, the model is calibrated with Guatemala's SEEA and applied to analysis of its forest and fuelwood sector where negative health and environmental impacts arise from inefficient fuelwood use.

AB  - The restructuring of the economy of countries of the Eastern Partnership with the EU requires new ways of implementation, which are based on the principles of ecologization, with due consideration of integrated indicators of strategic environmental assessment and balanced resource-efficient, environmentally-friendly production. Subject-matter: theoretical and practical principles of "green transformations" as a modern direction of the world economy, based on the harmonious use of innovative technologies and the natural environment. Purpose. The main purpose of the publication is to assess how the "green" growth strategy is implemented in the development of the agrarian sector, the demonstration of the importance and efficiency of green growth indicators and their practical application. The realization of the purpose led to solving the research tasks: to substantiate the necessity of forming a change in the agrarian paradigm in the countries of Eastern Europe, to analyse trends of the introduction of green growth, to prove the importance of the efficiency of using the green growth indicators. Methodology. The basis of the research methodology is the dialectical method, which involves the connection theory and practice, the principles of knowledge of the real world, the determinancy of phenomena and interaction processes of external and internal. In order to achieve the purpose and solve the tasks, the following methods were used: system-structural - in the study of the sustainable development of the agrarian sector; abstract-logical - when forming, generalizing, and analysing tendencies of adaptation of the Eastern Partnership countries to the Green Growth Concept; comparative - for comparing the factual data with the theoretical ones and characteristics of changes in time of indicators. As well as the methods of description and comparison were used to determine the vectors for the introduction of green growth in the countries of the Eastern Partnership. Results. New challenges for the world economy make it necessary to modernize the economy solely for ensuring sustainable development through green growth. According to the results of the analysis, the essence of "green" transformations of the agrarian sector was established, which proves the regularity of the inclusion of the ecological factor in the system of basic socio-economic indicators of the development of Eastern European countries. At the same time, on the basis of the generalization of the theoretical provisions, it was found that green growth stimulates competitive, innovative, investment activities, which can lead to new sources of economic growth. For the qualitative expression of the indicators of green growth, the dynamics of GDP of the countries of the Eastern Partnership with the EU and indicators of rational use of natural resources were analysed and summarized. Conclusions. Given the above, the necessity to use indicators of green growth in statistical information is proved, which allows reducing risks of economic growth; reducing the risk of conflicts caused by lack of resources; balancing the ecological imbalance of rural areas. The practical significance of the results obtained is the possibility of their use in the formation of statistical information, and the indicator of the efficiency of agricultural land use makes it possible to trace environmental and resource productivity, multi-factor productivity, dynamics of land use, life expectancy.
   The research results can be used as an analytical and informational basis for further scientific developments in the field of research on the impact of green transformations on the sustainable development of the agrarian sector.

AB  - Urbanization has brought about a substantial increase in population growth, and a considerable amount of park green space has been exposed to urban construction land, which has greatly affected the natural and social value of the urban natural capital. Although this problem is serious in developing countries such as China, few studies have been conducted on the basis of a comprehensive evaluation of urban natural areas. This study evaluates the ecological services value of urban wetland parks from two perspectives: 1) the urban economic development brought by urbanization has an obvious artificial influence on an urban park's economic value and 2) the wetland ecosystem plays an important role in regulating and improving the surrounding urban environment. A flexible evaluation step model and a series of quantitative evaluation methods was constructed and used in a case study of Aha Lake National Wetland Park in Guiyang, China, based on a comprehensive analysis of the social, economic, and ecological values of the park. The results show that the total ecosystem service value of Aha Lake National Wetland Park is 1.92x10(9) yuan. This article has two main purposes: 1) serving as an innovative quantitative evaluation method of key indicators and 2) establishing a framework of ecosystem services value evaluation for urban parks based on the cascade model.

AB  - Land degradation neutrality (LDN) was introduced to provide a policy framework to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15. Land use policy and management changes can alter the status of land-based natural capital, and exert an influence on ecosystem functioning and interactions with a socio-ecological system. Over the last 30 years, continued efforts to maintain the socioeconomic sustainability of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) led to the implementation of a unique ownership policy of individual households that were contracted to use defined grassland properties rather than collective nomadic practices. Two distinct types of privately-owned grassland properties now exist: individual private property (IPP) and jointly managed private property (JPP).
   The influence of IPP (vs. JPP) on grassland degradation has been the subject of a limited number of studies that are reviewed in this paper to help estimate some baseline indicator values for LDN on the QTP. Grasslands under IPP were more degraded according to soil and vegetation measurements, which were indicative of excessive vegetation removal and trampling due to grazing pressure. This pressure occurred because livestock mobility was limited by the imposed restrictions of fencing. A review of the associated socioeconomic status of this practice suggests that the disruption of social networks by the imposition of property lines between individual households acted to limit cultural transmission and collective benefits, such as the sharing of labour, pasture and food. Moreover, IPP seemed to lack the necessary resilience that is required to support the communities and their livestock.
   Although studies in the QTP are relatively scarce, research suggests that the notion that grassland contracts would address the region's social, economic and environmental problems should be revisited because there is a significant difference in LDN indicator values for IPP and JPP, and evidence of significant degradation in the decades before the 2015 baseline when the UNCCD adopted LDN and SDGs. Evidence suggests that JPP is a more resilient system, capturing the environmental benefits of nomadism and the socioeconomic benefits of land contracts. Given that some of the grasslands are already contracted to individual households, creative JPP property arrangements should be respected. A reconsideration of whether the not-yet-contracted grasslands should be contracted individually rather than jointly, is required if LDN is to be achieved on the QTP by 2030. If the current policy is maintained, research evidence suggests that JPP should be encouraged, and policy makers should seek better ways of ensuring long-term sustainability and that LDN is achieved to maintain the natural capital and associated ecosystem services of the QTP.

AB  - Environmental assessments of urban systems intend to help city managers to identify feasible measures towards the reduction of urban vulnerability and to the understanding on how cities are dependent on available resources. Through the emergy approach, city managers may recognize subcomponents from each building block that individually and collectively influence the municipalities' environmental performance. Internal stocks of the urban systems play an important role on cities functioning, and the interactions among economic, social and natural capital influence the municipal performance. This paper uses emergy synthesis to account for the internal stocks of the multi-urban system called ABC Paulista, the role of stocks in ABC development and growth. Three forms of capital (economic, social and environmental) were accounted for, which allowed describing the urban settlements according to their nature (such as service provider or industrial cluster). Results may assist policy makers in regard to urban aggregates sustainability and also in formulating policies for particular cities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Poorer communities tend to be located within lower quality natural environments, experiencing greater environmental burdens and fewer environmental amenities. To date, analysis of environmental inequalities has focussed on pollution, with less attention given to natural environment benefits that support human wellbeing. Here, the ecosystem service concept which identifies these benefits, and the natural capital (NC) which provides them, is applied within environmental inequality assessment. For England, 325 local authority districts were classified based on 14 indicators of NC, and the level of deprivation of districts within each class compared. Districts with extensive woodland or agriculture are the least deprived. The most deprived districts tend to be urban areas with lower extent and quality of NC, coastal districts, and rural uplands with extensive coverage of various higher quality NC. These findings demonstrate that the distribution of NC varies by social deprivation, with implications for social inequities and sustainable management of NC. However, whilst higher deprivation is often associated with a lower extent and quality of NC, this pattern is not consistent for all NC types or places. Given the lack of a consistent pattern of inequality nationally, this implies that equitable management of ecosystems should be driven at a local level. To achieve this, the relationship between environmental benefits and deprivation should be assessed at this level and analysis should move beyond NC to address the ecosystem services that flow from it.

AB  - In this paper, we examine how progress on ecosystem service indicators could contribute to ecosystem accounting within the scope of environmental-economic accounting in Finland. We propose an integration framework and examine the integration of ecosystem service indicators into environmental-economic accounting with two case studies relevant for Finland: (1) water-related ecosystem services and (2) the ecosystem services of fish provisioning in marine ecosystems. In light of these case studies, we evaluate the relevance of existing Finnish ecosystem service indicators, the data availability for ecosystem accounting in Finland, and the applicability of the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting o Experimental Ecosystem Accounting (SEEA-EEA) framework to integrate Finnish ecosystem service indicators and other relevant data into environmental-economic accounts. The results indicate that the present ecosystem service indicators can assist in creating a basis for ecosystem accounting, but the indicators require further elaboration to be more compatible with the existing environmental-economic accounting system.

AB  - The scientific research on ecosystem services (ES) has grown substantially over the past ten years, making more evident the vital role played by natural ecosystems in support of human economy and well-being. Several studies showed that biodiversity represents a fundamental part of the Earth's life support system. Biodiversity considerably affects ecosystem functioning while contributing to the provision of different types of ES. The increasing ecological awareness of scientists, citizens, and policy makers on the importance of natural capital stocks and ES flows boosted nature conservation strategies and the development of more environmentally friendly production processes. In this study, we explored the global scientific literature on ES over the last thirty years. The software VOSviewer was used to create maps based on network data of scientific publications displaying relationships among scientific journals, researchers, and countries. Specific keywords were finally used to explore the co-occurrence of different terms connected to the research on ES. Results show that the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment had a major impact on the scientific literature dealing with the ES concept. The top country researching on ES was USA, while the top journal was Ecological Economics. In terms of co-occurrence, the top keywords were "biodiversity", "management", "conservation", and "climate change". This study identified the main research areas characterizing the scientific literature on ES. Social network analysis and maps based on network data make possible the application of systems thinking in bibliometric science. This type of analysis allows for the investigation of research development in specific fields of science, capturing the interdisciplinarity of research topics crossing the boundary of specific disciplines, as it is the case of ES.

AB  - This paper develops a framework for improved mainstreaming of ecosystem science in policy and decision making within a spatial planning context. Ecosystem science is advanced as a collective umbrella to capture a body of work and approaches rooted in social-ecological systems thinking, spawning a distinctive ecosystem terminology: ecosystem approach, ecosystem services, ecosystem "services framework and natural capital. The interface between spatial planning and ecosystem science is explored as a theoretical opportunity space to improve mainstreaming processes adapting Rogers' (2003) diffusion model. We introduce the twin concepts of hooks (linking ecosystem science to a key policy or legislative term, duty or priority that relate to a particular user group) and 'bridges' (linking ecosystem science to a term, concept or policy priority that is used and readily understood across multiple groups and publics) as translational mechanisms in transdisciplinary mainstreaming settings. We argue that ecosystem science can be embedded into the existing work priorities and vocabularies of spatial planning practice using these hooks and bridges. The resultant framework for mainstreaming is then tested, drawing on research funded as part of the UK National Ecosystem Assessment Follow-On programme (2012-2014), within 4 case studies; each reflecting different capacities, capabilities, opportunities and barriers. The results reveal the importance of leadership, political buy in, willingness to experiment outside established comfort zones and social learning as core drivers supporting mainstreaming processes. Whilst there are still significant challenges in mainstreaming in spatial planning settings, the identification and use of hooks and bridges collectively, enables traction to be gained for further advances; moving beyond the status quo to generate additionality and potential behaviour change within different modes of mainstreaming practice. This pragmatic approach has global application to help improve the way nature is respected and taken account of in planning systems nationally and globally.

AB  - Several international initiatives, including the European Biodiversity Strategy to 2020, promote the identification and mapping of ecosystems as basic tools for the conservation of biodiversity and related services. On coarse scales, the spatial representation of ecosystems is usually based on broad land cover categories that largely overlook important ecological and biogeographic features of the biotic communities they are meant to exemplify. This paper presents a nationwide ecosystem mapping approach that promotes a degree of thematic detail, which is more suited than that found in the continental maps to meeting biodiversity conservation targets in Italy. The approach is based on the rationale that current and potential vegetation cover are valuable proxies for outlining ecosystems. The resulting Ecosystem Map of Italy includes 43 types of forest ecosystems instead of the 5 woodland, forest and other wooded land types recognized at the European level. We outline the expected advantages of this enhanced thematic detail for a number of conservation purposes and highlight how the resulting maps may help to meet biodiversity conservation targets at the national level. In particular, we refer to the assessment of conservation status, the definition of restoration priorities, the planning of green infrastructure and the identification of collapse risks for the ecosystems identified. Comprehensively, the defmition, characterization and assessment of ecosystem types represent the carrying structure of the recently launched national system of natural capital accounting.

AB  - Marine ecosystems are exposed to significant anthropogenic pressure mainly due to the exploitation of biotic and abiotic marine resources. Marine protected areas (MPAs) are important tools to achieve local and global marine conservation targets. Marine ecosystems generate goods and services vital for human well-being. Their value can be explored not only from an economic viewpoint based on market and human preferences, but also using a biophysical perspective based on the accounting of environmental costs sustained for the generation of natural capital stocks and ecosystem services flows.
   In this study, the value of natural capital in the MPA "the Islands of Ventotene and S. Stefano" (Central Italy) was assessed applying a biophysical and trophodynamic environmental accounting model based on emergy accounting. The value of natural capital was estimated for the main habitats of the investigated MPA in terms of the work done by the biosphere for its generation and maintenance. Both the autotrophic and heterotrophic natural capital of the MPA was evaluated. The highest value of emergy density of 4.26.10(11) sej m(-2) was shown by the habitat "Posidonia oceanica seagrass bed" when investigating the autotrophic natural capital. The sciaphilic hard bottom habitat (coralligenous) showed the highest value of emergy density of 2.76.10(12) sej m(-2) when investigating the heterotrophic natural capital. The high emergy cost of coralligenous confirmed the importance of this habitat that represents one of the most important hot spot of species diversity in the Mediterranean Sea. The total emergy value of natural capital of the MPA was converted to monetary units by using the emergy-to-money ratio for Italy, resulting in 8.26 M(sic) Finally, a GIS tool was used to show the spatial distribution of natural capital values in relation to different habitats. The outcomes of this study highlighted the usefulness of the applied biophysical and trophodynamic environmental accounting model to explore the ecological value of natural capital in marine ecosystems while supporting local managers and policy makers for the sustainable development of MPAs.

AB  - Traditional means of assessing representativeness of conservation value in protected areas depend on measures of structural biodiversity. The effectiveness of priority conservation areas at representing critical natural capital (CNC) (i.e., an essential and renewable subset of natural capital) remains largely unknown. We analyzed the representativeness of CNC-conservation priority areas in national nature reserves (i.e., nature reserves under jurisdiction of the central government with large spatial distribution across the provinces) in China with a new biophysical-based composite indicator approach. With this approach, we integrated the net primary production of vegetation, topography, soil, and climate variables to map and rank terrestrial ecosystems capacities to generate CNC. National nature reserves accounted for 6.7% of CNC-conservation priority areas across China. Considerable gaps (35.2%) existed between overall (or potential) CNC representativeness nationally and CNC representation in national reserves, and there was significant spatial heterogeneity of representativeness in CNC-conservation priority areas at the regional and provincial levels. For example, the best and worst representations were, respectively, 13.0% and 1.6% regionally and 28.9% and 0.0% provincially. Policy in China is transitioning toward the goal of an ecologically sustainable civilization. We identified CNC-conservation priority areas and conservation gaps and thus contribute to the policy goals of optimization of the national nature reserve network and the demarcation of areas critical to improving the representativeness and conservation of highly functioning areas of natural capital. Moreover, our method for assessing representation of CNC can be easily adapted to other large-scale networks of conservation areas because few data are needed, and our model is relatively simple.

AB  - Despite the growing recognition that poverty and environmental degradation remain a threat to achieving sustainable development goals, poverty-environment relationship is rarely explored. Crucial is the changing geography of the Lake Bosomtwe basin of Ghana. In this paper we examine how intensive and extensive fishing and farming in the name of livelihood sustainability, poverty reduction and human wellbeing undermine ecological health within the lake basin by subjecting data collected from 250 respondents to factor analysis. From a geo-referenced and processed classification of remotely sensed and GIS images over three periods using the maximum likelihood classifier algorithm, the results showed that, built up areas within the lake basin increased from 543.64 ha in 1986 to 7682.97 ha in 2008. Dense forest and rangeland decreased from 8698.95 and 22,660.88 ha over the same period to 1416.33 and 8577.99 ha in 2008 respectively. Other indicators such as water levels and fish stock also saw drastic reduction. The results further showed that major changes in the ecological landscape of the basin over the years are the outcomes of both direct and indirect drivers such as slash and burn agriculture, unregulated development of tourism facilities, overfishing, use of illegal fishing gear, poverty, annual overturn, climate change, market and institutional failures. Hence, a paradigm shift from the traditional site level forest restoration efforts to a landscape level, and a "conservation first principle'' as a top priority in planning for the future, as well as focus on non-farm activities to reduce pressure on the natural capital are required.

AB  - Over the past decade, Ecological Footprint has become one of the most popular and widespread indicators for sustainability assessment and resource management. However, its popularity has been coupled, especially in recent years, by the emergence of critical views on the indicator's rationale, methodology and policy usefulness. Most of these criticisms commonly point to the inability of the Ecological Footprint to track the human-induced depletion of natural capital stocks as one of the main shortcomings of the methodology. Fully addressing this issue will require research efforts and, most likely, further methodological refinements. The aim of this paper is therefore to outline the basis of a new area of investigation in Ecological Footprint research, primarily aimed at implementing the distinction between the use of stocks and the use of flows in Ecological Footprint Accounting and debating its implications.

AB  - The notion of ecosystem service is meant to better link human societies to ecological systems and to serve has a tool for decision making. However, the notion has never been applied in a comprehensive and consistent way to anthropized ecosystems while most ecosystems are indeed anthropized. This means that in initiatives of ecosystem service assessment anthropized ecosystems are either neglected or their services assessed in a misleading way. For example, services from cultivated lands are usually valued through the value of the agricultural production, while this production highly depends on inputs (fertilizers, pesticides, non-renewable sources of energy) and human work that cannot be assimilated to ecological factors. Moreover, these practices have negative impacts such as the emission of greenhouse gases, nutrient leaching to other ecosystems or loss of soil fertility. Hence, we present here a general framework that could be used to assess the ecosystem services provided by anthropized ecosystems. This framework is based on the joint assessment of ecological services, disservices, losses of natural capital and impacts on other ecosystems. We show that this framework is required to assess different practices to manipulate an ecosystem, e.g. low- vs high-input agriculture, or different ecosystems with different levels of anthropization, e.g. manage forest vs. cropland. Indeed, ecosystems function in such a complex way that human manipulations and natural ecological processes are tightly intermingled so that services and disservices arising solely from ecological processes cannot be separated from the result of human manipulations.

AB  - Ecologically sustainable development (ESD) is the environmental component of sustainable development (SD). The main aim of this study is to explain the issues related to ESD from different points of view. Considering that environmental issues are essential to achieve SD goals, emphasizing the central role of ecological resources in SD is an important issue that makes it possible to suggest certain solutions that might help keep the global ecosystem sustainable for the desired SD.The role of natural capital in clarifying concepts and linking the economic system with the environment is significant.

KW  - SCIENCE
AB  - In natural capital accounting, ecosystems are assets that provide ecosystem services to people. Assets can be measured using both physical and monetary units. In the international System of Environmental-Economic Accounting, ecosystem assets are generally valued on the basis of the net present value of the expected flow of ecosystem services. In this paper we argue that several additional conceptualisations of ecosystem assets are needed to understand ecosystems as assets, in support of ecosystem assessments, ecosystem accounting and ecosystem management. In particular, we define ecosystems' capacity and capability to supply ecosystem services, as well as the potential supply of ecosystem services. Capacity relates to sustainable use levels of multiple ecosystem services, capability involves prioritising the use of one ecosystem service over a basket of services, and potential supply considers the ability of ecosystems to generate services regardless of demand for these services. We ground our definitions in the ecosystem services and accounting literature, and illustrate and compare the concepts of flow, capacity, capability, and potential supply with a range of conceptual and real-world examples drawn from case studies in Europe and North America. Our paper contributes to the development of measurement frameworks for natural capital to support environmental accounting and other assessment frameworks.

AB  - We chart the moral space of Earth measurement with the aim to develop practical tools to evaluate and improve Earth measurement frameworks (including environmental-economic accounting and ecosystem services). Based on a survey of environmental ethics, we develop four concepts that are fundamentally important to fostering agreement in debates over Earth measurement frameworks among stakeholders with diverging belief systems. The four concepts can thus be used as criteria to evaluate the completeness and defensibility of existing measurement frameworks. The first two concepts, the consideration of broad human values and long time frames follow the landmark work by Bryan Norton. We further propose the adoption of the capital approach and precaution as the third and fourth concept, respectively. We conclude with suggestions for how current frameworks could be rendered more complete, defensible and internationally acceptable. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Environmental or ecological' footprints have been widely used in recent years as indicators of resource consumption and waste absorption presented in terms of biologically productive land area [in global hectares (gha)] required per capita with prevailing technology. In contrast, carbon footprints' are the amount of carbon (or carbon dioxide equivalent) emissions for such activities in units of mass or weight (like kilograms per functional unit), but can be translated into a component of the environmental footprint (on a gha basis). The carbon and environmental footprints associated with the world production of liquid biofuels have been computed for the period 2010-2050. Estimates of future global biofuel production were adopted from the 2011 International Energy Agency (IEA) technology roadmap' for transport biofuels. This suggests that, although first generation biofuels will dominate the market up to 2020, advanced or second generation biofuels might constitute some 75% of biofuel production by 2050. The overall environmental footprint was estimated to be 0.29 billion (bn) gha in 2010 and is likely to grow to around 2.57 bn gha by 2050. It was then disaggregated into various components: bioproductive land, built land, carbon emissions, embodied energy, materials and waste, transport, and water consumption. This component-based approach has enabled the examination of the Manufactured and Natural Capital elements of the four capitals' model of sustainability quite broadly, along with specific issues (such as the linkages associated with the so-called energy-land-water nexus). Bioproductive land use was found to exhibit the largest footprint component (a 48% share in 2050), followed by the carbon footprint (23%), embodied energy (16%), and then the water footprint (9%). Footprint components related to built land, transport and waste arisings were all found to account for an insignificant proportion to the overall environmental footprint, together amounting to only about 2%

AB  - The green economy is an emergent approach to sustainable development launched at Rio+20. Herein environmental decision-making is increasingly achieved through economistic processes and logic. The natural commons are quantified and managed as natural capital. This paper summarizes the trajectory of the project and its ideological framework. It examines various conceptualizations of economic approaches to the environment and considers philosophical, methodological, and political problems associated with the green economy project. In the face of very different definitions of what constitutes a green economy, environmental communicators face a situation characterized by discursive confusion as the complexity of natural capital accounting processes conceal new political configurations. Counter movements argue that the green economy program is performing ideological work that uses language of environmentalism to obscure an intensified agenda of neoliberal governance and capital accumulation. The concept now has contradictory meanings. Environmental communicators have an important role to play in exposing the contested nature of the project and in helping to define the emerging green economy.

AB  - Ecological resilience is developing into a credible paradigm for policy development and environmental management for preserving natural capital in a rapidly changing world. However, resilience emerges from complex interactions, limiting the translation of theory into practice. Main limitations include the following: (i) difficulty in quantification and detection of changes in ecological resilience, (ii) a lack of empirical evidence to support preventative orproactive management and (iii) difficulties in managing processes operating across socio-ecological systems that vary in space and time. We highlight recent research with the potential to address these limitations including new and/or improved indicators of resilience and tools to assess scale as a driver of resilience.Synthesis and applications. Effective resilience-based management must be adaptive in nature. To support this, we propose an operational model using resilience-based iterative management actions operating across scales.

AB  - Understanding the spatial distribution of specific environmental variables and the interdependencies of these variables is crucial for managing the environment in a sustainable way. Here we discuss two methods of mapping - a Geographical Information System classification-based approach and a statistical model-based approach. If detailed, spatially comprehensive covariate datasets exist to complement the ecological-response data, then using a statistical model-based analysis provides the potential for greater understanding of underlying relationships, as well as the uncertainty in the spatial predictions. Further, the model-based approach facilitates scenario testing. Although similar methods are already adopted in species distribution modeling, the flexibility of the model framework used is rarely exploited to go beyond modeling occupancy or suitability for a single species, into modeling complex derived metrics such as community composition and indicators of natural capital. As an example, we assess the potential benefits of the statistical model-based approach to mapping natural capital through the use of two national survey datasets; The Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) Land Cover Map (LCM) and the British Geological Survey's (BGS) Parent Material Model (PMM), to predict national soil microbial community distributions based on data from a sample of > 1000 soils covering Great Britain. The results are mapped and compared against a more traditional, land classification-based approach. The comparison shows that, although the maps look broadly similar, the model-based approach provides better overall spatial prediction, and the contribution of individual model terms (along with their uncertainty) are far easier to understand and interpret, whilst also facilitating any scenario testing. We therefore both recommend the use of spatial statistical modelling techniques to map natural capital and anticipate that they will become more prominent over the forthcoming years.

AB  - Overgrazing is a common form of land degradation at the global scale with negative impact on ecosystem functioning, natural capital stocks, socio-ecological systems and economic development. Although most of the regions in Mediterranean Europe are affected by soil degradation driven by unsustainable grazing, information on the spatial relationship among overgrazing, the economic structure and socio-spatial attributes of rural communities is limited. The present study explores the relationship between an index of grazing pressure and a set of indicators assessing six thematic domains (Population dynamics and human settlement, Labour market and human capital, Economic specialization and competitiveness, Quality of life, Agriculture and rural development Territory and environment) at the municipal scale in Italy. An exploratory data analysis based on non-parametric inference, multiple regression models, Principal Component Analysis and Hierarchical Clustering was developed with the aim to profile municipalities exposed to high or low degree of grazing pressure. An index of overgrazing-driven soil degradation risk which integrates grazing intensity and soil erosion risk was finally proposed. The analysis contributes to identify socioeconomic factors influencing soil degradation in areas with unsustainable grazing possibly leading to desertification risk. Results indicate that the socioeconomic profile of municipalities with high grazing pressure is characterized by specific socio-spatial and economic attributes, traditional cropping systems and a typical land-use structure. Our results may support the development of sustainable land management strategies in areas sensitive to land degradation in the Mediterranean region. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Globally, both biodiversity and the overall natural capital of the world are declining rapidly. Considering its implications to humanity, the Sixth Conference of the Parties (COP 6) of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in April 2002 committed themselves 'to achieve, by 2010, a significant reduction of the current rate of biodiversity loss at the global, regional and national levels as a contribution to poverty alleviation and to the benefit of all life on Earth' and a number of indicators and targets were set by the CBD. However, by 2010, the targets have been missed by vast majority of nations. Our analysis from the Hindu Kush-Himalayan (HKH) region revealed that the countries are at very different stages of progress towards meeting the 2010 targets. In term as of protected area coverage, which is considered as an integral element of the targets, the HKH regional member countries made significant progress by bringing 39 % of its terrestrial area under some form of protection. However, at the national level, they are at different stages of progress. In terms of conservation policies and practices, the HKH region has witnessed significant conceptual development in regional approaches to biodiversity conservation, from 'people exclusionary' and 'species focused' to 'people-centred community-based' and 'ecosystem/landscape approach'. However, there are still numerous challenges that prevail in the region. Anecdotal evidence of change is abundant, but in this vast region there is little, hard scientific information. Improved knowledge, information and environmental data is urgently needed so that appropriate action can be taken to combat and limit the impacts of future changes.

AB  - To examine management options for biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, eight research regions were Classified into social-ecological domains, using a dataset of indicators of livelihood resources, i.e., capital assets. Potential interventions for biodiversity-based agriculture were then compared among landscapes and domains. The approach combined literature review with expert judgment by researchers working in each landscape. Each landscape was described for land use, rural livelihoods and attitudes of social actors toward biodiversity and intensification of agriculture. Principal components analysis of 40 indicators of natural, human, social, financial and physical capital for the eight landscapes showed a loss of biodiversity associated with high-input agricultural intensification. High levels of natural capital (e.g. indicators of wildland biodiversity conservation and agrobiodiversity for human needs) were positively associated with indicators of human capital, including knowledge of the flora and fauna and knowledge sharing among farmers. Three social-ecological domains were identified across the eight landscapes (Tropical Agriculture-Forest Matrix, Tropical Degrading Agroecosystem, and Temperate High-Input Commodity Agriculture) using hierarchical clustering of the indicator values. Each domain shared a set of interventions for biodiversity-based agriculture and ecological intensification that could also increase food security in the impoverished landscapes. Implementation of interventions differed greatly among the landscapes, e.g. financial capital for new farming practices in the Intensive Agriculture domain vs. developing market value chains in the other domains. This exploratory study suggests that indicators of knowledge systems should receive greater emphasis in the monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and that inventories of assets at the landscape level can inform adaptive management of agrobiodiversity-based interventions.

AB  - The 'ecosystem service' debate has taken on many features of a classic Kuhnian paradigm. It challenges conventional wisdoms about conservation and the value of nature, and is driven as much by political agendas as scientific ones. In this paper we review some current and emerging issues arising in relation to the analysis and assessment of ecosystem services, and in particular emphasize the need for physical geographers to find new ways of characterizing the structure and dynamics of service providing units. If robust and relevant valuations are to be made of the contribution that natural capital makes to human well-being, then we need a deeper understanding of the way in which the drivers of change impact on the marginal outputs of ecosystem services. A better understanding of the trade-offs that need to be considered when dealing with multifunctional ecosystems is also required. Future developments must include methods for describing and tracking the stocks and flows that characterize natural capital. This will support valuation of the benefits estimation of the level of reinvestment that society must make in this natural capital base if it is to be sustained. We argue that if the ecosystem service concept is to be used seriously as a framework for policy and management then the biophysical sciences generally, and physical geography in particular, must go beyond the uncritical 'puzzle solving' that characterizes recent work. A geographical perspective can provide important new, critical insights into the place-based approaches to ecosystem assessment that are now emerging.

AB  - Whilst biophysical and economic values are often included in spatial planning for conservation and environmental management, social values are rarely considered. This study demonstrates a method for targeting the management of ecosystem services based on social values within the South Australian Murray-Darling Basin region, Australia. A total of 56 community representatives were interviewed and their values for ecosystem services were elicited and mapped. Spatial indicators of abundance, diversity, rarity, and risk were adapted from ecological science and applied to the mapped social values for ecosystem services. Those areas with the highest social value abundance, diversity, rarity, and risk scores were defined as priority areas for the management of ecosystem services. Four hotspots were located in overlapping areas of high priority for multiple spatial indicators. The ecosystem services contributing to high abundance, diversity, rarity, and risk were identified for management in these focal areas. Community suggestions for managing specific ecosystem services in focal areas were collated and synthesized. The results of this study enable the targeting of management of ecosystem service values in the landscape by identifying where high priority management areas are, specifying what services should be managed, and summarizing how they should be managed. This information can complement biophysical and economic information in systematic landscape planning studies. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The System for integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting (SEEA) has been criticized in this journal for ignoring the benefits of ecosystem services for human well-being. This paper argues that extended national accounts should not attempt measuring economic welfare. Rather, they could and should assess the environmental sustainability of economic activity as the cost of natural capital consumption. The global application of SEEA concepts and methods demonstrates the feasibility of international green accounting. For the world economy, sustainability costs run to about 3 trillion US$ or 6% of world GDP. Large variations at national and regional levels suggest that conventional economic indicators may significantly overstate economic progress in some parts of the world. Data gaps and lack of data comparability affect these first estimates. National and international statistical services should be more aggressive in greening the national accounts. More prudent and more sustainable economic policies might be the result. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Much effort is expended toward planning for conservation, natural resource management and sustainable land use in agricultural landscapes. Although often not explicitly stated, the aims of these efforts are often to restore natural capital for the provision of ecosystem services and stimulate multifunctionality in landscapes. However, the scarcity of resources for, and the potential economic impact of, ameliorative actions that restore natural capital necessitates the identification of cost-effective geographic priorities, or hotspots, which provide multiple ecosystem goods and services. This requires the integrated spatial modelling of multiple environmental and economic processes accompanied by clear goals and performance indicators. Identification of hotspots provides guidance for highly targeted land use change that cost-effectively adds to the stocks of natural capital in a landscape. Additionally, the multifunctionality of the landscape can be increased through the provision of multiple ecosystem goods and services. This paper begins by examining data requirements for identifying geographic hotspots for land use change. This study integrates traditionally disparate landscape-scale biophysical and economic data and models. The elements of natural capital considered here are species and ecosystems, soil and water resources, and the atmosphere. It is demonstrated that locating ameliorative actions towards hotspots will be more cost-effective at restoring natural capital and stimulating landscape multifunctionality than a random targeting approach. We calculate these efficiencies using a small set of indicators for assessing aspects of multifunctionality. The focus of this study is the agricultural landscapes of the Lower Murray region of south-eastern Australia. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We review the development of macroenvironmental indicators,an effort driven by a combination of improved understanding of the functioning of Earth's natural systems at large spatial and temporal scales and of increasing demands by an expanding human population for goods and services provided by ecosystems. To be credible, macroenvironmental indicators need to be based on established scientific concepts and supported by extensive data. To be adopted, they need to serve the interests of diverse stakeholders and be perceived as unbiased. The baselines against which they are evaluated must be clear. A modest number of macroindicators of abiotic natural capital, biotic natural capital, and ecological functioning are currently in use. Some of them are designed to report on trends in legislatively mandated goals and standards. Most environmental indicators, however, report on specific components of the environment at small scales. They are not readily aggregated to form synthetic macroenvironmental indicators.

AB  - Emergy Accounting and Synthesis, developed by Howard Odum in the 1980s, accounts for both the work of nature and that of humans as part of it in generating products and services. Since the 1990s, when Odum's system theories and emergy approach were introduced to China, a great attention was paid to them, since they appeared to Chinese scholars very important, comprehensive, and rich with application opportunities to China's economic development and environmental management. Until now more than 150 papers related to emergy theories were published in Chinese scientific journals, more than 20 dissertations presented in all Chinese Universities, and a large number of emergy-based papers were authored by Chinese scholars in international journals. Also, several reports dealing with emergy evaluation of different provinces of China were presented to local governments for decision-making. Emergy theories were applied to valuation of ecosystems and eco-industrial parks, as well as to studies of benefits/cost analysis and feasibility of ecological engineering. Meanwhile, a series of monographs and translated books related to emergy theories were published in China, some of which are used as text books in Chinese universities and institutes.
   Compared with the great potential of emergy application, there are many new fields that should be addressed in China, including: assessing the environmental impact of processes based on matching of high-quality and low-quality resources, establishing new frameworks and systems for environmental accounting, evaluating natural capital and services and applying research results to the process of decision-making, and finally studying the patterns and the available development options of China regional eco-economic systems.

AB  - The consequences of mass and energy conservation and the laws of thermodynamics for economic activity are analysed. As the objectives, for this content of the relations between thermodynamics and economics is critically investigated. First, the relations between mass and energy conservation and the Laws of Thermodynamics are discussed. Then the analysis of neoclassical economics attitudes to the Laws of Thermodynamics is given. After this the analysis of the concept of weak sustainability and the Laws of Thermodynamics are discussed. Methods of systematic scientific literature analysis, general and logical analysis, comparison and generalization were used as the methods of the research.
   The relation between Thermodynamics and Economics is a paramount issue in Ecological Economics. Basically, the Laws of Thermodynamics are relevant to the economy because economic activity is entropic. The integration between economics and thermodynamics at the substantive level is of crucial importance because economic processes obey thermodynamic laws and therefore a sound economic theory must be coherent with thermodynamics.
   When applying a systems perspective to resources and environmental issues, it is natural to start with thermodynamics. Many resources and environmental problems have their roots in fundamental aspect of conservation of matter. When we analyzing the environment-economy interaction and taking economy, there in each stage of the production process waste will arise. The amount of waste in any period is equal to the amount of natural resources used. The reason for this equivalence is the First Law of Thermodynamics.
   But some waste can be converted back to resources. Materials in goods can be recycled. But why not all waste is recycled? It is here that the Second Law of Thermodynamics become relevant. The materials that are used in economy tend to be used entropically and entropy places a physical obstacle, a 'boundary', in the way of redesigning economy as a closed and sustainable system.
   In recent years a new discipline Industrial Ecology, has emerged. This new discipline has been built, to a large extent, based on perceived analogies between economic and ecological systems. But the essential ecological difference between people and other species is that, in addition to our biological metabolism, people created enterprises with industrial metabolism. This stands as a crucial opposition to evolution of biosphere, which took many billions of years to evolve.
   Interpretations of strong and weak sustainability can also be justified by studying the possibilities of substituting supplies of nature's and economic capital or complementing each other. Strong sustainability requires both types of capital not to decrease for the benefit of one of significant indicators. The version of weak sustainability contains (making an unrealistic assumption about the perfect substitution of nature's and man-made capital) the sum of the forms of both capital - nature's and economic capital or any other aggregated unit of measurement, and requires it not to decline all the time.

AB  - This paper develops a thermodynamic input-output (TIO) model of the 1997 United States economy that accounts for the flow of cumulative exergy in the 488-sector benchmark economic input-output model in two different ways. Industrial cumulative exergy consumption (ICEC) captures the exergy of all natural resources consumed directly and indirectly by each economic sector, while ecological cumulative exergy consumption (ECEC) also accounts for the exergy consumed in ecological systems for producing each natural resource. Information about exergy consumed in nature is obtained from the thermodynamics of biogeochemical cycles. As used in this work, ECEC is analogous to the concept of emergy, but does not rely on any of its controversial claims. The TIO model can also account for emissions from each sector and their impact and the role of labor. The use of consistent exergetic units permits the combination of various streams to define aggregate metrics that may provide insight into aspects related to the impact of economic sectors on the environment. Accounting for the contribution of natural capital by ECEC has been claimed to permit better representation of the quality of ecosystem goods and services than ICEC. The results of this work are expected to permit evaluation of these claims. If validated, this work is expected to lay the foundation for thermodynamic life cycle assessment, particularly of emerging technologies and with limited information. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Economic valuation of natural and environmental assets is now a well established practice. Economic analysis provides several methods for discovering the impact on social welfare associated with changes in the ability of these assets to provide different goods and services. In general terms, these valuation exercises have been performed in the framework of Environmental Impact Assessment or, more generally, Cost Benefit Analysis. There is, however, an increasing demand nowadays to go beyond this framework and to value natural capital (natural resource stocks, land and ecosystems) as such. There are two main reasons for this new demand. On the one hand, sustainability requires that proper account should be taken of capital depreciation and, therefore, there is a need to value natural capital changes. This valuation process, nevertheless, only makes sense when some kind of substitution between natural and other forms of capital is allowed. On the other hand, there is also an increasing tendency to demand that the stock of natural capital present in a given territory be valued, either to discover one of the main components of social wealth or to help adequately plan changes in land use. Yet, whereas conventional valuation methods are probably adequate to fulfill the first task, this is less true in the case of the second, while even more difficulties arise in connection with the third one. Even if at first sight the process appears conceptually identical, these tasks are of a different order of magnitude, as the experience of both the World Bank and the Statistics Division of the United Nations in this respect clearly shows.

AB  - As economic and ecological support systems become more interdependent, new disciplines are needed to "bridge the gap" between human and nature. "Emergy" created by H.T. Odum is a new method for evaluating natural capital and ecosystem services. The "ecological footprint" created by Wackernagel and Rees has been promoted as a policy and planning tool for sustainability. The aim of this paper is to show a modified form of ecological footprint calculation by combining emergy analysis with conventional ecological footprint form of calculations. Our new method starts from the energy flows of a system in calculating ecological footprint and carrying capacity. Through a study of the energy flows, and using the method of emergy analysis, the energy flows of a system are translated into corresponding biological productive units. To demonstrate the mechanics of this new method, we compared our calculations with that of an original calculation of ecological footprint of a regional case. We select Gansu province in western China, as an example for application of our study. In this case the same conclusions were drawn using both methods: that Gansu province runs an ecological deficit.

AB  - Incorporation of ecological considerations in decision-making is essential for sustainable development, but is hindered by inadequate appreciation of the role of ecosystems, and lack of scientifically rigorous techniques for including their contribution. This paper develops a novel thermodynamic accounting framework for including the contribution of natural capital via thermodynamic input-output analysis. This framework is applied to the 1992 US economy comprising 91 industry sectors, resulting in delineation of the myriad ways in which sectors of the US economy rely on ecosystem products and services. The contribution of ecosystems is represented via the concept of ecological cumulative energy consumption (ECEC), which is related to emergy analysis but avoids any of its controversial assumptions and claims. The use of thermodynamics permits representation of all kinds of inputs and outputs in consistent units, facilitating the definition of aggregate metrics. Total ECEC requirement indicates the extent to which each economic sector relies directly and indirectly on ecological inputs. The ECEC/money ratio indicates the relative monetary versus ecological throughputs in each sector, and indicates the relationship between the thermodynamic work needed to produce a product or service and the corresponding economic activity. This ratio is found to decrease along economic supply chains, indicating industries that are higher up in the economic food chain price ecosystem contribution more than the basic infrastructure industries such as mining and manufacturing. The ratio of CEC with and without inclusion of ecosystems indicates the extent to which conventional thermoeconomic analysis underestimates the contribution of ecosystems. Such ratios, made available for the first time, provide unique insight into the importance of natural capital, and are especially useful in hybrid thermodynamic life cycle analysis of industrial systems. The approach, data compiled in this work, and the resulting insight provide a more ecologically conscious tool for environmental decision-making, and has potential applications at micro as well as macro scales.

AB  - The Brundtland Commission report, Our Common Future, defined sustainable development as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Although the idea of sustainable development has been widely accepted, it has proved difficult to identify and implement policies and practices that promote sustainable economic growth. Some economists, environmental scientists and policy analysts believe that they can transform the consensus about sustainability into manageable practices. They propose to accomplish this feat with a set of new ideas about the relationships between the economy and the environment offered under the banner of 'natural capital'. An ideal account of natural capital would be one or more standard measures or models that would allow the direct comparison of environmental goods, like forests, fresh water and clean air, with economic goods, like money, capital and productivity. By bringing economic science and environmental science to an objective common ground, a natural capital model has the potential to provide a concrete means of comparing the economic and ecological costs and benefits of particular policies and programmes. This paper offers a survey and analysis of several new contributions to the formation of the natural capital concept from economists, ecologists, policy analysts, biometricians, foresters and a philosopher. The paper concludes that existing microeconomic theory may be 'ungreenable', if it is not reformulated. While macroeconomic approaches to natural capital have been more successful, they share the limitation that ecosystems and species are valued solely in monetary terms. These problems are taken to suggest that the development of a successful natural capital model may require economic theory to be recast to include non-monetary social preferences and values.

AB  - This paper argues on both theoretical and empirical grounds that, beyond a certain point, there is an unavoidable conflict between economic development (generally taken to mean 'material economic growth') and environmental protection. Think for a moment of natural forests, grasslands, marine estuaries, salt marshes, and coral reefs; and of arable soils, aquifers, mineral deposits, petroleum, and coal. These are all forms of 'natural capital' that represent highly-ordered self-producing ecosystems or rich accumulations of energy/matter with high use potential (low entropy). Now contemplate despoiled landscapes, eroding farmlands, depleted fisheries, anthropogenic greenhouse gases, acid rain, poisonous mine tailings and toxic synthetic compounds. These all represent disordered systems or degraded forms of energy and matter with little use potential (high entropy). The main thing connecting these two states is human economic activity. Ecological economics interprets the environment-economy relationship in terms of the second law of thermodynamics. The second law sees economic activity as a dissipative process. From this perspective, the production of economic goods and services invariably requires the consumption of available energy and matter. To grow and develop, the economy necessarily 'feeds' on sources of high-quality energy/matter first produced by nature. This tends to disorder and homogenize the ecosphere, The ascendance of humankind has consistently been accompanied by an accelerating rate of ecological degradation, particularly biodiversity loss, the simplification of natural systems and pollution. In short, contemporary political rhetoric to the contrary, the prevailing growth-oriented global development paradigm is fundamentally incompatible with long-term ecological and social sustainability. Unsustainability is not a technical nor economic problem as usually conceived, but rather a state of systemic incompatibility between a economy that is a fully-contained, growing, dependent sub-system of a non-growing ecosphere. Potential solutions fly in the face of contemporary development trends and cultural values.

AB  - Critical natural capital (CNC) is commonly defined as that part of the natural environment, which performs important and irreplaceable functions. So far, the challenge to determine the criticality of natural capital (NC) has mainly been taken up by the natural sciences, and the critical functions of nature mainly associated with its life-support and ecological services. Little attention has been paid to the socio-cultural functions of NC and to their values for the health and well being of human societies. The aim of this paper is to encourage a more complete accounting of the critical functions of NC and its associated values, by highlighting the importance of the information functions (health, recreation, amenity, education, heritage, etc.) for the quality and sustainability of human life. It is argued that, despite their immaterial and often intangible nature, these functions provide many, socio-economic benefits, which might be assessed through both qualitative and quantitative valuation methodologies. Integration of ecology, sociology and economics is essential to operationalize the concept of CNC as a tool for more balanced environmental planning and decision making.

AB  - This paper identifies a line of reasoning based on a number of concepts and tools to facilitate river basin management, which have been applied in a case study. For long-term sustainable river basin management, a balance is needed between the human use of the river and its basin, the ecological functioning of the river and receiving waters, and the river's capacity to supply goods and services. To find such a balance a framework is needed that illustrates and clarifies possible trade-offs between economic use and environmental supply by integrating scientific information on cause-effect chains on a catchment scale. A number of concepts and tools are proposed as a basis for this framework. The tools are: (1) indicators that describe the complex interactions and processes in rivers; (2) a suite of linked models that predict the economic, environmental and ecological effect of management measures; (3) an evaluation framework to rank different management alternatives on the basis of three objectives: economic efficiency, spatial equity in costs and benefits and environmental quality of the river and receiving lakes. The concept of environmental quality defines the potential of the river environment (i.e. natural capital) to contribute to human welfare. The concept of environmental functions is used to identify societal interest in natural capital. The concept and tools have been applied in a case study involving the evaluation of four management strategies on nutrient abatement in the Rhine basin. The result of the case study is that economic efficiency is in conflict with spatial equity and environmental quality. Spatial equity is in agreement with environmental quality.

AB  - The meaning of sustainability is the subject of intense debate among environmental tal and resource economists. Perhaps no other issue separates more clearly the traditional economic view from the views of most natural scientists. The debate currently focuses on the substitutability between the economy and the environ ment or between "natural capital" and "manufactured capital"-a debate captured in terms of M elk versus strong sustainability. In this article, we examine the various interpretations of these concepts. We conclude that natural science and economic perspectives on sustainability are inconsistent. The market-based Hartwick-Solow "weak sustainability' approach is Far removed from both the ecosystem-based "Holling sustainabilily' and the "strong sustainability" approach of Daly and others. Each of these sustainability criteria implies a specific valuation approach, and thus an ethical position, to support monetary indicators of sustainability such as a green or sustainable Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The conflict between "weak sustainability" and "strong sustainability" is more evident in the context of centralized than decentralized decision making. In particular, Firms selling "services" instead of material goods and regarding the latter as "capital" leads to decisions more or less consistent with either type or sustainability. Finally, we discuss the implications of global sustainability for such open systems as regions and countries. Open systems have not been dealt with systematically for any of the sustainability criteria.

AB  - A new environmental paradigm has emerged, reflecting a change in the public's understanding of resource sustainability. Forest policy makers need to be better informed about such changes to achieve economic, social, and environmental objectives in a manner that balances human needs and aspirations with ecosystem constraints. As an aid to this task, a forest resource accounting system based on the key concept of natural capital could help reshape forest policies to provide an even wider spectrum of benefits for both present and future generations by maintaining and enhancing the productive capacity of forest capital. Such a resource accounting system would provide a tool for integrating multidimensional information requirements in measuring the health of both forest ecosystems and economic systems. This paper outlines some of the features of this accounting-system and proposes a framework that would integrate economic and ecological characteristics of natural resources. Forest resource accounting is urgently needed to achieve the sustainability goals of ecosystem management.

AB  - The diversity of fishes is declining worldwide, largely as the result of habitat alterations created by decisions that foster short-term economic gain. While the best arguments for preserving endangered fishes and ecosystems are non-economic arguments, they have been relatively ineffective. Therefore, it is necessary to provide economic arguments as well. Fish in general have high market values and are a vital source of protein for humans but these values have contributed more to their decline than to their conservation. Fish also have high value as indicators of the health of ecosystems which provide many services to humans, such as clean water. This has not prevented the degradation of aquatic ecosystems, although the value of fisheries has occasionally justified ecosystem protection. Existence values have been developed as a way of putting an economic value on some of the less tangible aspects of fish and ecosystems but they also make it possible to justify extinctions. If the continuous increase in the number of endangered fishes and aquatic ecosystems is to be halted, then the economic costs of environmental degradation to future generations must be included as part of the cost of doing business today (intergenerational value). Political action is needed to protect fishes and aquatic habitats against the day when more benign economic and philosophical systems become predominant.

AB  - The relationships between temporal patterns of macroinvertebrate community and water physicochemical parameters were investigated in the Xiangxi River, which is the largest tributary to the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in Hubei province, China. The construction of the TGR has strongly impacted the Xiangxi River watershed, but inter-annual patterns in stream macroinvertebrate communities have not been examined. We sampled water and macroinvertebrates monthly from 2004 to 2006. We assessed the persistence (similarity between years of species assemblage) and stability (similarity between years with respect to relative abundance of species in the community) of the macroinvertebrate community by the Bray-Curtis distance. The relationship between changes in water physicochemical conditions and changes in community structure were assessed with linear regression. The results showed that both the physical and chemical conditions of the water differed significantly among years. Similarly, the macroinvertebrate community structure and composition were significantly different among years. The compositional persistence was positively and significantly related to the physical condition, supporting the Habitat Templet Theory and indicating the importance of physical habitat protection. This study provides information for environmental assessment, which can be used to develop sustainable management strategies.

TI  - Assessing the environmental impact of induction motors using manufacturer's data and life cycle analysis
T2  - IET ELECTRIC POWER APPLICATIONS
LA  - English
AB  - Herein is reported development and testing of a life cycle analysis (LCA) procedure for assessing the environmental impact of induction motors. The operating conditions of a given industrial application are defined by the mechanical power required, operating hours and service life of the three-phase induction motor involved. Based on manufacturer's data mainly, different three-phase induction motors for various sets of operating conditions, including oversizing, have been selected. To quantify the environmental impact of each motor, the Methodology for the Ecodesign of Energy Using Products (MEEUP) was applied, according to the quantity of each of the motor's main constituent materials used in the production phase, and to the two operating variables that directly influence the LCA results: output power and efficiency. The procedure was applied to different three-phase induction motors representing two efficiency categories (IE1 and IE2) and considering different oversizing possibilities. The total environmental impact of each motor was determined based on the production, service life and end-of-life phases. The best motor option was identified for different operating conditions. Given the potential for energy savings in electric motors, LCA-based environmental impact assessment should be performed when different motors are being evaluated for a given industrial application.

AB  - Chironomid assemblages were studied in Lake Lautrey (Jura, France) along a 2.50m long core spanning the whole Lateglacial period. A stratigraphical constraint cluster analysis showed 7 biozones and 13 sub-biozones within the chironomid biostratigraphy. Characteristic taxa were allocated to each of the 7 biozones by simple analysis of the relative abundance diagram whereas several Correspondence Analyses (C.A.) were needed for the remaining 13 sub-biozones. Characteristic taxon compositions were interpreted using available quantitative inference models for total phosphorus concentration ([T.P.]), chlorophyll-a concentration ([Chl-a]), hypolimnetic oxygen conditions, and water temperature. Optimum ranks of the characteristic taxa against the environmental factors provided by these inference models were used to deduce an evaluation of environmental conditions. Paleoenvironmental interpretations of chironomid assemblage changes showed the Lateglacial climatic event succession (Oldest Dryas, Bolling/Allerod Interstadial, and Younger Dryas) commonly recognized in the area. Moreover, a bipartition of the Oldest Dryas, the occurrence of two minor oscillations during the Bolling/Allerod Interstadial and a trend in environmental changes (climatic improvement) during the Younger Dryas were also found.

AB  - The survival rates of enteric bacteria (i.e. Escherichia coli and enterococci) exposed to a sunlight simulator were determined at two different depths of sea water in varying conditions of light intensity, turbidity, sewage content, degree of mixing and temperature under controlled laboratory conditions. The combined effect of these factors on bacterial die-off was evaluated by statistical analyses carried out on the experimental data obtained according to the central composite experimental design. The magnitude and the general character of the influence of the factors were determined. The variability of bacterial mortality due to the effect of light was shown to depend on the variability of the intensity of light and the other microenvironmental factors (i.e. turbidity, sewage content, and mixing) influencing the depth profile of the light intensity and bacterial concentration. All factors except temperature were found to exert a significant influence on bacterial die-off under light conditions. Higher rates of die-off were brought about by high levels of light intensity and mixing with low levels of turbidity and sewage content of the water. No appreciable difference was found between the survival capabilities of E. call and enterococci on exposure to light.

AB  - Unbioturbated mudstones and highly bioturbated silty and sandy mudstones from the late Albian of Alberta, Canada, are characterized by their ichnological, foraminiferal, and geochemical signatures. A comparison of these data sets is undertaken to isolate the dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions that led to the preservation of unbioturbated mudstones versus highly bioturbated silty and sandy mudstones. Highly diverse and abundant benthic foraminiferal assemblages, coupled with conclusive geochemical signatures, indicate that unbioturbated mudstones were deposited under oxic bottom waters. The paucity of bioturbation in these rocks is attributed to the persistence of low-oxic conditions (5 > DO > 2 mg L-1) at the seafloor, comparable to the present-day Gulf of Mexico. We assert that unbioturbated mudstone should not automatically be attributed to oxygen deficiency (< 2 mg L-1). Instead, it may reflect oxygenation sufficient to support benthic microfauna (foraminifera) but insufficient to sustain a diverse ecosystem of macrofauna (burrowing fauna). Moreover, we propose that the distribution of unburrowed mudstones deposited below low-oxic waters is predictable. A paucity of bioturbation is normal in shallow marine (below fair-weather wave base to similar to 200 m water depth) deposits of subtropical to tropical ocean basins and/or semienclosed seaways.

AB  - Body condition is assumed to influence an animal's health and fitness. Various non-destructive methods based on body mass and a measure of body length have been used as condition indices (CIs), but the dominant method amongst ecologists is currently the calculation of residuals from an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression of body mass against length. Recent studies of energy reserves in small mammals and starlings claimed to validate this method, although we argue that they did not include the most appropriate tests since they compared the CI with the absolute size of energy reserves. We present a novel CI (the 'scaled mass index') based on the central principle of scaling, with important methodological, biological and conceptual advantages. Through a reanalysis of data from small mammals, starlings and snakes, we show that the scaled mass index is a better indicator of the relative size of energy reserves and other body components than OLS residuals, performing better in all seven species and in 19 out of 20 analyses. We also present an empirical and theoretical comparison of the scaled mass index and OLS residuals as CIs. We argue that the scaled mass index is a useful new tool for ecologists.

AB  - The subject of the paper is the analysis of the connection between the Slovak economy disequilibrium and the transformation if its system. A question is raised concerning deepening the economic disequilibrium in the transformation process. The conclusions on the disequilibrium deepening are based on the analysis of the indicators such as depreciation, economic returns, cost profitability and profit rate, interest and interest rate, as well as upon the change of individual industries position assessed by labour productivity and production decrease.
   Deepening of the disequilibrium of the Slovak economy basically change conditions of its revival. The role of these conditions is played primarily by the inevitability to match costs and prides, this being the prerequisite of hindering further decapitalization of production, of resolving the problems of debt among enterprises having the form of insolvency within production sphere and indebtedness of production sphere with respect to banking sphere.
   Even a partial analysis of present positions of individual industries of the-economy shows the diversity from position that enable growth of the economy working under the conditions or market economy environment that comprise its internal and external relations. In this connection a deteriorated position of manufacturing industries is stated and that of engineering industry especially.

AB  - Several tools can be used to evaluate the health status of fish. Histology is one of them because it assesses pathological changes induced by environment, pathogens and/or nutritional factors. The histological condition of macroscopically healthy turbot juveniles in the beginning of the growing phase in an intensive fish farm was evaluated. The gill, skin, liver, kidney and intestine were histologically processed by standard techniques and their histological status determined semi-quantitatively. The skin, the gills and the liver of examined turbot were in a good overall condition or presented slight alterations frequently observed in farmed fish. The kidney and the intestine of some fish presented pronounced histological alterations caused mainly by the occurrence of nephrocalcinosis in the kidney, and necrotic areas in intestinal lamina propria of the mucosa. The possible causes of these findings are discussed.
   Statement of relevance: This is a very first histology based survey conducted in an intensive farm to evaluate the health status of turbot juveniles. The results showed that i) the histological analysis is a useful tool for assessing the fish health and, ii) most of the fish were in good health condition. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Birdsong is a classic example of a learned trait with cultural inheritance, with selection acting on trait expression. To understand how song responds to selection, it is vital to determine the extent to which variation in song learning and neuroanatomy is attributable to genetic variation, environmental conditions, or their interactions. Using a partial cross fostering design with an experimental stressor, we quantified the heritability of song structure and key brain nuclei in the song control system of the zebra finch and the genotype-by-environment (G x E) interactions. Neuroanatomy and song structure both showed low levels of heritability and are unlikely to be under selection as indicators of genetic quality. HVC, in particular, was almost entirely under environmental control. G x E interaction was important for brain development and may provide a mechanism by which additive genetic variation is maintained, which in turn may promote sexual selection through female choice. Our study suggests that selection may act on the genes determining vocal learning, rather than directly on the underlying neuroanatomy, and emphasizes the fundamental importance of environmental conditions for vocal learning and neural development in songbirds.

AB  - This paper reports studies related to problems of vapour-side corrosion of copper/nickel alloys in multistage flash desalination plant. The main objective of the work was to obtain basic information and understanding of the corrosion behaviour of copper/nickel alloys in distilled water over a range of relevant environmental conditions. Some attention was also devoted to titanium and an austenitic stainless steel. The experiments were conducted in controlled laboratory conditions with assessment of corrosion behaviour mainly involving electrochemical monitoring. The results demonstrated a clear superiority of the Cu/30Ni alloy over Cu/10Ni material at ambient temperatures and also nonprotective behaviour of both alloys upon initial exposure to distilled water at 80 degreesC. In the time scales of the experiments (up to 15 days), no evidence was found that the presence of carbon dioxide at 80 degreesC made the water significantly more aggressive to the copper/nickel alloys. The superiority of the Cu/30Ni alloy over Cu/10Ni at lower temperatures did not appear to extend to the higher temperatures (80 degreesC) studied. Certainly at short exposure times, titanium and UNS S31603 stainless steel posses considerably superior corrosion resistance than the copper/nickel alloys over the entire range of conditions studied.

AB  - The study of the microbial communities has gained traction in recent years with the advent of next-generation sequencing with, or without, PCR-based amplification of the 16S ribosomal RNA region. Such studies have been applied to topics as diverse as human health and environmental ecology. Fewer studies have investigated taxa outside of bacteria, however. We present here data demonstrating the utility of studying taxa outside of bacteria including algae, diatoms, archaea and fungi. Here, we show how location along the Cuya-hoga River as well as a transient rainfall event heavily influence the microbial composition. Our data reveal how individual OTUs vary between samples and how the patterns of OTU abundance can accurately predict sampling location. The clustering of samples reveals that these taxa are all sensitive to water conditions in unique ways and demonstrate that, for our dataset, algae was most distinctive between sample groups, surpassing bacteria. Diversity between sampling sites could allow studies investigating pollution or water quality to identify marker OTUs or patterns of OTU abundance as indicators to assess environmental conditions or the impact of human activity. We also directly compare data derived from primers amplifying distinct taxa and show that taxa besides bacteria are excellent indicators of water condition.

AB  - Because of the significant role soils play in the health and function of the Everglades ecosystem, soil conservation is a central tenet of Everglades restoration. As such, it is critical to anticipate ecosystem responses to hydrologic restoration activities from the perspective of the soil component. The broad goal of this work was to investigate the resulting effects of various hydrologic restoration scenarios on soil processes of phosphorus and carbon accretion by modeling soil edaphic processes using the Everglades Landscape Model. The results of modeling effort suggest that full implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan provides the greatest spatial reduction of phosphorus (P) enrichment throughout the system. The existing condition baseline (ECB) scenario, which represents the current hydrologic and nutrient impaired condition, produced the highest observed rates of soil carbon accretion; however, this scenario is successful in accretion of soil carbon due to elevated P conditions, not restored hydrology. Management implications of restoration with respect to soil elucidated from this work include: (1) prioritization of habitat quality and ecosystem function (via P reduction) over carbon sequestration potential and (2) need to reduce P inputs before restoring hydrologic connectivity and historic flows.

AB  - In order to assess the effects of palaeoenvironmental fluctuations on the distributions of calcareous nannofossils and foraminifer species, semiquantitative analyses were carried out on a cored upper Aptian section in the Sergipe Basin, northeastern Brazil. In the lower part of the section, abundance peaks of Watznaueria barnesae, Nannoconus spp., and favusellids (a planktic foraminiferal morphogroup adapted to shallow, warm, carbonate-saturated environments) document the earliest marine incursions in northeastern Brazil and appear to represent cyclic short-term marine pulses in an environmental setting dominated by paralic conditions. Higher in the succession, where open marine, shallow-middle neritic conditions became well established, a negative correlation is seen between the abundance of Nannoconus spp. and coccoliths (Tranolithus spp., Stradneria spp. and W. barnesae) as nutrient levels fluctuated. Tranolithus spp. and Stradneria spp. are probable indicators of nutrient enrichment in very shallow-water environments, associated with the onset of marine transgressive events. A positive correlation between nannoconids, favusellids, and carbonate-rich deposits, indicates that both fossil groups thrived in the same environmental conditions (shallow,warm, hypersaline, carbonate-saturated environments with intermediate, mesotrophic, nutrient levels).

AB  - The literature is replete with information describing the composition of the root lipidome in several plant species grown under various environmental conditions. However, it is unknown to what extent the root membrane lipidome vary between silage-corn genotypes, and how such variation could influence agronomic performances during field cultivation in cool climate. To address this issue, the root membrane lipidome and agronomic performance were assessed for five silage-corn genotypes (Fusion-RR, Yukon-R, A4177G3-RIB, DKC23-17RIB, DKC26-28RIB) cultivated under cool climatic conditions. Leaf area, plant height and biomass production were used as agronomic performance indicators. Varieties DKC26-28RIB and Yukon-R expressed significantly higher leaf area, plant height and biomass production compared to the other genotypes. A strong positive Spearman rank-order correlation (P = 0.001) was observed between biomass production and root phosphatidic acid (PA). The high correlation observed between PA and agronomic performance indicates PA could potentially be used as biomarker to assist in the selection of silage-corn genotypes with superior agronomic performance ideally suited for field cultivations in cool climatic conditions.

T2  - BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH

KW  - INFRARED THERMOGRAPHY
KW  - DIAGNOSIS
AB  - Background: Thermal imagers have been used in a number of disciplines to record animal surface temperatures and as a result detect temperature distributions and abnormalities requiring a particular course of action. Some work, with animals infected with foot-and-mouth disease virus, has suggested that the technique might be used to identify animals in the early stages of disease. In this study, images of 19 healthy cattle have been taken over an extended period to determine hoof and especially coronary band temperatures (a common site for the development of FMD lesions) and eye temperatures (as a surrogate for core body temperature) and to examine how these vary with time and ambient conditions.
   Results: The results showed that under UK conditions an animal's hoof temperature varied from 10 C to 36 C and was primarily influenced by the ambient temperature and the animal's activity immediately prior to measurement. Eye temperatures were not affected by ambient temperature and are a useful indicator of core body temperature.
   Conclusions: Given the variation in temperature of the hooves of normal animals under various environmental conditions the use of a single threshold hoof temperature will be at best a modest predictive indicator of early FMD, even if ambient temperature is factored into the evaluation.

AB  - This work studied the feasibility of biohydrogen production by co-digestion of vinasse/molasses in an AnSBBR operated with mechanical stirring (30 degrees C and 200 rpm). Hydrogen production by co-digestion of vinasse/sucrose was also studied to verify the performance of the process with a known co-substrate with easy degradation. The effects of influent composition (vinasse/sucrose and vinasse/molasses), influent concentration (3000 and 4000 mgCOD. L-1) and cycle time (3 and 4 h) on performance indicators were evaluated using stability, organic matter removal efficiency, molar hydrogen yield, productivity and biogas composition. The condition with vinasse/molasses in the influent that showed the best results was obtained with a 3-hour cycle time, influent concentration of 3000 mgCOD. L-1 and composition of 33% vinasse and 67% molasses. The molar productivity in this condition was 3.8 molH(2).m(-3).d(-1) with a hydrogen molar fraction of 16% (and a methane molar fraction of 14%). A first order kinetic model was fitted efficiently to the best conditions.

AB  - Green urban areas provide several benefits to society and to the environment. San Juan de Aragon Park, located in the northeast of Mexico City, is one of the few green areas in that urban zone but the health of its trees is not known. In this survey, the crown condition indicator protocol was adapted and applied in 28 circular plots (0.1 ha) established randomly in this park. Normal diameter, total height, species identity, crown condition and tree density were evaluated for all of the trees within these plots. Six crown variables were measured: live crown ratio (Lcr), crown density (Cdn), crown transparency (Ctr), crown dieback (Cdie), crown position (Cpo) and light exposure ( Lex). The first four variables were measured in 5% classes, and the latter two by using an ordinal scale. A total of 760 trees, grouped into 10 families, 11 genera and 12 species, were evaluated. The average values for the crown variables were 56.37% for Lcr, 44.38% for Cdn, 4.04% for Cdie and 38.4% for Ctr. Only Lcr reached the standards established in other studies, while Cdn was lower and Ctr and Cdie were both higher.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the effect of increasing doses of retorted oil shale (ROS) application on the biological property indicators of soil quality. Experiments were carried out, under field and laboratory conditions, on a Hapludalf soil. In the laboratory, the treatments consisted of the application of seven different ROS rates (0, 300, 450, 600, 750, 1,500 and 3,000 kg ha(-1)) to the soil. In the field, the treatments were composed by four different ROS rates (0, 750, 1,500 and 3,000 kg ha(-1)) combined with the recommended mineral fertilizer rate, evaluated in two croppings of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), under no-till system. CO2 evolution, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), soil enzyme activity and the ecotoxicity test were evaluated. Application of increasing ROS rates improved the soil microbial activity by decreasing CO2 emission and causing no variations in MBC nor negative impacts on the soil enzymatic activity. The results obtained with the enzymes under field conditions, after two ROS applications, allied to MBC results, and to the metabolic quocient (qCO(2)) and to the ecotoxicity test, under laboratory conditions, show that the use of ROS cause no soil biological degradation.

AB  - Long-term plasticity of otolith shape has become a unifying principle to use morphological differences as indicator of environmental conditions. Contrary to the longstanding paradigmatic view that otolith shape can only reflect residency in particular environmental conditions over long time periods, data emphasize that otolith ontogenetic trajectory may be reoriented in case of short-term episodes of environmental disturbance during early lifetime. Using geometric morphometrics, discrimination was posible in absence of growth-related differences between control and brown trout (Salmo trutta Linnaeus, 1758) that have experienced brief thermal stress prior to their emergence but have grown in similar conditions (i.e., cohabiting within the same aquarium) during 6 months. Data emphasize that brief stress during key developmental periods can durably influence ontogenetic trajectories, subsequent otolith development, and can consequently change otolith morphology in juveniles. Therefore, differences in shape between groups of fish may not be exclusively indicative of long-time residency in contrasted and (or) separated habitats as it is generally assumed. Moving beyond long-term assumptions is fundamental if otolith shape is to be used as an effective tool for management of fisheries resources in the future.

AB  - Thedigging of peanut, which has the pod production in the subsurface, is directly affected by soil conditions, physical or environmental characteristics, at the time of operation and may be the cause of unwanted losses. Therefore, the quality of the operation is very important for minimizing these losses. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the quality of mechanizeddiggingoperation of peanut according to three soil textural classes( Sandy, Medium and Loamy) and their water content conditions at operation through statistical process control. The experiment was conducted at three locations in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, under sampling scheme arranged in tracks and 40 sampling points for each textural class of soil, using the mechanical digging variables as indicators of quality. We found that the mechanized digging operation in Sandy soil was the most critical, just meeting the specifications of quality indicators, reflecting higher losses and lower quality of the operation. Medium soil showed at the digginggood and homogeneous conditions in relation to water content in soil and pods, and because it has favorable characteristics it obtained the lower total losses and higher quality of operation. Loamy soil showed satisfactory quality, meeting the specifications as well, but with poorer quality than the Medium Soil.

AB  - The role of valvular interstitial cell (VIC) architecture in regulating cardiac valve function and pathology is not well understood. VICs are known to be more elongated in a hypertensive environment compared to those in a normotensive environment. We have previously reported that valve tissues cultured under hypertensive conditions are prone to acute pathological alterations in cell phenotype and contractility. We therefore aimed to rigorously study the relationship between VIC shape, contractile output and other functional indicators of VIC pathology. We developed an in vitro model to engineer VICs to take on the same shapes as those seen in normal and hypertensive conditions. VICs with longer cellular and nuclear shapes, as seen in hypertensive conditions, had greater contractile response to endothelin-1 that correlated with increased anisotropy of the actin architecture. These elongated VICs also demonstrated altered cell metabolism through a decreased optical redox ratio, which coincided with increased cellular proliferation. In the presence of actin polymerization inhibitor, however, these functional responses were significantly reduced, suggesting the important role of cytoskeletal actin organization in regulating cellular responses to abnormal shape. Overall, these results demonstrate the relationship between cell shape, cytoskeletal and nuclear organization, with functional output including contractility, metabolism, and proliferation.

AB  - Global biodiversity is affected by numerous environmental drivers. Yet, the extent to which global environmental changes contribute to changes in local diversity is poorly understood. We investigated biodiversity changes in a meta-analysis of 39 resurvey studies in European temperate forests (3988 vegetation records in total, 17-75years between the two surveys) by assessing the importance of (i) coarse-resolution (i.e., among sites) vs. fine-resolution (i.e., within sites) environmental differences and (ii) changing environmental conditions between surveys. Our results clarify the mechanisms underlying the direction and magnitude of local-scale biodiversity changes. While not detecting any net local diversity loss, we observed considerable among-site variation, partly explained by temporal changes in light availability (a local driver) and density of large herbivores (a regional driver). Furthermore, strong evidence was found that presurvey levels of nitrogen deposition determined subsequent diversity changes. We conclude that models forecasting future biodiversity changes should consider coarse-resolution environmental changes, account for differences in baseline environmental conditions and for local changes in fine-resolution environmental conditions.

AB  - The need to understand how anthropogenic landscape alteration affects fauna populations has never been more pressing. The importance of developing an understanding of the processes behind local extinction is widely acknowledged, but inference from spatial patterns of fauna distribution continues to dominate. However, this approach is limited in its ability to generate strong predictions about future distributions and local extinctions, especially when population-level responses to landscape alteration are subject to long time lags. We review the potential for indices of physiological stress and condition to contribute to understanding of how landscape pattern affects species persistence. Such measures can indicate habitat quality from the perspective of the individual animal, and can reveal environmental stressors before their negative consequences begin to manifest at a population level. Spatial patterns of chronic stress may therefore yield valuable insight into how landscape alteration influences species. We propose that the emerging disciplines of conservation physiology and macrophysiology have much to offer spatial ecology, and have great potential to reveal the physiological pathways through which habitat alteration affects fauna populations and their persistence in fragmented landscapes.

AB  - The root parameters of forest trees can be indicators of a changing environment. We summarize the results of root studies with regard to the effects of acidifying pollutants, especially soil acidification and aluminum toxicity, on various root parameters of Japanese forest trees under experimentally controlled conditions. All root parameters such as biomass, morphology, nutritional status, and physiology can be regarded as indicators, because, under laboratory conditions, root responses occur prior to the responses in the aboveground parts. However, considering the conditions of forest sites, the nutritional status and physiological changes are better indicators of soil acidification and Al stress than the biomass and morphological response. The currently available data suggest that the most important indicator is the Ca/Al molar ratio in roots of Japanese tree species. In order to predict and detect the initial effects of soil acidification, we postulate that the specific root response to the Ca/Al molar ratio of tree roots should be considered as a parameter for use in long-term forest monitoring sites.

AB  - Under ideal environmental conditions, RGB-based deep convolutional neural networks can achieve high performance for salient object detection (SOD). In scenes with cluttered backgrounds and many objects, depth maps have been combined with RGB images to better distinguish spatial positions and structures during SOD, achieving high accuracy. However, under low-light and uneven lighting conditions, RGB and depth information may be insufficient for detection. Thermal images are insensitive to lighting and weather conditions, being able to capture important objects even during nighttime. By combining thermal images and RGB images, we propose an effective and consistent feature fusion network (ECFFNet) for RGB-T SOD. In ECFFNet, an effective cross-modality fusion module fully fuses features of corresponding sizes from the RGB and thermal modalities. Then, a bilateral reversal fusion module performs bilateral fusion of foreground and background information, enabling the full extraction of salient object boundaries. Finally, a multilevel consistent fusion module combines features across different levels to obtain complementary information. Comprehensive experiments on three RGB-T SOD datasets show that the proposed ECFFNet outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods under different evaluation indicators.

AB  - Camera-based remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is a low-cost and casual non-contact heart rate measurement method suitable for telemedicine. Several factors affect the accuracy of measuring the heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV) using rPPG despite HRV being an important indicator for healthcare monitoring. This study aimed to investigate the appropriate setup for precise HRV measurements using rPPG while considering the effects of possible factors including illumination, direction of the light, frame rate of the camera, and body motion. In the lighting conditions experiment, the smallest mean absolute R-R interval (RRI) error was obtained when light greater than 500 lux was cast from the front (among the following conditions-illuminance: 100, 300, 500, and 700 lux; directions: front, top, and front and top). In addition, the RRI and HRV were measured with sufficient accuracy at frame rates above 30 fps. The accuracy of the HRV measurement was greatly reduced when the body motion was not constrained; thus, it is necessary to limit the body motion, especially the head motion, in an actual telemedicine situation. The results of this study can act as guidelines for setting up the shooting environment and camera settings for rPPG use in telemedicine.

AB  - Utilities prefer noninvasive methods for assessing the condition of power transformer insulation. Analysis of polarization-depolarization current (PDC) is one such popular method. One such analysis involves the estimation of trapped charge released from the interfacial region of oil-paper insulation. The literature shows that such charges can be reliably used for the diagnosis of transformer insulation. However, such analysis requires a complete profile of PDC. PDC measurement (an offline technique) takes a large amount of time (several hours) to complete. The magnitude of PDC data for a larger value of time is also sensitive to changes in environmental conditions and field noise as its magnitude is low. Hence, a reliable estimation of detrapped charge may require numerous PDC measurements. This situation is not convenient for utilities as it prolongs shut down time. In this article, a method has been proposed which is capable of estimating detrapping charge using PDC data measured for a short span of time. The proposed method is tested on data collected from several real-life in-service transformers.

KW  - DIAGNOSIS
AB  - Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) is a well established method to monitor and predict the condition of devices with oil-cellulose insulation, especially power transformers. However, the effect of the migration of theses gases between the liquid and solid insulation is often ignored. The migration phenomenon is temperature dependent and, if ignored, can potentially lead to erroneous condition assessment by the DGA method. This paper addresses the dynamic nature of propagation of these gases in such systems based on temperature variations. Diffusion times, and therefore diffusivity of the gases, in oil-impregnated cellulose are calculated by identifying the diffusion process as a linear system. The diffusion time-constants, and steady-state condition at the working concentrations, are estimated based on the identified model. A sensitivity study is performed to show the dependency of the diffusion time-constants to the temperature and the oil-cellulose ratio in the system. The equilibrium curves are obtained in the case of carbon dioxide by using solubility information of this gas in the oil and paper pulp, similar to the case of moisture equilibrium. The results are compared with the experimental data. An example of the implication of the obtained data is shown.

AB  - Urban rivers differ from natural rivers because of the direct connection they have with human habitat. Furthermore, riverbanks are public spaces that contribute to the interaction between natural and urbanized areas and between people from different socioeconomic background. Due to this significance, the main objective of this research was to provide a methodology for the construction of a toolbox that evaluates connectivity and comfort of urban riverbanks, so as to allow comparative visual and numeric analysis between different zones of the same river, distinct rivers in the same city and rivers in various cities. The proposal was based on the disaggregation of the concepts of connectivity and comfort, through the analysis of four dimensions: (a) Spatial and visual accessibility, (b) Continuity of the green corridor, (c) Condition ofpublic space, and (d) Condition of the first built line, expressed in thirteen quantitative condition indicators. For validation, the toolbox was applied to five zones of the Tomebamba River of the city of Cuenca in Ecuador and a series of maps were generated allowing spatial visualization of the results. In addition, an Urban River Sustainability Index (URSI) was developed to reinforce the decision-making processes in planning and urban design.

AB  - The paper investigates the dynamic relationship between renewable energy usage and trade performance in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), while considering the conditioning role of corruption control, regulatory quality, and the private sector access to finance. Focusing on 42 SSA countries for the period 2004-2016, and engaging the System generalized method of moments (GMM) technique for its estimation, this study found a negative relationship between renewable energy usage and the indicators of trade performance. However, with corruption control, improved regulatory framework, and better finance for the private sector, there are potentials for a positive net impact of renewable energy usage on manufacturing export. For renewable energy and total trade nexus, we find that improved regulatory framework, and better finance for the private sector are important conditioning structures. These findings are significant because they highlight the different important structures of SSA countries that improves the effect of renewable energy use on trade outcomes. For instance, the consideration of the financial, institutional and regulatory frameworks in SSA countries in conditioning the renewable energy-trade nexus stipulates a clear policy pathway for countries in this region as the debate for transition to the use of renewable energy progresses.

AB  - Reed marshes, the world's most widespread type of wetland vegetation, are undergoing major changes as a result of climate changes and human activities. The presence or absence of water in reed marshes has a significant impact on the whole ecosystem and remains a key indicator to identify the effective area of a wetland and help estimate the degree of degeneration. Past studies have demonstrated the use of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) to map water-level changes for flooded reeds. However, the identification of the different hydrological states of reed marshes is often poorly understood. The analysis given in this paper shows that L-band interferometric coherence is very sensitive to the water surface conditions beneath reed marshes and so it can be used as classifier. A method based on a statistical analysis of the coherence distributions for wet and dry reeds using InSAR pairs was, therefore, investigated in this study. The experimental results were validated by in-situ data and showed very good agreement. This is the first time that information about the water cover under herbaceous wetlands has been derived using interferometric coherence values. This method can also effectively and easily be applied to monitor the hydrological conditions beneath other herbaceous wetlands.

AB  - In this paper the development of a new laboratory prototype for the emulation of a photovoltaic (PV) field is presented. The proposed system is based on a DC/DC step-down converter topology and allows to obtain the solar array I-V curves, taking into account the environmental changes in solar irradiance and cell temperature. The DC/DC converter control strategy is deduced by using a comprehensive mathematical model of the PV field whose parameters are obtained from the knowledge of: (a) maximum power point data, measured when the PV plant power converter is running, (b) open circuit voltage and short-circuit current, measured off-line. This approach allows the most accurate representation of the PV source. Computer simulations and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed circuit acts as a highly accurate and efficient laboratory simulator of the photovoltaic array electrical characteristics both in steady state and transient conditions. Partial shading and fluctuating conditions can be reproduced too. Moreover the dynamic behaviour of the proposed laboratory emulator is suitable to its effective connection to power electronic interface to the utility or to load through a DC/DC boost converter.

AB  - The goal of precision medicine (individually tailored treatments) is not being achieved for neurobehavioural conditions such as psychiatric disorders. Traditional randomized clinical trial methods are insufficient for advancing precision medicine because of the dynamic complexity of these conditions. We present a pragmatic solution: the precision clinical trial framework, encompassing methods for individually tailored treatments. This framework includes the following: (1) treatment-targeted enrichment, which involves measuring patients' response after a brief bout of an intervention, and then randomizing patients to a full course of treatment, using the acute response to predict long-term outcomes; (2) adaptive treatments, which involve adjusting treatment parameters during the trial to individually optimize the treatment; and (3) precise measurement, which involves measuring predictor and outcome variables with high accuracy and reliability using techniques such as ecological momentary assessment. This review summarizes precision clinical trials and provides a research agenda, including new biomarkers such as precision neuroimaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation-electroencephalogram digital phenotyping and advances in statistical and machine-learning models. Validation of these approaches - and then widespread incorporation of the precision clinical trial framework - could help achieve the vision of precision medicine for neurobehavioural conditions.

AB  - The elemental shell chemistry of two freshwater snails, Viviparus diluvianus (Kunth) and Valvata piscinalis (Muller) was studied for palaeoenvironmental purposes. The shells were collected from lake sediments from five Holsteinian (Marine Isotope Stage 11) sites in eastern Poland (Ossowka, Hrud II, Roskosz, Ortel Krolewski and Szymanowo) and analysed for Ca, Mg, Sr, Mn and Fe. The Fe/Mn molar ratio was used as a redox indicator, with lower values (and high Mn concentrations) pointing to suboxic conditions. These occurred in the beginning of the Taxus zone and during the transition between the Taxus and Pinus-Larix zones at Ortel Krolewski, and in the Holsteinian thermal maximum (Carpinus-Abies zone) at Roskosz Lake. Strongly reducing conditions, indicated by increased Fe and Fe/Mn values, prevailed at Ortel Krolewski palaeolake in the middle of the Taxus zone, in the Pinus-Larix zone and in the upper part of the Roskosz sequence. Indicators of anoxia correlate with eutrophic conditions, enhanced productivity and oxygen consumption due to organic matter decay. The most distinct environmental changes in the records are comparable to other central and northern European records and to the main climatic oscillations during the Holsteinian, inferred from palynological, malacological and isotopic data.

AB  - The role of natural attenuation processes in groundwater contamination by petroleum hydrocarbons is of intense scientific and practical interest. This study provides insight into the biodegradation effects in groundwater at a site contaminated by kerosene (jet fuel) in 1993 (Vitanovac, Serbia). Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), hydrochemical indicators (O-2 , NO3-, Mn, Fe, SO42-, HCO3- ), delta C-13 of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and other parameters were measured to demonstrate biodegradation effects in groundwater at the contaminated site. Due to different biodegradation mechanisms, the zone of the lowest concentrations of electron acceptors and the zone of the highest concentrations of metabolic products of biodegradation overlap. Based on the analysis of redox-sensitive compounds in groundwater samples, redox processes ranged from strictly anoxic (methanogenesis) to oxic (oxygen reduction) within a short distance. The dependence of groundwater redox conditions on the distance from the source of contamination was observed. delta C-13 values of DIC ranged from -15.83 to -2.75 parts per thousand, and the most positive values correspond to the zone under anaerobic and methanogenic conditions. Overall, results obtained provide clear evidence on the effects of natural attenuation processes-the activity of biodegradation mechanisms in field conditions.

AB  - Rainwater harvesting has been recognized as an alternative water supply method with many environmental benefits. This method can also produce drinking water for people who cannot access safe water resources. In this study, we evaluate the newly developed rainwater for drinking (RFD) system built at Ly Nhan Hospital in Vietnam. Most evaluation methods are not suitable for the RFD system because they focus on given conditions and overlook the potential of the system via operation and management practices. The hydrological performance was evaluated based on the system supplying drinking water sustainably, with zero no water days and a rainwater utilization ratio of 22%. Methods for improving performance indicators under adverse conditions were determined using sensitivity analysis and include increasing catchment area and tank volume and maximizing water use by utilizing rainwater overflow. Among them, an additional tank should be prioritized considering the cost, or it can be replaced by a plastic bag. The RFD system can be designed based on system monitoring data despite a lack of daily rainfall data and unexpected changes in the conditions. Appropriate regional RFD guidelines can be established with the continued evaluation of the RFD system worldwide.

AB  - Survival and germination of spores in upper gastro intestinal tract (GIT) is crucial for spore-probiotics to confer beneficial effects to the host. In the present study, the survival, germination and metabolic activity of Bacillus coagulans Unique IS2 spores in an in vitro Simulator of Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME (R)) model was investigated. The survival and germination of spores under fed and fasted GIT conditions was analyzed by using flow cytometry and agar plate method. Lactate and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) were measured as indicators of metabolic activity. B. coagulans Unique IS2 showed 102% and 99% survival under fed and fasted conditions of upper GIT. Significant amount of spore germination was detected in small intestine, where the spores had not transformed completely into vegetative cells but assisted in digestion of lactose and fructose. Furthermore, once the germinated spores entered into the colon they underwent vegetative growth and produced significant levels of lactate (8.30 +/- 0.07 mM) and acetate (31.75 +/- 3.58 mM) as major metabolites. In conclusion, B. coagulans Unique IS2 demonstrated ability to survive and germinate under gastrointestinal conditions and aid in digestion of carbohydrates.

AB  - To manage a stressful stimulus animals react both behaviorally and physiologically to restore the homeostasis. In stable horses, a stressful stimulus can be represented by social separation, riding discomfort or the presence of novel objects in their environment. Although Heart Rate Variability is a common indicator of stress levels in horses, the behavioral mechanisms concurrently occurring under stressful conditions are still unknown. The sudden inflation of a balloon was administered to 33 horses. Video-recording of self-directed behaviors (snore, vacuum chewing, snort, head/body shaking) and monitoring of heart activity (HR and SDRR) were conducted for five minutes before (Pre-test) and after the stimulus administration (Stress-test). During the Stress-test, only snore and vacuum chewing increased and a significant increase was also recorded in both HR and SDRR. Moreover, the snore variation between the two conditions showed a significant correlation with the variation of both HR and SDRR. With the snore acting as stress-releasing behavior to restore basal condition, the homeostasis recovered via the enactment of such behavior could be physiologically expressed by an increasing vagal activity. Hence, the capacity to maintain homeostasis (resilience) could correspond to a prevalence of parasympathetic control on heart activity, intervening when certain behaviors are performed.

TI  - The Evaluation of Vehicle Fuel Consumption and Harmful Emission Using the Heating System in a Driving Cycle
T2  - SAE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FUELS AND LUBRICANTS
LA  - English
AB  - The article suggests the results of experimental and theoretical studies of the engine heating system with a phase-transitional thermal accumulator when the vehicle is in motion in a driving cycle. The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficiency of the vehicle heating system within thermal accumulator and catalytic converter under operating conditions. The peculiarity of the presented system is that it uses thermal energy of exhaust gases to accumulate energy during engine operation. The article describes the methodology to evaluate vehicle fuel consumption and emission in the driving cycle according to the UNECE Regulation. 83-05. The methodology takes into account the environmental parameters, road conditions, the design parameters of the vehicle, the modes of its motion, thermal state of the engine cooling system and the catalytic converter. Experimental studies determined the patterns of changing technical parameters of the engine G4GC (4FS 7.72 / 8.45) in the heating process using the heating system with thermal accumulator.

AB  - The paper presents the results of a three-year research on the technology of corn cultivation and efficiency of starch utilization as bio-feedstock for bioethanol production in Ukraine. Peculiarities of carbohydrate accumulation in corn hybrids depending on the fraction size, seeding depth and conditions of cultivation are determined. The effect of seed fraction size (small, medium and large), seeding depth (4, 7 and 11 cm) on the yield, starch content and output, approximate bioethanol output in corn hybrids of three maturity groups (early-'DKC 2960' and 'DKC 2971', mid-early-'DKC 3472', 'DKC 3795', and mid-'DK 315' and 'DKC 4082' originated by the company DEKALB Monsanto Ukraine) is analyzed. The influence of environmental conditions on the studied characteristics and indicators is revealed. Dependence of productivity, starch content and bioethanol output on the seeding depth and seed fraction size is disclosed. There has been observed the growth of genetic control of these indicators depending on the specific hybrid, compared to the investigated technology elements. Application of large linear-size seeds and the optimum seeding depth of 4-7 cm provide an opportunity to increase the yield, starch content and bioethanol output.

AB  - A novel damage detection algorithm for structural health monitoring using time series model is presented. The proposed algorithm uses output-only acceleration time series obtained from sensors on the structure which are fitted using Auto-regressive moving-average with exogenous inputs (ARMAX) model. The algorithm uses Cepstral distances between the ARMAX models of decorrelated data obtained from healthy and any other current condition of the structure as the damage indicator. A numerical model of a simply supported beam with variations due to temperature and operating conditions along with measurement noise is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed damage diagnostic technique using the ARMAX time series models and their Cepstral distances with novelty indices. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using the benchmark data of the 8-DOF system made available to public by the Engineering Institute of LANL and the simulated vibration data obtained from the FEM model of IASC-ASCE 12-DOF steel frame. The results of the studies indicate that the proposed algorithm is robust in identifying the damage from the acceleration data contaminated with noise under varied environmental and operational conditions.

AB  - The labels currently used on food and beverage products only provide consumers with a rough guide to their expected shelf lives because they assume that a product only experiences a limited range of predefined handling and storage conditions. These static labels do not take into consideration conditions that might shorten a product's shelf life (such as temperature abuse), which can lead to problems associated with food safety and waste. Advances in shelf-life estimation have the potential to improve the safety, reliability, and sustainability of the food supply. Selection of appropriate kinetic models and data-analysis techniques is essential to predict shelf life, to account for variability in environmental conditions, and to allow real-time monitoring. Novel analytical tools to determine safety and quality attributes in situ coupled with modern tracking technologies and appropriate predictive tools have the potential to provide accurate estimations of the remaining shelf life of a food product in real time. This review summarizes the necessary steps to attain a transition from open labeling to real-time shelf-life measurements.

AB  - Studies of yeast obtained postfermentation have largely considered individual cells within the crop to be phenotypically and genotypically similar. However, previous studies have indicated that environmental conditions within the cone of a cylindroconical vessel are variable, suggesting that physiological and potentially genetic heterogeneity may occur. Two 2,000-hL fermentation vessels, pitched in parallel with a lager strain, were cropped using two regimens and yeast fractions obtained at 500-kg intervals. Each yeast fraction was analyzed for factors impacting fermentation performance. In addition, characteristics of the barm beer were investigated. Analysis of yeast postfermentation indicated extensive heterogeneity within the crop, in terms of physiological condition, flocculation potential, cell size, and replicative age. In addition, environmental conditions within the cone were also observed to vary substantially. Gradients in terms of temperature, pH, gravity, and ethanol were all detected within the cone. Although cropping regimens can differ, it is proposed that variation in yeast quality throughout the cone may facilitate selection during cropping. Successively cropping and pitching with a specific portion of the cone may lead to the accumulation of a population comprising cells with inappropriate fermentative characteristics, potentially leading to fermentation inconsistency.

AB  - In the present study, we examined the utility of proline usage as a biochemical indicator of metabolic changes caused by climate change (mean temperature and precipitation) during seed development of two Acer species differing in desiccation tolerance: Norway maple (Acer platanoides L.-desiccation tolerant-orthodox) and sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.-desiccation sensitive-recalcitrant). In plants, proline is an element of the antioxidant system, which has a role in response to water loss and high temperatures. Our study considered whether proline could be treated as an indicator of tree seed viability, crucial for genetic resources conservation. Proline content was measured biweekly in developing seeds (between 11 and 23 weeks after flowering) collected in consecutive years (2017, 2018, and 2019). We showed that proline concentrations in recalcitrant seeds were positively correlated with mean two-week temperature. In contrast, in orthodox seeds no such relationship was found. Proline content proved to be sensitive to thermal-moisture conditions changes, which makes it a promising biochemical marker of seed desiccation tolerance in different climatic conditions.

AB  - Plant stress caused by extreme environmental conditions is already a principal reason for yield reduction in crops(1). The threat of global environment change makes it increasingly important to generate crop plants that will withstand such conditions. Stress, particularly stress caused by increased sunlight, leads to the production of reactive oxygen species that cause photo-oxidative cell damage(2). Carotenoids, which are present in the membranes of all photosynthetic organisms, help protect against such light-dependent oxidative damage(3). In plants, the xanthophyll cycle (the reversible interconversion of two carotenoids, violaxanthin and zeaxanthin(4)) has a key photoprotective role(5) and is therefore a promising target for genetic engineering to enhance stress tolerance. Here we show that in Arabidopsis thaliana overexpression of the chyB gene that encodes beta-carotene hydroxylase-an enzyme in the zeaxanthin biosynthetic pathway(6)-causes a specific twofold increase in the size of the xanthophyll cycle pool. The plants are more tolerant to conditions of high light and high temperature, as shown by reduced leaf necrosis, reduced production of the stress indicator anthocyanin and reduced lipid peroxidation. Stress protection is probably due to the function of zeaxanthin in preventing oxidative damage of membranes.

AB  - For successful survival and reproduction in various environmental conditions, over the course of evolution, plants have formed a complex of regulatory mechanisms that control their development depending on environmental changes. The transition of plants to sexual reproduction is an important stage in their life cycle, and depending on the growing conditions, different groups of plants choose optimal periods to induce this development program. The initiation of flowering in angiosperms is controlled by a series of complex regulatory pathways that integrate information from the environment, primarily temperature and photoperiod, which are indicators of the changing seasons and thus signals for starting the flowering program. In Arabidopsis thaliana, one of the key regulators of flowering is the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) protein, a florigen, whose homologs have been found in other angiosperms. This review considers molecular mechanisms of flowering regulation with the participation of FT-like proteins in different plant groups, as well as the role of these proteins in other developmental processes. Particular attention is paid to the evolutionary changes that occurred in FT-like genes during adaptation to certain environmental conditions, as well as during plant breeding.

AB  - Generating power at night has recently stimulated interest in using the radiative cooling mechanism with thermoelectric generators (TEGs). These low temperature and passive devices have been shown to generate electricity at night with no active input of heat needed. Here, we optimize both the geometry and operating conditions of radiative cooling driven thermoelectric (RC-TE) generators. We determine the optimal operating conditions, including the maximum power point and maximum efficiency point, by developing a combined thermal and electrical model. Our results show that the optimal operating condition results in larger power output than was previously expected. Moreover, we show that maximum power density occurs when the area ratio between the cooler and P or N element reaches an optimal value and can be improved to nearly 2.2 times larger than what has been achieved with commercial TEGs. Finally, we perform a parametric study that takes account of environmental and structural parameters to improve the performance of the RC-TE device, including enhancing heat transfer between the hot surface and ambient air, suppressing the cooling loss of the radiative cooler, and optimizing the geometry of individual thermocouples. In summary, our work identifies how to maximize the output of RC-TE devices, providing universal guidance for this passive power generation method.

AB  - We propose a pavement block piezoelectric energy harvester (PBPEH) that can be installed in an actual walkway. We developed an Internet of Things (IoT) system that can power the walkway signal indicator (delineator) and also collect environmental data (such as humidity and temperature) near the walkway utilizing the PBPEH, without a battery. A highly integrated module with 24 piezoelectric devices were fixed inside the PBPEH. Under maximum weight condition, that is, in case of a person weighing 100 kg passing over the module, an output voltage of 38.52 V-max, current of 3.85 mA(max), and power of 148.3 mW(max) (3.7 W/m(2)) were generated at a load resistance of 10 k Omega. Energy storage test as applied to realistic conditions, that is, when a 60 kg person (average weight condition) passes over the module 10 times it charged a capacitor (1000 mu F) to 55.6 mJ. As a result, it successfully turned on a delineator installed on an actual walkway after 4.8 s and powered the IoT sensor system without an external energy source.

AB  - The Azores, a North Atlantic archipelago, has 14 known ant species. Although some earlier researchers have regarded all ants in the Azores to be exotic, we believe several are native (i.e., predating human arrival). Five ant species found in relatively undisturbed environments and not widely distributed beyond the Azores, neighboring Madeira, and the Mediterranean, we judge to be native to the Azores: Hypoponera eduardi, Lasius grandis, Leptothorax unifasciatus, Monomorium carbonarium, and Plagiolepis schmitzii. In addition, Tetramorium caespitum, though widely distributed, shows variation within the Azores that suggests it is native. Six ant species found only in highly disturbed environments in the Azores and distributed around the world through human commerce, we consider exotic: Hypoponera punctatissima, Linepithema humile, Paratrechina longicornis, Pheidole megacephala, Tetramorium bicarinatum, and Tetramorium caldarium. In addition, Solenopsis (Diplorhoptrum) sp. of unknown taxonomic status, and Aphaenogaster senilis, which is not widely distributed, were restricted to disturbed sites and appear to be exotic.
   Five of the six native ant species (all except P. schmitzii), but only two of the eight exotic species (A. senilis and L. humile) are common and widespread in the Azores. The Argentine ant, L. humile, is the only exotic ant species that appears to have some impact on native species, but it was abundant only in scattered urban and agricultural areas. Three ant species that are important tropical pests, P. longicornis, P. megacephala, and T. bicarinatum, all have their highest latitude populations in the Azores, probably a reflection of the relatively mild climate due to the warming influence of the Gulf Stream.
   Relatively natural areas in the Azores have low ant species richness, but usually all the ants present are native. Urban sites often have higher ant species richness due to the presence of both native and exotic species. Thus, the total ant species richness is not a useful indicator of habitat integrity. The presence of exotic ant species, however, is an excellent indicator of disturbance.
   Twelve of the 14 recorded ant species (all except A. senilis and T. caespitum) in the Azores also occur in Madeira. The Azores have far fewer ant species than Madeira (27 species), no doubt related to the Azores' younger age, higher latitude, and greater distance from continental source populations.

AB  - Biomarkers, the measurable indicators of biological conditions, are fast becoming a popular approach in providing information to track disease processes that could lead to novel therapeutic interventions for chronic conditions. Inherited, chronic kidney disease affects millions of people worldwide and although pharmacological treatments exist for some conditions, there are still patients whose only option is kidney dialysis and kidney transplantation. In the past 10 years, certain chronic kidney diseases have been reclassified as ciliopathies. Cilia in the kidney are antenna-like, sensory organelles that are required for signal transduction. One of the signalling pathways that requires the primary cilium in the kidney is Wnt signalling and it has three components such as canonical Wnt, non-canonical Wnt/planar cell olarity (PCP) and non-canonical Wnt/Ca2+ signalling. Identification of the novel role of ATM INteractor (ATMIN) as an effector molecule in the non-canonical Wnt/PCP pathway has intrigued us to investigate its potential role in chronic kidney disease. ATMIN could thus be an important biomarker in disease prognosis and treatment that might lighten the burden of chronic kidney disease and also affect on its progression.

AB  - Soil degradation, most notably caused by salinization and water-logging, creates formidable problems in arid and semi-arid environments. Advancing our knowledge of salt-affected soils is a prerequisite for understanding how salinization affects environmental concerns, such as soil erosion, nutrient leaching, and lack of vegetation cover. Therefore this study investigated the impact of salt diapirs on soil physicochemical conditions, as well as explored the relationship between halophytic vegetation and soil factors, and described the composition and distribution of plant species in relationship to soil salinity. The study area was divided into three units based on different geomorphologic conditions, slopes and vegetation type. Changes in salinity, soil properties and vegetation were studied. Results showed that the proportion of clay increased while silt and sand decreased with increasing distance from salt diapirs. The presence and kind of ions in all samples consistently indicated high levels of Na, and moderate levels of Mg, Ca, and K. Based on the soil conditions, plant covers were changed to types with more resistance to salinity and water-logging. Typically, this results in a decrease in soil structure stability through degradation of soil aggregates and a variation in the composition of the vegetation toward undesirable species.

AB  - Isolated ponds provide vital habitat for an array of vertebrates and invertebrates. Given the potential decline in protection of isolated ponds and the increase in urbanization in northeastern North America, knowledge of the condition of this aquatic resource is essential for developing revisions to existing regulations, conservation efforts, and restoration initiatives. We were interested in the ability of rapid assessment methods, which require only one site visit, to estimate the condition of isolated ponds. During 2008, we conducted dip-net surveys at 10-day intervals from mid-May to late July 2008 at each of 36 isolated ponds in Rhode Island. We calculated detection probabilities for larval amphibian species and predatory macroinvertebrate families and assessed factors influencing detection probabilities. Most taxa displayed distinct seasonal phenologies in detection probabilities. Pond depth and vegetative characteristics also influenced detection probabilities of many taxa. Based on seasonal variation in detection probabilities, rapid assessment methods would not be effective to monitor overall biodiversity of isolated ponds in southern New England. Rather, multiple visits would be required to estimate occupancy rates of pond-breeding amphibians or aquatic macroinvertebrates if they were used as ecological indicators of pond condition.

AB  - To address issues of security, efficiency and cost in mining operations, the concept of mining environment regeneration (MER) is proposed. Mining environment regeneration is defined as improving the orebody occurrence conditions via geotechnical engineering techniques and providing safe mining conditions for workers and equipment. Therefore, artificial reconstruction bodies such as preconditioned roofs and pillars play a significant role in stope stability. Given the initial stress states and blasting dynamic disturbances, an artificial reconstruction body numerical model is established using the explicit dynamic software ANSYS/LS-DYNA. An implicit and explicit conversion technique is used to investigate the dynamic response process of a preconditioned roof (PR) under a combined static and dynamic loading condition. The peak particle velocity (PPV), peak pressure and strain energy density (SED) of key points are selected as the technical analysis indicators, and the dynamic responses in the PR are obtained. An industrial experiment is performed in an underground mine based on the numerical results. By combining on-site blasting vibration-monitored data and numerical simulation results, we provide reasonable guidance in practical mining production.

AB  - Wastewater reclamation will be a significant part of future water management and the environmental assessment of various treatment systems to reuse wastewater has become an important research field. The secondary treatment process and sludge handling on-site are, especially, electricity demanding processes due to aeration, pumping, mixing, dewatering, etc. used for operation and are being identified as the main contributor for many environmental impacts. This study discusses how the environmental performance of reuse treatment systems may be influenced by surrounding conditions. This article illustrates and discusses the importance of factors commonly treated as externalities and as such not being included in optimization strategies of reuse systems, but that are necessary to environmentally assess wastewater reclamation systems. This is illustrated by two up-stream and downstream processes; electricity supply and the use of sludge as fertilizer commonly practiced in regions considered for wastewater reclamation. The study shows that external conditions can have a larger impact on the overall environmental performance of reuse treatment systems than internal optimizations could compensate for. These results imply that a more holistic environmental assessment of reuse schemes could provide less environmental impacts as externalities could be included in measures to reduce the overall impacts.

KW  - FRAMEWORK
AB  - In the Klamath River Basin (KRB) of northern California and southern Oregon, climate-related changes, such as more intense droughts, varied and concentrated precipitation, earlier spring and later fall conditions, extreme temperatures, and decreased snowpack have contributed to increasingly unpredictable plant reproduction and harvest cycles. In this study, we explore contemporary relationships between plants and Indigenous People in the KRB, identifying benefits of cultural ecosystem services (CES) derived from Indigenous stewarding and gathering of culturally significant plants, and discuss how these services may change based on climate change observations and experiences. This study contributes to the conceptualization of Indigenous Cultural Ecosystem Services (ICES), providing a framework for the incorporation of Indigenous concepts, approaches, and perspectives into assessments of ecosystem services (ES) and, particularly, CES. It highlights the value of Indigenous perspectives and observations of climate change effects on plant reproduction and productivity, as well as their contribution to cultural ecosystem resilience and adaptation under changing climate conditions. We propose that incorporating Indigenous concepts and approaches to assessing CES and ES could lead to more holistic management decisions and better-informed climate adaptation initiatives with greater ES for all.

AB  - Two-photon imaging is a major recording technique used in neuroscience. However, it suffers from several limitations, including a low sampling rate, the nonlinearity of calcium responses, the slow dynamics of calcium dyes and a low SNR, all of which severely limit the potential of two-photon imaging to elucidate neuronal dynamics with high temporal resolution. We developed a hyperacuity algorithm (HA_time) based on an approach that combines a generative model and machine learning to improve spike detection and the precision of spike time inference. Bayesian inference was performed to estimate the calcium spike model, assuming constant spike shape and size. A support vector machine using this information and a jittering method maximizing the likelihood of estimated spike times enhanced spike time estimation precision approximately fourfold (range, 2-7; mean, 3.5-4.0; 2SEM, 0.1-0.25) compared to the sampling interval. Benchmark scores of HA_time for biological data from three different brain regions were among the best of the benchmark algorithms. Simulation of broader data conditions indicated that our algorithm performed better than others with high firing rate conditions. Furthermore, HA_time exhibited comparable performance for conditions with and without ground truths. Thus HA_time is a useful tool for spike reconstruction from two-photon imaging.

AB  - The exponential growth of off-shore mariculture that has occurred worldwide over the last 10 years has raised concern about the impact of the waste produced by this industry on the ecological integrity of the sea bottom. Investigations into this potential source of impact on the biochemistry of the sea floor have provided contrasting results, and no compelling explanations for these discrepancies have been provided to date. To quantify the impact of fish-farm activities on the biochemistry of sediments, we have investigated the quantity and biochemical composition of sediment organic matter in four different regions in the temperate-warm Mediterranean Sea: Akrotiri Bay (Cyprus), Sounion Bay (Greece), Pachino Bay (Italy), and the Gulf of Alicante (Spain). In these four study regions, the concentrations of phytopigments, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids in the sediments were measured, comparing locations receiving wastes from fish farms to control locations in two different habitats: seagrass beds and soft nonvegetated substrates. Downward fluxes were also measured in all of the regions, up to 200 m from the fish farms, to assess the potential spatial extent of the impact. In all four regions, with the exception of seagrass sediments in Spain, the biochemistry of the sediments showed significant differences between the control and fish-farm locations. However, the variables explaining the differences observed varied among the regions and between habitats, suggesting idiosyncratic effects of fish-farm waste on the biochemistry of sediments. These are possibly related to differences in the local physicochemical variables that could explain a significant proportion of the differences seen between the control and fish-farm locations. Biodeposition derived from the fish farms decreased with increasing distance from the fish-farm cages, but with different patterns in the four regions. Our results indicate that quantitative and qualitative changes in the organic loads of the sediments that arise from intensive aquaculture are dependent upon the ecological context and are not predictable only on the basis of fish-farm attributes and hydrodynamic regimes. Therefore, the siting of fish farms should only be allowed after a case-by-case assessment of the ecological context of the region, especially in terms of the organic matter load and its biochemical composition.

AB  - Despite its influence on wind energy service life, condition-based maintenance is still challenging to perform. For offshore wind farms, which are placed in harsh and remote environments, damage detection is critically important to schedule maintenance tasks and reduce operation and maintenance costs. One critical component to be monitored on a wind turbine is the pitch bearing, which can operate at low speed and high loads. Classical methods and features for general purpose bearings cannot be applied effectively to wind turbine pitch bearings owing to their specific operating conditions (high loads and non-constant very low speed with changing direction). Thus, damage detection of wind turbine pitch bearings is currently a challenge. In this study, entropy indicators are proposed as an alternative to classical bearing analysis. For this purpose, spectral and permutation entropy are combined to analyze a raw vibration signal from a low-speed bearing in several scenarios. The results indicate that entropy values change according to different types of damage on bearings, and the sensitivity of the entropy types differs among them. The study offers some important insights into the use of entropy indicators for feature extraction and it lays the foundation for future bearing prognosis methods.

AB  - In silviculture, the characteristics of growth of seedlings in relation to light conditions are an important indicator of the success of natural regeneration. The paper shows the growth characteristics of one-year-old Hungarian oak seedlings in full light conditions in a field experiment conducted in 2016 in the nursery of the Faculty of Forestry in Belgrade. Four hundred seedlings were analyzed and classified according to the number of shoot growth flushes into three growth types: one-flush growth, two-flush growth and three-flush growth type. Within the analyzed four hundred seedlings, 39.8% belonged to the one-flush growth type, 58.2% to the two-flush growth type, and only 2.0% of the seedlings to the three-flush growth type. The one-flush growth seedlings have less leaves and lower values of height, root collar diameter and total leaf area, but they are characterized by a higher mean height of the primary axis (the height of the first growth flush), compared to the multi-flush growth seedlings. This is pointing out to different growth characteristics in the initial stage of development and during the growing season between different types of seedlings.

AB  - Frequency domain spectroscopy is a potential tool for non-invasive condition assessment of oil-paper insulation in power equipment. On the other hand, it is well known that the results of frequency domain spectroscopy are affected predominantly by temperature. Moreover, the voltage used for frequency domain spectroscopy is sinusoidal is nature. But the actual insulation system at site is stressed by voltage that may deviate significantly from sinusoid during operation. Considering these two aforesaid facts, in this paper, the response of oil-paper insulation has been studied at different temperatures using both sinusoidal as well as non-sinusoidal excitation. An experimental sample has been prepared in the laboratory that emulates the composite insulation of oil immersed type power transformer at site. The results of frequency response using sinusoidal voltage waveform at different temperature show good agreement with the conventional results that validates the scheme of the experimental setup. Some more information is obtained from the response of non-sinusoidal excitation that could help to get a better interpretation of the actual physical condition of oil-paper composite insulation.

AB  - One of the most effective techniques for evaluating stress is the analysis of developmental stability, measured by stochastic variation based particularly on fluctuating asymmetry, i.e. a variance in random deviations from perfect bilateral symmetry. However, the application of morphological methods is only possible when an organism lives under testing conditions during a significant part of its ontogenesis. Contrary to morphological characters, behavior can change very fast. Consequently, methods based on behavioural characters may have advantages over more traditional approaches. In this study we describe the technique of assessing stochastic variation, using not morphological, but behavioural characters. To measure stochastic variation of behavioural response, we assessed the stability of the isolation reaction of blue mussel Mytilus edulis at regular changes of salinity. With increasing temperature from +12 degrees C to +20 degrees C stochastic variation of the isolation reaction increased, which is a common response to change of environmental conditions. In this way, we have developed a method of assessing stochastic variation of behavioural response in molluscs. This method may find a great range of applications, because its usage does not require keeping animals in tested conditions for a long time.

TI  - Exergy Investigation of R410A as a 'Drop In' Refrigerant in a Water-Cooled Mechanical Vapor Compression Cycle
T2  - HEAT TRANSFER ENGINEERING
LA  - English
KW  - COMPACT HEAT-EXCHANGERS
AB  - The urge to replace hydrofluorocarbons which possess high global warming potentials has taken center stage in the air conditioning industry due to both international and local policies such as the Kigali Amendment and Japan's revised Fluorinated Gas law. This has prompted the exploration of novel refrigerants as well as their mixtures to create high performance environmentally friendly alternatives. These refrigerants can be integrated into existing systems as 'drop in' refrigerants, which provide a simpler and low cost substitution process to replace environmentally harmful refrigerants such as R410a. R410a is currently a widely used refrigerant in air conditioning systems, but is to be phased out of use under the Kigali Amendment by the late 2040s. Thus to compare the suitability of replacing this refrigerant with environmentally friendly 'drop in' alternatives, a preliminary baseline investigation on a mechanical vapor compression chiller with R410a is conducted via performance and exergy indicators. The testing procedure utilized Air Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Standard 551/591 which revealed an optimum charge amount of 0.70 kg with a peak performance near 88% of full capacity. The heat exchanger overall heat transfer coefficients showed varying trends, whilst the exergy destruction was as expected highest for the compressor.

AB  - Independence screening is powerful for variable selection when the number of variables is massive. Commonly used independence screening methods are based on marginal correlations or its variants. When some prior knowledge on a certain important set of variables is available, a natural assessment on the relative importance of the other predictors is their conditional contributions to the response given the known set of variables. This results in conditional sure independence screening (CSIS). CSIS produces a rich family of alternative screening methods by different choices of the conditioning set and can help reduce the number of false positive and false negative selections when covariates are highly correlated. This article proposes and studies CSIS in generalized linear models. We give conditions under which sure screening is possible and derive an upper bound on the number of selected variables. We also spell out the situation under which CSIS yields model selection consistency and the properties of CSIS when a data-driven conditioning set is used. Moreover, we provide two data-driven methods to select the thresholding parameter of conditional screening. The utility of the procedure is illustrated by simulation studies and analysis of two real datasets. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.

AB  - Sugar cane is a crop which generates large amounts of biomass and a juice rich in high-value natural molecules. After extracting sugar from the juice, the recovering of various compounds such as organic acids contained in molasses could contribute to increase the competivity of the sugar industry. Therefore, according to the biorefinery approach, we propose to study the chemical conversion of one of these acids, the aconitic acid, by esterification reactions. A new series of aconitate esters have been synthesized by combining aconitic acid and alcohols from natural origin. The effects of experimental conditions have been investigated and have shown that the type of catalysis has a significant effect on the selectivity. Kinectics have thus been performed to determine the best conditions to synthetize enriched compositions in esters. Homogeneous catalysis generates the highest yield in triester. Heterogeneous catalysis (macroporous resins) is prefered for the production of monoesters while catalysis assisted by ionic liquid is adapted to prepare mainly diesters. Green indicators have been discussed according to the calculations performed. The resulting polyfunctional esters are totally biosourced molecules and have a great potential as bioproducts for different applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We evaluated a potential index for quantifying wetland floristic quality, based on the Floristic Quality Assessment Index (FQAI) developed and tested in other regions of the United States. Principal reasons for this study were 1) FQAI is based on plant species' coefficients of conservatism, which are unavailable for most of the world and 2) FQAI value calculation mathematically neglects exotic (nonnative) species. The index that we evaluated, termed the Floristic Assessment Quotient for Wetlands (FAQWet), incorporated components of total species richness, wetland affinity of species present, and the contribution of native versus exotic species to wetland vegetation quality. Thus, this index incorporated factors demonstrated to be influenced by the degree of human activity on the landscape while including both native and non-native plant species, and it used information that is readily available for most plant species encountered in wetlands of the United States. Adequacy of this index at representing perceived human influence on wetlands was evaluated by sampling vascular plant assemblages in 53 wetlands across northern Mississippi, USA. Correlation of FAQWet scores with semi-quantitative disturbance indicators suggested that FAQWet Index calculations weighted by proportion and frequency of native species performed best overall and were comparable with the currently used FQAI, although all indices displayed low correlation with indices of human activity. Analyses of individual components of the disturbance index, along with information on hydrogeomorphology and hydrologic alteration, helped account for some unexplained variation in the relationship between floristic quality and disturbance. For example, there were more exotic species and a lower overall degree of wetland affinity in vegetation of depressional wetlands than in lake fringe and riverine wetlands. The most important benefits of the FAQWet index in these studies were a lack of correlation with total plant species richness (unlike the FQAI), a stronger correlation with non-native species richness than was the case with the FQAI, and the ease of obtaining wetland indicator status and nativity status for FAQWet calculations. Results also highlighted the potential danger of ignoring exotic species in floristic assessments because of the relatively strong correlations of non-native species richness with human activity, hydrologic impairment, and floristic index scores.

AB  - Within the ecological assessment of running waters based on benthic macroinvertebrates different levels of taxonomic resolution (species, genus, family and higher) are in use. Although assessment systems are often developed with detailed data on species level, water managers and other end-users could like to use data on higher taxonomic levels to assess the ecological quality of a water body because of limited human or money resources. The question that arises is, if an assessment system built with species level data is also applicable using data with a higher taxonomic resolution.
   Within the AQEM project a multimetric assessment system was developed to evaluate the ecological quality classes (from bad (1) to high (5) ecological quality) of different stream types throughout Europe. The present study focuses on the question whether the resulting water quality class changes using the AQEM Assessment Software (AAS) with different taxonomic resolutions and if yes, how large the deviations of ecological quality classes from the original classes are and if the deviations are unidirectional. For analyses data from four Austrian and two Dutch stream types were used.
   It is demonstrated that the assignment of a site to an ecological quality class may change if different taxonomic levels are used. Deviations in both directions (higher/lower ecological quality class) were observed. In most cases the divergence was only one ecological quality class, but also larger deviations occasionally occurred. The causes of changes in the assessment were investigated by separately looking into the underlying metrics of the multimetric system. Some of the evaluated metrics rely on autecological information on species level and are simply not applicable on higher taxonomic levels. Other metrics worked on higher taxonomic levels as well and showed more or less good distinctions between ecological quality classes.
   It is concluded that the AQEM Assessment Software is not applicable if data on higher taxonomic levels are used. As the deviations were not unidirectional and ranged from one to three ecological quality classes, it is not possible to include a correction factor for using the software with higher taxonomic resolution data.

AB  - The present study aimed to characterize the dynamics of NDVI and meteorological conditions, relating both to the annual dynamics of biomass accumulation in natural pastures of the Pampa biome as a way of subsidizing growth modeling. Forage accumulation rate data from a long-term experiment, NDVI data from the MODIS images, and meteorological data measured at the surface were used. We verify that the agrometeorological element associated to the accumulation of forage in the natural grasslands is different according to the season, which is typical of the subtropical climate, Winter is the critical season for livestock production due to the lower forage accumulation rate and lower values of NDVI, conditioned by the decrease of solar radiation and air temperature. In the summer, the limiting factor to forage accumulation is the hydric condition, It was also verified that the variability in the growth of grasslands can be associated with the ENSO phenomenon, being the El Nino favorable and the La Nina unfavorable, especially in the spring-summer period. Considering the verified associations, spectral indices combined with agrorneteorological elements are recommended to the adjustment of models of forage accumulation in the Pampa biome natural grasslands.

AB  - Samples of early Miocene Muara Wahau coal from three drill cores were investigated with respect to maceral composition. Huminite macerals are dominant in the coal, ranging from 73.3 to 88.0% (vol.) with an average value of 77.4% (vol.). Liptinite macerals account for lower amount, from 0.7 to 6.7 with an average value of 1.8% (vol.). Inertinite macerals vary from 4.3 to 34.0% (vol.), averaging at 15.3% (vol.). Some paleoenvironmental indices based on the maceral composition were determined. Groundwater index (GWI) and vegetation index (VI) were considered as indicators for hydrological regime and type of peat vegetation. Tissue preservation index (TPI) and gelification index (GI) were determined to indicate the degree of preservation and relative wetness of the peat forming conditions. The VI-GWI diagram suggest that the coal was developed from herbaceous plants in ombrotrophic type of peat. TPI-GI diagram shows that the preservation was low and the peat was relatively wet or limnic. However, ombrotrophic peat type have commonly been related to relatively drier or telmatic environments. It is therefore, interpreted that the limnic condition could occur in ombrotrophic peat type, as the water level was rising up during the development of a high moor peat.

AB  - Alternative laying hen rearing systems have been rapidly introduced into poultry production in an effort to harmonise poultry health and welfare with consumer, producer, industry and environmental demands. They are an integral part of modern egg production. Husbandry systems for keeping laying hens have an impact on, inter alia, the chemical composition of eggs. The subject matter of this study is a comparative review of the results obtained by different authors on the effect of rearing system on chemical composition ( proteins, lipids, cholesterol, vitamins and fatty acids content) and hygienic conditions of eggs from different rearing systems of laying hens. Eggs from these laying hen rearing systems have been proven by a large body of literature data to have better nutritional properties. Moreover, the results analysed also indicate differences within rearing systems. Rearing systems also have an influence on hygienic and microbiological quality of eggs. In view of the above, this comparable overview of the literature on the use of different rearing systems in table egg production can serve as a tool in determining the future direction of research as well as an indicator of its practical application.

AB  - The occurrence and distribution of dinoflagellate cysts in surface sediments from the Laptev Sea shelf and the adjacent continental margin have been studied in relation to surface water conditions. Assemblages were interpreted by visual inspection and Q-mode factor analysis. The inner Laptev shelf is a type-area for polar environments because of the near absence of relatively warm waters from the Pacific or Atlantic oceans and an extensive seasonal sea-ice cover. Assemblages are of low diversity and are dominated by the cold water taxon Islandinium minutum and related morphotypes. The common occurrence of distinctive polykrikoid cyst morphotypes is an indicator of polar environments. Furthermore, a strong supply of fresh water in summer influences the surface water conditions, and is a major factor controlling the occurrence and distribution of dinoflagellate cysts. The dinoflagellate cysts Nematosphaeropsis labyrinthus and Operculodinium centrocarpum are restricted to the continental margin, suggesting a relation to the inflow of relatively warm Atlantic waters along the Eurasian continental margin. An abundance maximum of Brigantedinium spp. at the shelf break is related to the mean position of the marginal ice zone. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Through the last millennium, Patagonia has been affected by changing climate conditions and successive volcanic eruptions. Lake Toncek is a high-altitude lake in the Southern Volcanic Zone in the northern Patagonian Andes. We documented the responses of the subfossil chironomid community to the effects of successive volcanic and different conditions in a sedimentary sequence from this lake comprising the last 900 years. The community composition and structure (abundance, diversity, and richness) and the development of morphological anomalies in the chironomid mouthparts were evaluated throughout the core. Both climatic conditions and volcanism affected the chironomid community differentially. The chironomid community changed following short-term climate change patterns, being affecting not only by temperature changes but also by variations in the regional precipitation regime. Decreases in abundance and diversity were only observed in coarse volcanic layers. In these samples, we recorded a high percentage of damaged chironomid mouthparts caused by mechanical wear, breakage or abrasion, possibly due to the increase of mineral particles. Our results represent important baseline data about the responses of chironomid communities to environmental disturbances in high-altitude lakes over long time frames.

AB  - The landscapes of a territory are the consequence of its history; overlapped geological, vegetable and cultural histories usually exist on a landscape. At the Mediterranean domain, however, a translucent vegetation exists, and its history is closely related to the geologic and cultural histories, because low-technology agricultural uses on a different hardness rock background control vegetation. Thus, in areas like the Guadalajara province, the geologic composition and the human activities can be considered the primary conditions for landscape configuration. Both condition the typologies, distribution and relative importance of the geotic, biotic and anthropogenic components of landscapes. A complex network of interrelations among all them exists but, in the base of which lie the geology of the territory, included relief, because it has a more independent influence since man cannot modify the geologic factors; such as the colour of the rocks, the size and distribution of rock bodies, the palaeogeographic domains and the tectonic structure all which control landscape development and configuration. Moreover, geology influences conditions and even limit, the presence, typologies and development of the biotic and anthropogenic elements. These factors also have a major relevance for environmental management, educational and economic policy, and, in some cases, for environmental impact assessment. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Anaerobically stabilized sewage sludge has potential to partially substitute synthetic fertilizers. The main risk with the recycling of urban sludge on agricultural soils is the accumulation of unwanted products, such as trace metals and organic micropollutants. In this context, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are particularly monitored because of their toxic properties at low concentrations and their high resistance to biological degradation. The aim of the present study was to optimize PAHs removal during anaerobic digestion of contaminated sewage sludge. Thirteen PAHs were monitored in laboratory-scale anaerobic bioreactors under mesophilic (35degreesC) and thermophilic (55degreesC) methanogenic conditions. Abiotic losses were statistically significant for the lightest PAHs, such as fluorene, phenanthrene and anthracene. It was shown that PAH removal was due to a specific biological activity. Biological PAHs removal was significantly enhanced by an increase of the temperature from 35degreesC to 55degreesC, especially for the heaviest PAHs. Bioaugmentation experiment was also performed by addition of a PAH-adapted bacterial consortium to a non-acclimated reactor. Significant enhancement of PAHs removal was observed. It was finally shown that PAH removal efficiencies and methanogenic performances were closely linked. The rate of biogas production may be used as an indicator of bacterial activity on PAH removal.

AB  - Reduced bull fertility imposes economic losses in bovine herds. Specifically, testicular and spermatic traits are important indicators of reproductive efficiency. Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genomic regions associated with these fertility traits. The aims of this study were as follows: 1) to perform a systematic review of GWAS results for spermatic and testicular traits in cattle and 2) to identify key functional candidate genes for these traits. The identification of functional candidate genes was performed using a systems biology approach, where genes shared between traits and studies were evaluated by a guilt by association gene prioritization (GUILDify and ToppGene software) in order to identify the best functional candidates. These candidate genes were integrated and analyzed in order to identify overlapping patterns among traits and breeds. Results showed that GWAS for testicular-related traits have been developed for beef breeds only, whereas the majority of GWAS for spermatic-related traits were conducted using dairy breeds. When comparing traits measured within the same study, the highest number of genes shared between different traits was observed, indicating a high impact of the population genetic structure and environmental effects. Several chromosomal regions were enriched for functional candidate genes associated with fertility traits. Moreover, multiple functional candidate genes were enriched for markers in a species-specific basis, taurine (Bos taurus) or indicine (Bos indicus). For the different candidate regions identified in the GWAS in the literature, functional candidate genes were detected as follows: B. Taurus chromosome X (BTX) (TEX11, IRAK, CDK16, ATP7A, ATRX, HDAC6, FMR1, L1CAM, MECP2, etc.), BTA17 (TRPV4 and DYNLL1), and BTA14 (MOS, FABP5, ZFPM2). These genes are responsible for regulating important metabolic pathways or biological processes associated with fertility, such as progression of spermatogenesis, control of ciliary activity, development of Sertoli cells, DNA integrity in spermatozoa, and homeostasis of testicular cells. This study represents the first systematic review on male fertility traits in cattle using a system biology approach to identify key candidate genes for these traits.

AB  - Land-use change, such as agricultural expansion and urbanization, can affect riverine biological diversity and ecosystem functioning. Identifying the major stressors associated with catchment land-use change is a prerequisite for devising successful river conservation and restoration strategies. Here, we analyzed land-use effects on the fatty acid (FA) composition and concentrations in suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM) along a fourth-order tropical river, the Rio das Mortes. Thereby, we aimed at testing the potential of fatty acids in riverine suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM-FAs) as indicators of land-use change in tropical catchments, and at identifying major human impacts on the biochemical composition of SPOM, which represents an important basal energy and organic matter resource for aquatic consumers. River water SPOM and total FA concentrations ranged between 2.8 and 10.2 mg dry weight (DW) L-1 and between 130.6 and 268.2 mu g DW L-1, respectively, in our study. Urbanization was the only land-use category correlating with both FA composition and concentrations, despite its low contribution to whole catchment (1.5-5.6%) and riparian buffer land cover (1.7-6.6%). Higher concentrations of saturated FM, especially C16:0 and C18:0, which are the main components of domestic sewage, were observed at sampling stations downstream of urban centers, and were highly correlated to urbanization, especially within the 60 m riparian buffer zone. Compared to water chemical characteristics (inorganic nutrients, dissolved oxygen, pH, and specific conductance) and river habitat structural integrity, FA variables exhibited a higher variability along the investigated river and were more strongly correlated to urban land use, suggesting that SPOM-FA profiles may be an efficient indicator of urban land-use impacts on larger tropical rivers. High total FA concentrations in the SPOM of urbanized tropical rivers may represent high-energy biochemical subsidies to food webs, potentially leading to changes in functional ecosystem characteristics, such as bacterial and suspension-feeder production.

AB  - Efforts to increase above- and below-ground biodiversity in farming systems require greater understanding of how farmers develop and use their knowledge of biodiversity, ecological processes and soil quality. The goal of this research was to assess the extent to which farmers have incorporated their observations of native species and ecological processes into farm management practices in a hillside agroforestry system of western Honduras. The system incorporates slash-and-mulch of native vegetation (rather than slash-and-burn cultivation, which was widely practiced in the area before 1990), and the retention of trees within cropping fields. Information on farmer knowledge was elicited primarily through semi-structured interviews with 20 farmers. Farmers interviewed distinguish several local soil types on the basis of soil texture, colour, structure and stone content, with each soil type having varying suitability for the major crops grown in the district (maize, beans, sorghum and pasture). The most highly valued tree species are those that fulfil multiple economic and agricultural functions, including having a positive influence on soil quality through decomposition, nutrient cycling, and provision of soil cover. In particular, species with small, fine leaves that gave dappled shade (rather than solid shade) and decomposed rapidly were preferred. Farmers named 16 commonly recognised, distinct soil macrofauna taxa. The most detailed knowledge on the relationship between soil fauna and soil quality was held on taxa considered to have either beneficial or harmful effects on farming activities, such as earthworms and beetle larvae. Farmers had complex understanding of the influence of fire on soils, vegetation, crop yield and soil biota over various lengths of time, which may have been gained through a combination of first-hand experience, interaction with agricultural extension workers, and information gained from other farmers. It is likely that local ecological knowledge of the effect of different species on soil quality, the interactions among species, and the role of vegetation in maintaining agricultural productivity and landscape integrity, is an important component of the adoption and success of the agroforestry system.

AB  - China is the largest worldwide producer of table grape, and table grape production has expanded throughout the country with technology advance. However, the vineyards in different regions show discrepant performance due to the multiple natural, locational, economic and technological conditions. This paper aims to develop a WebGIS-based suitability evaluation system for table grape production, and implement efficient and real-time assessment for grape production suitability. Firstly, different kinds of users' requirements were analyzed, base on which the function modules and the system architecture were designed. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was applied to make the suitability evaluation for the system and the suitability indicators concerning economic benefits, climate, location factors and soil conditions were established. Finally, the system was implemented and then applied in suitability evaluation in sampled areas of China. The system application showed the main functions of the system have been realized and the system can satisfy users' requirements. The evaluation results show that vineyards with high suitability of table grape production are distributed both in traditional grape planting areas and southern areas where used to be deemed unsuited for grape cultivation. The reasons may be that some areas in south China own superiority in economic conditions, location and the technology.

AB  - We evaluated the precision and accuracy of equations from the Australian Ruminant Feeding Standards (ARFS) and the Large Ruminant Nutrition System (LRNS) in predicting the performance of Ongole (Bos indicus) cattle under Indonesian conditions. A database was constructed using information from 121 cattle in five different pen-feeding experiments. Cattle included mature cows and growing bulls, and they were fed a range of diets commonly used by Indonesian farmers. We compared observed and predicted dry matter intake and daily liveweight gain. Model predictions were evaluated for precision and accuracy using mean bias, mean square prediction error and regression of observed against predicted values. Across all experiments, the LRNS provided the better estimates of intake and growth. While both models included animal age, sex, weight and body condition score, the LRNS provided better estimates of metabolisable energy requirements for maintenance of liveweight, feed quality and efficiency of energy utilisation. The LRNS model also better accounted for environmental conditions by including correction factors for minimum night temperature and relative humidity, in addition to average daily temperatures. Based on our results, the LRNS model appears suitable for use in Indonesian beef-production systems.

AB  - There have been no previous risk assessment studies on citrus pesticides in Spain. The aim of this work was to estimate the risks caused by worst-case drift scenarios of the principal pesticides used on the crop, assessing possible damage to the environment and human health. A field survey was carried out, characterizing the specific conditions of plant protection product applications to citrus crops in Spain. Six targets were identified as being the most affected by droplet spray drift in Spain, and more broadly in most Mediterranean conditions: aquatic organisms, earthworms, bees, adult bystanders, child bystanders and residents. Three drift estimation models were used to assess the amount of drift at specific distances downwind of a field in order to calculate Risk Indicators. These showed safe conditions for earthworms and residents, but also indicated that some pesticides may pose a risk to aquatic organisms, even with a 20 m buffer zone, and also to bees, and adult and child bystanders. In general, results generated similar consequences of hazard risk independent of the drift prediction model used, indicating that toxicological data are more relevant for predicting risks.

AB  - Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a common condition in women that is difficult to diagnose. Although heritability estimates have been published for some conditions potentially underlying pelvic pain, the heritability of CPP itself has never been investigated. Using data from 623 MZ and 377 DZ female twin pairs aged 29-50 from an Australian twin cohort, we found an increased CPP concordance among MZs compared to DZs, with tetrachoric correlations of 0.43 (95% CI: 0.26-0.58) and 0.11 (95% CI: -0.16-0.38), respectively. This corresponded to a heritability of 0.41 (95% CI: 0.25-0.56). Lack of correlations with environmental indicators suggested that violation of the equal environments assumption was not responsible for this effect. Multivariate Cholesky decomposition models incorporating CPP and significantly correlated phenotypes showed that the entire CPP heritability could be explained by genetic variance underlying endometriosis (38%), dysmenorrhoea (23%), fibroids (24%), and somatic distress (15%), the latter a possible indicator of increased nociception. CPP itself is unlikely to be a useful independent phenotype to conduct genetic aetiological studies; contributing conditions such as endometriosis and variation in nociception are likely to provide more useful phenotypes.

AB  - A Late Quaternary permafrost profile from the Labaz Lake area (Taymyr Peninsula, Central Siberia) has been investigated using analyses of diatoms, pollen, sedimentology and geochemistry. A sedimentation gap for the termination of the Pleistocene and the start of lacustrine sedimentation in the Boreal can be inferred. At that time shallow-lake conditions prevailed and a connection to the Labaz Lake is probable. The diatom data provide indications for the assessment of the Holocene environmental development of the study site in more detail. The most favourable climatic conditions and comparatively higher water level stands are inferred for the early Atlantic. Towards the end of this period the gradual transition to a wetland with poor-fen character took place. Within the Subboreal there was a short episode with mild climate conditions. At that time the last trees occurred in the Labaz Lake area and somewhat higher water level stands were likely. The Subatlantic climate deterioration led to further drying up of the wetland along with a lowering of water pH and permafrost aggradation. The transition from a locality with low-centre to one with high-centre polygons is still underway.

AB  - The adequacy of working conditions to safety standards has a fundamental importance in the company's environment. The efficient implementation of an Occupational Health and Safety Management System allows the reduction of risks associated with accidents; reduce costs to the employer and a strong ally in the competitive market when the safety indicator is a decisive factor in the choice of suppliers. The aim of this study was to evaluate occupational safety and health (OSH) practices at work in a plastic recycling plant located in northeastern Brazil, as well as to identify opportunities for improvement. Data collection was carried out from on-site visits and control measures were proposed for the risk factors identified. The evaluation made it possible to identify that the recycling activity is characterized by several occupational hazards, which are aggravated by inadequate working conditions. The non-conformity of jobs, the use of obsolete equipment and the lack of specific training to perform certain functions were identified as the most relevant aspects. For these, opportunities for improvement and adequation were connected. The study results can help other companies that perform the same activities to improve their performance in OSH based on the points of improvement presented.

AB  - Escherichia coli is an important pathogenic indicator in drinking water. Viable but non-culturable (VBNC) E. coli induced by low level chlorination was found to have higher antibiotic tolerance. The emerging of VBNC bacteria in drinking water systems is posing challenges to the control of bio-safety. It is necessary to study the underlying mechanisms of VBNC state E. coli under actual residual chlorine condition of drinking water pipe network. In this study, we investigated the changes of morphology and gene expressions that might present such state. The results indicated that the size of VBNC E. coli was not remarkably changed or recovered culturability under favorable environmental conditions. Results from transcriptomic analysis revealed that the regulated genes related to fimbrial-like adhesin protein, putative periplasmic pilin chaperone, regulators of the transcriptional regulation, antibiotic resistance genes and stress-induced genes, rendering VBNC cells more tolerant to adverse environmental conditions. In total of 16 genes were significantly up-regulated under the VBNC state, including three genes encoding toxic protein (ygeG, ibsD, shoB), indicating that VBNC E. coil was still a threat to human. The work is of great relevance in the context of better understanding this poorly understood physiological state.

AB  - This study assessed the paternal effects on the growth of early juvenile winter flounder Pseudopleuronectes americanus and examined the energy allocation strategy employed during this critical stage. Males from three different locations (Passamaquoddy Bay, Baie-des-Chaleurs and the St Lawrence Estuary) were crossed with females from the Baie-des-Chaleurs, and the growth characteristics of hybrids from settlement to 45 days post-settlement were monitored under similar culture conditions. Young juveniles displayed good growth rates (0.09 +/- 0.02 mm day(-1)), with no differences related to sire origin, in terms of growth indicators (length, width, RNA:DNA and triacylglycerol:sterol ratios), condition indices (Fulton's K, pigmentation and fin erosion) and biochemical components (nucleic acids, proteins and lipid classes). These results suggest the absence of a paternal contribution to the growth strategy during the early juvenile stage of P. americanus. The results also highlight the high energetic cost associated with metamorphosis: young juveniles mobilized most of their triacylglycerol reserves during the growth period following settlement.

AB  - Costly investments in storage and transport of onion bulbs makes it increasingly important to identify cultivars with the best chance of long-term storage. This paper discusses our own and other researchers' results and laboratory procedures on onion's pungency, soluble solids, dry matter, respiration rate, carbohydrates and catabolism-related enzymes under different storage conditions. The variability in parameters such as carbohydrate composition, pungency, soluble solids and soluble uronic acid concentration in water is growth dependent, and defines the quality of onion bulbs at harvest time. During storage, these parameters can be modified by environmental conditions, presence of pathogens or termination of dormancy. Under postharvest conditions, indicators of dormancy are usually measured as percentage of either root emergence or sprouting. Biochemical and physiological parameters such as decreases in sucrose levels and increases in (1) respiration rates, (2) exo hydrolase activity, and (3) bulb-softening enzyme rates (polygalacturonase poly methyl esterase) signal the end of dormancy. However, more research is needed on environmental and chemical factors that reduce the rate of bulb sprouting.

AB  - One of the main goals of marine spatial management is to promote a sustainable use of marine resources without putting biodiversity and habitats at risk.
   Environmental status assessments of benthic habitats have traditionally been conducted on soft bottom infauna communities. These communities represent only a limited part of the total diversity of seabed environments. Large and habitat forming organisms that are particularly vulnerable to physical disturbance of the seabed are in general associated with mixed or hard substrates. Together with mobile benthos these large organisms have been poorly mapped with the traditional approach. In accordance with a demand for information on all aspects of benthic habitats there is an increasing interest in a broader mapping approach for assessments of the distribution and status of benthos.
   This has led to an increased demand for a broader mapping approach for assessments of the distribution and status of benthos to include as many habitats as possible.
   We present mapping strategies based on literature together with perspectives from Norway's MAREANO Mapping Programme (www.mareano.no). A first and important step is to acquire high resolution topographical information from multibeam echosounder surveys. Building upon this baseline data set, video inspection along transects can provide information about how megafauna and surface sediments relate to local and broad scale topographical features. Classification of habitats/biotopes can be carried out through the analysis of the megafauna composition and its relation to environmental variables such as depth, quantitative terrain descriptors, and substrates. Marine landscapes have several definitions but generally refer to the major features delimiting broad-scale habitats. Each landscape will include different substrates that can be subdivided into smaller biotopes with specific fauna composition, functionality and production. For these habitats and biotopes information from all sampling gears can then be used to describe a more complete community composition.
   Experience from recent seafloor mapping indicates that a broad approach is required to support evidence-based policy and management of benthic species, communities and habitats. The approach presented can be used to identify biologically valuable areas and assess health status for bottom habitats/biotopes in a broad set of marine (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Phenanthrene, is one of the important polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which can be used as indicator for measuring PAHs and as a model molecule for studying PAHs biodegradation. During phenanthrene bioremediation bacterial species plays an important. In present work, a previously isolated PAHs-degrading bacterium, Pseudomonas stutzeri JP1, was used to investigate the phenanthrene degradation mechanism under low oxygen condition. RNA-sequencing was conducted for gene detections. The results indicated that methylcrotonoyl-CoA carboxylase gene and quinoprotein alcohol dehydrogenase genes of bacterium were up-regulated during the PAHs exposure. The results of RT-qPCR revealed that the genes encoding the quinoprotein alcohol dehydrogenase were 3.16-fold up-regulated. Further, two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and MALDI-TOF-TOF were used to study the proteins related to phenanthrene degradation. The results showed that expression of six proteins obviously increased upon phenanthrene induction. Quinoprotein alcohol dehydrogenase gene was involved in phenanthrene catabolism. The results correspond nicely to the RNA-Seq data. This work provided in-depth knowledge as well as technical support for bioremediation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons contamination via microbes in low oxygen environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, a method for evaluating the in-situ degradation of nitro polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (nitro-PAH) in sediments is presented. The methodology is adapted from the passive sampler technique, which commonly uses the dissipation rate of labeled compounds loaded in passive sampler devices to sense the environmental conditions of exposure. In the present study, polymeric passive samplers (made of polyethylene strips) loaded with a set of labeled polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and nitro-PAH were immersed in sediments (in field and laboratory conditions) to track the degradation processes. This approach is theoretically based on the fact that a degradation process induces a steeper concentration gradient of the labeled compounds in the surrounding sediment, thereby increasing their compound dissipation rates compared with their dissipation in abiotic conditions. Postulating that the degradation magnitude is the same for the labeled compounds loaded in polyethylene strips and for their native homologs that are potentially present in the sediment, the field degradation of 3 nitro-PAH (2-nitro-fluorene, 1-nitro-pyrene, 6-nitro-chrysene) was semi-quantitatively analyzed using the developed method.

AB  - A primitive equation finite element hydrodynamic model developed for the lagoon of Venice some years ago has been internally coupled with the Streeter-Phelps module of Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program (WASP). The coupled model (VELFEEM) has been applied for a first evaluation of the impact on water quality of the lagoon of Venice induced by a reduction in the exchange with the Adriatic Sea, which could be caused by the temporary closure of the inlets. Such closures have been proposed to prevent the flooding (acqua-alta) of the historical city occurring in winter time and would be obtained by specifically designed mobile gates (MOSE). Short-term simulations of biochemical oxygen-dissolved oxygen (BOD-DO) dynamics are performed under winter conditions, in both the presence and the absence of the mobile closure. Results suggest that the mobile closures do not significantly affect the water quality of the lagoon, even in the case of repeated closures, and that, in any case, the lagoon seems to be able to return rather easily to its unperturbed condition when the inlets are open again.

AB  - As a precautionary measure, the re-use (or landfill) of waste requires an environmental assessment of its potential impact. This assessment is usually made by simulating the emission of pollutants with a predictive model based on laboratory tests (standardised batch leaching tests, up-flow percolation tests, acid neutralisation capacity tests [CEN, Characterisation of Waste - Leaching - Compliance Test for Leaching of Granular Waste Materials and Sludges, European Committee for Standardisation (ECS), Brussels, 2002 [1]; CEN, prCEN/TS 14405 Characterisation of Waste - Leaching Behaviour Tests - Up-flow Percolation Test (under specified conditions), ECS, Brussels, 2002 [21; CEN, prCEN/TS 14429 Characterisation of Waste - Leaching Behaviour Test - Influence of pH on Leaching with Initial Acidibase Addition, ECS, Brussels, 2003 [3]]. These tests a-re performed with simpler conditions than those occurring in the scenario of re-use (saturated media, permanent inflow...).
   In order to evaluate the relevance of these tests to be considered as a reference for predictive model, the purpose of this work is to determine how the intermittent hydrodynamic flow influences the pollutants release of unsaturated waste. As a result, we could estimate whether this parameter should be introduced in the model. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The functioning of forested headwater streams is intimately linked to the decomposition of leaf litter by decomposers, mainly aquatic hyphomycetes, which enables the transfer of allochthonous carbon to higher trophic levels. Evaluation of this process is being increasingly used as an indicator of ecosystem health and ecological integrity. Yet, even though the individual impacts of contaminants and nutrient availability on decomposition have been well studied, the understanding of their combined effects remains limited. In the current study, we investigated whether the toxic effects of a reemerging contaminant, silver (Ag), on leaf litter decomposition could be partly overcome in situations where microorganisms were benefitting from high phosphorus (P) availability, the latter being a key chemical element that often limits detritus decomposition. We also investigated whether these interactive effects were mediated by changes in the structure of the aquatic hyphomycete community. To verify these hypotheses, leaf litter decomposition by a consortium of ten aquatic hyphomycete species was followed in a microcosm experiment combining five Ag contamination levels and three P concentrations. Indirect effects of Ag and P on the consumption of leaf litter by the detritivorous crustacean, Gammarus fossarum, were also evaluated. Ag significantly reduced decomposition but only at the highest concentration tested, independently of P level. By contrast, P and Ag interactively affected fungal biomass. Both P level and Ag concentrations shaped microbial communities without significantly affecting the overall species richness. Finally, the levels of P and Ag interacted significantly on G. fossarum feeding rates, high [Ag] reducing litter consumption and low P availability tending to intensify the feeding rate. Given the high level of contaminant needed to impair the decomposition process, it is unlikely that a direct effect of Ag on leaf litter decomposition could be observed in situ. However, subtle Ag effects in relation to nutrient levels in ecosystems could be expected. In particular, owing to higher consumption of low P leaf litter, shredding invertebrates could increase the ingestion of contaminated resources, which could, in turn, represent an important threat to headwater stream ecosystems.

AB  - Coral reefs are among the world's most productive and biologically diverse ecosystems. In recent decades, they have experienced an unparalleled decline resulting from various anthropogenically induced stressors. Ultraviolet (UV) filters found in personal care products, such as sunscreen, are chemical pollutants that are emerging as a growing toxic threat to reef organisms. In this study, a systematic literature review was conducted to (1) determine the current understanding of spatial distribution and the occurrence of UV filters exposed to the marine environment, (2) synthesize current ecotoxicological thresholds of relevant reef organisms under various UV-filter exposures, (3) identify research gaps related to both exposure and toxicity of UV filters in coral reef ecosystems. With gaps identified, a survey was developed and distributed to experts in the field representing academic, governmental, not-for-profit, and industry researchers in order to prioritize research gaps and inform future research efforts. The survey identified the need for better understanding of the impacts of co-stressors, long-term exposure, mixture, and degradation product exposure and realistic environmental conditions. Ultimately, this review will help guide priority research efforts to understand the risks of UV-filter exposure to coral reef ecosystems. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2021;00:1-15.

AB  - Based on actual land use in Yancheng city, this paper establishes the ecological security of the land index system from the perspectives of economy, society and ecological environment. Using the catastrophe theory and pressure-state-response (PSR) model, the purpose of the research was to judge the degree of land ecological security in Yancheng city from 2002 to 2011 and determine the requirements to ensure the sustainable development of this region. The results showed that over the ten years, the pressure, state, response and synthetic values of the land ecological security were evaluated as safe in 2003 and 2007 and at middle level in 2002 and for 2004 to 2006 and then dropped to insecure for 2008 to 2009 and very insecure for 2011 to 2012. The ecological security level and circumstance of land use in Yancheng city has generally declined. During this period, the land use pattern of Yancheng city was under tremendous pressure from the conflict between rapid urbanization and economic development, as well as conservation and rehabilitation of the eco-environment. This research shows that conditions for the land ecosystems of Yancheng city are not optimistic and, as such, should draw the attention of responsible government departments. Future policy options should aim to mitigate these problems through the control of population growth and the improvement to quality of life, protection of wetland and forest land, application of scientific concepts of development, coordination of economic development and land utility, and strengthening the control functions of land-use planning.

AB  - Freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea, a surrogate species in metal toxicity testing, is a promising bioindicator of impairment in aquatic ecosystems. Little is known, however, about the relationship between clam valve daily rhythmic response and metal bioavailability related to a metal biological early warning system (BEWS) design. The purpose of this study was to link biotic ligand model (BLM)-based bioavailability and valve daily rhythm in C. fluminea to design a biomonitoring system for online in situ detection of waterborne copper (Cu). We integrated the Hill-based dose-time-response function and the fitted daily rhythm function of valve closure into a constructed programmatic mechanism. The functional presentation of the present dynamic system was completely demonstrated by employing a LabVIEW graphic control program in a personal computer. We used site-specific effect concentration causing 10% of total valve closure response (EC10) as the detection threshold to implement the proposed C. fluminea-based Cu BEWS. Here our results show that the proposed C. fluminea-based BEWS could be deliberately synthesized to online in situ transmit rapidly the information on waterborne bioavailable Cu levels under various aquatic environmental conditions through monitoring the valve daily rhythmic changes. We suggested that the developed C. fluminea-based dynamic biomonitoring system could assist in developing technically defensible site-specific water quality criteria to promote more efficient uses in water resources for protection of species health in aquatic environments.

AB  - The environment is currently polluted by thousands of chemicals or xenobiotics introduced into the environment by man to meet the demands of the modern era. Every day we encounter this negative side of human civilization, but have done little to lessen the rate of pollution. Although the entire biosphere is polluted it is water resources that are the most polluted because water is the ultimate sink for many contaminants. Thus, fish are the most vulnerable of all animal species. They are helpless because they cannot avoid the polluted habitat and face this contamination by default. Nevertheless, fish are found to survive under extreme conditions when their natural habitat has been compromised to a great extent. However, fish are highly sensitive to small environmental changes and their populations gradually dwindle if pollution continues unabated. However, we know that there are instances when water is cleaned and the rate of repopulation by different fish species has gained momentum, restoring the ecological balance. Thus, fish are considered reliable bioindicators of water pollution and fish ecotoxicology has received much attention in recent years, and fish toxicology has been able to defend a significant position in the arena of xenobiotics research over the years. This review deals with some of the major intoxication and detoxication signals manifested by fish exposed to arsenic (As), which is presently one of the most worrying metalloids in water pollution.

AB  - Sedimentary diatom assemblages from three lakes in the Southeastern Swiss Alps were analysed at high temporal resolution since AD 1800. Altered land-use patterns, increasing population and exploitation through tourism are clearly reflected in annually laminated sediments of Lej da San Murezzan (Lake St Moritz) and Lej da Silvaplauna (Lake Silvaplana). Diatom assemblages originally dominated by Cyclotella taxa are replaced by taxa indicating higher total phosphorus (TP) concentrations, such as Asterionella formosa, Frogilaria crotonensis and Stephanodiscus parvus. In Lej da la Tscheppa, located well above the treeline in a catchment that was hardly exposed 10 human impact, Cyclotella comensis prevails throughout the entire sediment sequence. Quantitative estimates of past TP concentrations were inferred using a newly developed regional diatom-TP inference model based on 119 modern samples. In Lej da la Tscheppa diatoms imply stable, low TP concentrations (similar to 10 mu g/1), which can be considered as natural background concentration. Elevated TP levels are interred for Lej da San Murezzan (max. 60 mu g/1) since AD 1910 and for Lej da Silvaplauna (max. 40 mu g/1) Since AD 1950, corroborated by changes in sedimentary biogenic silica concentration and organic carbon content. Since similar to AD 1970 improved waste water management led to a considerable reduction in TP loading in Lej da Silvaplauna and Lej da San Murezzan.

AB  - Selection of receptors is a key element of ecological risk and natural resource damage assessments. The great horned owl (Bubo virginianus; GHO) has advantages as a tertiary terrestrial receptor and integrated measure of exposure to chemical residues in a multiple- lines- of- evidence approach that includes elucidation of contaminant exposure by measured (tissue-based) and predicted (dietary) methodologies, and population- level measures of potential adverse effects (i. e., productivity, abundance). Methods described herein exploited attributes of GHO behavior, including its propensity to nest in artificial nesting platforms. This approach allowed better control of experimental conditions, minimized uncertainty in assessment endpoints, and maximized data utility for testing hypotheses. During 5 years, 54 GHO nests (14 active territories) along 38 km of river floodplain were monitored at the Kalamazoo River Superfund Site ( Kalamazoo/ Allegan Counties, Michigan). Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and otho-, para- substituted isomers of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), including DDD/ DDE (Sigma DDTs), were measured in 24 eggs and 16 samples of nestling blood plasma. Dietary PCB exposure was predicted by determining site- specific dietary composition and sampling and quantifying PCB concentrations in 171 prey items collected within active GHO territories. The convergence of exposure and effects assessments improved confidence in resulting predictions of minimal risk to resident GHO populations (Hazard Quotients <= 1.5). Repeated GHO use of nesting platforms minimized temporal and spatial variability.

AB  - Nutrient inputs associated with coastal population growth threaten the integrity of coastal ecosystems around the globe. In order to assess the threat posed by rapid growth in tourism, we analyzed the nutrient concentrations as well as the delta(15) N of NO3- and macrophytes to detect wastewater nitrogen (N) at 6 locations along a groundwater-dominated coastal seagrass bed on the Caribbean coast of Mexico. We predicted that locations with greater coastal development would have higher concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and phosphorus (P), as well as delta(15) N of NO3- reflecting wastewater sources of N. However, concentrations of NO3- were not significantly different between developed (3.3 5.3 mu M NOD and undeveloped (1.1 +/- 0.7 mu M) marine embayments. The most important control on DIN concentration appeared to be mixing of fresh and salt water, with DIN concentrations negatively correlated with salinity. The delta N-15 of NO3- was elevated at an inland pond (7.0 +/- 0.42%.) and a hydrologically-connected tide pool (7.6 +/- 0.57 parts per thousand) approximately 1 km downstream of the pond. The elevated delta N-15 of NO3- at the pond was paralleled by high delta N-15 values of Cladophora sp., a ubiquitous green alga (10 +/- 1 parts per thousand). We hypothesize that inputs of nitrogen rich (NO3-> 30 mu M) groundwater, characterized by N-15 enriched signatures, flow through localized submarine groundwater discharges (SGD) and contribute to the elevated delta N-15 signatures observed in many benthic macrophytes. However, changes in nitrogen concentrations and isotope values over the salinity gradient suggest that other processes (e.g. denitri fi cation) could also be contributing to the N-15 enrichments observed in primary producers. More measurements are needed to determine the relative importance of nitrogen transformation processes as a source of N-15 to groundwaters; however, it is clear that continued inputs of anthropogenic N via SGD have the potential to severely impact ecologically and economically valuable seagrass meadows and coral reefs along the Caribbean coast of Mexico.

AB  - The ecological effects of a C12-13 linear alcohol ethoxylate (LAE) were studied in stream mesocosms. The surfactant has an average distribution of six and one-half ethylene oxide groups per mole of alcohol. Responses of periphyton, macrophytes, invertebrates, and fish were examined and used to estimate a mesocosm-predicted no-observable-effect concentration (NOEC). The stream mesocosm experiment consisted of a 2-week period of natural colonization, a 30-d treatment period, and a 2-week post-treatment period. Four surfactant concentrations in duplicate streams were used along with two untreated control streams. Surfactant concentrations were delivered to the streams with no apparent loss during the 17-min transit time. The structural integrity of the surfactant was also maintained with no observed differences between the head, middle, or tail sections of individual streams. Average measured concentrations of LAE for replicate streams were 0.32, 0.88, 1.99, and 5.15 mg/L. Periphyton and Myriophyllum aquaticum did not show significant effects. The no-observed-effect concentration (NOEC) for all periphyton and M. aquaticum parameters was 5.15 mg/L, the highest concentration tested. Statistically significant effects were observed on Simuliidae, Copepoda, and Cladocera densities during the treatment period in all exposure concentrations. Thus, the lowest-observed-effect concentration (LOEC) for invertebrate densities was 0.32 mg/L. Drifting invertebrates did not show significant LAE effects; however, increased numbers of invertebrates drifted in the 5.15-mg/L streams compared to controls. The 30-d LC50 for farm-raised and University-cultured fathead minnows was similar at 1.27 mg/L. The 30-d survival NOEC and LOEC for both populations of fish were 0.88 mg/L and 1.99 mg/L, respectively. There were no significant effects on reproduction in University-cultured fathead minnow. Fathead minnow reproductive behavior and feeding behavior were most susceptible to surfactant exposure with a NOEC of 0.32 mg/L. Bluegill sunfish survival responded similarly to the LAE as fathead minnow with a 30-d NOEC of 0.88 mg/L. No sublethal effects on juvenile bluegill growth were observed in this study. For primarily regulatory purposes, a ''mesocosm NOEC'' of 0.28 mg/L was derived for use in risk assessment.

AB  - Understanding the nature and extent of biological activity in soils is critical for characterizing transformation processes, such as those involved in nutrient cycles and pollutant biodegradation. Unlike monitoring chemical and hydrological parameters, the current methods for analyzing microbial processes typically rely on destructive sampling, thus limiting our understanding of biogeochemical dynamics under rapidly changing environmental parameters. Extracellular enzymes are excellent representatives of the soil micro-fauna's response to changing conditions. We hypothesized that it is possible to analyze the activity of free enzymes passing with the soil pore-water through a suction cup porous interface. Thus, specific enzymes activity in the soil pore-water can provide information on the biological activity in the soil and unsaturated zone in a simple, non-destructive, continuous manner. The current study examined free enzyme activity in pore-water samples, as obtained from a porous interface during soil column experiments, as compared to values measured directly from the soil. The results demonstrated a high correlation between the measured enzymatic activities of phosphatase, beta-glucosidase, and fluorescein diacetate (FDA) in the pore-water and the soil samples. Additionally, a preliminary implementation of the method was tested in ongoing remediation in a contaminated site. The results showed a strong correlation between the in-situ measurement of enzyme activity and the pollutant's biodegradation rate in the soil.

AB  - Deep-sea natural products have been created by unique marine organisms that thrive in a challenging environment of extreme conditions for its inhabitants. In this study, 179 deep-sea natural products isolated from 2009 to 2013 were investigated by analysing their physicochemical properties that are important indicators of the ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and Toxicity) profile of a compound. The study and analysis of these molecular descriptors and characteristics enabled the defining of these compounds in various chemical spaces, particularly as an indication of their drug-likeness and position in chemical space and is the first to be conducted to analyse deep-sea derived natural products. It was found that 40% of all deep-sea natural products were drug-like and 2/3 were within Known Drug Space (KDS), highlighting the high drug-likeness of a significant proportion of deep-sea natural products, most of which have already been shown to have notable biological activities, that should be further investigated as potential therapeutics. Furthermore, this study was able to reveal the general structural differences between compounds from Animalia, Bacteria and Fungi organisms where it was observed that natural products from members of the Animalia kingdom are structurally more varied than compounds from bacteria and fungi. It was also noted that, in general, fungi-derived compounds occupy a more favourable position in drug-like chemical space and are a rich and promising source of biologically-active natural products for the purposes of drug development and therapeutic application.

AB  - Heavy metal soil contamination provides a danger both to human and environmental ecosystem health and is still on the rise in many developing countries. Electroremediation provides an innovative method to remedy contamination of soils by heavy metals. Fundamental to the acceptance of any soil remedial technique is proof that positive benefits outweigh the negative impacts, in terms of soil health. The environmental effect of electroremediation of heavy metals contaminated soil by some biological indicators was evaluated. A soil contaminated with Zn, Pb, Ni, and Cd was used in a laboratory experiment. Treatment was imposed with a constant voltage gradient of 0.83 V/cm for 20 days. Results indicated that the physicochemical changes caused by the electroremidiation process on the soil microbial population (actinomycetes and gram-positive and negative bacteria), soil respiration and microbial biomass were significant (p < 0.01). At the commencement of the study, soil microbial activity was reduced, due to physicochemical changes in pH, amount of moisture and the changes in the levels of heavy metals in the soil. The greatest reduction on the microbial activity was close to the cathode where high levels of heavy metal concentrations and high pH were demonstrated. The metabolic quotient index [qCO(2)] was used to achieve a more refined evaluation, compared to analysis of soil respiration and microbial biomass alone. Accordingly, high amounts of qCO(2) near the cathode show the unfavorable living conditions of such microorganisms in these sections.

AB  - The impact of biodiversity loss on soil functions is well established via laboratory experiments that generally consider soil biota groups in isolation from each other, a condition rarely present in field soils. As a result, our knowledge about anthropogenic-induced changes in biodiversity and associated soil functions is limited. We quantified an array of soil biological constituents (plants, earthworms, nematodes, bacteria, and fungi) to explore their interactions and to characterize their influence on various soil functions (habitat for soil organisms, air and water regulation, and recycling of nutrients and organic waste) along a legacy Cu pollution gradient. Increasing Cu concentrations had a detrimental impact on both plant growth and species richness. Belowground soil biota showed similar responses, with their sensitivity to elevated Cu concentrations decreasing in the order: earthworms > bacteria > nematodes > fungi. The observed loss of soil biota adversely affected natural soil bioturbation, aggregate formation and stabilization, and decomposition and mineralization processes and therefore resulted in compacted soil with narrow pore size distributions and overall smaller pores, restricted air and water storage and flow, and impeded C, N, and P cycling. The simultaneous evolution of soil biodiversity and functions along the Cu gradient emphasized the key role of soil life in controlling ecosystem services. Furthermore, results indicated that different soil biodiversity and functional indicators started to decline (10% loss) within a Cu concentration range of 110 to 800 mg total Cu kg(-1).

AB  - The sugar contents of emergent macrophytes from a freshwater lake, a freshwater swamp, and a salt marsh in the southeastern United States were examined together with the dissolved free sugars produced during macrophyte degradation and in natural water samples collected adjacent to macrophyte stands.  Simultaneous separation of up to 13 neutral and 2 amino sugars together with 3 uronic acids and muramic acid was achieved by anion-exchange high-performance ion chromatography.  As little as 10 pmol or a concentration of 20 nM sugar can be detected by pulsed amperometry, a greater sensitivity for sugar quantification than that of previously reported detection techniques used in conjunction with either gas or liquid chromatographic systems.  Optimum conditions for hydrolysis of plant material by using trifluoroacetic acid were determined, and internal standards were used to quantify losses due to matrix effects and solid-phase extraction of samples.  Our data demonstrate that ratios of certain indicator sugars in undergraded macrophytes differ significantly from ratios of dissolved free sugars formed during macrophyte degradation, reflecting the complex processes (biological and physical) involved in vascular plant degradation in aquatic ecosystems.  Natural water samples collected adjacent to macrophyte beds contained dissolved free sugars at concentrations of 620 nM (lake), 890 nM (freshwater swamp), and 2,300 nM (salt marsh).  Sugar signatures of these natural water samples were similar to those of macrophyte degradation products.

AB  - Agricultural drainage ditches are common structures in cultivated lowland areas across Europe. These artificial linear water bodies are interconnected to form networks that can offer valuable habitats for many water associated organisms. The current study contributes to the knowledge of aquatic Coleoptera biodiversity associated with artificial drainage ditches. Fundamental ecological and faunistical findings were combined with aspects relevant for applied nature conservation. Adult beetles were sampled at 124 sampling locations belonging to seven study sites in the federal state of Brandenburg, Germany. With 108 taxa out of 10 families the studied ditches showed a high species richness. Taxa associated with eutrophic conditions dominated with the dytiscid Hydroporus palustris as the most abundant species. In terms of beta-diversity, a moderate turnover between the study sites could he observed. Although the sampling locations showed some degree of variability concerning habitat characteristics. measured environmental parameters only weakly explained observed differences in community composition. Beside taxonomical characterization of beetle diversity, aspects of functional diversity were analyzed. Interestingly. individuals with reduced flight ability were dominant, Because the predaceous family Dytiscidae dominated. beetles were mainly integrated as carnivores in the food web of ditches. Throughout the study, 13.0% threatened as well as 18.4% rare taxa could be recorded, referring to the German fauna of aquatic beetles. This may underpin the need to include agricultural drainage ditches into conservation management.

AB  - Contamination of aquatic environments as a consequence of metal mining is an international issue. Most historic studies have considered the impact of acid mine drainage (pH < 6) on instream communities and comparatively little attention has been given to sites where drainage is typically circum-neutral (6 > pH < 8). Here, the impacts of historic mining activities on the benthic macroinvertebrate community of a circum-neutral river in Central Wales are assessed. Biotic and diversity indices, widely used for biomonitoring purposes, indicate aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages within the Afon Twymyn to be in a good condition, despite severe metal contamination of bed sediments and river water. However, Canonical Correspondence Analysis identifies differences in community structure between mining impacted and unimpacted reaches of the river associated with chalcophile (Zn, Pb, Cu, Cd) and common (Fe and Mn) metals. Stream pH was not a significant factor structuring the macroinvertebrate community. Widely utilised macroinvertebrate indices failed to identify impacts at the community level because they either seek to identify impacts of a specific contaminant or are dependent on a model community response to a given stress. The nature of metal mine discharges is temporally complex, having highly variable chemical signatures and as a result, care is advised when interpreting and modelling community impacts. The use of standard macroinvertebrate biotic and diversity indices in the context of the EU Water Framework Directive could lead to erroneous classifications of aquatic ecosystem health when used for bio-monitoring rivers affected by neutral mine drainage where other indicators are unavailable.

AB  - Agriculture in the Czech Republic plays an important role in the degradation of individual components of the environment. Reduction of soil fertility, contamination of surface- and groundwater, reduction of biodiversity and damage caused by it are proven. The agrarian landscape does not provide the appropriate ecosystem functions. It is not attractive for life of the inhabitants of rural areas, and the permeable landscape attractive for investors. It is also not permeable and attractive for investors. The farmers are offered applicable and functional techniques, technologies and procedures. These are not used and exploited in an appropriate rate. Based on the analysis of business environment, there was found that the reason is the absence of the agroenvironmental management system in operative management of agricultural subjects. For the need of the possible implementation of the appropriate system into practice, there was developed a branch standard and subsequently a methodology for the application of agro-environmental management system on the basis of a general tool for environmental management. The methodology was developed, then implemented and tested under the conditions of a concrete farm. Before the implementation of requirements, there were established environmental indicators which were evaluated before and after the introduction of the proposed system. The results of the subsequent monitoring of the chosen environmental indicators of environmental status confirmed the functionality and accuracy of the developed management tool that can also be seen as the best available technique for the implementation of the current and prepared agricultural policy.

TI  - SOILS AND GEOAMBIENTS OF AMAZON CAMPINARANAS: GENETIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GEOENVIRONMENTS AND LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION IN A TRANSECT IN THE UPPER RIO NEGRO BASIN, AMAZONIA
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GEOMORFOLOGIA
LA  - Portuguese
KW  - BRAZIL
AB  - The upper Rio Negro basin's Amazon Campinaranas are natural ecosystems which have sandy material as substrate, mainly Spodosols. These ecosystems occur in different topographical positions, as well as depressed areas on tableland interfluves, downslopes, alluvial terraces and paleochannels. Campinaranas are often surrounded by "terra firme" forests, being differentiated from the latter by vegetation size. There are important physiognomic variations, which are directly related to soil conditions (texture, nutrient content and organic matter), topography, and the influence of the water table level. Although occupying significant areas of the Rio Negro basin and constituting very fragile environments, there are few studies about the Campinaranas ecology in this region. The goal of this study is to characterize an area of campinaranas the upper Rio Negro basin's Amazon as well as the genetic relationships between soil and vegetation on the landscape scale. In the field a transect was made covering four different geoenvironments. In each of them, were performed soil analysis of sortive complex, organic matter content, nitrogen and texture. The Campinaranas floristic, structural, and diversity patterns are strongly related to the water table's depth, variation in soil texture and in the macro and micronutrient contentThe results indicate that the vegetation diversity and soils along the transect are closely linked to the development and evolution of podzolization and to the process of installation and incision of the drainage network in the area. It is concluded that the vegetation and its spacial variation has been an important indicator of the transformation.

AB  - Patterns in plant-soil biota interactions could be influenced by the spatial distribution of species due to soil conditions or by the functional traits of species. Gypsum environments usually constitute a mosaic of heterogeneous soils where gypsum and non-gypsum soils are imbricated at a local scale. A case study of the interactions of plants with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in gypsum environments can be illustrative of patterns in biotic interactions. We hypothesized that (i) soil characteristics might affect the AMF community and (ii) there are differences between the AMF communities (modules) associated with plants exclusive to gypsum soils (gypsophytes) and those associated with plants that show facultative behavior on gypsum and/or marly-limestone soils (gypsovags). We used indicator species and network analyses to test for differences between the AMF communities harbored in gypsophyte and gypsovag plants. We recorded 46 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to nine genera of Glomeromycota. The indicator species analysis showed two OTUs preferentially associating with gypsum soils and three OTUs preferentially associating with marly-limestone soils. Modularity analysis revealed that soil type can be a major factor shaping AMF communities, and some AMF groups showed a tendency to interact differently with plants that had distinct ecological strategies (gypsophytes and gypsovags). Characterization of ecological networks can be a valuable tool for ascertaining the potential influence of above- and below-ground biotic interactions (plant-AMF) on plant community composition.

AB  - Ecological regionalizations, such as ecoregions or environmental clusters, are often used as coarse filters for conservation. To be effective biodiversity surrogates, regionalizations should contain distinct species assemblages. This condition is not frequently evaluated and regionalizations are rarely assessed comparatively. We used a national dataset of Canadian butterfly collections to evaluate four regionalizations (ecoregions, land cover and productivity regime classifications, and a spatial grid) at two thematic resolutions using analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) and species indicator values. Overall, the spatially constrained schemes (ecoregions and grids) best captured patterns of butterfly community composition and species affinities, indicating that butterfly communities are strongly structured by space at the continent scale. In contrast, when comparing regions only within spatial or environmental neighbourhoods (i.e., comparing between regions that are adjacent along geographic or environmental gradients), all regionalizations performed similarly. Adjacency in environmental space is thus as important as physical adjacency at determining community dissimilarity. Productivity regimes and land cover will be useful biodiversity surrogates when considered in conjunction with space or within a spatially constrained area. This finding was confirmed with two ecoregional case studies (of the Algonquin-Lake Nipissing and Thompson-Okanagan Plateau ecoregions), which also revealed that the relative performance of regionalizations depends upon the context of the study area. We conclude that including species data can improve the efficiency of environmental surrogates for systematic conservation planning. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - To understand the complex mechanisms behind the recent biodiversity decline, it is necessary to complement traditional biological and ecological studies with studies of the economic, historic, and social contexts related to biodiversity loss, We used the completeness of the woodpecker guild as a biodiversity indicator to test the hypothesis that forest biodiversity in Europe is inversely related to the degree of urban-economic development. We related woodpecker diversity to several socioeconomic indices in 20 central European countries where the basic physiogeographic conditions are similar. As predicted, woodpecker diversity was low in highly developed countries with a long history of intensive land use, whereas in less-developed, peripheral countries, the woodpecker diversity was much higher and no species had been lost. The negative correlation between the degree of urbanization and woodpecker diversity was interpreted as a causal link between neotechnological landscape degradation and the decline of biodiversity. We discuss, and reject, alternative hypotheses related to the slow postglacial dispersal of species and climatic differences between western and eastern Europe that might explain the observed pattern of woodpecker diversity. The relative importance of particular woodpecker species for the level of woodpecker diversity shows that species depending on naturally dynamic temperature forests are particularly sensitive to anthropogenic changes. Finally, we stress the importance of bolistic studies on biodiversity, including ecological, geographical, and social issues, and we encourage specialists and practitioners from different disciplines to examine the European east-west gradient to learn how to avoid the same biodiversity loss in the East that has afflicted the West.

AB  - Fire is an intrinsic component of many natural ecosystems. In human-modified landscapes that occur in fire-driven ecosystems, it can be difficult to make fire management decisions, as there must be a trade-off between ideal conservation management and the practicalities of management in an altered landscape. We assess how biodiversity is influenced by differences in fire regime in a landscape fragmented by timber production. Here, optimal fire management for maintaining grassland integrity is not always possible, due to logistical constraints and fire risk to plantations. We investigate thicket establishment arising from reduced fire frequency, and how this affects butterfly diversity, assemblage structure, indicator species and species associations to larval host plants with different growth forms. Butterflies were sampled along a gradient of woodiness in large-scale conservation corridors that separate timber compartments. The two extreme stages along the successional gradient, recently burned grassland and natural forests, supported relatively diverse and complementary butterfly assemblages. Grassland corridors without fire for 2 years were as high in butterfly diversity and similar in composition to recently burned grasslands. However, corridors without fire for >5 years were encroached by thicket and supported lower butterfly diversity. Thicket, with its intermediate vegetation character, was poor habitat for species adapted to either open grassland or to forests. Also, thicket-encroached areas carry high fire risk to plantations. Synthesis and applications. In this fragmented, fire-driven ecosystem, there is more than one burning strategy for achieving positive biodiversity outcomes. We recommend a divergent management approach that covers both extremes of the fire frequency continuum, with the choice depending on the stage of succession and management logistics for each site: (a) frequent burning to prevent woody encroachment in less-encroached, logistically easier sites or (b) letting succession run its course through thicket to forest by excluding fire in heavily encroached, logistically challenging sites. Both options are practicable and maintain biotopes that have high value for butterfly conservation and low fire risk to plantations. This divergent management approach is a flexible strategy that benefits both conservation and commercial interests across fire-prone plantation mosaics.

Location A decommissioned brown coal mine near Soby, central Denmark (56 degrees 01 ' 45 '' N, 9 degrees 04 ' 4 '' E). Methods We resurveyed the plant communities of the mine 31 years after an initial survey. Changes in the prevalence of exotic species and species indicator values for environmental conditions were used to link the observed vegetation changes to global change factors. Results The plant communities, including their unmined reference sites, changed over the 31-year period toward plant communities with higher proportions of exotics, nitrophilous, warmth- and moisture-indicating species, and species of low foraging quality for deer. The changes are consistent with the novel drivers of community assembly at the site, such as the introduction of exotic species, increased nitrogen deposition, elevated temperatures, steadily increasing groundwater level post mining, and the massive comeback of red deer. Conclusions The global-change forcing of novel plant communities suggests that it is becoming increasingly difficult to restore historical references. It may thus be more sensible to acknowledge novelty and adopt an open-ended approach for the restoration of this and similar post-industrial areas, e.g. using rewilding principles to promote biodiverse self-sustaining ecosystems.

AB  - Heavy metal pollution has become a serious environmental concern to global biological diversity. The continuous accumulation of toxic metals in plants is affecting the growth, development and reproduction of herbivore insects. In the present study, heavy metal-induced toxicity through tomato, Solanum lycopersicum L., leaves in Hadda beetle, Epilachna vigintioctopunctata (Coccinellidae; Coleoptera), was assessed. Second instar grubs of E. vigintioctopunctata were exposed to two concentrations i.e. 300 mu g ml(-1) and 100 mu g ml(-1) of zinc (Zn) and lead (Pb) metals. Experiment was performed using CRD design under controlled conditions (28 degrees C, 65 % R.H. and 16L: 8D h). Feeding indices: relative growth rate (RGR), relative consumption rate (RCR), efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI), growth parameters: grub weight gain, grub length, leaf weight loss, and percent survival rate were recorded. Zn showed to have higher feeding indices (RGR, RCR, and ECI) at both concentrations. Pb, on the other hand, showed a significant reduction in RGR due to low consumption rate and poor efficiency of conversion of ingested food at both concentrations. Due to decreased feeding indices, grub growth also reduced in Pb treated insects compared to Zn. Survival rate was significantly decreased in Zn and Pb treated grubs compared to control. Observed effects were more detrimental in insects exposed to Pb. Future studies should focus other herbivore insects as bioindicators of heavy metal accumulation in agricultural ecosystems which will help improving environmental safety guidelines.

AB  - While the Galapagos Archipelago is known for its endemic flora and fauna, many introduced species have also become naturalised there, especially on the human-inhabited islands. The only amphibian species known to have established on the islands, the Fowler's snouted treefrog (Scinar quinquefasciatus), is thought to have arrived about two decades ago. Since then, this treefrog has substantially extended its range to the islands of Santa Cruz and Isabela. Our study explores the potential influence of this introduced amphibian on native trophic systems on Santa Cruz and identifies potential antagonists likely to control larval frog populations. To understand the impact of S. quinquefasciaites as a predator of local invertebrate fauna, we performed a stomach-content analysis of 228 preserved adult specimens from seven different localities on Santa Cruz. Of the 11 macroinvertebrate orders recorded, Lepidoptera constituted more than 60% of the contents. We also identified active predators of S. quinquefasciazus tadpoles: larvae of the endemic diving beetle (Thermonectus basillarus galapagoensis). To determine the efficiency of this predator, we conducted predator-prey experiments in ex situ conditions. Tadpole predation was highest after first exposure to the predator and significantly decreased over time. Our experimental results demonstrate that although T. b. galapagoensis larvae are effective tadpole predators, their feeding saturation rates are likely inadequate for frog population control. Our findings provide the first baseline data necessary to make informed ecological impact assessments and monitoring schemes on Santa Cruz for this introduced treefrog.

AB  - Study was aimed to assess the potential ecological risk of nine metals (Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) and one metalloid (As) in bottom sediments of the Dzierno Due Reservoir located in the key anthropogenic hot spot areaUpper Silesian Industrial Region (Poland). Sediments were collected in seven sampling sites, along the main axis of a reservoir. Statistical analysis revealed a significant correlation (p<0.05) between the potentially toxic elements, which indicated that they plausibly originate from the same source of contamination or have a similar accumulation behavior. Several indices were used to assess ecological risk associated with examined elements, i.e., Enrichment Factor, Geoaccumulation Index, Contamination Factor, Potential Ecological Risk Factor, Probable Effect Concentration, Threshold Effect Concentration, Degree of Contamination and Risk Index. The values of analyzed indices indicate that sediments are highly to extremely highly contaminated, especially by Cd, Pb, Zn, and As, which simultaneously pose the highest ecological risk. The results of Cluster Analysis (CA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) indicate that Cd, Cr, Fe, Ni, Pb, Zn, and As in the bottom sediments are most likely of anthropogenic origin, while Mn rather from natural sources. The obtained results confirm the usefulness of different indices in assessing the ecological condition of water bodies and prove that the problem of toxic elements contamination in bottom sediments of the Dzierno Due Reservoir poses a serious environmental threat.

AB  - Study region: Upper Ganga reaches up to Rishikesh town, India.
   Study focus: Environmental Flows (E-Flows) assessment in the upper stretches of the Ganga river has been carried out by integrating ecological and geomorphological parameters with hydraulic analysis to estimate the flow depths and flow volumes necessary for river ecology and channel maintenance. We have used a modified version of Building Block Method (BBM) for computing E-Flows for lean period, for monsoon period and for high floods based on the flow requirements of keystone species for different sites and geomorphic considerations. We define three flow depths, D1, D2 and D3 which correspond to the minimum flow depths required for sustenance of keystone species during lean period, for breeding and spawning of keystone species during monsoon period, and for maintaining lateral connectivity during floods respectively.
   New hydrological insights for the region: Annual hydrographs for E-Flows have been developed and compared with the observed flows for each site under natural flow conditions. Our computation shows that for the wet period, which is taken as the period from mid-May to mid-October, monthly E-Flows vary from similar to 23% to similar to 40% of the monthly natural flows at different sites. However, dry season E-Flows as percentages of natural flows, taken for the period from mid-October to mid-May, vary over a wider range of 29%-53% for these sites.

AB  - The assessment of the impacts of human morphological alterations on lake ecological condition based on littoral benthic fauna is still in its infancy, especially in the Mediterranean area of Europe. Lake Piediluco is a riverine lake, sited in Central Italy, whose water level is strictly regulated for hydroelectric reasons and hence can be classified as a Heavily Modified Water Body (HMWB) according to the E.U. Water Framework Directive (WDF). Here, we aim at comparing the invertebrate assemblages among sites with a different degree of morphological alterations by identifying potential indicator species and metrics sensitive to morphological alterations, and by comparing the fauna composition collected using two sampling procedures (composite vs habitat-specific samples) with different processing times. Our results show that the invertebrate assemblages of Lake Piediluco differed according to the three types of shoreline alteration (natural, soft- and hard-altered sites) and this was more evident when we analyzed the habitat-specific samples. Several taxa, diversity and metrics based on the number of Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, Odonata and Mollusca taxa (ETO and ETOM) are found to be sensitive to shoreline alterations and are candidates for inclusion in assessment metrics for WDF compliant monitoring of the ecological status of this lake. While habitat-specific sampling provided a more detailed picture of the assemblages, composite samples provided consistent results and could be used when processing cost is an issue.

KW  - BENEFITS
AB  - Because thousands of pharmaceutical and industrial compounds are in use today and distributed into ecosystems via waste water, effective analysis of environmental risk needs to change as our understanding of the complexity of ecosystem services grows. Klaminder et al (2014 Environ. Res. Lett. 9 084003) now provide some important observations on a methodological bias in standardized ecotoxicological tests. First, the authors show that the formalized use of control species in risk assessment impacts how data is judged and valued. Reducing quantitative uncertainty may improve the rigor of toxicological assays, but may also increase the risk of missing likely ecosystem-scale impacts, essentially 'throwing the baby out with the bathwater'. Second, we should recognize the importance of integrating nature, complexity, and dynamics across temporal and spatial scales in relation to the unintended consequences of pharmaceuticals and their partial degradation products in the environment. Since ecosystems and our broader life support system are composed of various stability states with dynamic cycles, feedback can destabilize a system as we know it.
   Complex systems have emergent properties with high degrees of uncertainty and ecosystem risk assessments must report not only toxicological risks but also 'benefits'. In addition, risk assessment must expand its scale from the molecular and cellular to that of the ecosystem with real world conditions. The authors' findings that exposure to Oxazepam led to increased survival and aggressiveness should inform changes in standardized testing methodology as well as improvements in regulatory policy.

AB  - Ecological communities consist of a large number of species. Most species are rare or have low abundance, and only a few are abundant and/or frequent. In quantitative community analysis, abundant species are commonly used to interpret patterns of habitat disturbance or ecosystem degradation. Rare species cause many difficulties in quantitative analysis by introducing noises and bulking datasets, which is worsened by the fact that large datasets suffer from difficulties of data handling. In this study we propose a method to reduce the size of large datasets by selecting the most ecologically representative species using a self organizing map (SOM) and structuring index (SI). As an example, we used diatom community data sampled at 836 sites with 941 species throughout the French hydrosystem. Out of the 941 species, 353 were selected. The selected dataset was effectively classified according to the similarities of community assemblages in the SOM map. Compared to the SOM map generated with the original dataset, the community pattern gave a very similar representation of ecological conditions of the sampling sites, displaying clear gradients of environmental factors between different clusters. Our results showed that this computational technique can be applied to preprocessing data in multivariate analysis. It could be useful for ecosystem assessment and management, helping to reduce both the list of species for identification and the size of datasets to be processed for diagnosing the ecological status of water courses.

AB  - This paper substantiates the necessity of improving the principles of using natural basis for ecosystem-focused forest management in mountain conditions using all the collected knowledge, regional databases, and new remote sensing facilities. The results of applying the spectral features of vegetation using the thermal range for studying the altitudinal differentiation of forest cover are given based on the example of the mountains of the Altai-Sayan region. Thus, forest-steppe, subtaiga light-coniferous small-leaved deciduous, mountain dark coniferous chern, mountain dark coniferous taiga, and subalpine classes of altitudinal belt complexes (ABC) can be defined in the Yenisei part of the Sayans. Particular forest-management systems should be used for each of them, taking into account the natural features of forests and their management purpose. One important task for mountain forestry and whole multipurpose forest use is to improve the ecological and geographical basis and present it in the form of medium-scale maps, which reflect not only the formational composition of forest cover, but also the altitudinal classes of ecosystems. Modern satellite remote sensing systems coupled with GIS technologies open up new possibilities for forest cover inventory, monitoring, and study methods. This makes it possible to introduce a high-quality natural basis into forest management, which is currently highly relevant at all levels of forest planning: from exploitation projects for separate forest plots to forest plans of federal subjects of the Russian Federation.

AB  - Current strategies for conservation reportedly suffer from an inadequate awareness of the drivers affecting lichen diversity, pointing to the need to fully develop a functional approach to lichen ecology. This study is an attempt to detect the drivers affecting functional diversity in the lichen flora of a volcanic Mediterranean area. Data on epiphytic lichen distribution were correlated with information coming from a GIS analysis. Species richness, functional diversity and indicator values of lichens species were analyzed as a function of altitude, bioclimatic patterns and land use patterns. Both taxonomic and functional diversity were found to increase with altitude, peaking at 600 m a.s.l. and slightly decreasing at higher elevations. A filtering effect of altitude on lichen growth-forms was detected at increasing altitude, with foliose isidiate lichens replacing crustose lichens with sexual reproduction, cyanobacteria replacing Trentepohlia as photobiont, and oligotrophic species linked to partially shaded environments gradually replacing species indicating eutrophic conditions. Forest stations impacted by low impact traditional agriculture tended to express higher lichen diversity compared to either undisturbed broadleaved forests or intensive orchards. These data demonstrate the need to integrate traditional low-impact agricultural practices in protected areas. Moreover, they provide the evidence that reanalyzing past and recent lichenological censuses with the proposed analytical tools may help previewing and driving the evolution of endangered ecosystems.

AB  - Surrogate indicators are important alternatives to overcome the shortage of total biodiversity data for planning and implementing conservation measures. The most important premise of this approach is congruence among surrogate candidates and among different assemblages. The aim of this study was to evaluate abundance and incidence congruence between invertebrate assemblages at two taxonomic resolutions (genus and family), and between invertebrate assemblage (genus) and three groups of taxa (EPT, Odonata, and Trichoptera). We also evaluated the congruence between functional groups of EPT and the taxonomic groups listed above. Data were collected from 51 stream sites distributed along a disturbance gradient in the rural area of the Paragominas municipality of the state of Para, Brazil. We used Procrustes analysis to test congruence between invertebrate assemblages at the multiple taxonomic resolutions listed previously. Family taxonomic level was a good substitute for similarity pattems measured at the genera level. EPT genus also were highly congruent with whole invertebrate assemblage (genus level) variation. Trichoptera had greater congruence with all macroinvertebrate genera than did Odonata. The congruence between EPT functional groups and groups of taxa was greater than r = 0.70. In general, taxonomic and functional metrics responded similarly to environmental conditions (water quality, channel morphology, substrate, riparian vegetation cover). Trichoptera (abundance), EPT (genera and functional groups), or invertebrate families appear to be reasonable surrogates for Amazon stream invertebrate assemblage as biological indicators for assessing and conserving streams influenced by agriculture.

AB  - Fish stock productivity, and thereby sensitivity to harvesting, depends on physical (e.g. ocean climate) and biological (e.g. prey availability, competition and predation) processes in the ecosystem. The combined impacts of such ecosystem processes and fisheries have lead to stock collapses across the world. While traditional fisheries management focuses on harvest rates and stock biomass, incorporating the impacts of such ecosystem processes are one of the main pillars of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM). Although EAFM has been formally adopted widely since the 1990s, little is currently known to what extent ecosystem drivers of fish stock productivity are actually implemented in fisheries management. Based on worldwide review of more than 1200 marine fish stocks, we found that such ecosystem drivers were implemented in the tactical management of only 24 stocks. Most of these cases were in the North Atlantic and north-east Pacific, where the scientific support is strong. However, the diversity of ecosystem drivers implemented, and in the approaches taken, suggests that implementation is largely a bottom-up process driven by a few dedicated experts. Our results demonstrate that tactical fisheries management is still predominantly single-species oriented taking little account of ecosystem processes, implicitly ignoring that fish stock production is dependent on the physical and biological conditions of the ecosystem. Thus, while the ecosystem approach is highlighted in policy, key aspects of it tend yet not to be implemented in actual fisheries management.

AB  - Increasing environmental concerns and the introduction of technologies based on renewable resources have stimulated the replacement of persistent petroleum-derived plastics with biodegradable plastics from biopolymers. As a consequence, a variety of products are currently manufactured from bioplastic, including carrier bags. This series of studies investigated the deterioration of carrier bags made with Mater-Bi (MB), a starch-based bioplastic, in soil, compost and two aquatic ecosystems, a littoral marsh and seawater. Results from the laboratory study indicated that bioplastic carrier bags were rapidly deteriorated in soil and compost. After three months of incubation, weight loss of specimens was of 37% and 43% in soil and compost, respectively. Conversely, little deterioration was observed in specimens buried in soil under field conditions or exposed to water of a littoral marsh and of the Adriatic Sea. These findings were consistent with the greater number of bacteria and especially fungi capable of degrading MB that were recovered from soil and compost with respect to the two aquatic ecosystems. Considering that a variety of microbial isolates are capable of using MB as a source of carbon, a new alternative to recycle these MB-based carrier bags was explored. More specifically, starchy residues from bags were fermented by the fungus Rhizopus oryzae to produce up to 35 mg of lactic acid per g of bag residues. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The presence of whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) in Bahia de Los Angeles, Baja California Norte, Mexico, is a seasonal phenomenon, occurring during the months of June-November, with highest abundance from August to October. The foraging ecology of whale sharks in Bahia de Los Angeles was studied from 28 July to 26 October 1999. During this period, 19 individual whale sharks were identified, including nine males, three females, and seven whose sex was not identified. Feeding by whale sharks was observed on 132 out of 190 sightings. Approximately 80% of the feeding events occurred in areas with <= 10 m bottom depth (mean +/- S.D. = 7.0 +/- 5.5 m), and were concentrated primarily in the southernmost region of the bay. The highest numbers of feeding events occurred between 12.00 and 16.00 h. Mean ( +/- S.D.) sea surface temperature during these events was 29.7 +/- 1.1 degrees C. Three feeding behaviors, "active", "vertical", and "passive", and one non-feeding behavior, "cruising", were characterized. Analysis of plankton samples collected beside feeding sharks revealed that zooplankton, primarily copepods (similar to 85% of total zooplankton abundance) appeared to be the primary prey source in the bay. Although whale sharks were observed feeding among large schools of baitfish (sardines, anchovies), whale sharks were never observed directly preying upon these fish. Whale sharks may target baitfish to locate zooplankton, as these fish can be indicators of plankton rich patches. Zooplankton abundance was significantly different among the three feeding behaviors, suggesting that prey abundance may influence which feeding technique was utilized. Feeding was not observed when the minimum density of zooplankton was less than similar to 10.0 x 10(3) individuals m(-3). Whale sharks may be following oceanographic cues (physical and biological) both within the bay as well as throughout the Gulf of California that are favorable for increases of prey resources. Because whale shark ecotourism is rapidly increasing in Bahia de Los Angeles, it is important to identify and manage ecologically important areas utilized by whale sharks within the bay to ensure the continued integrity of the habitat that supports whale shark presence.

AB  - Stoneflies are among the most sensitive aquatic insect taxa and therefore arguably the best indicator of the excellent, i.e. pristine, ecological status of surface streams. Karst habitats are one of the most exciting freshwater habitats in terms of biological geological interplay They, in turn, support a biodiversity far superior to surrounding freshwater habitats and hence these habitats are designated as biodiversity hotspots. Our study deals with both of these crucial ecological players. We studied stonefly assemblages, their microhabitat preferences and emergence patterns along a karst oligotrophic hydrosystem. The sampling was conducted monthly from March 2007 to December 2008 using pyramid-type emergence traps set in various habitats and associated microhabitats (e.g. springs, rivers, streams. tufa bairiersx moss, angiosperm, cobble, sand, silt substrates). Favorable environmental conditions, such as a wide range of karst habitat types with low water temperature and high oxygen concentration, resulted in high stonefly species richness (31 recorded species). Water temperature and pH had the highest influence on stonefly assemblages. Species richness and diversity decreased in a downstream direction. We recorded a longitudinal shift from crerial-epirhithral to epirhithral-mentrhithral assemblages with some hyporhithral and potarnal elements. Upstream sites were dominated by shredders, while downstream sites had a higher proportion of gatherers-collectors. Sevend species showed a significant preference for a specific microhabitat type in accordance with their feeding strategies and food availability The majority of recorded species exhibited univoltine life cycles slow or fast.

AB  - Dung beetle community structures changes due to the effects of destruction, fragmentation, isolation and decrease in tropical forest area, and therefore are considered ecological indicators. In order to assess the influence of type of maize cultivated and associated maize management on dung beetle communities in Atlantic Forest fragments surrounded by conventional and transgenic maize were evaluated 40 Atlantic Forest fragments of different sizes, 20 surrounded by GM maize and 20 surrounded by conventional maize, in February 2013 and 2014 in Southern Brazil. After applying a sampling protocol in each fragment (10 pitfall traps baited with human feces or carrion exposed for 48 h), a total of 3454 individuals from 44 species were captured: 1142 individuals from 38 species in GM maize surrounded fragments, and 2312 from 42 species in conventional maize surrounded fragments. Differences in dung beetle communities were found between GM and conventional maize communities. As expected for fragmented areas, the covariance analysis showed a greater species richness in larger fragments under both conditions; however species richness was greater in fragments surrounded by conventional maize. Dung beetle structure in the forest fragments was explained by environmental variables, fragment area, spatial distance and also type of maize (transgenic or conventional) associated with maize management techniques. In Southern Brazil's scenario, the use of GM maize combined with associated agricultural management may be accelerating the loss of diversity in Atlantic Forest areas, and consequently, important ecosystem services provided by dung beetles may be lost.

AB  - This study evaluated ecological health, using various biomarkers and bioindicators, of pale chub (Zacco platypus) as a sentinel species, in Daejeon Stream, South Korea, during April-May 2011. The biomarkers and bioindicators were compared among three sites of control: Reference (C-z), transition (T-z), and the urban zones (U-z); and the 7-Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, DNA damage, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and vitellogenin (VTG) concentrations were more significantly increased in the U-z than in the C-z. Also, physiological markers such as condition factor, liver somatic index, visceral somatic index, and gonad somatic index were significantly increased in the U-z than in the C-z. For the health assessments, three categorized parameters of blood chemistry, molecular biomarkers, and physiological bioindicators were standardized and calculated as a star-plot, representing values of Integrated Health Response (IHR). Values of IHR had more significant (P<0.05) increases in the U-z than any other zones, indicating an impairment of ecological health by organic matter, nutrients (N, P), and toxic chemicals. This study is based on low levels of biological organization approach of molecular and physiological biomarkers and bioindicators, so further study of high-levels of biological organization approach such as community and population is required for overall range of health assessments. The approach of IHR values, however, may be useful in providing early warning of future impacts on ecological health.

AB  - Both, poverty reduction and preservation of biodiversity are high oil the global agenda on sustainable development. The relationships between poverty, biodiversity of agro-ecosystems and agricultural development are complex and poorly understood. In this paper, we present an integrated framework for analysis of agricultural development and natural resource management options at agro-ecosystem level, using Pujiang county, in Zhejiang province, China as a case study area to perform the analysis. A regional linear programming (LP) model is applied, maximizing regional economic surplus, given production and labour market conditions in Pujiang. We use the model to examine the consequences for a set of regional poverty and biodiversity indicators, of four so-called poverty reduction strategies, i.e., (i) intensification of production, (ii) diversification towards livestock production, (iii) land expansion, and (iv) an exit from agriculture. The analysis indicates that diversification is the most promising poverty reduction strategy, but requires efficient use of animal manure ill cropping systems to avoid environmental problems. Improved nutrient management in cropping systems is effective in reducing the regional nitrogen surplus, but less effective in increasing per capita income. The exit strategy is effective in reducing poverty and achieving biodiversity goals, but may have important social consequences that are not addressed in this study. Further reduction in rural poverty is hampered by labour constraints during the harvesting period in high value crops such as vegetables and fruits, which calls for research and development in the field of agricultural mechanization.

CP  - WORKSHOP ON IMPROVING NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT THROUGH MONITORING
AB  - Concepts, planning and design procedures are examined that are needed in the development of long-term stream monitoring programs in forested regions. A long-term stream monitoring program is viewed as the key component for bringing together management organizations, researchers and decision-makers to improve the management of natural resources. The keystones of such ecosystem monitoring are long-term data records that provide the basis for analysis of environmental assessment objectives, predictions and analysis of outcomes which in-turn can be used to modify and improve future projects. Management organizations that initiate long-term monitoring programs are urged to use monitoring actions and information to facilitate decision-making processes that pertain to conserving and allocating resources for future beneficial uses. Recommendations are provided for careful planning and definition of interactive activities of monitoring programs and that should provide information feedbacks that can be used to evaluate issues pertaining to beneficial uses of resources. Procedural requirements and literature sources are suggested for developing long-term stream monitoring programs. They include reviews of background and historical information to provide precise definitions of long-term objectives, planning considerations and monitoring methods. Examples are given of specific procedures that need to be identified during the planning process. They include the application of management standards to variable conditions encountered within natural ecosystems,and the detection of the timing of recovery phases of stream ecosystem development following a disturbance. These procedures are viewed as being essential for improving applications of management standards and perceived thresholds to stream and watershed ecosystems monitoring programs.

AB  - Arachis hypogaea L. (peanut) is a major oil yielding crop and its productivity is largely affected by the availability of nitrogen and phosphorus. The present study aims to elucidate the differential physiological and biochemical mechanisms involved in two contrasting genotypes of peanut for mitigation of N and/or P deficiency. The plants of two contrasting genotypes of peanut (GG7 and TG26) were subjected to N and/or P deficiency under hydroponic culture condition. After 15 d of N and/or P deficiency, various growth parameters, mineral nutrient status, nutrient use efficiency, photosynthesis, transpiration, water use efficiency, chlorophyll fluorescence, ROS level, and changes in enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidative components were measured in control and nutrient deficient plants. Our results showed that GG7 is fast-growing genotype than TG26 under control condition, whereas under N and/or P deficiency growth performance of GG7 was significantly declined as compared to TG26. The levels of photosynthetic pigments, net photosynthesis activity (P-N), and stomatal conductance (g(s)) declined in N and/or P deficient plants of both the genotypes. However, quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) did not change significantly under N and/or P starvation in both the genotypes. In the present investigation, most of the antioxidative enzymes either remained in steady state or downregulated in both the genotypes of peanut under N and/or P deficiency condition. N and/or P deficiency did not influence the levels of ROS and oxidative stress indicators such as O-2(center dot-), H2O2, and MDA in both the genotypes. In the present investigation, the decline in growth in both the genotypes under N and/or P deficiency might be due to the reduced photosynthetic performance. Our results suggest that TG26 is more resistant to N and P deficiency than GG7 genotype. Higher NUE value of GG7 as compared to TG26 suggests that GG7 can utilize N more efficiently to promote biomass production than TG26 under sufficient nutrient condition. On the other hand, mineral resource allocation to leaf and higher PUE are key adaptive features of the TG26 genotype under N, and P deficiency conditions. The differential regulations of various enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidative components in peanut genotypes maintain the cellular redox homeostasis under mineral deficiency conditions and prevent the peanut plants from oxidative stress, thereby maintaining PSII efficiency. The information from the present study can be useful for the improvement of traits in peanut that can maintain the productivity under N and P deficient environment with minimum input of fertilizers.

AB  - 1. Reef fish biomass is increasingly recognized as a key indicator of fishery and biodiversity status linked to ecosystem integrity on coral reefs, and yet the evaluation of appropriate baselines for biomass, and what drives variation in potential baselines, is sparse.
   2. Variability in reef fishable biomass was assessed to test for the existence of baselines or benchmarks (B&Bs), based on field studies of 223 reef sites in remote uninhabited reefs, in high-compliance closures of >5 km(2), and among the increasing number of small and recent closures.
   3. The purpose of the study was to examine the effects of human habitation, travel time and distance to cities, habitat, depth, benthic cover, and environmental variables on fish B&Bs.
   4. There were large differences in the three categories of 'no fishing', with human habitation being the single best predictor of biomass. In remote areas without people (>9 hours of travel time), fish biomass had a mean of 2,450 kg ha(-1) (95% confidence interval, 95% CI, 2,130-2,770 kg ha(-1); median = 1,885 kg ha(-1)).
   5. In these remote areas, biomass was weakly associated with human travel time to the site and, to a lesser extent, wave energy. In high-compliance closures, fish biomass peaked at 20 years and 5-10 km(2), and levelled at 910 kg ha(-1) (95% CI 823-989 kg ha(-1)) for both closure age and size. There was little evidence that human travel time and environmental factors influenced biomass greatly in these established closures. In small and recent closures (<15 years), habitat, depth and closure age were the best predictors of fish biomass.
   6. Based on the weakness of environmental factors, country or site-specific B&Bs are not required in these two provinces. However, human habitation in the seascape as well as the size and age of closures set limits to the maximum achievable biomass. The importance of environmental factors increases as the no-fishing areas and closure times decline. Reef wilderness is not widespread in these provinces, but provides key services and therefore needs to be included in conservation and fisheries policy and management goals.

AB  - The impact of anthropogenic ocean acidification (OA) on marine ecosystems is a vital concern facing marine scientists and managers of ocean resources. Euthecosomatous pteropods (holoplanktonic gastropods) represent an excellent sentinel for indicating exposure to anthropogenic OA because of the sensitivity of their aragonite shells to the OA conditions less favorable for calcification. However, an integration of observations, experiments and modelling efforts is needed to make accurate predictions of how these organisms will respond to future changes to their environment. Our understanding of the underlying organismal biology and life history is far from complete and must be improved if we are to comprehend fully the responses of these organisms to the multitude of stressors in their environment beyond OA. This review considers the present state of research and understanding of euthecosomatous pteropod biology and ecology of these organisms and considers promising new laboratory methods, advances in instrumentation (such as molecular, trace elements, stable isotopes, palaeobiology alongside autonomous sampling platforms, CT scanning and high-quality video recording) and novel field-based approaches (i.e. studies of upwelling and CO2 vent regions) that may allow us to improve our predictive capacity of their vulnerability and/or resilience. In addition to playing a critical ecological and biogeochemical role, pteropods can offer a significant value as an early-indicator of anthropogenic OA. This role as a sentinel species should be developed further to consolidate their potential use within marine environmental management policy making.

AB  - Diatoms are unicellular, photosynthetic, eukaryotic algae with a ubiquitous distribution in water environments and they play an important role in the carbon cycle. Molecular or morphological changes in these species under ecological stress conditions are expected to serve as early indicators of toxicity and can point to a global impact on the entire ecosystem. Thalassiosira pseudonana, a marine diatom and the first with a fully sequenced genome has been selected as an aquatic model organism for ecotoxicological studies using molecular tools. A customized DNA microarray containing probes for the available gene sequences has been developed and tested to analyze the effects of a common pollutant, benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), at a sub-lethal concentration. This approach in diatoms has helped to elucidate pathway/metabolic processes involved in the mode of action of this pollutant, including lipid metabolism, silicon metabolism and stress response. A dose-response of BaP on diatoms has been made and the effect of this compound on the expression of selected genes was assessed by quantitative real time-PCR. Up-regulation of the long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase and the anti-apoptotic transmembrane Bax inhibitor, as well as down-regulation of silicon transporter 1 and a heat shock factor was confirmed at lower concentrations of BaP, but not the heat-shock protein 20. The study has allowed the identification of molecular biomarkers to BaP to be later on integrated into environmental monitoring for water quality assessment.

AB  - Periphytic ciliate communities of riverine floodplains have hardly been studied, although they play an important role in aquatic food webs and contribute to the overall ecosystem functioning. In this study we analyzed the taxonomic and functional composition and diversity of these communities across all seasons and hydrological phases. The study was conducted in a floodplain lake, a part of the large natural Danube floodplain, from February 2015 to September 2016. We found that higher temperature and hydrologically stable conditions during the lake isolation phase, when a high amount of suspended food is available, result in the highest ciliate abundances and dominance of relatively large suspension-feeding ciliates, mainly peritrichs, which could serve as good bioindicators for detecting disturbances in river-floodplain ecosystems. During the flow pulse phase, associated with lower temperatures, and during the phase of extreme floods, when the availability of suspended food was largely reduced, small surface-feeding ciliates prevailed in the periphyton. Further, while the total ciliate abundance was the lowest, the highest taxonomic and functional diversity was found, especially during an intermediate level of hydrological connectivity (flow pulse). Our results confirm the importance of different levels of hydrological connectivity for maintaining biodiversity in riverine floodplains and add to a growing awareness of the need to preserve the natural hydrological regimes of large rivers.

AB  - Aims Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling are key ecosystem functions potentially altered by heavy metal pollution. We used an ecosystem approach to study the long-term effect of lead (Pb) on C and N cycles in a natural grassland in a former shooting range. Methods Microbial activity was evaluated by substrate-induced respiration (SIR) in situ, adding isotopically labelled C-4-sugar to the soil. C and N contents and natural abundance of isotopes were measured in grass leaves, soil and microbial biomass together with root biomass. Results A reduced microbial activity and microbial biomass per area, together with a higher soil C stock and C:N ratio suggested a lower microbial decomposition in high Pb compared to low Pb areas. A more closed N cycle in the high Pb area was indicated by 2-3 parts per thousand lower delta N-15 in leaves and soil compared to low Pb areas. Higher delta C-13 in leaves and higher root biomass but similar leaf nutrient contents indicated plant responses and adaptions to the high Pb. Conclusions The applied ecosystem approach revealed that Pb slowed down the C and N cycles, possibly by indirect effects rather than by direct toxicity. The ecosystem seems to have adapted to altered conditions.

AB  - The relevance of the research is caused by the need to monitor heavy metal content in ecosystems and human bio-substrates as the initial stage in assessing their impact on ecosystems and human body for determination the regional ecological standards taking into account natural and technogenic specificity of the region.
   The aim of this study was to evaluate soil content of Pb, Zn, Sr, Cu, Ni, Co, Cr, As, Vat 30 monitoring sites of residential areas in the central, southern, eastern, northwestern, western and northern regions of the Crimean peninsula.
   Methods. The total content of Pb, Zn, Sr, Cu, Ni, Co, Cr, As, Vin samples of soil was determined using x-ray spectrometer "Spektroskan Max-GV" in the laboratory of Soil Science Department in Academy of biology and biotechnology in Southern Federal University.
   Results. Exceedances of the maximum permissible concentrations were determined for Cr, Co, Pb, while As and Zn showed excess rarely. The maximum values of exceedances were as follows: 6,6 for As; 2,1 for Pb; 1,1 for V; 1,7 for Zn; 1,1 for Ni of maximum permissible concentration, 2,8 for Co; 2,6 for Cu; 1,7 for Cr and Sr of darkes for settlements. The comparative analysis of heavy metals distribution in soil of the regions with different natural and anthropogenic conditions allows assuming that the revealed heavy metals exceedances are mostly of an anthropogenic origin. Further studies including the reserved territories of the Crimea are needed to identify the geochemical soil characteristics and their origin at different regions.

AB  - The Nature Conservancy's wetland restoration at the Emiquon Preserve has been a success to date, but there are warning signs of undesirable change if left unmanaged. A water control structure built in 2016 will increase management capabilities, but periodic connection to the river, which has experienced human alterations typical of rivers in eastern North America and Europe, also introduces risks. The Conservancy's planning process has identified (1) management targets (e.g., diverse native fish populations); (2) Key Ecological Attributes (KEAs) that maintain the targets (e.g., relatively deep over-wintering habitats for fishes); (3) measurable indicators for the KEAs (e.g., depth in winter); and (4) desirable ranges for the indicators (e.g., 10% of the aquatic area has depths of 2-3 m and dissolved oxygen levels of 4-6 mg/l). Assessments and experiments completed to date have focused on documenting the restoration, evaluating effects of the record flood of 2013, and predicting outcomes of management actions. Simulation models of hydrology, hydraulics, and vegetation response developed during the planning process allayed some concerns of stakeholders, but not all outcomes are predictable from either current theory or management experience. Therefore, each action can be considered not only as an adaptive management experiment focused on sustaining targets, but also contributing to ecological theory and restoration practice on a broader scale.

AB  - Maintaining ecosystem functioning under global change requires resilient ecosystems to absorb disturbances, reorganize and maintain the adaptive capacity. Maintaining resilience is therefore a common objective for ecosystem management, but how this objective may he achieved remains largely unclear. The concept of ecological memory provides a perspective on how the adaptive capacity of ecosystems can be enhanced through management. It specifies how ecological processes in space and time assist in the reorganization of communities after disturbances, We present a trail-based approach that links environmental variables at site and patch level to plant traits. With a generalized linear mixed-effects model we test how environmental variation in management and floodplain dynamics, within and between sites, relates to plant traits that are considered relevant for ecological memory. The results show different mechanisms that intervene in ecological memory. Grazing enhances recruitment opportunities, both for internal reorganization and for colonization between sites. Dense vegetation structure se feels for species survival via resprouting after disturbance and competitive species. Hydrodynamics interact with seed dispersal mechanisms and seed persistence. We show that at different spatial levels, plant trait composition can act as an indicator of ecological processes contributing to the ecological memory of a floodplain ecosystem. For ecosystem management to maintain and use as much of this memory as possible it should incorporate management measures at various levels of scale to enhance ecosystem resilience.

AB  - We investigated the variations of reef fish assemblages on coral reefs that experience different turbidity regimes, by assessing the association between the vertical extinction coefficient for photosynthetically active radiation (K-d PAR) and communities of fishes and corals at 21 reef sites in La Parguera, southwest Puerto Rico. Statistical correlations and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) identified turbidity as an important environmental parameter affecting ecological processes on coral reefs, as reflected by changes in the composition and abundance of reef fishes and benthic communities. Lower fish density and species richness was found at turbid sites. Turbidity was also negatively correlated to percent coral cover, which together with rugosity, were additional habitat parameters shaping reef fish assemblages. Bluehead wrasse Thalassoma bifasciatum and yellowtail damselfish Microspathodon chrysurus were species rarely present at turbid sites and abundant at clear ones. The yellowtail hamlet Hypoplectrus chlorurus and sharknose goby Elacatinus evelynae had the opposite distribution along the turbidity gradient. We identified seawater turbidity as an additional predictor of the reef fish community structure in La Parguera, in addition to live coral cover and reef rugosity. Because coral reefs and reef fishes were less complex (lower rugosity, less species richness, less diversity) in more turbid sites, managing for clear water conditions within the coastal area of La Parguera should lead to improved ecosystem resilience and stability, and should become a primary goal of management.

AB  - Environmental monitoring through living organisms is an effective technique of human impact assessment, based on reliable and cost-effective biological tools of control. In this study, roots, stems and leaves of the worldwide distributed macrophyte Arundo donax (giant reed) were tested as potential biomonitors of trace element contamination in water and sediment. In particular, the concentrations of the following elements were analyzed: Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn. A two-year sampling was conducted in an urban watercourse of Catania (Sicily, Italy), affected by municipal and industrial discharges of wastewaters. Results showed that the amount of concentrations in plant tissues is significantly dependent on the kind of organ and element. Trace element concentrations decreased according to the pattern of root > leaf > stem, implying that roots acted as the main centers of bioaccumulation, and stems as transit organs as a consequence of the general high translocation from roots to leaves. Overall, A. donax showed a significant capacity of bioaccumulation in agreement with ecologically similar macrophytes. Positive correlations were found between trace concentrations in plant organs and sediment (Al, Cr, Mn, Ni, Zn), and water (Cu, Ni, Zn). The results of this study suggested that A. donax acts as an ecological indicator of environmental conditions, thus, its application may prove a useful tool during monitoring campaigns of wetlands.

AB  - The form, hydrology and functioning of rivers worldwide have been increasingly modified by a range of human activities. The impacts of these changes on the fish faunas of rivers need to be assessed for biodiversity conservation and fisheries management. Reliable and cost effective indicators of fish assemblage responses to hydrological, morphological and functional changes in a river are required. Given the large number of fish species present in many rivers, reliance on a single indicator species is problematic. The present paper proposes the use of environmental guilds for this purpose. Building on prior studies, we propose a series of environmental guilds based on common patterns of response by fish species to changes in river flow and geomorphology. A general framework consisting of two upland stream guilds, three lowland lentic guilds, four lowland lotic guilds, two generalist guilds and five estuarine guilds is proposed. Considering the large numbers of species present in many river and estuarine systems and the flexibility of their behaviour, many species will be difficult to classify. Further development of the proposed guild classification at the level of individual basins is anticipated, particularly in river systems with highly variable hydrology and many opportunistic species. Nevertheless, this general scheme would be easily and rapidly applied to a wide variety of local circumstance, as well as to the description of the general trends in fish population and assemblage structure Occurring during river development.

AB  - The biochemical properties of soil have often been described as early and sensitive indicators of ecological changes in both natural soil and agroecosystem. In the current study, the impacts of the amendment of Bt-transgenic rice (KMD) straw on biological activities in water-flooded soil were investigated under laboratory conditions and compared with non-transgenic rice (Xiushui 11) straw. The results showed that there were some differences in protease, neutral phosphatase and cellulase activities between soil amended with Bt-transgenic rice straw and non-transgenic rice straw at the early stage of incubation, and none of these differences were persistent. However, differences in dehydrogenase activity, methanogenesis, hydrogen production and anaerobic respiration between soil supplemented with Bt-transgenic rice straw and non-transgenic rice straw were persistent over the course of incubation. Dehydrogenase activity, methanogenesis and anaerobic respiration were considerably lower from sample days 7 to 56, but higher after day 56 in soil amended with Bt-transgenic rice straw. In comparison, the H-2-production in soil containing Bt-transgenic rice straw was significantly lower after day 56. The results demonstrated that the amendment of the Bt-transgenic rice straw altered some important biological properties in water-flooded soil, indicating a shift in microbial populations or a change in the metabolic abilities of the microbial community as a result of substrate availability in soil.

AB  - Previous attempts to test the hypothesis that laboratory selection of isogenetic populations can produce test organisms with a significantly increased mean tolerance to toxic substances have failed. One possible explanation for such failure is that the tolerance of laboratory populations is largely constrained by their origins (were the source populations composed of tolerant genotypes?). To address this question, among- and within-population variability in stress tolerance was assessed by calculating the variance in individual fitness and longevity across a cadmium gradient (0-10 mug/L). The study employed Daphnia magna clones from four geographically separate European populations. Results revealed significant differences in tolerance to lethal levels of toxic stress among populations. The distribution of tolerances within two of the studied populations showed high amounts of genetic variation in tolerance. Genetic relationships between tolerance traits and life history performance under nonstressful environments differed among the studied populations. One population showed significant but low costs associated with tolerance, whereas no costs were associated with tolerance in the other population. These results suggest that laboratory selection will favor individuals with high fitness or reproductive performance under optimal laboratory conditions resulting in laboratory populations with similar or lower tolerance to toxic stress than their original field populations. Given that populations can exhibit high levels of genetic variability in tolerance to toxic stress, minimizing genetic diversity in toxicity tests will increase the uncertainty attendant in extrapolating from the lab to the field.

AB  - This paper explores the potential for collaborative governance approaches to support Cumulative Effects Assessment (CEA) in the Cree territory of Eeyou Istchee, located in Northern Quebec, Canada, where a long history of large-scale hydroelectricity development, mining and forestry activities have negatively affected wildlife populations, imposing burdens on the traditional food systems and livelihoods of local Indigenous communities. Drawing on key informant interviews with policy actors from government, non-government and private sector organizations working on Impact Assessment in Eeyou Istchee, the potential for more decentralized and networked approaches to regional wildlife monitoring and baseline data collection in support of CEA is considered. Results suggest a shared willingness to collaborate towards improving the overall regional envi-ronmental conditions and to generate long-term data on wildlife population and distribution. Challenges include the absence of essential supporting programs (land-use plans, regional environmental frameworks, lead moni-toring agencies, designated funding), and high levels of distrust between proponents and NGOs which combine to suppress the initiation of collaborative governance processes as well as the potential utility of any regional monitoring program that might be established. The need for leadership to facilitate reciprocal knowledge flows among actors, build trust and enable long-term cooperative structures based on a shared vision and goal con-gruency is identified.

AB  - The descriptive ability of two integral biotic indices obtained from laboratory experimental data focused on estimating the effects of humic products (HPs) on the microbiota under conditions of copper contamination in a model soil substrate is evaluated. The Standard Soil prepared from sand, kaolin, and peat (ISO 11268-1) as recommended for the assessment of biological effects was used. To summarize the results of ecotoxicological studies of Cu-polluted samples (660 mg Cu/kg) and to provide the integral estimation of HPs impact on the microbiota, two statistical models were used: the Harrington's desirability function D and the integrated parameter of the soil microbial system sustainability G (ratio of biodiversity to instability) using multisubstrate testing. The indices obtained based on two sets of multidimensional data were compared in their descriptive ability when estimating the detoxifying efficiency of HPs. It was found that HPs mainly stimulate multispecies bacterial complexes, while the test cultures representing higher plants and algae are less sensitive to their impact. Three of the five studied HPs showed a pronounced detoxifying effect and improved the state of the studied system. Both integral biotic indices-the generalized Harrington desirability function D and the General sustainability parameter of the system G-demonstrated a similar effect vector. For the purpose of environmental regulation, the use of the integrated approach based on a generalized desirability function could be recommended due to its higher completeness and reliability of the system of biotic indicators.

AB  - Methane and CO2 gas emissions from a gas seep located in the French Alps, documented over two millenaries, have been quantified along with gas emissions from the miniseepage area contouring the main vent. Several tons per year of both gas phases are released in the atmosphere from the main seep (18 tons of CH4 and 5.5 tons of CO2) which has been modified by an old borehole. Diffuse seepage brings additional CH4 (1 ton per year) and CO2 (2.3 tons per year) which are emitted from a small area of 240 m(2). Secondary CH4 oxidation processes are likely to occur near the surface. Biologically produced CO2 is also found in the soil in the seepage area and the biological component becomes predominant as CO2 concentrations drop lower than 2% vol. Soil gas CH4 + CO2 enrichments are oriented along N45 and N170 pathways that represent the main structural directions of the area. Soil flux anomalies are more scattered because surface clay formations have been strongly reworked at surface. Variety of methods (IRGA, micro-GC, accumulation chamber flux measurements, IR-camera) were tested and are discussed in connection with environmental impact monitoring and the role of sampling conditions, with emphasis on shale gas and carbon storage baseline assessments The role of potential leakage pathways represented by the old borehole structure is also discussed as an analogue with leaky shale gas wells.

AB  - The Southeastern United States is a global center of freshwater biotic diversity, but much of the region's aquatic biodiversity is at risk from stream degradation. Nonpoint pollution sources are responsible for 70% of that degradation, and controlling nonpoint pollution from agriculture, urbanization, and silviculture is considered critical to maintaining water quality and aquatic biodiversity in the Southeast. We used an ecological risk assessment framework to develop vulnerability models that can help policymakers and natural resource managers understand the impact of land cover changes on water quality in North Carolina. Additionally, we determined which landscape characteristics are most closely associated with macroinvertebrate community tolerance of stream degradation, and therefore with lower-quality water. The results will allow managers and policymakers to weigh the risks of management and policy decisions to a given watershed or set of watersheds, including whether streamside buffer protection zones are ecologically effective in achieving water quality standards. Regression analyses revealed that landscape variables explained up to 56.3% of the variability in benthic macroinvertebrate index scores. The resulting vulnerability models indicate that North Carolina watersheds with less forest cover are at most risk for degraded water quality and steam habitat conditions. The importance of forest cover, at both the watershed and riparian zone scale, in predicting macrobenthic invertebrate community assemblage varies by geographic region of the state.

AB  - We compared 15 blackwater and clearwater streams in coastal drainages of Alabama by quantifying fish assemblages and associated environmental conditions across multiple seasons and characterizing potential relationships using multivariate statistical approaches. Clearwater stream channels tended to be deeper, to have sandier substrates, and to have higher dissolved oxygen concentrations than blackwater streams. In contrast, blackwater streams showed higher dissolved organic carbon levels and higher benthic macroinvertebrate densities. Discriminant function analysis based on environmental and invertebrate data resulted in 90% discrimination between the two stream types. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) of seasonal fish assemblages indicated separation by stream type, with no overlap in fish assemblages of blackwater and clearwater streams in any season, and 12 (39%) of the 31 species captured were indicative of stream type. A suite of environmental and biological variables representing invertebrate density, discharge, stream size, water chemistry, and land use was correlated with NMDS axes separating fish assemblages by stream type. Fish traits were somewhat distinctive between stream types, as there were unique lie-in-wait predators and short-lived species in each stream type. A fourth-corner analysis indicated potential linkages between fishes preferring woody substrate and stream type, further suggesting that stream type may explain fish functional structure. These results emphasize the need to consider these coastal systems as biotically unique ecosystem types in conservation plans as well as to focus more attention on better understanding the diversity patterns in headwater streams within the Coastal Plains region.

AB  - Adaptive phenotypic plasticity is a key component of the ability of organisms to cope with changing environmental conditions. Fish have been shown to exhibit a substantial level of phenotypic plasticity in response to abiotic and biotic factors. In the present study, we investigate the link between environmental sensitivity assessed globally (revealed by phenotypic variation in body weight) and more targeted physiological and behavioral indicators that are generally used to assess the sensitivity of a fish to environmental stressors. We took advantage of original biological material, the rainbow trout isogenic lines, which allowed the disentangling of the genetic and environmental parts of the phenotypic variance. Ten lines were characterized for the changes of body weight variability (weight measurements taken every month during 18 months), the plasma cortisol response to confinement stress (3 challenges) and a set of selected behavioral indicators. This study unambiguously demonstrated the existence of genetic determinism of environmental sensitivity, with some lines being particularly sensitive to environmental fluctuations and others rather insensitive. Correlations between coefficient of variation (CV) for body weight and behavioral and physiological traits were observed. This confirmed that CV for body weight could be used as an indicator of environmental sensitivity. As the relationship between indicators (CV weight, risk-taking, exploration and cortisol) was shown to be likely depending on the nature and intensity of the stressor, the joint use of several indicators should help to investigate the biological complexity of environmental sensitivity.

AB  - The adoption of sustainable land management strategies and practices that respond to current climate and human pressures requires both assessment tools that can lead to better informed decision-making and effective knowledge-exchange mechanisms that facilitate new learning and behavior change. We propose a learning-centered participatory approach that links land management assessment and knowledge exchange and integrates science-based data and stakeholder perspectives on both biophysical and socio-economic attributes. We outline a structured procedure for a transparent assessment of land management alternatives, tailored to dryland management, that is based on (1) principles of constructivism and social learning, (2) the participation of stakeholders throughout the whole assessment process, from design to implementation, and (3) the combination of site-specific indicators, identified by local stakeholders as relevant to their particular objectives and context conditions, and science-based indicators that represent ecosystem services of drylands worldwide. The proposed procedure follows a pattern of eliciting, challenging, and self-reviewing stakeholder perspectives that aims to facilitate learning. The difference between the initial baseline perspectives and the final self-reviewed stakeholder perspectives is used as a proxy of learning. We illustrate the potential of this methodology by its application to the assessment of land uses in a Mediterranean fire-prone area in East Spain. The approach may be applied to a variety of socio-ecological systems and decision-making and governance scales. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecological production functions (EPFs) link ecosystems, stressors, and management actions to ecosystem services (ES) production. Although EPFs are acknowledged as being essential to improve environmental management, their use in ecological risk assessment has received relatively little attention. Ecological production functions may be defined as usable expressions (i. e., models) of the processes by which ecosystems produce ES, often including external influences on those processes. We identify key attributes of EPFs and discuss both actual and idealized examples of their use to inform decision making. Whenever possible, EPFs should estimate final, rather than intermediate, ES. Although various types of EPFs have been developed, we suggest that EPFs are more useful for decision making if they quantify ES outcomes, respond to ecosystem condition, respond to stressor levels or management scenarios, reflect ecological complexity, rely on data with broad coverage, have performed well previously, are practical to use, and are open and transparent. In an example using pesticides, we illustrate how EPFs with these attributes could enable the inclusion of ES in ecological risk assessment. The biggest challenges to ES inclusion are limited data sets that are easily adapted for use in modeling EPFs and generally poor understanding of linkages among ecological components and the processes that ultimately deliver the ES. We conclude by advocating for the incorporation into EPFs of added ecological complexity and greater ability to represent the trade-offs among ES. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2017; 13: 52-61.

AB  - Understanding and predicting species distribution in space and time and consequently community structure and dynamics is an important issue in ecology, and particularly in climate change research. A crucial factor determining the composition and dynamics of animal populations is habitat heterogeneity, i.e., the number of structural elements in a given locality. In the marine pelagic environment habitat heterogeneity is represented by the distribution of physical oceanographic parameters such as temperature, salinity and oxygen that are closely linked to atmospheric conditions. Little attention has been given, however, to the role of habitat heterogeneity in modulating the response of animal communities to external climate forcing. Here we investigate the long-term dynamics of Acartia spp., Temora longicornis, and Pseudocalanus acuspes, three dominant zooplankton species inhabiting different pelagic habitats in the Central Baltic Sea (CBS). We use the three copepods as indicator species for changes in the CBS zooplankton community and apply non-linear statistical modeling techniques to compare spatial population trends and to identify their drivers. We demonstrate that effects of climate variability and change depend strongly on species-specific habitat utilization, being more direct and pronounced at the upper water layer. We propose that the differential functional response to climate-related drivers in relation to strong habitat segregation is due to alterations of the species' environmental niches. We stress the importance of understanding how anticipated climate change will affect ecological niches and habitats in order to project spatio-temporal changes in species abundance and distribution.

AB  - The potential natural vegetation (PNV) is a tool for landscape planning, nature preservation and the assessment of naturalness. It is mostly constructed by the application of expert knowledge. This paper shows the advantages of using a more sophisticated and formalized PNV construction that overlays vegetation types and site factor maps by applying a Bayes model and herewith improving existing PNV maps solely based on expert knowledge. The investigation was conducted in the forest complex of the Bavarian Forest National Park (Germany) and the adjacent umava National Park (Czech Republic). The project reached two major results: (1) The existing heterogeneous country-specific databases of natural site conditions and of vegetation types could be adapted to each other to construct a solid scientific basis to deduce a PNV map. The habitat requirements of the occurring harmonized vegetation types can now be quantitatively described in a formalized way. (2) The combination of terrestrial PNV mapping and numerical modeling allows the synthesis of the views of the different experts that generated the maps used for model calibration. However, the modeled map loses the details of the expert-based map that cannot be derived from the underlying site maps. A common modeled PNV map of both national parks covering an area of about 92,000 ha was created. While the former expert-based PNV maps display breaks along the country border, the modeled PNV presents a harmonized view based on the common database of both national parks.

AB  - This paper focuses on the application of various biomonitoring techniques in China. We report a study in the Pearl River Basin (Guangzhou) based on the application of diatom indices as well as a study on the waterways in Wuhan based on evaluation of toxicity (using phytotoxicity, Daphnia magna and Microtox (TM) tests) and the Extended Biotic Index (EBI). Regarding the diatom indices, acceptable results were obtained based on comparison of the chemical water quality level and the European and Japanese indices, despite a lack of taxonomic information. The toxicity tests applied to the Wuhan waterways (Yangtze and Han Rivers) produced interesting results and can be considered to represent a useful tool for water pollution control in this area. Application of the EBI in Wuhan produced results that were contradictory to the toxicological analyses, as there were no indications of toxicity, whereas EBI indicated poor water quality. It can be concluded that in principle, certain European biological indicators can be considered to represent feasible tools to be applied in China. However, further studies will have to be carried out to develop bioindices based on Chinese data sets. The use of bioindices based on macroinvertebrates is limited to less polluted and smaller rivers with a lithic river substratum, whereas diatom indices are also applicable under extreme conditions (e.g., under high pollution loads or in large river streams with sandy riverbed sediments through installing artificial substrates).

AB  - In order to explore new bioindicators of aquatic environments, phytoplankton functional groups (FGs) were applied in a subtropical estuarine river delta system (the Pearl River Delta) for 2012 and 2015. Our results showed that the water quality (physicochemical parameters) of 2015 was better than 2012, which was benefited from Chinese government?s implementation of water pollution control measures. However, a non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS) based on phytoplankton FGs similarities did not show interannual differences correspondingly. This implied that the present improvements in water quality were insufficient to affect the interannual alterations of FGs. Among the 29 FGs identified, FGs P and TB were predominant in biomass, with sum proportion of 75%, while other FGs showed occasional advantages either seasonally or spatially, reflecting their randomness of exogenous inflows from water bodies such as lakes and reservoirs. The diversity of dominant FGs could be good bioindicators to spatial and seasonal variations in water quality, since it showed apparently lower in high eutrophic conditions (around Guangzhou city or dry seasons), and higher when water quality was better (the West River side or wet seasons). Therefore, we assumed that continued efforts in improving water quality would finally enhance the diversity of dominant FGs in the study area. In conclusion, the phytoplankton FGs method is suitable for identifying the spatial and seasonal characteristics of aquatic environments greatly affected by human activities, but its sensitivity to interannual water quality improvements requires further investigation.

AB  - Agricultural pesticides are known to significantly impact the composition of communities in stream ecosystems. Moreover, agricultural streams are often characterised by loss of physical habitat diversity which may impose additional stress resulting from suboptimal environmental conditions. We surveyed pesticide contamination and rates of leaf litter decomposition in 14 1st and 2nd order Danish streams using litter bags with coarse and fine mesh sizes. Two sites differing in physical habitat complexity were sampled in each stream, and we used this approach to differentiate the effects of pesticides between sites with uniform (silt and sand) and more heterogeneous physical properties.
   Microbial litter decomposition was reduced by a factor two to four in agricultural streams compared to forested streams, and we found that the rate of microbial litter decomposition responded most strongly to pesticide toxicity for microorganisms and not to eutrophication. Moreover, the rate of microbial litter decomposition was generally 50% lower at sites with uniform physical habitats dominated by soft substrate compared to the sites with more heterogeneous physical habitats. The rate of macroinvertebrate shredding activity was governed by the density of shredders, and the density of shredders was not correlated to pesticide contamination mainly due to high abundances of the amphipod Gammarus pulex at all sites. Our study provides the first field based results on the importance of multiple stressors and their potential to increase the effect of agricultural pesticides on important ecosystem processes.

AB  - Y Multi-proxy studies of floodplain sequences provided materials for reconstructing natural and anthropogenic factors affecting landscape evolution of the Razdolnaya (Suifun) River basin near the Starorechenskoye settlement attributed to the Bohai culture in the Russian Far East. Data were obtained on the humid phase of the middle Holocene (similar to 5.9 ka), while the last 2.5 ka were studied in detail. The vegetation development tracked climate conditions, largely changed in moisture. The studied sequences include a paleosol that developed during a prolonged period of drought 2.7-1.3 ka ago. The period was noted for a wide occurrence of steppe and forb meadows with wormwood, and open birch forests. The climate became gradually warmer since the late 7th to 10th centuries CE following by a decrease in temperature and high humidity in the Little Ice Age. The pollen assemblages display an appearance of dark conifers and Korean pine pollen brought by floods. In Pinus densiflora and birches gained in importance in the mountain forests. The pollen spectra from surface soil are indicative of the wide development of agricultural landscapes. The recorded biological indicators shed light onto the dynamics of paleo-floods. The significance of anthropogenic factors in landscape evolution is considered with reference to the periods of the Bohai settlers, first settlers in 19th-early 20th centuries, and the present days marked with development of the modern agrocomplexes.

AB  - Silver mining in the early-1900s has left a legacy of arsenic-rich mine tailings around the town of Cobalt, in northeastern Ontario, Canada. Due to a lack of environmental control and regulations at that time, it was common for mines to dispose of theirwaste into adjacent lakes and land depressions, concentrating metals and metalloids in sensitive aquatic ecosystems. In order to examine what impacts, if any, these century-old, arsenic-rich mine tailings are having on present-day aquatic ecosystems, we sampled diatom assemblages in lake surface sediment in 24 lakes along a gradient of surface water arsenic contamination (0.4-972 mu g/L). In addition, we examined sedimentary Cladocera and chironomid abundances and community composition, as well as open-water zooplankton communities and chlorophyll-a concentrations in10 of these study lakes along a gradient of arsenic contamination (0.9-1113 mu g/L). Our results show that present-day arsenic concentration is not a significant driver of biotic community composition of the organisms we studied, but instead, that other variables such as lake depth and pHwere more important in structuring assemblages. These results suggest that, while legacy contamination has greatly increased metal concentration beyond historical conditions, variability in lake-specific controls among the study lakes appear to be more important in the structuring of diatom, Cladocera, chironomidae, and zooplankton in these lakes.

Soil quality is a key indicator to infer about the environmental sustainability of Brazilian ethanol production. Our objective was to quantify the effects of the most common LUC sequence associated with sugarcane expansion (i.e., native vegetation to pasture to sugarcane) on chemical attributes in tropical soils. Soil sampling was carried out in three study sites located in central-southern Brazil, primary sugarcane region of production and expansion of the world. Overall, long-term conversions from natural ecosystems to extensive pasturelands decreases available P, S, Ca, Mg and B contents. In addition, the LUC leads to soil acidification and decreases of CECpH7, indicating that pasturelands have poor soil chemical quality. The LUC from pasture to sugarcane increases soil nutrient levels and reduces the soil acidity due to inputs of lime and fertilizers. Despite that, increments of available P and base saturation are necessary to achieve ideal soil chemical conditions to sugarcane growth. Overall, our findings suggest that sugarcane expansion in Brazil replacing pasturelands will promotes improvements on soil chemical quality. Nevertheless, sugarcane expansion can be associated with management strategies to increase soil organic matter and improve the soil fertility, reducing the environmental and economic costs associated with ethanol production in Brazil.

AB  - Management prescriptions for contemporary ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl.) forests often incorporate the restoration to a structure that more closely resembles pre European contact forests. Successful restoration programs should incorporate the herbaceous understory component; however, published research specifically addressing changes in understory species composition is minimal. Ponderosa pine influence on the undercanopy environment may be an important factor in understory vegetation distribution. In this study, we addressed the relationships among ponderosa pine abundance, undercanopy environment, and understory species composition and made inferences with respect to restoration potential. Data representing vegetation, soil, and environmental attributes were measured in 28 plots in an eastern Oregon ponderosa pine forest. Relationships among the parameters measured were evaluated using cluster analysis, indicator species analysis, and ordination. Ponderosa pine occupancy was inversely related to understory perennial bunchgrass abundance and species diversity and appeared to regulate the undercanopy habitat through alterations in light intensity, nitrogen availability, and soil temperature. Light availability was the most important ponderosa pine influenced undercanopy environmental parameter associated with understory vegetation distribution. These data suggested that degradation in the undercanopy environment associated with higher levels of ponderosa pine abundance may be temporary and that restoration practices that reduce pine occupancy should promote undercanopy conditions favorable to perennial bunchgrass growth. However, understory vegetation recovery in stands with excessive pine ingrowth may be constrained by desired understory species loss or invasion by more competitive understory vegetation.

AB  - The invasion of hydrilla into North American lakes has provoked concern over loss of native flora and fauna and resulted in costly suppression efforts. We used two data sets to determine if common measures of ecosystem health; abundance, species richness, diversity and evenness, were affected by the presence of hydrilla. Data Set 1 consisted of 27 Florida lakes, 11 of which had hydrilla present for approximately 4-8 years in varying abundances, and 16 did not have hydrilla. Given the number of lakes, each was sampled only once in the summers of 1986-1990 for community measures of aquatic plants, birds, and fish. Data Set 2 consisted of 12 lakes, six with abundant hydrilla for over 23 years and six without hydrilla. These lakes were sampled every year in the summer (with a few exceptions due to weather conditions) between 1999 and 2006 for community measures of aquatic plants and fish. The results for both data sets show that presence of hydrilla had no statistically significant effect (P > 0.05) on all community measures tested (i.e., richness, diversity, abundance). Our conclusions support the hypothesis that hydrilla in these Florida lakes has occupied a mostly vacant ecological niche and has not affected the occurrence or relative composition of native species of aquatic plants, birds, and fish. Because pond experiments have found negative effects of hydrilla, further focused research is needed to assist management decisions when considerable resources are to be spent each year on hydrilla suppression.

AB  - Scale surface microstructure of reptiles are multifarious. There are macro- and micro-structural features such as sharp spines, leaf-like microornamentation and pores. However, the argument on whether they indicate taxonomic relationship or convergent evolution is still open as well as their effect on wettability or dirt shedding. Here we show a comparison of scale microstructure in closely related Natrix natrix and Natrix tessellata which differ in ecological niches. We found marginal denticulations on the distal boundary of the Oberhautchen cells and two types of micropores; Type I covers the surface of Oberhautchen cells and Type II covers the epidermal folds of hinge regions. Type I micropores are longitudinal grooves on dorsal scale surface while they are rounded on the surface of the gastrosteges. Type II are similar both inter and intra-specifically. Our results are in line with previous studies that indicated an inverse ratio between pore number and wettability. We found no qualitative significance in terms of microstructural features. Our findings support the hypothesis saying that microornamentation is indicator of phylogenetic relations. Yet, only a few models of scale surface microstructure which are shaped by the environmental conditions could have been generalized which indicates that Oberhautchen cells as simple elementary morphological structures are highly plastic and species-specific studies can be considered as special cases. Apart from contribution to an old "nature-nurture controversy", we anticipate our assay to be a comparative perspective of the multifunctional integument of widely distributed Natrix sp.

AB  - Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a popular and valuable species used in many different biomedical research areas. The complex behavior that fish exhibit in response to different stimuli allows researchers to explore the biological and pharmacological basis of affective and mood disorders. In this sense, anxiety is commonly studied in preclinical research with animal models in rodents. During the last decade, those models have been successfully adapted to zebrafish. Stressful stimuli, such as novel environments, chemical substances, light conditions, and predator images, can trigger defensive behaviors considered indicators of an anxiety-like state. In the first stage, models were adapted and validated with different stressors and anxiolytic drugs with promising results and are now successfully used to generate scientific knowledge. In that sense, zebrafish allows several routes of administration and other methodological advantages to explore the anxiolytic effects of natural products in behavioral tests as novel tank, light-dark chamber, and black/white maze, among others. The present work will review the main findings on preclinical research using adult zebrafish to explore anxiolytics effects of natural products as plant secondary metabolites such as flavonoids, alkaloids and terpenes or standardized extracts of plants, among others. Scientific literature confirms the utility of zebrafish tests to explore anxiety-like states and anxiolytic-like effects of plant secondary metabolites, which represent a useful and ethical tool in the first stages of behavioral.

AB  - Various types of pollutants derived from rapid industrialization and urbanization have largely threaten biodiversity and functioning of freshwater ecosystems globally. Morphological plasticity, especially body size-associated traits, is considered a functional response to water pollution in species, as such changes are often directly related to functioning of freshwater ecosystems through dynamics of food webs. However, detailed dynamics of pollution impacts on morphological plasticity remain largely unknown, particularly in the wild. Here, we used the model planktonic rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus to assess morphological response to chemical pollution in a river reach disturbed by sewage discharges. Multiple analyses showed dynamic morphological response to water pollution in wild B. calyciflorus populations. The distance between anterior lateral spines, lorica length, and egg short diameter were the most sensitive morphological indicators to water pollution, while spine length was stable in varied pollution conditions. Interestingly, body size and egg size were increased with accentuated water pollution, suggesting that wild populations maintain fitness by increasing feeding efficiency and reducing vulnerability to predation and ensure survival by producing large newborns in polluted environments. Total ammonia nitrogen was the leading nitrogen pollutant affecting body size, while total phosphorus and elements of Mn and As were the key factors relating to egg size. The results obtained here provide new sights into biological consequences of environmental pollution in the wild, thus advancing our understanding of pollution impacts on structure and functioning of freshwater ecosystems.

AB  - Globally, freshwater ecosystems are under threat. The main threats come from catchment land-use changes, altered water regimes, eutrophication, invasive species, climate change and combinations of these factors. We need scientific research to respond to these challenges by providing solutions to halt the deterioration and improve the condition of our valuable freshwaters. This requires a good understanding of aquatic ecosystems, and the nature and scale of changes occurring. Macrophytes play a fundamental role in aquatic systems. They are sensitive indicators of ecosystem health, as they are affected by run-off from agricultural, industrial or urban areas. On the other hand, alien macrophytes are increasingly invading aquatic systems all over the world. Improving our knowledge on the ecology and management of both native and alien plants is indispensable to address threats to freshwaters in order to protect and restore aquatic habitats. The International Aquatic Plants Group (IAPG) brings together scientists and practitioners based at universities, research and environmental organisations around the world. The main themes of the 15th symposium 2018 in New Zealand were biodiversity and conservation, management, invasive species, and ecosystem response and restoration. This Virtual Special Issue provides a comprehensive review from the symposium, addressing the ecology of native macrophytes, including those of conservation concern, and highly invasive alien macrophytes, and the implications of management interventions. In this editorial paper, we highlight insights and paradigms on the ecology and management of native and alien macrophytes gathered during the meeting.

AB  - The Tennessee Valley Authority conducted a Baseline Ecological Risk Assessment (BERA) for the Kingston Fossil Plant ash release site to evaluate potential effects of residual coal ash on biota in Watts Bar Reservoir, Tennessee. The BERA was in response to a release of 4.1 million m(3) of coal ash on December 22, 2008. It used multiple lines of evidence to assess risks for 17 different ecological receptors to approximately 400000m(3) of residual ash in the Emory and Clinch rivers. Here, we provide a brief overview of the BERA results and then focus on how the results were used to help shape risk management decisions. Those decisions included selecting monitored natural recovery for remediation of the residual ash in the Emory and Clinch rivers and designing a long-term monitoring plan that includes adaptive management principles for timely adjustment to changing conditions. This study demonstrates the importance of site-specific ecological data (e.g., tissue concentrations for food items, reproductive data, and population data) in complex ecological risk assessments. It also illustrates the value of the US Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) data quality objectives process in building consensus and identifying multiple uses of results. The relatively limited adverse effects of this likely worst-case scenario for ash-related exposures in a lotic environment provide important context for the USEPA's new coal combustion residue disposal rules.

AB  - Although our knowledge of the spatial distribution of stream organisms has been increasing rapidly in the last decades, there is still little consensus about trait-based variability of macroinvertebrate communities within and between catchments in near-pristine systems. Our aim was to examine the taxonomic and trait based stability vs. variability of stream macroinvertebrates in three high-latitude catchments in Finland. The collected taxa were assigned to unique trait combinations (UTCs) using biological traits. We found that only a single or a highly limited number of taxa formed a single UTC, suggesting a low degree of redundancy. Our analyses revealed significant differences in the environmental conditions of the streams among the three catchments. Linear models, rarefaction curves and beta-diversity measures showed that the catchments differed in both alpha and beta diversity. Taxon- and trait-based multivariate analyses also indicated that the three catchments were significantly different in terms of macroinvertebrate communities. All these findings suggest that habitat filtering, i.e., environmental differences among catchments, determines the variability of macroinvertebrate communities, thereby contributing to the significant biological differences among the catchments. The main implications of our study is that the sensitivity of trait-based analyses to natural environmental variation should be carefully incorporated in the assessment of environmental degradation, and that further studies are needed for a deeper understanding of trait-based community patterns across near-pristine streams.

AB  - Robust predictions of stream solute concentrations expected under natural (reference) conditions would help establish more realistic water quality standards and improve stream ecological assessments. Models predicting solute concentrations from environmental factors would also help identify the relative importance of different factors that influence water chemistry. Although data are available describing the major factors controlling water chemistry (i.e., geology, climate, atmospheric deposition, soils, vegetation, topography), geologic maps do not adequately convey how rocks vary in their chemical and physical properties. We addressed this issue by associating rock chemical and physical properties with geological map units to produce continuous maps of percentages of CaO, MgO, S, uniaxial compressive strength, and hydraulic conductivity for western United States lithologies. We used catchment summaries of these geologic properties and other environmental factors to develop multiple linear regression (LR) and random forest (RF) models to predict base flow electrical conductivity (EC), acid neutralization capacity (ANC), Ca, Mg, and SO4. Models were derived from observations at 1414 reference-quality streams. RF models were superior to LR models, explaining 71% of the variance in EC, 61% in ANC, 92% in Ca, 58% in Mg, and 74% in SO4 when assessed with independent observations. The root-mean-square error for predictions on validation sites were all <11% of the range of observed values. The relative importance of different environmental factors in predicting stream chemistry varied among models, but on average rock chemistry > temperature > precipitation > soil atmospheric deposition > vegetation > amount of rock/water contact > topography.

AB  - Small mammals are widely used as suitable indicators of environmental pollution and genotoxic damage.
   The present investigation of the karyotype sensitivity to the influence of a strong mutagen was held under strictly controlled laboratory conditions. The data about the chromosome aberrations induced by treating of Mitomycin C (3.5 mg/kg) in bone marrow cells have been analyzed. The structural changes in the chromosomes including laboratory white mice ICR as well as five species small rodents-Clethrionomys glareolus (Schreber, 1780), Apodemus flavicollis (Melchior, 1834), Microtus levis (Miller, 1908), Mus spicilegus (Petenyi, 1882) originating from Rila Natural Park, Vitosha Nature Park, Kresna Gorge and the vicinities of Pleven region were compared.
   The analysis was performed according to the protocol described by Preston et al. (1987).
   All treated groups of small mammals investigated showed significantly higher percentage of damaged cells in comparison with their own untreated controls (P >= 0.99).
   Rodent species under present investigation have presented significantly lower sensitivity of their chromosome set when compared to the laboratory mice ICR (P >= 0.99). The lowest chromosome aberrations value (in %) was expressed within the specimens in Microtus arvalis (10.29 +/- 0.38) while the highest sensitivity was shown in Mus spicilegus (21.5 +/- 3.03). In the four other species investigated quite close values about the number of induced chromosome aberrations were expressed. These findings have important implications for the use of zoomonitors as bioindicators in ecotoxicology and in application of genotoxicity findings in laboratory animal models to natural populations.

AB  - Three diatom ecological guilds were distinguished based on their potential to tolerate nutrient limitation and physical disturbance, i.e. a low profile, high profile, and motile guild. The guild distributions were examined along nutrient and flow disturbance gradients and across habitats in two extensively sampled streams. The guilds showed distinct distributional patterns, i.e. the low profile guild was favored in nutrient-poor and high disturbance habitats; the high profile guild reached a maximum in nutrient-rich sites and in conditions of low flow disturbance; and the motile guild increased along the nutrient gradients and decreased along the disturbance gradient. Guild distribution was habitat-specific: the low profile guild dominated the epipsammon, the high profile guild showed preference for epilithon and epiphyton, and the motile guild-for epipelon. The highest guild diversity was observed at high nutrient levels across all habitats, at higher flow disturbance levels, and in the epipelon and epiphyton. Comparisons of species, guild, and environmental distances, derived from species counts, guild abundance, and physico-chemical data, respectively. revealed high congruence between species-environment and guild-environment correlations. The predictable behavior of the three ecological guilds along nutrient and disturbance gradients, and across major benthic habitats elucidates the functional value of different diatom growth morphologies in species-environment interactions and suggests a potential use in ecological assessments of human-impacted ecosystems.

AB  - Implementing management actions to achieve environmental outcomes requires defining and quantifying ecological targets, but this is a complex challenge, and there are few examples of how to quantitatively set them in complex dynamic marine ecosystems. Here we develop a methodology to devise 'desired state' for tropical seagrasses in Cleveland Bay, northern Australia, in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. Analysis of diverse species assemblages was used to define seagrass communities as indicators of the region's ecological value. Multivariate regression trees assigned 8000 observations of species presence/absence and habitat characteristics from 2007 to 2017 into seven community types. Generalized Linear Models were used to assess annual variation in above-ground biomass of each seagrass community. Reference subsets of the data expressing high biomass and spatial extent were identified, and desired state was defined as the mean and 95% confidence intervals. This approach rests on the assumption that seagrass resilience and its ecosystem services are ma when the diverse seagrass communities reach desired state. This method required a data set that spanned a range in seagrass conditions, but which may have been compromised by a history of pressures. Our method for defining desired state provides evidence-based targets that can be used within an adaptive management framework that prioritises and implements management actions.

AB  - Five water samples from three sources, two municipal reservoirs in central North Carolina and Toolik Lake in Alaska, were processed to conduct a comparative survey of microbial small subunit rDNA sequences. Genomic DNA was extracted and amplified by PCR using universal SSU rDNA primers to generate 16S and 18S rDNA clone libraries and 50 clones from each library were sequenced and placed in operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Through this recovery and analysis of SSU rRNA genes, a metagenomic profile of the microbial community emerged for each environmental sample. Analyses of these profiles, including species diversity estimates and rank-abundance curves, revealed that approximately 64% of prokaryotic OTUs and 80% of eukaryotic OTUs were novel. Diversity estimates were consistent with predicted ecosystem characteristics: they were greater for the mesotrophic to eutrophic temperate lakes, than for the oligotrophic arctic lake. Sample comparisons showed that community similarity declined as geographic distance between sites increased. Real-time quantitative PCR results showed that OTUs which had been recovered from only one library were actually present in other samples, but at much lower frequencies, suggesting that many, if not most, microorganisms are cosmopolitan. Together, these results support the potential value of using the microbial community as an indicator of local environmental conditions. In other words, it may be realistic to monitor water quality using a single, comprehensive suite of microorganisms by analyzing patterns of relative abundance. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Establishing robust estimates of polar marine biodiversity is important for interpreting future changes in the Arctic; however, despite a recent increase in scientific expeditions, this region remains relatively underexplored. Particularly overlooked in biodiversity assessments are small species, such as protists, fungi, and many small invertebrates that are collectively known as meiofauna. These species contribute to the foundation of food webs and are crucial for the survival of larger species that are economically and socially important. The application of high-throughput sequencing methodologies has proven effective for biomonitoring small metazoan species but has sparingly been applied in the Arctic. We used a metabarcoding approach to assess the diversity of sea ice and sediment-associated metazoans from Utqiagvik (Barrow), Alaska. Sea ice and sediment samples were collected six times over eight months (January through August) encompassing three seasons (winter, spring, and summer) from polar night to ice-out in August. Biodiversity was assessed as both richness and community composition by incorporating incidence data and phylogenetic distance. Environmental conditions associated with ice, sediment, water, and snow were measured and tested for possible correlations with biodiversity estimates. We found a high number of taxa distributed locally, suggesting that metabarcoding can be effectively applied to Arctic biomonitoring programs. In addition, these results show that season and habitat are significant predictors of meiofaunal biodiversity, supporting hypotheses that meiofauna can be used as a valuable indicator of climate change.
