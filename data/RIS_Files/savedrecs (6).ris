AB  - Rapid economic development has a significant negative impact on the rural ecological environment. Evaluating the ecological environmental effect of land use and its change trend at the village scale has important practical significance for maintaining ecological functions and ensuring ecological safety. Taking a typical village in Yudian Town as an example, we applied a land-use ecological environment effect evaluation and the CA-Markov change trend prediction model and constructed an index of ecological environmental effect status. Based on the land use, resource environment, and social economic data from 2014 and 2019, we evaluated the ecological environmental effects of land use in each village, simulated the land-use change in each village in two different scenarios, i.e., the developmental orientation (DO) and ecological orientation (EO), in 2030, and analyzed the corresponding change trend of the land-use effect. The ecological environmental effect of land use showed obvious characteristic differentiation in villages with different development levels. For example, villages with poor natural geographic background conditions and slower economic development had a good level of ecological environmental effect, whereas villages with better resource and environmental endowments but faster economic development had lower levels of ecological environmental effect. Village land-use management methods have had a certain effect on improving ecological security, but the effect has been slow. In conclusion, the research results portray the relationship between rural land use and ecological environmental effects in low hilly areas in northern Hubei at a small scale and have reference value for land resource allocation and spatial pattern optimization in similar regions.

AB  - The business environment and cluster development in given economy have a defining role for the development, maintenance and enhancement of national competitiveness and this has been proven repeatedly in theory and in practice. Cluster development in Bulgaria started with some delay compared to the other European countries. In Bulgaria, companies even though being a member of a cluster, they do not fully realize their advantages in terms of competition and joint efforts. The reason is that clusters in Bulgaria are still in a process of building efficient internal interactions between their members. The study focuses on the way and the extent the state of business environment and cluster development foster national competitiveness in the case of Bulgaria and selected Central and Eastern European EU member states countries. For the purposes of the study of business environment the Diamond Model of Michael Porter is employed and it is carried out through the World Economic Forum's indicators of Global Competitiveness Reports. Both, business environment and the level of cluster development in Bulgaria are evaluated in a comparative context with selected Central and Eastern European EU member states countries. The results of the study show domination of limitations and obstacles to enhancing national competitiveness. We may conclude that the state of the business environment, the level of cluster development, and their interaction are not very favourable for more intensive competitive development of Bulgarian economy.

AB  - We examined the reproductive potential of the anchovy, Engraulis japonicus, based on the data of adult maturation and the feeding environment in the southeastern and southwestern coastal waters of the Korean Peninsula during early spawning season of 20062009. Salinity and Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration displayed significant yearly and regional differences (p<0.01 for both). The mean densities of the copepods, gonad somatic index (GSI), and condition factor (CF) of the anchovy were higher in 2008 than in 2006, 2007, and 2009 (p<0.001). GSI and CF were higher in the southwestern area than in the southeastern area (p<0.001). Half of the females were mature at 8.6 cm FL in 2008 and 9.39.5 cm FL in 2006, 2007, and 2009. Positive relationships (p<0.05) between CF and the copepods density in the same month and CF and GSI with a one-month time lag revealed that anchovy reproduction potential in the southern coastal waters of Korea is related to changes in the feeding environment and through their energy reserves, showing evidence of the bottom-up effects.

AB  - A system of five adjacent Posidonia oceanica meadows facing the waterfront of Genoa city (Ligurian Sea, NW Mediterranean) was investigated over different spatial scales (meters-kilometers) using three environmental indices: conservation index (CI), substitution index (SI) and phase-shift index (PSI). CI revealed differences mostly at large spatial scale, distinguishing the poor condition of the meadows closest to Genoa centre and harbour from the comparatively healthy condition of the farthest meadows. SI showed differences mostly at small spatial scale (i.e., within meadows), suggesting the influence of local factors in the re-colonisation of regressed meadows by the seagrass Cymodocea nodosa and/or the invasive alga Caulerpa racemosa. Mapping of PSI showed that the meadows closest to Genoa centre and harbour have undergone a nearly total phase shift and have no real potential for recovery: attempts to re-establish P. oceanica there might be a waste of time and money. On the contrary, the meadows farthest from Genoa centre and harbour showed a comparatively low level of phase shift and could still fully recover given specific management actions.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR GAS TURBINES AND POWER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
LA  - English
CP  - 37th International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exposition
AB  - The fault diagnostic process for gas turbine engines can be improved if data acquired by an on-board engine monitoring system (EMS) are utilized effectively. In the commercial transport field, techniques are available to extract engine condition assessment information from steady-state EMS data. In a military environment, steady-state data are not always available, and therefore it is desirable to exact at least some of the information from transient data, such as during take-off. Fault signatures are presented for an F404 engine based on fault implant tests in a sealevel-static (SLS) lest cell. A comparison is then made between the fault coverage capabilities of fault diagnostic techniques based on the use of steady-state engine data with those using transient data. The important conclusions to emerge from this work are that for the range of faults examined, not only is there similar fault information contained within the transient date, but the faults can be detected with increased sensitivity using these data.

AB  - Water quality monitoring data are usually used independently to report on the condition of streams and watersheds. For example, watersheds are often rated as good, fair, or poor with regard to a single stressor or with regard to an index of biotic integrity. The utility of monitoring data may be enhanced by integrating stressor-response information with the observed stressor data, and reporting stressor levels in terms of their relative effects upon valued ecological resources. We estimated stressor-response relationships at the regional scale using data collected in the Eastern Cornbelt Plains Ecoregion of Ohio. Generalized additive models were used to visualize stressor-response relationships. Piecewise linear functions and simple linear functions were then used to parameterize the observed responses. Parameters derived from the regional models were used to scale observations of stressors in the Big Darby Creek watershed, OH. After scaling, stressors were compared in terms of their spatial distribution and in terms of the severity with which they influenced the biological endpoint of interest. Stressors most strongly associated with the current ecological condition of the watershed were identified. In the Big Darby Creek watershed, decreases in substrate quality were associated with the most severe decrements in biological condition. At smaller decrements in biological condition, three stressors were important: substrate quality, riparian quality, and increased concentrations of NOx.

AB  - Pollen assemblages closely reflect the local vegetation that characterizes the salinity status, providing useful analogs for paleoecologxical reconstruction in regional deposits. Palynological evidences of surface sediments from the Coringa mangrove wetland were correlated with the physicochemical and sediment salinity records to observe the relationship between them. The statistical analysis of the data obtained here revealed a marked horizontal salinity gradient from north to south.. In this study, ordination (detrended correspondence analysis) of palynomorph groups has identified a salinity gradient of 1.1 to 3.0 PSU from the north to the south in the wetland. High palynomorph deposition and lower salinity are observed along channel margins due to the mixing of estuarine water during the rainy season. The mudflats along the transects show a lower diversity of plants in the pollen record and high total dissolved solids (TDS) than commonly found in the coastal wetlands. The presence of scrubby halophytic vegetation in the upper saltmarsh and oligohaline-freshwater vegetation in the low tidal saline marshes is a zonation pattern related to the localized influence of freshwater conditions. Palynomarine Index (PMI) reveals the highest freshwater/tidal inundation along Ramannapalem due to the presence of numerous riverine channels while the remaining part of the wetland has restricted tidal inundation leading to the conversion of mangrove forests to salt pans and paddy fields. Thus, the health and productivity of the mangrove ecosystem are also governed by hydrodynamics, catchment land use, water discharge in the channels, and tidal flushing.

AB  - The hazard posed by poorly treated effluent from agro-food treatment plant has been a growing concern to environmentalists and regulatory bodies. This study is aimed at benchmarking fresh water utilization and assessing the treatment efficiency of an agro-food wastewater treatment plant in Lagos, Nigeria based on biophysicochemical characterization. Water utilization analysis and benchmarking were initially conducted to determine areas with significant water saving potentials. Influent and effluent samples were collected daily for six months (September 2016 to February 2017) and analyzed for 25 biophysicochemical pollution indicators. Results were compared with Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency (LASEPA) guidelines for industrial effluent. Significant improvements were recorded for all the assessed biophysicochemical parameters. The treatment plant was adjudged satisfactory with all assessed parameters falling within permissible limits and average removal efficiencies ranged from 4.78% to 96.9%. However, plant overloading resulting from high water intensity and inadequate plant monitoring accounted for the low removal efficiencies recorded for some parameters. Given the current performance, significant improvements in areas such as freshwater management, routine plant monitoring and adjustment of hydraulic loading rates are necessary to optimize the plants' operation in line with standard practice.

AB  - Although numerous techniques have been developed to monitor autophagy and to probe its cellular functions, these methods cannot evaluate in sufficient detail the autophagy process, and suffer limitations from complex experimental setups and/or systematic errors. Here we developed a method to image, contextually, the number and pH of autophagic intermediates by using the probe mRFP-GFP-LC3B as a ratiometric pH sensor. This information is expressed functionally by AIPD, the pH distribution of the number of autophagic intermediates per cell. AIPD analysis reveals how intermediates are characterized by a continuous pH distribution, in the range 4.5-6.5, and therefore can be described by a more complex set of states rather than the usual biphasic one (autophagosomes and autolysosomes). AIPD shape and amplitude are sensitive to alterations in the autophagy pathway induced by drugs or environmental states, and allow a quantitative estimation of autophagic flux by retrieving the concentrations of autophagic intermediates.

AB  - Artisanal fishery in the lagoon of Venice is a multi-target activity with an old tradition. It was the only fishing activity since a new one with most features of an industrial fishery flourished following the introduction of the Manila clam in 1983. To compare the two fishing activities, a set of ecosystem indicators (landings, catches, discards, biomass of the system, mean Trophic Level of the system and exergy) obtained by a model approach, was applied. The model used was a mass-balance model of the lagoon ecosystem developed with the software package Ecopath with Ecosim. The 73 scenarios obtained by changing the fishing effort of the two different fisheries were used to explore the impact of fishing activity on the ecosystem. The results showed that the two activities are strongly interrelated, even if they do not exploit the same resources, and that the mechanical clam harvesting is the driving force able to affect the ecosystem state fundamentally. All this produces a strong conflict between the two kinds of fisheries. The ecosystem and social optimisation depend mainly upon a reduction of clam fishery, while the optimisation of the economic aspects is strictly linked to the maintenance of this fishing activity.

AB  - We established superfluidity in a two-state mixture of ultracold fermionic atoms with imbalanced state populations. This study relates to the long-standing debate about the nature of the superfluid state in Fermi systems. Indicators for superfluidity were condensates of fermion pairs and vortices in rotating clouds. For strong interactions, near a Feshbach resonance, superfluidity was observe for a broad range of population imbalances. We mapped out the superfluid regime as a function of interaction strength and population imbalance and characterized the quantum phase transition to the normal state, known as the Pauli limit of superfluidity.

AB  - BackgroundCoral reefs are facing unprecedented pressure on local and global scales. Sensitive and rapid markers for ecosystem stress are urgently needed to underpin effective management and restoration strategies. Although the fundamental contribution of microbes to the stability and functioning of coral reefs is widely recognised, it remains unclear how different reef microbiomes respond to environmental perturbations and whether microbiomes are sensitive enough to predict environmental anomalies that can lead to ecosystem stress. However, the lack of coral reef microbial baselines hinders our ability to study the link between shifts in microbiomes and ecosystem stress. In this study, we established a comprehensive microbial reference database for selected Great Barrier Reef sites to assess the diagnostic value of multiple free-living and host-associated reef microbiomes to infer the environmental state of coral reef ecosystems.ResultsA comprehensive microbial reference database, originating from multiple coral reef microbiomes (i.e. seawater, sediment, corals, sponges and macroalgae), was generated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing for 381 samples collected over the course of 16months. By coupling this database to environmental parameters, we showed that the seawater microbiome has the greatest diagnostic value to infer shifts in the surrounding reef environment. In fact, 56% of the observed compositional variation in the microbiome was explained by environmental parameters, and temporal successions in the seawater microbiome were characterised by uniform community assembly patterns. Host-associated microbiomes, in contrast, were five-times less responsive to the environment and their community assembly patterns were generally less uniform. By applying a suite of indicator value and machine learning approaches, we further showed that seawater microbial community data provide an accurate prediction of temperature and eutrophication state (i.e. chlorophyll concentration and turbidity).ConclusionOur results reveal that free-living microbial communities have a high potential to infer environmental parameters due to their environmental sensitivity and predictability. This highlights the diagnostic value of microorganisms and illustrates how long-term coral reef monitoring initiatives could be enhanced by incorporating assessments of microbial communities in seawater. We therefore recommend timely integration of microbial sampling into current coral reef monitoring initiatives.

AB  - The aim of our research was to estimate the effect of high temperatures on respiration rate, breathing condition and productivity of holstein cows in different production systems. The best values of air temperature (Tair), breathing frequency, Environmental Stress Index (ESI) and Heat Load Index (HU) among the investigated production systems were recorded on a farms with misting and ventilation systems. In the period of the hilliest thermal stress (12.00-16.00 pm), T-air did not exceed 29 degrees C , breathing rate - 77 breaths/min, ESI - 39.07 degrees C and HLI - 76.29. Least optimal for cow comfort values were found in the low cost housing: T-air - 33 degrees C, breathing rate - 82 breaths/min, ESI - 41.88 degrees C and HLI - 79.80. Intermediate values were observed at the open feedlots with shelters: T-air - 33 degrees C, breathing rate - 79 breaths/min, ESI - 41.18 degrees C and HLI - 77.98. For all types of production systems the average daily temperature rise to +27.7 degrees C became a significant stress factor for cows, which considerably influenced the dynamics of breathing rate, breathing severity, ESI and HLI values. It was established that keeping cows in facilities with misting and ventilation systems and on open feedlots, the Temperature-Humidity Index (THI), breathing rate and severity during the period of maximum temperature load (12.00-16.00 pm) were lower than that for low cost housing, The use of misting and ventilation systems allowed to minimise productivity losses during the period of thermal stress, which decreased by 2.67%, while for maintenance at feedlots the losses amounted to 9.22%, while in the low cost housing- 11.88%.

AB  - An Asset Health Index (AHI) is a tool that processes data about asset's condition. That index is intended to explore if alterations can be generated in the health of the asset along its life cycle. These data can be obtained during the asset's operation, but they can also come from other information sources such as geographical information systems, supplier's reliability records, relevant external agent's records, etc. The tool (AHI) provides an objective point of view to justify, for instance, the extension of an asset useful life, or to identify which assets from a fleet are candidates for an early replacement, or renovation, as a consequence of a premature aging. This paper describes how to build the AHI model as a continuous time simulation model, which is then implemented using Vensim simulation environment. This is done in order to: 1) improve model formulating robustness, 2) benefit of the outstanding software optimization features for AHI model parameters calibration; and 2) easy the provision of predictions for asset degradation, operational and capital investments risk under different possible exogenous scenarios and endogenous managerial options. The process of model building, and parameterization is applied to an industrial case of a regasification terminal. Several strategies involving major maintenance scheduling are compared in terms of total expenditure in assets over their life cycle. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The assessment of ecological environment during the large-scale development of islands is a major topic in the study of current coastal islands. Choosing the appropriate assessment method to evaluate the suitability of carrying capacity of islands and making relevant suggestions are significant to the sustainable development of islands. Ecological footprint method is used to analyze the ecological carrying capacity of Pingtan Island (PI) from 2005 to 2016 for promoting the coordinated rational development and construction and ecological environment of the island. Although PI is in rapid urban development and construction, the island maintains secure and stable ecological conditions. PI is used as a research case to analyze the sustainable development of the ecological environment through the carrying capacity of the island ecosystem.

TI  - Analysing inter-relationships among water, governance, human development variables in developing countries
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
LA  - English
AB  - The "Integrated Water Resources Management" principle was formally laid down at the International Conference on Water and Sustainable development in Dublin 1992. One of the main results of this conference is that improving Water and Sanitation Services (WSS), being a complex and interdisciplinary issue, passes through collaboration and coordination of different sectors (environment, health, economic activities, governance, and international cooperation). These sectors influence or are influenced by the access to WSS. The understanding of these interrelations appears as crucial for decision makers in the water sector. In this framework, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission (EC) has developed a new database (WatSan4Dev database) containing 42 indicators (called variables in this paper) from environmental, socio-economic, governance and financial aid flows data in developing countries. This paper describes the development of the WatSan4Dev dataset, the statistical processes needed to improve the data quality, and finally, the analysis to verify the database coherence is presented. Based on 25 relevant variables, the relationships between variables are described and organised into five factors (HDP - Human Development against Poverty, AP - Human Activity Pressure on water resources, WR - Water Resources, ODA - Official Development Aid, CEC - Country Environmental Concern). Linear regression methods are used to identify key variables having influence on water supply and sanitation. First analysis indicates that the informal urbanisation development is an important factor negatively influencing the percentage of the population having access to WSS. Health, and in particular children's health, benefits from the improvement of WSS. Irrigation is also enhancing Water Supply service thanks to multi-purpose infrastructure. Five country profiles are also created to deeper understand and synthetize the amount of information gathered. This new classification of countries is useful in identifying countries with a less advanced position and weaknesses to be tackled. The relevance of indicators gathered to represent environmental and water resources state is questioned in the discussion section. The paper concludes with the necessity to increase the reliability of current indicators and calls for further research on specific indicators, in particular on water quality at national scale, in order to better include environmental state in analysis to WSS.

AB  - During late spring through summer of 1994 and 1995, 290 randomly selected stream sites in Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri were sampled once for several parameters including conductivity, turbidity, total phosphorus, nitrate-nitrite nitrogen, the index of biotic integrity, and a habitat index. Based on landscape data from watersheds that were delineated for each sampling location, interrelationships were examined between these water quality parameters and land use/land cover, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and vegetation phenological metrics derived from the NDVI. Statistically significant relationships were found between NDVI values and the derived metrics with the stream condition parameters (r values to 0.8, alpha = 0.05). The NDVI or vegetation phenological metrics (VPMs) were more highly correlated to the selected stream condition parameters than were the land use/land cover proportions. Knowledge of the general land use/land cover setting within the watersheds, however, was important for interpreting these relationships. The most common variables associated with the stream data were early spring NDVI values or VPMs associated with the date of onset of greenness. These results demonstrate the utility of NDVI and VPMs as broad-scale environmental indicators of watershed conditions.

AB  - Key global indicators of biodiversity decline, such as the IUCN Red List Index and the Living Planet Index, have relatively long assessment intervals. This means they, due to their inherent structure, function as late-warning indicators that are retrospective, rather than prospective. These indicators are unquestionably important in providing information for biodiversity conservation, but the detection of early-warning signs of critical biodiversity change is also needed so that proactive management responses can be enacted promptly where required. Generally, biodiversity conservation has dealt poorly with the scattered distribution of necessary detailed information, and needs to find a solution to assemble, harmonize and standardize the data. The prospect of monitoring essential biodiversity variables (EBVs) has been suggested in response to this challenge. The concept has generated much attention, but the EBVs themselves are still in development due to the complexity of the task, the limited resources available, and a lack of long-term commitment to maintain EBV data sets. As a first step, the scientific community and the policy sphere should agree on a set of priority candidate EBVs to be developed within the coming years to advance both large-scale ecological research as well as global and regional biodiversity conservation. Critical ecological transitions are of high importance from both a scientific as well as from a conservation policy point of view, as they can lead to long-lasting biodiversity change with a high potential for deleterious effects on whole ecosystems and therefore also on human well-being. We evaluated candidate EBVs using six criteria: relevance, sensitivity to change, generalizability, scalability, feasibility, and data availability and provide a literature-based review for eight EBVs with high sensitivity to change. The proposed suite of EBVs comprises abundance, allelic diversity, body mass index, ecosystem heterogeneity, phenology, range dynamics, size at first reproduction, and survival rates. The eight candidate EBVs provide for the early detection of critical and potentially long-lasting biodiversity change and should be operationalized as a priority. Only with such an approach can science predict the future status of global biodiversity with high certainty and set up the appropriate conservation measures early and efficiently. Importantly, the selected EBVs would address a large range of conservation issues and contribute to a total of 15 of the 20 Aichi targets and are, hence, of high biological relevance.

AB  - The manure produced by livestock animals across all of Japan is approximately 90 million tonnes a year, which represents approximately 25% of the overall biomass of Japan's natural resources. In recent decades, the supply of the livestock animal compost has decreased due to various factors a decrease in fodder, decrease in deserted cultivated land and increase in the importation of fodder while the domestic animal manure portion of the livestock waste and associated increases have risen dramatically. Most of this manure leads to negative environmental effects by increasing nitrogen (N) loads in rainfall events and causing excess fertilisation, especially in agricultural areas. Animal manure accounts for approximately 23% of all categories of waste in Japan and 89% of all livestock waste in Japan. This 89% of livestock waste is generally utilised as compost or fertiliser. In Japan, the oversupply of fertiliser has already been identified as a problem in the field of agriculture. To address these issues, we assessed the two-dimensional (2D) concentration distribution of N in a water system to specifically analyse the effect of livestock contamination. From the results of this analysis, we observed that industrial factory wastewater creates a narrow localised impact, while the livestock industry creates a medium/broad impact. Therefore, this study provided a simultaneous representation of the total and specific impacts of both human and livestock activities under typical rural catchment conditions. The difference between the environmental impact index value of the current situation and the policy effect was quantitatively assessed. These results will contribute to the construction of a practical decision-making method. Additionally, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, a widely expanded network of protected areas and/or efforts to provide corridors to ease species movement may be necessary to achieve more globally sustainable practices.

AB  - The proliferation of air-diffused microorganisms inside public buildings such as schools, hospitals, and universities, is often indicated as a possible health risk. In this research, we have illustrated the results of an investigation realized to determine the health of the air in some university classrooms, both from a microbiological and a microclimatic viewpoint, during the normal didactic activity of direct lessons. The results obtained have been expressed by means of contamination indices, already used in previous works. Very little contamination was recorded in the different phases of air treatment, which underlines the efficiency of the system and of the maintenance protocols. The Global Index of Microbial Contamination (GIMC per cubic meter) showed a value greater than the mean during the heating period (290), while the highest values (95th percentile 1,138.45) were recorded in the period using air conditioning. The index of mesophilic bacterial contamination, though it did not show any significant differences in the various modes of air treatment, showed a mean value (1.34) and the 95th percentile value (4.14), which was greater in the air-conditioning phase. Finally, the mean value of the amplification index underlined a decrease in the microbial contamination in comparison to the outside, while showing situations of increased microbial amplification during the period of simple ventilation (95th percentile 4.27). The 95th percentile values found for GICM in the three sampling periods, however, permitted us to identify the value of GIMC per cubic meter equal to 1,000 as a guide to provide a means of self-monitoring the quality of the air inside the classrooms. From a microclimatic viewpoint, two periods of the year manifested discomfort situations: during the heating phase (winter) and during the simple ventilation phase (spring). The results obtained indicate, therefore, a need to intervene on the environmental parameters, not being able, in this particular case, to intervene on other aspects that influence the microclimate.

AB  - Observations indicate that although average temperatures in Central Asia showed almost no increases from 1997 to 2013, they have been in a state of high variability. Despite the lack of a clear increasing trend, this 15 year period is still the hottest in nearly half a century. Precipitation in Central Asia remained relatively stable from 1960 to 1986 and then showed a sharp increase in 1987. Since the beginning of the 21st century, however, the increasing rate of precipitation has diminished. Dramatic changes in meteorological conditions could potentially have a strong impact on the region's natural ecosystems, as some significant changes have already occurred. Specifically, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of natural vegetation in Central Asia during 1982-2013 exhibited an increasing trend at a rate of 0.004 per decade prior to 1998, after which the trends reversed, and the NDVI decreased at a rate of 0.003 per decade. Moreover, our results indicate that shrub cover and patch size exhibited a significant increase in 2000-2013 compared to the 1980s-1990s, including shrub encroachment on grasslands. Over the past 10 years, 8% of grassland has converted to shrubland. Precipitation increased in the 1990s, providing favorable conditions for vegetation growth, but precipitation slightly reduced at the end of the 2000s. Meanwhile, warming intensified 0.93 degrees C since 1997 compared to the average value in 1960-1997, causing less moisture to be available for vegetation growth in Central Asia.

AB  - The rapid increase in urbanization due to population growth leads to the degradation of vegetation in major cities. This study investigated the spatial patterns of the ecoenvironmental conditions of inhabitants of two distinct Asian capital cities, Beijing of China and Islamabad of Pakistan, by utilizing Earth observation data products. The significance of urban vegetation for the cooling effect was studied in local climate zones, i.e., urban, suburban, and rural areas within 1-km(2) quantiles. Landsat-8 (OLI) and Gaofen-1 satellite imagery were used to assess vegetation cover and land surface temperature, while population datasets were used to evaluate environmental impact. Comparatively, a higher cooling effect of vegetation presence was observed in rural and suburban zones of Beijing as compared to Islamabad, while the urban zone of Islamabad was found comparatively cooler than Beijing's urban zone. The urban thermal field variance index calculated from satellite imagery was ranked into the ecological evaluation index. The worst ecoenvironmental conditions were found in urban zones of both cities where the fraction of vegetation is very low. Meanwhile, this condition is more serious in Beijing, as more than 90% of the total population is living under the worst ecoenvironment conditions, while only 7% of the population is enjoying comfortable conditions. Ecoenvironmental conditions of Islamabad are comparatively better than Beijing where similar to 61% of the total population live under the worst ecoenvironmental conditions, and similar to 24% are living under good conditions. Thus, Islamabad at this early growth stage can learn from Beijing's ecoenvironmental conditions to improve the quality of living by controlling the associated factors in the future. (C) The Authors.

AB  - Land use is considered one of the most serious drivers of biodiversity change. Aquatic macrophytes are sensitive to changes occurring within their physical habitat and respond at different scales to the effects of land use. Our main objective was to evaluate the effects of multiple land uses on macrophyte diversity. For that, we surveyed aquatic macrophyte richness and cover, in addition to local (water parameters and canopy cover) and landscape (land use and land cover) environmental variables. We evaluated 30 aquatic ecosystems and the results showed canopy cover was negatively correlated with temperature and land use gradient, indicating this parameter reflects land use change within sites. Species richness was affected negatively by canopy cover. Forest cover loss could change macrophyte microhabitats, increasing light resources that favor species that otherwise would not be able to occur there. Species composition was related negatively with canopy cover and water turbidity, and positively related to pH. Three species were selected as indicators of change in canopy cover, which reflects land use change within the sites. Land use change favors mostly emergent and amphibious species, and some species belonging to other life-forms that show adaptations and niche requirements that are benefited by it. Macrophyte communities could be experiencing succession, in which the appearance of invasive species could be the onset of a reduction in diversity as land use consequences become abrasive. We recommend different aspects of macrophyte communities (e.g. species richness, composition, life-form diversity, presence of invasive species, and taxon-specific niche requirements) to be considered when creating indexes of integrity, and when making management decisions regarding the preservation of Amazonian freshwater ecosystems, due to their great potential as indicators, and in order to maintain overall aquatic biodiversity.

AB  - Urbanisation has become a severe threat to pristine natural areas, causing habitat loss and affecting indigenous animals. Species occurring within an urban fragmented landscape must cope with changes in vegetation type as well as high degrees of anthropogenic disturbance, both of which are possible key mechanisms contributing to behavioural changes and perceived stressors. We attempted to elucidate the effects of urbanisation on the African lesser bushbaby, Galago moholi, by (1) recording activity budgets and body condition (body mass index, BMI) of individuals of urban and rural populations and (2) further determining adrenocortical activity in both populations as a measure of stress via faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) levels, following successful validation of an appropriate enzyme immunoassay test system (adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) challenge test). We found that both sexes of the urban population had significantly higher BMIs than their rural counterparts, while urban females had significantly higher fGCM concentrations than rural females. While individuals in the urban population fed mainly on provisioned anthropogenic food sources and spent comparatively more time resting and engaging in aggressive interactions, rural individuals fed almost exclusively on tree exudates and spent more time moving between food sources. Although interactions with humans are likely to be lower in nocturnal than in diurnal species, our findings show that the impact of urbanisation on nocturnal species is still considerable, affecting a range of ecological and physiological aspects.

AB  - Water temperature is considered both a controlling and lethal factor in coastal ecosystems, influencing behavioral and physiological responses in marine organisms. Abrupt weather events such as severe cold front passages and accompanied changes in weather conditions have led to sharp decreases in water temperatures, metabolic stress, and incidences of mortality in marine organisms. In this paper, we assess the weather-related factors associated with physical and biological response in South Florida systems through historical sea surface temperature (SST) from satellites and the use of a synoptic climatology spanning over 30 years. We utilize previous categorizations of sea-level pressure and newly developed categorizations of 850-mb temperature reanalysis data to define circulation and temperature patterns across the southeastern US and adjacent Gulf of Mexico. Systematic connections are seen between particular circulation and temperature patterns characteristic of enhanced north-to-south circulation and cold air outbreaks, SST, and turtle strandings data over the Florida Panhandle region for the period 2006-2013. Identified weather forcing variables associated with sharp SST decreases and turtle stuns are presented and assist in the formulation of a moving cold-stress index for South Florida coastal ecosystems. Results demonstrate the potential of using synoptic climatological analysis and derived indices for tracking and modeling changes in SST and other indicators related to biological health.

AB  - The relative importance of agricultural land retirement on water quality and aquatic-community health was investigated in the Minnesota River Basin. Eighty-two sites, with drainage areas ranging from 4.3 to 2200 km(2), were examined for nutrient concentrations, measures of aquatic-community health (e. g., fish index of biotic integrity [IBI] scores), and environmental factors (e. g., drainage area and amount of agricultural land retirement). The relation of proximity of agricultural land retirement to the stream was determined by calculating the land retirement percent in various riparian zones. Spearman's rho results indicated that IBI score was not correlated to the percentage of agricultural land retirement at the basin scale (p = 0.070); however, IBI score was correlated to retired land percentage in the 50- to 400-m riparian zones surrounding the streams (p < 0.05), indicating that riparian agricultural land retirement may have more influence on aquatic-community health than does agricultural land retirement in upland areas. Multivariate analysis of covariance and analysis of covariance models indicated that other environmental factors (such as drainage area and lacustrine and palustrine features) commonly were correlated to aquatic-community health measures, as were in-stream factors (standard deviation of water depth and substrate type). These results indicate that although agricultural land retirement is significantly related to fish communities as measured by the IBI scores, a combination of basin, riparian, and in-stream factors act together to influence IBI scores.

AB  - Marine mussels Mytilus sp. were transplanted on a monthly basis in cages over one year to oyster farms and harbours in the Arcachon Bay ( France) in order to assess the water quality of the bay. Contaminant levels (organotin compounds, trace metals, PCBs and PAHs) were measured in tissues of transplanted mussels and mussels from a reference station, along with physiological parameters of the mussels ( condition indexes, lipid content and dry weight). Four biomarkers (AChE: acetylcholinesterase activity, GST: gluthathione S-transferase activity, CAT: catalase activity and TBARS: thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance content) were also monitored. The remote stations monitored ( oyster parks) exhibited no accumulation pattern of pollutants. Their respective concentrations therefore constitute a background level of the contamination in the bay ([TBT] = 30 ng Sn g(-1) dw, [SigmaHAPs] = 100 ng g(-1) dw, [SigmaPCBs] = 35 ng g(-1) dw). The elevated chemical contamination of the largest harbour of the bay, the Arcachon harbour, can be interpreted in terms of persistence of organotin compounds ([SigmaOTs] = 1500 - 2000 ng Sn g(-1) dw) and PAHs ([SigmaHAPs] = 4500 - 5000 ng g(-1) dw) in sediments and, to a lesser extent, of direct inputs of copper ([Cu] = 20 mug g(-1) dw in harbours versus 7 in oyster parks) and petrogenic PAHs ([methylphenanthrenes] = 1600 ng g(-1) dw in the dockyard versus 170 at the gas stations), related to the use of copper-based antifouling paints and to dockyard activity, respectively. However, the Arcachon Bay presents a low contamination level by PCBs and metals, including harbour stations. Furthermore, higher levels of other PAHs ( particularly alkyl PAHs such as methylphenanthrenes/1600 ng g(-1) dw) not included in the 16 PAHs from the EPA priority list ( usually studied in biomonitoring programmes/ 1500 ng g(-1) dw) in the Arcachon harbour underline the need to integrate these compounds in biomonitoring of highly PAH-polluted areas such as harbours in order to avoid misinterpretation of the biological responses observed. Biomarker responses were not able to discriminate the different chemical contamination levels recorded in the Arcachon Bay and rather reflected changes in environmental factors. Furthermore, the strong intraspecies variability of biological responses could be due to genetic differences of mussels from the Arcachon Bay. It is the first time that such an integrated monitoring is performed in the Arcachon Bay, also taking into account seasonal variations of chemical contents and biomarkers levels in mussel tissues.

AB  - The amount of potentially toxic chemicals in a fish depends on various environmental factors, such as temperature and feeding ecology, which can be affected by Global Changes (GC). The main objective of the present work was to study the relative influence of temperature, food quality and food availability on the growth and contamination of juveniles of common sole (Solea solea), a marine flatfish species known to be a relevant indicator of the nursery quality. It focuses on two Persistent Organic Pollutants (CB153 and L-PFOS) of legacy and emerging concern, respectively. To achieve this, we used a toxicokinetic (TK) model in which toxicant flows are mechanistically predicted using a bioenergetic model based on the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory. This modelling framework was applied to juvenile sole from the Gironde estuary (SW France) and allows accounting for the influence of environmental conditions on fish biological processes involved in toxicant fluxes. To compare their respective influence on model predictions of age, length, and contamination at puberty, we included in a global sensitivity analysis: (1) environmental variability gathered from literature for this particular estuary and (2) TK parameters (i.e. assimilation efficiency AE and elimination rate (k) over dot(e)) variability and uncertainty gathered from literature about each contaminant but for different fish species and experimental conditions. Then, model predictions were confronted to fish contamination measurements from the Gironde Estuary with different combinations of TK parameter values from literature. Results highlighted a key role of diet composition on fish contamination and growth while water temperature only affected growth. It stressed the need to focus on GC impact on benthic communities and their consequences on juvenile fish diet for future work on GC scenarios. Furthermore, for both chemical, the range of variability of TK parameters from experiments led to underestimated fish contaminations. The best model fits were obtained using TK parameter values from model applications: from Mounier et al. for CB153 (Solea solea, experiment, AE= 0.8 and =0 d(-1)) and from de Vos et al. (2008) for PFOS (food chain of the Western Scheldt estuary, The Netherlands, AE = 0.8 and (k) over dot(e)=0.8 10(-2) d(-1)).

AB  - Sulfur is an element commonly occurring in the environment. It is present in the atmosphere, in the hydrosphere, and in live organisms; it is one of the most important physicochemical and geological indicators. Depending on the natural conditions, sulfur compounds in the environment may play the role of electron acceptor or donor in the redox processes. These compounds influence the ion concentration and ion balance in benthic sediments. They also determine the speciation, bioavailability and toxicity of heavy metals. Comprehensive knowledge of the processes mediated by sulfur can be a valuable source of information about the past and present state of the ecosystem.

AB  - Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) disposal is currently one of the major environmental issues in big cities. Several tools and techniques have been developed for Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of MSW disposal options, including scoping, checklists, matrices, qualitative and quantitative models and decision-support systems. Rapid Impact Assessment Matrix (RIAM) is a partially new method which is particularly advantageous over others as it provides a transparent and permanent record of analysis process at the same time organizing the EIA procedure, which in turn considerably reduces the time taken in executing EIAs. Using this method, the EIA has been carried out on different MSW disposal options including present landfill, composting, recycling, sanitary landfill and incineration in Mashhad (northeast of Iran) and it has been found that the sanitary landfill is the best recommended option under the existing circumstances. The EIA results show that the most important negative impact of the landfill operation is leachate leakage through layers which can lead to groundwater pollution. To mitigate this effect, the Industrial Waste Evaluation Model (IWEM) of United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) was used to assess the possible risks associated with different types of liners. The results show that the single liner is the best alternative among lining options which can provide protective conditions against leachate seepage in Mashhad's landfill.

AB  - This article describes and tests a systems theory-based policy indicators model. The framework is used to examine propositions about linkages between states' ecological-spatial characteristics and subsequent selected solid waste management (SWM) -related environmental policies. It was hypothesized that state characteristics of: (1) population density (used as a garbage-per-land area index), (2) population convergence within urban areas, and (3) percent population change in the interval 1980-1985, could jointly explain state variation in both the number and the vigor of SWM policy outputs. Greater levels of spatial pressure were proposed to be related directly to more numerous, more convincing policies. Proposals are grounded in the literature of organizational search theory, crisis stimulation, and technological pressure.
   Results revealed that the sociospatial model in fact could explain a reasonable proportion of policy variation across states. However, not all hypotheses are supported. Population change shows an indirect, rather than the anticipated direct, relationship with policy output levels. In addition, when used in the model as a pollution intensity index, population density failed to contribute significantly to an explanation of differences in state SWM policy levels. The analysis raises questions about changes occurring over time in the nature and direction of linkages between sociospatial measures and policy responses. This study suggests that strengthening policy indicator models may require questioning key assumptions and theoretical bases, conducting longitudinal studies, and factoring in political, economic, and other policy environment forces.

AB  - Are the distribution of Mazocraes alosae and its impact on the host similar between Alosa alosa and A. fallax according to their resemblances? Parasites were numbered on each gill of shads sampled in North-East Atlantic coastal waters and connected rivers. Their impact on host condition was measured using girth, gonado-somatic ratio, C/N ratio, and Fulton's K. Prevalence and mean intensity of M. alosae were significantly higher for A. alosa than for A. fallax, including in sympatric conditions. The mean intensity varied among sites whatever fish species; it was higher in coastal-estuarine versus fresh waters only for A. fallax. The distribution of M. alosae was aggregated in the host population whatever species. At the host individual level, some gills (second and third for A. alosa, second for A. fallax) were significantly more inhabited than others, probably in relation with larger water volumes flowing on these gills and mazocraeid sedentary lifestyle. Despite high prevalence and intensity, no negative impact of M. alosae was demonstrated on the host condition whatever the index considered. Our study underlines the major occurrence of M. alosae on shads and the potential use of such benign parasite as biological tag to discriminate closely related host species.

AB  - Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are important industrial brominated flame retardants. PBDEs have raised great concerns for their persistence, bioaccumulation, and harm to aquatic life and human health. Pentabromodiphenyl ether (PeBDE), octabromodiphenyl ether (OcBDE), and decabromodiphenyl ether (DeBDE) are three main commercial PBDEs congeners. In this study, published ecotoxicity data of these three PBDEs congeners for Chinese freshwater species were collected, and several acute and chronic toxicity tests for the three PBDEs congeners were performed. Using the derivation method for aquatic life criteria developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), we determined that the criterion maximum concentration (CMC) for PeBDE, OcBDE and DeBDE for protection of freshwater organisms were 0.0492 mg/L, 0.197 mg/L and 0.239 mg/L, respectively. The criterion continuous concentration (CCC) for PeBDE, OcBDE and DeBDE were 0.0103 mg/L, 0.0224 mg/L and 0.0267 mg/L, respectively. The results provided a good reference for the derivation of PBDEs' water quality criteria and a basis for ecological risk assessment of PBDEs. In addition, the results of species sensitivity distribution comparison showed that the toxicity rank of five brominated flame retardants was TBBPA > PeBDE > OcBDE > DeBDE > HBCD.

AB  - In Europe the monitoring of lakes with regard to benthic diatoms is still conducted in line with the European Water Framework Directive. Ribbon lakes are a special case as extremely steep slopes of the lake basin cause their littoral zone to be narrow. The Durowskie ribbon lake was chosen as a model for the assessment of the ecological status of waters based on its Diatom Index. Given its use in recreation, it is under heavy anthropogenic pressure. Physicochemical and biological parameters were monitored in the peak of the vegetational season (July, August) between 2010 and 2018 at 12 varied littoral sites across the full length of the shoreline. This long-term analysis of the Diatom Index, despite showing an improvement in the quality of water, demonstrated the ecological state of Lake Durowskie to be weak (southern, deep part) to moderate (north, shallow part). The taxonomic structure of diatoms (referral and indicator taxa) in phytobenthos communities allowed to show the changes in physicochemical parameters of the environment such as pH, oxygen dissolved in water and its trophic status. Research results are shown in relation to the anthropogenic changes to the lake's direct catchment area and the results of the physicochemical monitoring of waters.

AB  - New concepts have emerged in theoretical ecology with the intent to quantify complexities in ecological change that are unaccounted for in state-and-transition models and to provide applied ecologists with statistical early warning metrics able to predict and prevent state transitions. With its rich history of furthering ecological theory and its robust and broad-scale monitoring frameworks, the rangel and discipline is poised to empirically assess these newly proposed ideas while also serving as early adopters of novel statistical metrics that provide advanced warning of a pending shift to an alternative ecological regime. We review multivariate early warning and regime shift detection metrics, identify situations where various metrics will be most useful for rangeland science, and then highlight known shortcomings. Our review of a suite of multivariate-based regime shift/early warning indicators provides a broad range of metrics applicable to a wide variety of data types or contexts, from situations where a great deal is known about the key system drivers and a regime shift is hypothesized a priori, to situations where the key drivers and the possibility of a regime shift are both unknown.

AB  - The United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) must characterize potential risks to human health and the environment associated with manufacture and use of thousands of chemicals. High-throughput screening (HTS) for biological activity allows the ToxCast research program to prioritize chemical inventories for potential hazard. Similar capabilities for estimating exposure potential would support rapid risk-based prioritization for chemicals with limited information; here, we propose a framework for high-throughput exposure assessment. To demonstrate application, an analysis was conducted that predicts human exposure potential for chemicals and estimates uncertainty in these predictions by comparison to biomonitoring data. We evaluated 1936 chemicals using far-field mass balance human exposure models (USEtox and RAIDAR) and an indicator for indoor and/or consumer use. These predictions were compared to exposures inferred by Bayesian analysis from urine concentrations for 82 chemicals reported in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Joint regression on all factors provided a calibrated consensus prediction, the variance of which serves as an empirical determination of uncertainty for prioritization on absolute exposure potential. Information on use was found to be most predictive; generally, chemicals above the limit of detection in NHANES had consumer/indoor use. Coupled with hazard HTS, exposure HTS can place risk earlier in decision processes. High-priority chemicals become targets for further data collection.

AB  - The insects of the order Odonata have been widely used as bioindicators of environmental quality in different types of ecological research. In general, the taxonomic level used is the species, but higher taxa, such as the family, have received less attention. Assuming that higher taxa can reproduce the impacts that occur at the species level, we use facets of diversity at the community to assess if Odonata families could be an efficient tool for the assessment of environmental impact in Amazon streams. We first assessed to what extent each family retains ecological information from the ecological diversity of the species of the suborder (Anisoptera or Zygoptera). We then quantified the degree of congruence between different taxonomic levels in the Odonata. Next, we evaluated the effects of environmental integrity on the facets of diversity of the families. Finally, we evaluated whether ecological thresholds can be detected using a family-level approach. We sampled adult odonates in 98 streams in the eastern Amazon, in the municipalities of Paragominas, Santare ' m, and Belterra, in the Brazilian state of Par ' a. The habitat integrity index (HII) was used to assess the environmental integrity of each stream. The congruence between the different taxonomic levels was evaluated using a Procrustes analysis. The degree of correlation of diversity facets was evaluated between families and each suborder. Linear mixed models and matrix regressions were used to measure the influence of environmental integrity on the diversity facets of the families. Higher-level ecological thresholds were detected using the TITAN analysis. The results of the analyses indicated a high degree of congruence between species-level and higher levels (family and suborder). The ability of the families to represent the diversity facets of the suborder is influenced by the abundance of individuals and the number of species in the family. The environmental integrity of the streams affects the facets of diversity of the families systematically, although cumulative measurements, such as abundance, appeared to be more advantageous as biomonitoring tools. The similarity of the responses observed at species and family levels supports the use of odonate families for the detection of ecological thresholds in stream environments. The sum of the evidence indicates that a family-level approach is effective for the identification of alterations in the environmental integrity of streams, providing valuable insights into the facets of diversity of the odonate community. The adoption of a family-level approach in environmental monitoring programs could optimize the investment of resources, in particular through the identification of specimens by non-specialists, permitting a significant increase in sampling effort and replication.

AB  - The present study aims at understanding the prospective groundwater zones in eastern Dehradun valley and its surroundings region based on integrated remote sensing and field data. High-Panchromatic (PAN) and medium-Linear Image Self Scanning (LISS)-III resolution data from Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) have been used to understand the process of occurrence and movement of groundwater, parameters such as lithology/rock types, structures, land cover, drainage density were interpreted on satellite images in conjunction with field data. Well data have been collected for the post monsoon season from different government departments of the Uttarakhand state and it has been validated on field. Based on Well data, different maps like static water table, aquifer thickness, well discharge, well specific capacity and well yield factor were generated. Subsequently, all the remotely and field acquired layers were integrated in the GIS environment using index overlay method. The weights/scores to different parameters and themes have been assigned depending upon their importance. As an outcome, groundwater prospect map of the study area is prepared. The results show that the groundwater prospective zones are essentially located in the inter-montane Doon valley, especially in the lower part under semi confined to confined conditions. Productive aquifers in the study area are mostly confined to the lower part of Doon valley fan and to the active flood or alluvial plains of major rivers i.e., Song and Jakhan Rao wherein the groundwater mainly occurs in unconfined and semi-confined conditions. It indicates that the groundwater flow is towards the song river in the lower Doon valley fan and later towards the river Ganga. Thus, results clearly present the groundwater behavior of the study area which may form valuable input for researchers and planners in the context of future planning and strategy for water resource management.

AB  - A total of 129 wheat cultivars collected from local breeders in four ecological regions in China was evaluated for Fusarium head blight resistance after natural infection under epidemic conditions. The disease index was scored and seven toxins concentrations were determined by UPLC-MS/MS. The disease index ranged from 6.3 to 80.9% and a strong correlation was found between the regions from which the cultivars originate and disease index. The middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River Region showed the highest disease resistance, followed by the upper reaches of the Yangtze River Region. FHB resistance of cultivars from northern and southern Huanghuai Region was lowest and all cultivars in these regions are highly or moderately susceptible. Disease index was significantly correlated with toxin accumulation on nation scale, but no clear correlation was found within most ecological regions. The toxin accumulation was also not well correlated with resistant levels. As the incidence of FHB has increased dramatically over the last decade, improved FHB resistance in cultivars is urgently needed. We recommend that besides scoring for disease index also mycotoxin accumulation in cultivars is incorporated in breeding procedures and the evaluation of cultivars.

AB  - The objective of this study was to observe the relationship between levels of family environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). Clinical datr AHI, lower oxygen saturation, longer apnea time, and lower ventilation time (p < 0.05). There was a correlation between EST and OSAHS. Compared with non-exposa of 209 patients who visited the respiratory department were retroactively collected. The data entailed gender, age, body mass index (BMI), family environmental smoke exposure, medical history, Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) score, and polysomnography (PSG) indicators. Two groups of patients were studied: ETS-exposed group and non-ETS-exposed group. Using the apnea hypopnea index (AHI), OSAHS patients were classified as mild (5 <= AHI <= 15), moderate (15 < AHI <= 30), and severe (AHI > 30). There were 148 cases in the OASHS group and 61 cases in the normal group. 56.66% of the OASHA group were ETS-exposed patients, which was significantly higher than that the normal group ETS-exposure of 31.57% . Compared to the OSAHS patients unexposed to ETS, the OSAHS patients with EST exposure had a greater degree of lethargy, greateed, the EST-exposed group was more susceptible to OSAHS, and the longer the time, the more severe the condition.

AB  - Species' functional traits are closely related to ecosystem processes through evolutionary adaptation, and are thus directly connected to environmental changes. Species' traits are not commonly used in palaeoecology, even though they offer powerful advantages in understanding the impact of environmental disturbances in a mechanistic way over time. Here we show that functional traits of testate amoebae (TA), a common group of palaeoecological indicators, can serve as an early warning signal of ecosystem disturbance and help determine thresholds of ecosystem resilience to disturbances in peatlands. We analysed TA traits from two Sphagnum-dominated mires, which had experienced different kinds of disturbances in the past 2000 years -fire and peat extraction, respectively. We tested the effect of disturbances on the linkages between TA community structure, functional trait composition and functional diversity using structural equation modelling. We found that traits such as mixotrophy and small hidden apertures (plagiostomic apertures) are strongly connected with disturbance, suggesting that these two traits can be used as palaeoecological proxies of peatland disturbance. We show that TA functional traits may serve as a good proxy of past environmental changes, and further analysis of trait-ecosystem relationships could make them valuable indicators of the contemporary ecosystem state.

AB  - The progressive nature of osteoarthritis is manifested by the dynamic increase of degenerated articular cartilage, which is one of the major characteristics of this debilitating disease. As articular chondrocytes become exposed to inflammatory stress they enter a pro-catabolic state, which leads to the secretion and activation of a plethora of proteases. In aim to detect the disease before massive areas of cartilage are destroyed, various protein and non-protein biomarkers have been examined in bodily fluids and correlated with disease severity. This review will discuss the widely research extracellular degraded products as well as products generated by affected cellular pathways upon increased protease activity. While extracellular components could be more abundant, cleaved cellular proteins are less abundant and are suggested to possess a significant effect on cell metabolism and cartilage secretome. Subtle changes in cell secretome could potentially act as indicators of the chondrocyte metabolic and biological state. Therefore, it is envisioned that combined biomarkers composed of both cell and extracellular-degraded secretome could provide a valuable platform for testing drug efficacy to halt disease progression at its early stages.

AB  - The aim of this work is to evaluate the heavy metal and metalloids contents in indicator lichens inside two nature reserves situated within the Tver region that has a complex infrastructure and large number of industrial zones. Inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission spectral analysis is used to test for the gross and average ratio of 17 metals and metalloids (Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ge, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sn, Ti, V, Zn) in Hypogymnia physodes lichen samples. The average content of the most elements identified in samples from Zavidovo National Park (ZNP) is higher than in the samples from Central Forest State Nature Biosphere Reserve (CFSNBR). There are such metals as titanium, copper, arsenic, cobalt, molybdenum, and tin among them. Differences are the result of different levels and regimens of air moisture saturation, localization of working production plants, degree of anthropogenic transformation of the territory. Spatial distribution of areas with much higher metal concentrations on reserve territory is resulted apparently from variation in air humidity to large extent. In ZNP addiction between qualitative and quantitative metal impact is defined more clearly by level and character of artificial territory transformation. Moreover, in ZNP wide marshy and forest areas in valley on the Lob' river were identified, which have conservation importance as they are characterized by lack or very low concentrations of many metals. So it would be useful to take advantage while zoning and correction of regimes.

KW  - WEATHER
AB  - Microclimate in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne 'Caravelle') was monitored for 3 years to identify environmental conditions associated with brown patch (Rhizoctonia solani) outbreaks and to develop a weather-based disease-warning model. The micrometeorological parameters measured were ambient air temperature, relative humidity, leaf wetness duration, precipitation, soil temperature, soil moisture, and solar radiation. Brown patch outbreaks were confirmed by the visual presence of foliar R. solani mycelium. An environmental favorability index (E) was developed to relate a combination of environmental conditions with brown patch outbreaks. The initial index (E(6)) was based on relative humidity (RH greater than or equal to 95% for greater than or equal to 8 h; mean RH greater than or equal to 75%), leaf wetness duration (greater than or equal to 6 h) or precipitation (greater than or equal to 12 mm), and minimum air (greater than or equal to 16 degrees C) and soil (greater than or equal to 16 degrees C) temperatures. Further analyses, however, revealed that an equally effective E was provided by a two-variable regression model (E(2)) The E(2) model is E = -21.5 + 0.15RH + 1.4T - 0.033T(2), in which RH is the mean relative humidity and Tis the minimum daily air temperature. For both E(6) and E(2) models, a threshold value (i.e., E greater than or equal to 6) constituted a brown patch warning. Brown patch outbreaks were predicted by both models with 85% accuracy over a 3-year period. All major infection events were predicted. In 1993, the warning model was used to field evaluate fungicide performance in perennial ryegrass and colonial bentgrass (Agrostis tenuis 'Bardot'). There were equivalent levels of blighting between the warning model and a 14-day calendar-based spray schedule, but the warning schedule provided a 29% reduction in fungicide applications.

AB  - Functional diversity has emerged as a relevant aspect in the ecosystem studies; several indexes have been used for its evaluation. However, these indexes have not considered the functional redundancy among species, even when its implication in forest resilience facing natural and anthropogenic disturbances have been recognized. In this study an index for functional diversity, considering functional redundancy, is proposed and applied to know changes in functional diversity types according to its disturbance responses, in sites under different disturbance levels, in a microphyll semi-deciduous forest. The probability theory was used to derive a functional biodiversity index from the Simpson biodiversity index. The sensitivity of the index in relation to changes in the individual, species and functional type number was analyzed and compared with other indexes proposed in literature. The less functional diversity value was found in highly disturbed sites, and the highest value in the less disturbed sites. Results confirmed that in less disturbed sites, individuals were more uniformly distributed inside the species and these inside the functional types, than those individuals found in highly disturbed areas; it confers the system a superior functional redundancy. It is concluded that the proposed index is, besides, a good reference of the resilience in a forest ecosystem, and the forest management oriented to keep the functional diversity, as it is interpreted, is a guaranty for the conservation of the forest resilience and integrity.

AB  - In this work, a novel simple and sensitive detection method for lysozyme based on the surface plasmon resonance of gold nanoparticles has been developed. The lysozyme aptamer constantly immobilized on the surface of gold nanoparticles via a thiol functional group is the recognition element of lysozyme and a stabilizer of this system. The presence of lysozyme leads to the red-shift of the resonance wavelength of gold nanoparticles in accordance with its concentration. Two factors lead to the red spectral shift of gold nanoparticles, which are the increase of the refractive index in the environment surrounding the gold nanoparticles and the aggregation of gold nanoparticles. A critical point is distinguished from the spectral shift as a function of lysozyme concentration, where the dominant power influencing the redshift is transferred from the first one to the second one with the increase of lysozyme concentration. The limit of detection for lysozyme in this study is 0.054 nM, with a linear calibration ranging from 0.347 nM to 2.431 nM under the optimal usage conditions of 0.1250 nM thiol-aptamer functionalized gold nanoparticles. Therefore, this thiol-aptamer functionalized gold nanoparticle method provides a selective detection strategy for lysozyme and generates a great promising application.

AB  - In order to study the effect of ascorbic acid foliar application and limited irrigation on quantitative and qualitative characteristics of corn, an experiment was conducted in research field of Islamic Azad University, Varamin Branch in Iran during 2012 growing season. The experimental design was laid out in a randomized complete, block with a split plot arrangement of treatments in three replications. Main plot included four different levels of irrigation (complete irrigation, irrigation withholding at 8-leaf stage, irrigation withholding at silks appearance stage and irrigation withholding, at both 8-leaf stage and silks appearance stages) and different concentration of foliar application of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) (0, 75 and 150 ppm) was allocated to sub-plots. The results showed that irrigation withholding conditions in different growth stages significantly decreased plant height, yield components, seed yield, biological yield, harvest index, oil and protein percentage and oil and protein yield. Ascorbic acid foliar application in irrigation withholding in different growth stages had positive effect on all attributes in this experiment. In general, the results of the present study indicate that usage of AsA reduces the harmful effects of water deficit stress and increases resistance to drought stress in corn plant.

AB  - The U.S. Department of Agriculture-Natural Resources Conservation Service has recommended domestic cattle grazing exclusion from riparian corridors for decades. This recommendation was based on a belief that domestic cattle grazing would typically destroy stream bank vegetation and in-channel habitat. Continuous grazing (CG) has caused adverse environmental damage, but along cohesive-sediment stream banks of disturbed catchments in southeastern Minnesota, short-duration grazing (SDG), a rotational grazing system, may offer a better riparian management practice than CG. Over 30 physical and biological metrics were gathered at 26 sites to evaluate differences between SDG, CG, and nongrazed sites (NG). Ordinations produced with nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) indicated a gradient with a benthic macroinvertebrate index of biotic integrity (IBI) and riparian site management; low IBI scores associated with CG sites and higher IBI scores associated with NG sites. Nongrazed sites were associated with reduced soil compaction and higher bank stability, as measured by the Pfankuch stability index; whereas CG sites were associated with increased soil compaction and lower bank stability, SDG sites were intermediate. Bedrock geology influenced NMS results: sites with carbonate derived cobble were associated with more stable channels and higher IBI scores. Though current riparian grazing practices in southeastern Minnesota present pollution problems, short duration grazing could reduce sediment pollution if managed in an environmentally sustainable fashion that considers stream channel response.

AB  - Eutrophication can lead to an uncontrollable increase in algal biomass, which has repercussions for the entire microbial and pelagic community. Studies have shown how nutrient enrichment affects microbial species succession, however details regarding the impact on community functionality are rare. Here, we applied a metaproteomic approach to investigate the functional changes to algal and bacterial communities, over time, in oligotrophic and eutrophic conditions, in freshwater microcosms. Samples were taken early during algal and cyanobacterial dominance and later under bacterial dominance. 1048 proteins, from the two treatments and two timepoints, were identified and quantified by their exponentially modified protein abundance index. In oligotrophic conditions, Bacteroidetes express extracellular hydrolases and Ton-B dependent receptors to degrade and transport high molecular weight compounds captured while attached to the phycosphere. Alpha- and Beta-proteobacteria were found to capture different substrates from algal exudate (carbohydrates and amino acids, respectively) suggesting resource partitioning to avoid direct competition. In eutrophic conditions, environmental adaptation proteins from cyanobacteria suggested better resilience compared to algae in a low carbon nutrient enriched environment. This study provides insight into differences in functional microbial processes between oligo-and eutrophic conditions at different timepoints and highlights how primary producers control bacterial resources in freshwater environments. The data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD004592.

AB  - Esox lucius L. (northern pike) inhabits river, lake, and brackish water ecosystems of the temperate region in North America and Eurasia. In many areas of its native range, the species is confronted with human-induced disturbances that can affect local and regional genetic diversity. Conservation of genetic diversity constitutes an important policy objective. Therefore, we investigated how the genetic population structure and patterns suggestive of hybridisation among subpopulations from different catchments vary with the type of ecosystem (river vs. lake) and the integrity of the ecosystem assessed using ecological status assessments of the European Water Framework Directive and indices of the wetland quality (in rivers) and trophic state (in lakes).
   In total, 1,384 pike samples from the North, Baltic, and Black Sea drainages in Germany were analysed. We differentiated between metapopulations from each hydrogeographic region using genotypes from 15 microsatellites and mitochondrial cyt b sequences.
   Individual populations showed signs of genetic admixture ranging from almost zero to complete replacement by foreign genotypes originating from different catchments. Hierarchical general linear modelling revealed a significantly positive association of the degree of genetic hybridisation with decreasing ecological status. An eroded population substructure indicative of hybridisation was also significantly elevated in rivers relative to lakes and in heavily modified water bodies. Results were consistent when using ecological status assessments by the Water Framework Directive and an alternative environmental quality index based on the health of wetlands in rivers and trophic state in lakes.
   We speculate that macrophyte loss through loss of wetlands or in response to eutrophication fostered genetic mixing among different subpopulations, which were brought into secondary contact either due to stocking or due to natural dispersal from foreign catchments. Our findings suggest that anthropogenic alteration of freshwater ecosystems may influence the genetic structures present in a freshwater top piscivore at both local and regional scales.

AB  - The aim of this study is the assessment of desertification risk in a typical Mediterranean island, in the frame of climate change and the application of good agricultural practices (GAPs). Based on the MEDALUS Environmentally Sensitive Area Index (ESAI) approach, the sensitivity in desertification is estimated by employing 15 quantitative parameters divided in four main quality indices: climate, vegetation, soil and management quality. The methodology applied for a baseline scenario (current conditions), two future climate change scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) and a soil quality improvement scenario. According to the results, more than 13% of the island's area is characterized as critically sensitive to desertification in the current conditions. This percentage seems to be increased in the future under both the RCP 4.5 and the RCP 8.5 climate scenarios, where the critical areas will rise above to 15%. By applying, simultaneously with the climate change scenarios, the soil quality improvement scenario, a slight mitigation of desertification risk in the future could be achieved. The methodology developed in this study may be used to assess desertification process under various climate, soil and land use management scenarios in regions of the Mediterranean Sea.

However, local differences in reference conditions, human impacts and biological communities make developing suitable indices for different regions of the world necessary. Thus, our goal was to develop and validate a multimetric index based on macroinvertebrates to evaluate the ecological status of streams from the Basque Country (north Spain). For this, 22 lowland calcareous streams (7 reference and 15 disturbed) were monitored from 1993 to 2005. At each study site, a stress level was calculated based on human impacts. Fifty-three macroinvertebrate metrics were tested for their capability to discern stress level. Our multimetric index was calculated as the mean of six metrics - genus richness, IBMWP, abundance of Sel_EPTD, abundance of Sel_ETD', family richness of Sel_ETD and family richness of EPT. The index was split into five ecological status classes, ranging from 0 (bad ecological status) to 1 (high ecological status). This index was validated in 231 study sites in 108 streams of six different typologies, demonstrating suitability for application in biomonitoring and assessment studies in Basque streams.

AB  - It is costly to sample all air pollutants of a general community. Air sampling should be conducted based on a practical assessment strategy and monitoring plan. In Hong Kong, the Environmental Protection Department (HKEPD) launched an Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) certification scheme to grade workplace IAQ as 'Excellent' or 'Good' by measuring the levels of nine common indoor air pollutants, namely carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), respirable suspended particulates (RSP), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O-3), formaldehyde (HCHO), total volatile organic compounds (TVOC), radon (Rn), and airborne bacteria count (ABC). Although average office IAQ performance has been improved since the implementation of this certification scheme, there are still resource issues and technical difficulties. To streamline the assessment of office IAQ performance, this study proposes a simple index of IAQ benchmarks formulated in compliance with the HKEPD requirements. In particular, three of the nine listed common air pollutants were selected as the 'representatives' for the overall satisfactory IAQ. Together with the assessment results of 422 Hong Kong air-conditioned offices, the index was evaluated in terms of test sensitivity, specificity and predictive values. Proved to be feasible to describe the IAQ of some air-conditioned offices, this IAQ index would be a useful tool for policymakers, building owners and professionals to quantify IAQ performance in offices and to make decisions on resources and manpower management for efficient mitigation actions.

AB  - Digital holographic microscopy (DHM) is an important technique that may be used for quantitative phase imaging of unstained biological cell samples. Since the DHM technology is not commonly used in clinics or bioscience research labs, at present there is no well-accepted focusing criterion for unstained samples that users can follow while recording image plane digital holograms of cells. The usual sharpness metrics that are useful for auto-focusing of stained cells do not work well for unstained cells as there is no amplitude contrast. In this work, we report a practical method for estimating the best focus plane for unstained cells in the digital hologram domain. The method is based on an interesting observation that for the best focus plane the fringe pattern associated with individual unstained cells predominantly shows phase modulation effect in the form of bending of fringes and minimal amplitude modulation. This criterion when applied to unstained red blood cells shows that the central dip in the doughnut-like phase profile of cells is maximal in this plane. The proposed methodology is helpful for standardizing the usage of DHM technology across different users and application development efforts.
   Lay Description Digital holographic microscopy (DHM) is slowly but steadily becoming an important microscopy modality and gaining acceptability for basic bio-science research as well as clinical usage. One of the important features of DHM is that it allows users to perform quantitative imaging of unstained transparent cells. Instead of using dyes or fluorescent labelling, DHM systems use quantitative phase as a contrast mechanism which depends on the natural refractive index variation within the cell samples. Since minimal wet lab processing is required in order to image cell samples with a DHM, cells can be imaged in their natural state. While DHM is gaining popularity among users, the imaging protocols across the labs or users need to be standardized in order to make sure that the same quantitative phase parameters are used for tasks such as quantitative phased based cell classification.
   One of the important operational tasks for any microscopy work is to focus the sample under study. While focusing comes naturally to users of brightfield microscopes based on image contrast, the focusing is not straightforward when samples are unstained so that they do not offer any amplitude contrast. When performing quantitative phase imaging, defocus can actually change the phase profile of the cell due to near-zone (Fresnel) diffraction effects. So unless a standardized focusing methodology is used, it will be difficult for multiple DHM users (potentially at different sites) to agree on quantitative results out of their phase images. DHM literature has prior works which perform numerical focusing of recovered complex wave-field in the hologram plane to find the best focus plane. However such methods are not user friendly and do not allow user the same focusing experience as in a brightfield microscope. The numerical focusing is therefore a reasonably good method for an optics researcher but not necessarily so for a microscopy technician looking at cell samples with a DHM system in a clinical setting.
   The present work provides a simple focusing criterion for unstained samples that works directly in the hologram domain.
   The technique is based on an interesting observation that the when an unstained cell sample is in the best-focus plane, its corresponding hologram (or fringe pattern) predominantly shows phase modulation manifested by bending of fringes at the location of the cell. This criterion can be converted into a simple numerical method as we have used to find the best-focus plane using a stack of through focus holograms. We believe that the technique can be used manually by visually observing the holograms or can be converted to an auto-focus algorithm for a motorized DHM system.

AB  - The world's cultural and natural heritage has been gradually affected by climate change, and although the research agendas of many countries have included this reality since 2003, there is still an incipient approach to it, with analysis techniques used being limited. In addition, there are very few case studies that describe in detail the adaptation processes of spaces to these new conditions. The aim of this research is to identify the scientific production related to the impact of climate change on cultural and natural heritage indexed in the international databases Scopus and Web of Science (WoS), which will enable to establish maturity of the research on this subject. The methodology used for the analysis of the data obtained is bibliometric analysis; evaluative and relational measures are applied to a set of 78 articles (45 in Scopus and 33 in WoS) and to a joint base of 47 articles after deleting those articles that overlap in both databases. The result is a scientific mapping that enables observing of the evolution of knowledge generation in this field of study. The main findings show that research is incipient, with a large presence of transient authors with a single publication, the research is limited to the geographical scope of Europe and North America, neglecting many other areas, the impact which is measured by the citation of articles is very low, the relational measures corroborate that the thematic approach is new by identifying a high presence of isolated relationships among authors. The results obtained will be very useful for researchers working in this scientific area, as they can find a synthesis of scientific production in this document, allowing them to draw their own conclusions regarding the current gaps in research; constituting the starting point of their research, with the aim of filling these gaps.

AB  - This study was conducted to provide a better understanding of the relationship between foliar nutrient status, maple dieback and soil quality. Fieldwork was conducted in four maple stands, two of which were located in the Appalachians at Tingwick and two in the Laurentians at Duchesnay. All stands were characterised by a mound and depression microrelief. In one of the Tingwick maple stands (T-1) the predominant soil type was found on mounds, and was well to moderately well-drained (Leeds and Woodbridge series). At the other site (T-2), the predominant soil type was in depressions, and imperfectly to poorly drained (Sainte-Marie and Brompton series). At the first Duchesnay site (D-1) the predominant soil type was found on mounds and was well to rapidly drained (Ste Agathe series). At the second Duchesnay site (D-2), the predominant soil type was also found on mounds, but was well to moderately well-drained (Sergent series). On all sites, the soils were acidic and nutrient poor. The lowest pH values and nutrient concentrations (in the H-Ah horizons) were found in maple stands with well-drained soils (T-1 and D-1) (P < 0.05). On these sites, maple dieback was less than 10%. It was on the poorly to imperfectly drained soils at Tingwick (T-2), as well as on the moderately drained soils at Duchesnay (D-2), that we observed the lowest biological activity. Although these soils were the most nutrient rich, we observed foliar nutrient deficiencies, and maple dieback in excess of 25%. Our results suggest that maple dieback is the result of a poor physiological adaptation of sugar maple to poor drainage conditions in the areas studied.

AB  - In this 3-year study the suitability of the normalized differenced vegetation index (NDVI) to the evaluation of pea plant infestation by aphids and expected seeds yield was investigated. The effect was assessed in the conditions of the increasing doses of phosphorus fertilization (0, 70, and 140 kg P2O5 ha(-1)) and in the different pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris) occurrence on six various cultivars of pea. Independent of the dose, the phosphorus fertilization supported the occurrence of aphids on pea plants of Batuta, Model, and Protecta cultivars where in Tarchalska and Mecenas cultivars only the standard dose (70 kg ha(-1)) showed such effect. NDVI index was not clearly, unambiguously correlated to the intensity of A. pisum occurrence. Such factors as the deficiency or excessive amount of phosphorus, as well as meteorological conditions and the cultivar of host plant had the greater effect on its value than the presence of aphids. All this testifies that the NDVI index is not reliable indicator of aphid occurrence on pea, however it can offer a promising method to select the cultivars under sub-opitmal conditions. The seed yield was strongly related to agronomical factors (fertilization, cultivars) and plant (NDVI) variable, while marginally to environmental variable (aphids).

AB  - This study proposes a method for evaluating livable urban environments using the analytic hierarchy process, a survey of public opinions (n = 1,075), and gray relational analysis with a pollutant standards index to estimate the weights of weather, air pollution, and environment aspects and each respective factor. This study investigates the positive or negative correlation of these factors and their effects on livable environment. A value of 100 was designated as the perfect living condition. Results show that the weights of weather, air pollution, and environment aspects were 0.288, 0.395, and 0.317, respectively. The weight ranges of three weather factors, five air pollution factors, and ten environmental factors were 0.311-0.358, 0.191-205, and 0.081-0.116, respectively. The monthly livable index of 28 districts in Taichung City and of 20 cities/counties in Taiwan ranged from 81.1 to 92.4 and from 83.1 to 90.8 in different months, respectively, showing that environmental aspect played a key role. These results demonstrate that the proposed method can provide a quantification index of living conditions in each region, thereby establishing the governmental improvement policy firmly. This study also presents a discussion on improvement strategies, especially on the apportionment rate of governmental construction funds for livable urban environments.

AB  - Many global environmental agendas, including halting biodiversity loss, reversing land degradation, and limiting climate change, depend upon retaining forests with high ecological integrity, yet the scale and degree of forest modification remain poorly quantified and mapped. By integrating data on observed and inferred human pressures and an index of lost connectivity, we generate a globally consistent, continuous index of forest condition as determined by the degree of anthropogenic modification. Globally, only 17.4 million km(2) of forest (40.5%) has high landscape-level integrity (mostly found in Canada, Russia, the Amazon, Central Africa, and New Guinea) and only 27% of this area is found in nationally designated protected areas. Of the forest inside protected areas, only 56% has high landscape-level integrity. Ambitious policies that prioritize the retention of forest integrity, especially in the most intact areas, are now urgently needed alongside current efforts aimed at halting deforestation and restoring the integrity of forests globally. Mapping and quantifying degree of forest modification is critical to conserve and manage forests. Here the authors propose a new quantitative metric for landscape integrity and apply it to a global forest map, showing that less than half of the world's forest cover has high integrity, most of which is outside nationally designed protected areas.

Here, we explore how local-scale variations in seaweed habitat quality interact with large-scale climatic conditions (Southern Oscillation Index, SOI) to influence the recruitment of three tropical fish species (Lethrinus spp.), often targeted by fishers. New fish recruits and juveniles of all species were almost exclusively found in macroalgal nursery habitats, while adults of two of these species were predominantly found on adjacent coral reefs. Annual supply rates of new recruits were found to be strongly correlated to variations in the SOI, with La Nina conditions associated with higher recruitment. However, local rates of recruitment were generally poor predictors of older juvenile abundance. Instead, local juvenile abundance was more closely related to structural characteristics of macroalgae nursery habitat quality (density, canopy height, canopy cover) and/or predator biomass, at the time of survey, with species-specific habitat associations apparent. Given the dynamic nature of fish recruitment supply to the SOI, coupled with the effects of climatic and oceanic processes on the structure of macroalgal patches, these results suggest protection of macroalgal nursery habitats that maintain high canopy density, height and cover is critical to supporting the conservation of fish populations.

AB  - Widespread hydrologic alteration creates a need for tools to assess ecological impacts to streams that can be applied across large geographic scales. A regional framework for biologically based flow management can help catchment managers prioritise streams for protection, evaluate impacts of disturbance or interventions and provide a starting point for causal assessment in degraded streams. However, lack of flow data limit the ability to assess hydrologic conditions across a region. Hydrologic models can address this problem. Regionally calibrated hydrologic models were used to estimate current and reference flows at 572 bioassessment sites in southern and central coastal California. Flow alteration was characterised as the difference in 39 flow metrics calculated from simulations of present-day and reference flow time-series, calculated under up to four precipitation conditions. Biological condition was assessed with the California Stream Condition Index (CSCI) and its components. Logistic regressions were used to predict the likelihood of high scores (i.e. 10th percentile of the CSCI reference calibration data). Statistically significant relationships between increasing severity of hydrologic alteration and decreasing biological condition were used to set thresholds that reflected tolerance for risk of a stakeholder advisory group. An index of hydrologic alteration was created by selecting flow metrics based on their importance for predicting biological response variables in boosted regression tree models. Metrics were selected in the order of decreasing importance, and no more than two metrics per metric class were selected (i.e. duration, frequency, magnitude, timing and variability). Seven metrics were selected: HighDur (duration of high-flow events), HighNum (# of high-flow events), NoDisturb (duration between high- or low-flow events), MaxMonthQ (maximum monthly discharge), Q99 (99th percentile of daily streamflow), QmaxIDR (interdecile range of annual maxima) and RBI (Richards-Baker Index). Applying the index to data from a probabilistic survey, 34% of stream-miles in southern California were estimated to be hydrologically altered. One of four management priorities were assigned to each site based on biological condition and hydrologic status: protection (healthy and unaltered, 52% of stream-miles), monitoring (healthy but altered 4%), evaluation of flow management (unhealthy and altered, 30%) and evaluation of other management (unhealthy but unaltered, 14%). Regionally derived biologically based targets for flow alteration allow catchment managers to prioritise activities and conduct screenings for causal assessments across large spatial scales. Furthermore, regional tools pave the way for incorporation of hydrologic management in policies and catchment planning designed to support biological integrity in streams. Development of regional tools should be a priority where hydrologic alteration is pervasive or expected to increase in response to climate change or urbanisation.

AB  - Although water deficiency is one of the major problems affecting crop production, including wheat, studying water limiting effects on yield components and their relationships with grain yield can facilitate breeding programs for selecting high-yielding genotypes under drought stress conditions. In this regard, 21 bread wheat genotypes were evaluated using two field experiments (post-anthesis drought stress and normal conditions). The experiments were arranged as randomized complete block designs with three replications during 2009-2011. There were significant differences among the genotypes in their traits under both conditions. Under irrigated conditions, genotypes KAYSON/GLENNSON//ATTILA and CHAM//PTZ NISKA/VT, and under drought stress conditions, genotypes CHAM//PTZ NISKA/VT and PASTOR/3/VORONA produced the highest yields. The grain yield had positive and high correlations with the biological yield, harvest index, number of spikes per square meter (m(2)), and number of kernels per spike under normal conditions and with the harvest index, number of kernels per spike, and spike length under drought stress conditions. Path analysis indicated that the maximum positive direct effect on grain yield under both conditions was contributed namely by the harvest index, number of kernels per spike, and spike length. These traits should be considered as the promising traits in wheat improvement programs.

AB  - This study deals with the stochastic nonlinear bending response of functionally graded materials (FGMs) plate with uncertain system properties subjected to transverse uniformly distributed load in thermal environments. The system properties such as material properties of each constituent's material, volume fraction index and transverse load are taken as independent random input variables. The material properties are assumed to be temperature independent (TID) and temperature dependent (TD). The basic formulation is based on higher order shear deformation theory with von-Karman nonlinear strain kinematics using modified C-0 continuity. A direct iterative based nonlinear finite element method in conjunction with first-order perturbation technique developed by last two authors for the composite plate is extended for the FGM plate to compute the second order statistics (mean and standard deviation) of the nonlinear bending response of the FGM plates. Effects of TD, TID material properties, aspect ratios, volume fraction index and boundary conditions, uniform temperature and non-uniform temperature distribution on the nonlinear bending are presented in detail through parametric studies. The present outlined approach has been validated with the results available in the literature and independent Monte Carlo simulation.

AB  - Jinan City is the first pilot city for the construction of a hydroecological civilisation in China. Fifty-eight representative river sampling stations were selected through field trips and surveys, and fish were sampled in the spring, summer, and autumn of 2015. An index of fish biological integrity in Jinan City was constructed and to evaluate the hydroecological health of rivers. Canonical correlation analysis was used to select key driving factors that affect the health of the fish community. The results show that the key physical factor affecting water quality was turbidity, the key chemical factor affecting water quality was chemical oxygen demand (COD) and the key hydrological factor affecting water quality was discharge. Of all the driving factors, COD had the greatest effect on the health of the fish community, followed by discharge and turbidity. Macropodus chinensis Bloch was sensitive to changes in COD; Saurogobio dumerili Bleeker and Pseudolaubuca engraulis Nichols were sensitive to the hydrological factors of discharge and flow velocity; and Saurogobio gymnocheilus Lo and Squaliobarbus ourriculus Richardson were sensitive only to discharge. COD and discharge had a strong effect on fish survival, whereas turbidity affected fish survival but was not a major factor affecting the spatial distribution of river health. The findings can provide a reference for aquatic ecological rehabilitation in developing countries.

AB  - Active-layer detachment failures triggered weeks to months after forest fire in the central Mackenzie Valley (65 degrees N, discontinuous permafrost zone) are compared to others generated almost immediately by summer meteorological conditions on the Fosheim Peninsula, Ellesmere Island (80 degrees N, continuous permafrost zone). Preferred long-axis orientations in both zones vary in relation to valley geometry and ground ice distribution: differential insolation plays no direct role in detachment failure distribution. Rates of geomorphic work over periods of one to two centuries are of the same order of magnitude. Threshold meteorological conditions for initiating failures on the Fosheim Peninsula can be incorporated into a surface heating index, but pre-conditioning of the active layer remains important because rapid thaw does not always initiate activity. Slope pre-conditioning does not occur at the fire-affected sites because the failure zone is within formerly perennially frozen ground. Long-term rates of unit vertical transport at the most active site on the Fosheim Peninsula are similar to those due to debris flow and slushflow in a nearby mountain range. The frequency of potential triggering events at the Ellesmere Island sites is expected to increase if summer climate warms, providing low percentage cloud cover is maintained during periods of high air temperatures.

AB  - Pristine aquatic environments are the preferred state for maintaining ecosystem integrity, supporting biodiversity and preserving human health. However, world ecosystems have been altered by anthropogenic activities which release chemical contaminants into the environment and threaten terrestrial and aquatic life. In order to protect water bodies from pollution, monitoring water quality indicators and levels of trace metals is critical. The Okavango Delta is regarded pristine, but concentrations of trace metals in the river have not been adequately studied. This study quantifies concentration of 10 trace metals, determines their spatiotemporal distribution and assesses associated health risks. Water samples were collected monthly between 2014 and 2017 from five sites and concentrations determined by ICP-OES. The results indicate that all metals studied were present at all study sites with a concentration in the order of Fe > Mn > Ni > V > Zn > Pb > Cd >> Cu > Cr > Co, a wide occurrence of metals reflecting a possible presence of mafic and ultramafic rocks in the catchment. Concentrations of trace metals were variable, but these were not statistically significant at p <= 0.05, indicating a relatively uniform water composition. However, Fe occurred in distinctively higher concentrations compared to other metals. When compared with US EPA guidelines for freshwater ecosystems and WHO drinking water standard, mean concentrations of all metals except Pb were below EPA guidelines for freshwater ecosystems and WHO drinking water standard. The risk assessment revealed that none of the metals posed health risks to the communities that use river water as a direct drinking source. Continuous monitoring is necessary for the protection of human health and sustainability of the delta.

AB  - Finding the ideal density to optimise growth, health and welfare of aquaculture species reared in cage or tank environments allows farmers to produce the best quality product per unit area. Appropriate stocking densities are well known for most major aquaculture species, but limited information exists for the developing sea urchin aquaculture industry. The temperate purple sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma is a prime candidate for aquaculture, yet how stocking density and/or the rearing environment influence urchin health and roe production remain unknown. Here, we tested whether stocking density (low vs. high) and rearing environment (individual vs. group) influences urchin external condition, gonad index (GI) and roe grade in H. erythrogramma after 12-weeks of roe enhancement during autumn-winter (April-June) and winter-spring (July-September) periods. Across rearing environments, high density reduced the proportion of urchins with healthy external condition by 26-30% during autumn-winter and 7-20% in winter-spring compared to low density. During the autumn-winter period, while higher density resulted in lower GIs in the group reared treatments, higher density did not affect the GI of individually reared urchins. Rearing environment affected gonad grade in the autumn-winter period, with a higher proportion of quality (B-grade) roe produced in individually reared treatments compared to group reared treatments. Our results highlight the importance of stocking density and rearing environment for onshore urchin roe enhancement. Maximising production will require a trade-off between investing in greater infrastructure cost to individually rear urchins at high density to ensure higher GIs versus investing in less expensive infrastructure, but group rearing urchins at lower densities to ensure high GIs after enhancement.

AB  - Alcohol is frequently involved in psychological trauma and often used by individuals to reduce fear and anxiety. We examined the effects of alcohol on fear acquisition and extinction within a virtual environment. Healthy volunteers were administered alcohol (0.4 g/kg) or placebo and underwent acquisition and extinction from different viewpoints of a virtual courtyard, in which the conditioned stimulus, paired with a mild electric shock, was centrally located. Participants returned the following day to test fear recall from both viewpoints of the courtyard. Skin conductance responses were recorded as an index of conditioned fear. Successful fear acquisition under alcohol contrasted with impaired extinction learning evidenced by persistent conditioned responses (Experiment 1). Participants' impairments in extinction under alcohol correlated with impairments in remembering object-locations in the courtyard seen from one viewpoint when tested from the other viewpoint. Alcohol-induced extinction impairments were overcome by increasing the number of extinction trials (Experiment 2). However, a test of fear recall the next day showed persistent fear in the alcohol group across both viewpoints. Thus, alcohol impaired extinction rather than acquisition of fear, suggesting that extinction is more dependent than acquisition on alcohol-sensitive representations of spatial context. Overall, extinction learning under alcohol was slower, weaker and less context-specific, resulting in persistent fear at test that generalized to the extinction viewpoint. The selective effect on extinction suggests an effect of alcohol on prefrontal involvement, while the reduced context-specificity implicates the hippocampus.

AB  - Land use and agricultural management cause differences in the structure and composition of soil organic matter (SOM). The relative abundance of volatile organic products was determined to evaluate chemical-structural properties of SOM under different agronomical practices: conventional tillage (CT), no tillage (NT), no tillage with previous chisel (ChNT), maintenance (MR) and export of crop residues (ER), continuous maize (M-M) and maize-soybean cropping (M-S). The experiment was carried out on a Typic Hapluster Af soil, in the Central Llanos (9degrees23'33"N and 66degrees38'30"W), Venezuela. The chemical structural composition of SOM was measured by a degradative technique of pyrolysis gas chromatography (Py Gc) in soils and extracts. Individual treatments did not result in different SOM structures. The products were characterized by a high degree of humified and biologically altered compounds. In MRM-S and ERM-M the organic matter was enriched in material resistant to biodegradation. MR showed the least SOM humification and mineralization indexes under these conditions. The reduction of furfural, acetic acid and phenol at 20 days after harvest (dah), like to pyrrole at 35dah reflected to a considerable high rate of biodegradation of SOM in the 20dah. The lowest value of mineralization index was found in the NTMRM-M combination, while the structure of humic substances from soil extracts indicated no difference for NTMRM-M, ChNTMRM-M and CTMRM-M.

AB  - Polyethylene is widely used in packaging due to its chemical stability, lightness, impermeability and low cost. However, these properties become questionable when it is discarded. Oxodegradable plastics, which degrade by an abiotic-biotic process, have been promoted as a solution to the pollution caused by plastics. This research assesses the degradability of conventional and oxodegradable high density polyethylene in marine, freshwater, and outdoor tropical environments. Samples of these plastics, with and without previous abiotic degradation, were exposed to direct weathering in the Caribbean Sea and the Magdalena River, in Colombia. Their degradation was evaluated during six months by the formation of carbonyl groups, a decrease in elongation at break and visual evidence of deterioration. We found faster degradation for outdoor, followed by marine and freshwater conditions, evidencing that UV and temperature are the most relevant promoters of degradation, especially for oxodegradable plastics, as evidenced by the increase in carbonyl index. In aqueous environments, all specimens showed the formation of biofilm and in some cases cracks and fragmentation, especially in oxidized oxodegradable high density polyethylene specimens in the marine environment. Even if oxodegradables plastics, and in a lesser degree conventional ones, began their degradation process, they did not achieve complete disintegration or mineralization, due to lack of environmental conditions that can only be guaranteed in carefully monitored waste management systems.

KW  - MANAGEMENT
AB  - To sustain fishery development and ensure the supply of fish, the role that a sustainable development indicator system plays in the evaluation of fishery management performance is becoming increasingly important. A sustainable indicator system based on the Pressure State Response (PSR) framework was developed for local fisheries in Gungliau, Taiwan, between 1995 and 2003. Factor analysis and canonical correlation analysis were also applied to aggregate indicators and analyse the linkage of indicators. The most serious problem facing fishery system in Gungliau is conflicting local and higher levels of enforcement that result in the problems of effort, harvest and fleet age composition related to the pressure component. Fishery resources and the state of ecosystem were also affected by marine environmental change, especially by El Nino. Consequently, fishermen adjusted their effort and investment to the variation of Fishery resources, leading Gungliau fisheries to unsustainability. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Concern has been raised that the increased use of pesticides in intensive aquaculture practices may cause adverse sublethal effects to non-target aquatic species. Azamethiphos is an organophosphate (OP) pesticide used to combat sea lice infestations in farmed salmonids. Here, the sublethal impact on the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, of short term exposure to azamethiphos was determined. The testing regime included biomarkers of exposure (acetylcholinesterase activity), cytotoxicity (neutral red retention), immune function (phagocytic index) and physiological condition (feeding rate). The distribution and sensitivity of M. edulis acetylcholinesterase to inhibition by azamethiphos was first determined, yielding IC50 values of 0.736 and 1.30 mg l(-1) for gill and haemolymph, respectively. Exposure of mussels to 0.1 mg l(-1) azamethiphos for periods of up to 24 h caused a significant reduction in acetylcholinesterase activity in both the haemolymph (P < 0.0002) and the gill (P < 0.002), alteration in cell viability (P < 0.02) and decrease in phagocytic index (P < 0.03). The feeding rate remained unaffected. The results support the hypothesis that, in addition to its neurotoxic effects, azamethiphos can modulate haemocyte function and immune defence in M. edulis at environmentally relevant concentrations after only a few hours.

AB  - Cordyceps militaris is a well-known traditional Chinese medicinal mushroom. In this study, the mycelium of C. militaris was cultured using liquid fermentation technology and the culture medium components were optimized by the orthogonal test method. Our results showed that the optimal medium combination for the mycelium growth is 3% glucose, 3% peptone, 0.1% MgSO4, and 0.2% KH2PO4. The international general nutritional assessment method was applied to the overall evaluation of the protein nutrition value of submerged cultivated mycelium and fruit body of C. militaris. The protein contents in C. militaris mycelium and fruit body are 21.10% and 18.47%, respectively. The first limiting amino acids of C. militaris mycelium and fruit bodies are the sulfur-containing amino acids (methionine and cysteine), and the second limiting amino acid is isoleucine. The quality of amino acids from submerged cultivated mycelium and fruit body from C. militaris was also evaluated by amino acid score (AAS), chemical score (CS), essential amino acid index (EAAI), biological value (BV), nutritional index (NI), and score of ratio coefficient of amino acid (SRCAA). Our data demonstrate that AAS, CS, EAAI, BV, NI, and SRCAA scores of the submerged cultivated mycelium proteins are 62.41, 38.74, 88.37, 84.63, 18.61, and 25.57, respectively, whereas the fruit body proteins are 37.11, 34.59, 61.92, 55.79, 11.44, and 68.51, respectively. The protein content of C. militaris mycelium has higher nutrition value than that of fruit body protein, which holds the promise for future further development. Our study provides the optimal culture conditions and the essential nutritional information of medicinal species, C. militaris.

AB  - Treatments involving vegetation thinning have become more frequent in Mediterranean forest ecosystems. Under extreme climate conditions, this practice can affect the balance between physicochemical, microbiological and biochemical soil properties, modifying the soil quality and the ability of these forest ecosystems to regenerate. The aim of this study was to use principal component analysis (PCA) to develop a multivariable soil-quality index (SQI) applicable to the Mediterranean forest ecosystems of the Cuenca mountain range in central-eastern Spain. To achieve this, seven physicochemical properties (moisture, pH, electrical conductivity, carbonate, total organic carbon, total nitrogen and available phosphorus) and six microbiological properties (basal respiration and microbial biomass carbon, as well as the activity of dehydrogenase, urease, phosphatase and beta-glucosidase enzymes) were measured seasonally between 2011 and 2012. Soil samples were obtained from seven unmanaged and undisturbed forest areas and these data were used to create the SQI. Subsequently, we applied this SQI to soil samples from other forests in the Cuenca mountain range, which had been affected by different thinning treatments. Our analysis showed that the greater was the canopy present in these treated forests, the larger were the average values for all 13 variables. The smallest SQI values were in areas that had been intensively thinned. Therefore, our results suggest that this SQI is an important tool for the development of appropriate measures to maintain the quality of forest soil in Spanish Mediterranean forest ecosystems. Highlights
   We developed a multivariable soil quality index (SQI) to assess status of Mediterranean forest ecosystems. This index is adequate to detect changes quickly in forest soil of Mediterranean ecosystems. The SQI helped to assess the effects of thinning treatments on forest soil. The SQI enabled establishment of different levels of soil quality (very high, high, medium and low).

AB  - Correlation coefficient analysis conducted on 22 triticale x bread wheat derivatives along with six checks to select true-breeding derivative(s) for future hybridization programme with tolerance to drought and cold stress conditions as well as better quality traits revealed significant correlation of grain yield with spikelets per spike, biological yield, harvest index, leaf area index. Interestingly, the grain yield and drought susceptibility index showed no association. However, with cold tolerance it showed significant positive correlation indicating the desirability of certain plant traits under cold stress. The grain yield exhibited no association with quality traits which might assist in the predictability of high yielding varieties with high protein, total sugars, reducing sugars and non-reducing sugars. Path coefficient analysis revealed that biological yield had the highest positive direct effect on grain yield followed by harvest index, specific leaf weight, stomatal number, 1000 grain weight, stomatal size, spikelets per spike and days to heading. Therefore, indirect selection for these plant traits in order should be exercised in selecting drought tolerant genotypes. Two genotypes (RL-124-2P(2) and RL 111P(2)) were found to be drought and cold tolerant with high grain yield, spikes per plant, spikelets per spike and leaf area index.

AB  - Tourism development activities affect the structure and functions of ecosystems directly triggering changes in the thermal environment of tourism destinations and raising a need for sustainable development of the tourism industry. Using the 2005-2015 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data on the land surface temperature combined with the land use data, the urban thermal environment contribution index (CI) of prefecture-level cities and ecosystem types corresponding to the study area in Sichuan-Chongqing region were quantitatively calculated under various seasonal and diurnal conditions in terms of the scales of administrative divisions and ecosystem types. The characteristics of the roles played by different cities and ecosystem types to contribute to the thermal environment of the metropolitan region were summarized, and the differences and changes in the corresponding contribution intensity of various ecosystem types were measured. The results indicate the following: (1) Different cities play different roles as the sources and sinks with respect to the thermal environment in the daytime and nighttime. Based on the diurnal differences of the contribution indices, cities can be divided into three types: the day-night heat source type, the day-sink and night-source type, and the day-night heat sink type. (2) The farmland and the grassland ecosystems are the most important source and sink landscapes in the thermal environment of the Sichuan-Chongqing Region, respectively. (3) The region is affected by the spatial arrangement of the internal ecosystems and its own development conditions, and, consequently, there are significant temporal-spatial variations and role transitions between heat source and heat sink regarding the contribution of different ecosystem types to the thermal environment of individual cities. It is important to scientifically regulate the thermal environment effect on tourism destinations and maintain the comfort and sustainable development through identifying the source and sink ecosystems of the thermal environment, controlling the quantity and spatial arrangement of the heat source ecosystems, and fully enabling the cooling effect of the heat sink ecosystems.

AB  - The authors link the effects of pCO(2) on marine invertebrates to the localized pCO(2) conditions of their coastal habitats. They show that responses depend on the deviation from the locally experienced upper pCO(2) level, highlighting the importance of small-scale variability and adaptation.
   Minimizing the impact of ocean acidification requires an understanding of species responses and environmental variability of population habitats. Whereas the literature is growing rapidly, emerging results suggest unresolved species- or population-specific responses. Here we present a meta-analysis synthesizing experimental studies examining the effects of pCO(2) on biological traits in marine invertebrates. At the sampling locations of experimental animals, we determined environmental pCO(2) conditions by integrating data from global databases and pCO(2) measurements from buoys. Experimental pCO(2) scenarios were compared with upper pCO(2) using an index considering the upper environmental pCO(2). For most taxa, a statistically significant negative linear relationship was observed between this index and mean biological responses, indicating that the impact of a given experimental pCO(2) scenario depends on the deviation from the upper pCO(2) level experienced by local populations. Our results highlight the importance of local biological adaptation and the need to consider present pCO(2) natural variability while interpreting experimental results.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW
LA  - English
KW  - environmental impact assessment (EIA)
KW  - life cycle assessment (LCA)
AB  - Various authors have stated that Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) differs fundamentally from product Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). This paper shows the contrary. LCA is a specific elaboration of a generic environmental evaluation framework. EIA is a procedure rather than a tool, in which LCA certainly may be useful. Particularly in strategic and project EIAs, environmental comparisons of process and abatement alternatives may be relevant. Although these alternatives may lead to different emissions and effects at the location of the process itself (which is usually the focus in project EIAs), they can also influence the demand for activities upstream and downstream in the production chain. Including such secondary effects in an EIA, which may be crucial for a proper comparison of alternatives, requires a system approach that takes into account all relevant effects. This is, in fact, LCA. A review of five case studies shows that it is quite feasible to use elements of LCA in EIA. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The article theoretically substantiates and analyzes the indicators for assessing the spheres of human activity for the development of an information-logical model for describing the Arctic as a complex structured object. It is proposed to use indicators reflecting the state of the ecological and socio-economic spheres of life, as the most important areas of human activity in the Arctic zone. Statistical information on these indicators has been collected and systematized in the context of forty-three municipalities belonging to the Russian Federation Arctic zone. Compiled graphical models that reflect the dynamics of the considered indicators over the past 10 years assessed their trend. The information-logical model for describing the Arctic as a complexly structured object is a combination of interdependent model parameters, each of which can simultaneously act as an influencing variable, as well as a marker of the current state of the municipality. The Arctic as a complexly structured object is a complex system of organized human activity and can be presented in the form of information and communication fields relating to various spheres of human activity: demographic (demo-social), natural, industrial, economic, innovative-technological, social, political, and spiritual. The article highlights the main eighteen indicators characterizing the state of the demographic, natural, industrial, economic, innovative, technological and social spheres of life. For the formation of the information-logical model of the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation, these indicators were grouped into two main blocks: a block of environmental and socio-economic spheres of human activity in the Arctic.

AB  - We integrated multiple geochemical analysis of a 13.75 m-long core 973-4 recovered from the northeastern South China Sea (SCS) to detect the response of deep-sea sediment archives to sea-level change spanning the last 42 kyr. The age-depth model based on AMS C-14 dating, together with the sediment grain size, shows an occurrence of turbidity current at around 14 kyr, which was associated with submarine landslides caused by gas hydrate dissociation. A dominantly terrigenous sediment input was supplied from southwestern Taiwan rivers. By synthesizing environment-sensitive indexes, four distinct stages of paleoenvironmental evolutions were recognized throughout the studied interval. Well-oxygenated condition occurred during the stage I (42.4-31.8 kyr) with low sea-level stand below -80 m, accompanied by flat terrigenous input. The largest amounts of terrigenous sediment input occurred during the late phase of stage II (31.8-20.4 kyr) with the lowest sea-level stand below -120 m because of a short distance from paleo-Taiwan river estuaries to the core location. An occurrence of Ca-enriched turbidity current disturbed the original sediments during the stage III (20.4-13.9 kyr). The stepwise elevated sea-level stand resulted in an enclosed (semi-enclosed) system and contributed to a relatively low-oxygen environment in deep ocean during the stage IV (13.9 kyr-present). Temporal variations of TOC and CaCO3 display contrary pattern synchronously, indicating a decoupled relationship between organic carbon burial and carbonate productivity. Our results highlight that these sedimentary records as reflected in the paleoenvironmental changes in the northeastern SCS were mainly driven by sea-level fluctuations and later, since the mid-Holocene, the strengthening East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) overwhelmed the stable sea level in dominating the environmental changes.

AB  - To date the exposure, absorption and respiratory health effects of cast-house workers have not been described since most studies performed in the aluminium industry are focused on exposure and health effects of potroom personnel. In the present study, we assessed the external exposure and the absorbed dose of metals in personnel from the aluminium cast house. This was combined with an evaluation of respiratory complaints and the lung function of the personnel. 30 workers from an aluminium casting plant participated and 17 individuals of the packaging and distribution departments were selected as controls. The exposure was assessed by the quanti. cation of total inhalable fume with metal fraction and by the determination of urinary aluminium, chromium, beryllium, manganese and lead concentration. Carbon monoxide ( CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), aldehydes and polyaromatic hydrocarbons and man-made mineral fibres concentration were assessed as well. In order to evaluate their respiratory status each participant filled out a questionnaire and their lung function was tested by forced spirometry. Total inhalable fume exposure was maximum 4.37 mg m(-3). Exposure to the combustion gases, man-made mineral fibres and metal fume was well below the exposure limits. Beryllium could not be detected in the urine. The values of aluminium, manganese and lead in the urine were all under the respective reference value. One individual had a urinary chromium excretion above the ACGIH defined biological exposure index ( BEI) of 30 mu g g(-1) creatinine. There was no significant difference in any of the categories of the respiratory questionnaire and in the results of the spirometry between cast house personnel and referents (Chi-square, all p > 0.05). Exposure in cast houses seem to be acceptable under these conditions. However, peak exposure to fumes cannot be excluded and the potential risk of chromium and beryllium exposure due to the recycling of aluminium requires further attention.

AB  - The effect of major cations and ionic strength (I) on the chemistry of indigenous heavy metals, Cd, Cu and Zn in alkaline sodic and acidic soils was investigated. Both I and the nature of index cations had a marked effect on the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), Cd, Cu and Zn in the soil liquid phase. With increasing I, the concentration of DOC decreased in all soils. A similar effect of index cation was also recorded; i.e. divalent cations led to a decrease in DOC relative to the monovalent cations. These changes in DOC were also accompanied by marked differences in the concentrations of Cd, Zn and Cu in the two soil types. While the concentration of Cd increased with I in all soil types, that of Zn increased in acid soils and decreased markedly in alkaline sodic soils. The concentration of Cu also decreased in sodic soils with increasing I. The concentration of Cd and Zn in solution phase increased in the order Ca < Mg < Na in acidic soils. In contrast, there was little obvious effect of index cations on Cu in alkaline sodic soils. MINTEQA2 speciation studies showed that the ratio of free hydrated Zn2+ to the total Zn increased from < 1% and 18% to 5% and 76% with I in two alkaline sodic soils studied, while the ratio of org-Zn to the total Zn decreased from 99% and 78% to 92% and 15% in the same conditions, respectively. This shows that DOC is an important factor controlling the solubility of Zn and Cu in alkaline sodic soils through organo-mineral complexation reactions. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - There is increasing concern that birds in terrestrial ecosystems may be exposed to spent lead shot. Evidence exists that upland birds, particularly mourning doves (Zenaida macroura), ingest spent lend shot and that raptors ingest lead shot by consuming wounded game. Mortality, neurological dysfunction, immune suppression, and reproductive impairment are documented effects of exposure to lead in birds. An ecological risk assessment on the impact of lead shot exposure in upland birds was conducted and is presented in the context of the new United States Environmental Protection Agency's Ecological Risk Assessment Paradigm. A considerable amount of spent lead shot is released into the environment each year from shooting and hunting. Doves collected from fields that are cultivated to attract mourning doves for hunting activities show evidence of ingestion of spent lead shot. Because lead can cause both acute and chronic toxicity if ingested by birds, and because there is evidence of widespread deposition of lead shot in terrestrial ecosystems, concern for impacts on upland game birds and raptors seems warranted. Although this ecological risk assessment does not clearly define a significant risk of lead shot exposure to upland game birds, this issue merits continued scrutiny to protect our upland game bird and raptor resources.

KW  - ECOLOGICAL REGIONS
AB  - The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), with the assistance of the US Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is examining the utility of a critical loads approach for evaluating atmospheric pollutant effects on sensitive ecosystems. A critical load has been defined as, ''a quantitative estimate of an exposure to one or more pollutants below which significant harmful effects on specified sensitive elements of the environment do not occur according to present knowledge.'' Working in cooperation with the United Nations Economic Community for Europe's (UN-ECE) Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) Convention, the EPA has developed a flexible, six-step approach for setting critical loads for a range of ecosystem types. The framework is based on regional population characteristics of the ecosystem(s) of concern. The six steps of the approach are: (1) selection of ecosystem components, indicators, and characterization of the resource; (2) definition of functional subregions; (3) characterization of deposition within each of the subregions; (4) definition of an assessment end point; (5) selection and application of models; and (6) mapping projected ecosystem responses. The approach allows for variable ecosystem characteristics and data availability. Specific recognition of data and model uncertainties is an integral part of the process, and the use of multiple models to obtain ranges of critical loads estimates for each ecosystem component in a region is encouraged. Through this intercomparison process uncertainties in critical loads projections can be estimated.

AB  - This paper addresses three-dimensional (3-D) free vibration characteristic of thick circular/annular functionally graded (FG) plates with surface-bonded piezoelectric layers on the basis of 3-D Ritz solution. Three displacement components along with electrical potential field of the plate are expressed by a set of Chebyshev polynomials multiplied by geometry boundary functions. Both open-circuit and closed-circuit surface conditions are taken into account. The mechanical properties of the FG plates are assumed to vary continuously through the thickness of the plate and obey either exponent or power law distribution of the volume fraction of the constituents. The effect of thickness-to-radius ratio, inner-to-outer radius ratio, piezo-to-host thickness ratio and gradient index on the natural frequencies of coupled piezoelectric FG circular/annular plates is investigated for different electrical and mechanical boundary conditions. It is observed that, unlike isotropic homogeneous circular/annular plates, frequency parameters of their piezoelectric coupled FG counterparts significantly increase with an enhancement in the host plate thickness to radius ratio. Results also show that the frequency parameters for open-circuit condition are higher than those for closed-circuit condition. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The amphipod Gmelinoides fasciatus from Lake Baikal is an example of a species being introduced into a number of water bodies in Russia, including the water system of North-west Russia, to expand food reserves of commercial fish. The interest in this crustacean has been attributed to its successful adaptation and expanding habitat area in the region. In order to assess the role of genetic mechanisms in adaptation to new conditions the frequency of chromosomal aberrations (ChA) at anaphase and telophase stages of mitosis in G. fasciatus embryos from six local populations of Lake Baikal and two invasive populations of the Gulf of Finland, originating from natural habitats were studied in two sequential years. The average level of ChA varied slightly between 0.95% in the samples collected in Lake Baikal and 2.9% in those from the Gulf of Finland. A significant increase in the frequency of ChA was found at two sites in Lake Baikal in 2015 and at two locations in the Gulf of Finland in 2016. First information on G. fasciatus chromosome number and constitution acquired by means of molecular cytogenetic techniques is presented and discussed. The results enable us to suggest this amphipod as a sensitive model to study possible mechanisms of biological adaptation and at the same time as a natural bioindicator of the environmental state.

AB  - Nine-spined stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) exhibit a very wide geographical distribution and are increasingly used in ecological and evolutionary research. While pronounced morphological and behavioural differentiation among local populations has been shown, physiological differentiation, especially with respect to stress responses, has not been investigated. However, this would be of interest since the increased use of sticklebacks as ecotoxicological sentinel species presumes a uniform response of used populations to stressors. Metabolic rates of nine-spined sticklebacks from five populations residing in similar latitude across Fennoscandia (Baltic Sea, White Sea, two Finnish and one Russian pond) were compared under controlled conditions, and the effects of exposure to increasing copper concentrations (0-7.1 mu mol l(-1)) on resting metabolic rate, condition factor and survival were tested. While sticklebacks from the two Finnish pond populations consisting of 'giant' fish were the largest, body condition index was highest in the Baltic population. Weight-corrected resting metabolic rates were also significantly different between populations with the highest rate in the Baltic (89.6 +/- 18.3, n=12) and the lowest in the White Sea and the Russian pond populations (62.2 +/- 10.3, n=10 and 56.5 +/- 10.3 nmol O(2) min(-1) g(-1), n=12, respectively). Allometric metabolic rate - weight analysis revealed a metabolic scaling exponent of 0.986, significantly higher than a generally accepted exponent for fish (0.88), suggesting an elevated resting metabolic rate for the two 'giant' stickleback populations. Copper exposure caused an overall increase in metabolic rate of 3.1 nmol O(2) min(-1) g(-1)/1 mu mol l(-1) increase in copper. However, the copper-induced changes in metabolic rate differed significantly among populations, with the least increase in the Baltic and the highest increases in the two Finnish pond populations. Survival of fish following copper exposure was significantly lower for Baltic and one Finnish pond population (mean time to death: 32 days), compared to the White Sea and the other Finnish and Russian pond populations (mean time to death: 68 days). The results demonstrate significant physiological differences in metabolic rate and stress response among local populations, and suggest that caution has to be exercised and pilot studies have to be carried out when different wild populations of a single species are used for ecotoxicological monitoring.

AB  - We present a regional classification of 40 floodplains and wetlands of the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, based on changes in flows since river regulation and water resource development. The classification is based on a similarity percentage analysis of nine metrics relating to frequency, duration and volume of floods, and seasonality of flows. The major changes in flows were a delay in mean Julian day of occurrence of low flow and reduced variation in occurrence, lower frequency of flood events and reduced variation of flood duration. The spatial distribution of floodplain classes highlights the differential effects of river regulation across the Basin, with greatest change in rivers in the southern Basin, particularly the Murray, Murrumbidgee, and Lachlan, and the least change in unregulated or less-regulated rivers, predominantly in the north. There is generally good spatial concordance between distribution of floodplain classes and the Murray-Darling Basin Sustainable Rivers Audit index of riverine ecosystem health, and the distribution of major communities of waterbirds. Our results suggest, when compared with published reports of ecological condition, that very low-gradient, terminal floodplain wetlands characterized by low discharge volume and anastomosing distributary channels may be particularly susceptible to adverse ecological impacts arising from relatively slight alterations to flows.

AB  - Temperature is an important environmental factor influencing fish physiology that varies both spatially and temporally in ecosystems. In small north temperate zone lakes, cold water piscivores rely on nearshore prey; however, this region exceeds the optimal temperature of the foraging species during summer. To cope, piscivores make short excursions into the nearshore to feed and return to cold water to digest their meal, but the physiological impacts of these repeated acute exposures to warm water are not well understood. We exposed juvenile lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) to treatments where they were held at similar to 10 degrees C and exposed to either 17 or 22 degrees C for 5-10 min daily for 53 days mimicking warm-water forays. Control fish, held at an average temperature of similar to 10 degrees C but not exposed to thermal variation, consumed more food and grew slightly faster than heat challenged fish, with no clear differences in body condition, hepatosomatic index, ventricle mass, or muscle concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase and cytochrome c oxidase. Aerobic metabolic rates measured at 10 degrees C indicated that standard metabolic rates (SMR) were similar among treatments; however, fish that were repeatedly exposed to 17 degrees C had higher maximum metabolic rates (MMR) and aerobic scopes (AS) than control fish and those repeatedly exposed to 22 degrees C. There were no differences in MMR or AS between fish exposed to 22 degrees C and control fish. These results suggest that although SMR of fish are robust to repeated forays into warmer environments, MMR displays plasticity, allowing fish to be less constrained aerobically in cold water after briefly occupying warmer waters.

AB  - This paper provides pieces of advice on the practices of quality assurance and quality control in assessing production and dissolution rates of biogenic silica in marine waters with stable isotope techniques. The objective is to make a rigorous contribution to the interpretation of Si-30 isotopic measurements including modelling and uncertainty analyses. The results are illustrated with real data taken from Beucher et al. [Beucher, C., Treguer, P., Corvaisier, R., Hapette, A/-M., Elskens, M., 2004a. Production and dissolution of biogenic silica in a coastal ecosystem of western Europe. Marine Ecology Progress Series 267:57-69.]. Prior to the flux rate assessment, there are a number of analytical considerations required for screening between optimal and defective experimental conditions. Three indexes were proposed to check the relevance of underlying assumptions when dealing with 30Si tracer enrichment and dilution techniques. Afterwards for extracting rate values from measurements, it is necessary to postulate a model, and if required an optimization method. Various models and formulae were compared for their precision and accuracy. It was shown that oversimplified models risk bias when their underlying assumptions are violated, but overly complex models can misinterpret part of the random noise as relevant processes. Therefore, none of the solutions can a priori be rejected, but each should statistically be assessed with hypothesis testing. A weighted least squares regression strategy combining an analysis of the standardized residuals and cost function (sum of the weighted least squares residuals) was used to select optimal solution subsets corresponding to a given data set, i.e. the solution that uses the most relevant processes and which was tested for the presence of outliers (observations or measurements with undue influence in the flux rate assessment).

AB  - With more than 7000 inner rivers, streams, small permanent or temporal watercourses, and wetlands, Entre Rios province has the richest fish diversity in Argentina due to habitats diversity generated by the climatic, biogeographic, and topologic characteristics. However, this region is one of the most impacted areas by intense livestock and farming activities. For this reason, it is necessary and urgent to assess the fish richness and biotic integrity to strategically conserve resources. The aims of this study were to study the fish assemblages of a temperate third order stream namely Santa Barbara, and to determine the environmental quality through modified Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI). The study area is located in the lower-middle basin of the stream in the south-east of Entre Rios (Gualeguaychu department). Fish samples were collected and identified in 3 sampling stations during 2012 (n = 5), and 11 metrics were calculated. One hundred and sixty-seven native organisms were collected, and 17 species, 3 genera, and 1 family were identified. Presence ofSerrapinus microdonwas reported, representing the most austral record in Argentina and the first record in Entre Rios province. Modified IBI was applied to fish data and showed that the study area exhibited between poor and good biotic integrity. This work contributed to the knowledge of ichthyofauna from inner sub-basin of the Uruguay river and it was the first application of IBI in the Mesopotamic Pampa with an adaptation proposal.

AB  - A study of the water quality changes of Chini Lake was conducted for 12 months, which began in May 2004 and ended in April 2005. Fifteen sampling stations were selected representing the open water body in the lake. A total of 14 water quality parameters were measured and Malaysian Department of Environment Water Quality Index (DOE-WQI) was calculated and classified according to the Interim National Water Quality Standard, Malaysia (INWQS). The physical and chemical variables were temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), conductivity, pH, total dissolved solid (TDS), turbidity, chlorophyll-a, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solid (TSS), ammonia-N, nitrate, phosphate and sulphate. Results show that base on Malaysian WQI, the water in Chini Lake is classified as class II, which is suitable for recreational activities and allows body contact. With respect to the Interim National Water Quality Standard (INWQS), temperature was within the normal range, conductivity, TSS, nitrate, sulphate and TDS are categorized under class I. Parameters for DO, pH, turbidity, BOD, COD and ammonia-N are categorized under class II. Comparison with eutrophic status indicates that chlorophyll-a concentration in the lake was in mesotrophic condition. In general water quality in Chini Lake varied temporally and spatially, and the most affected water quality parameters were TSS, turbidity, chlorophyll-a, sulphate, DO, ammonia-N, pH and conductivity.

AB  - The United States Environmental Protection Agency's Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health Act (BEACH Act) requires states to develop monitoring and notification programs for recreational waters using approved bacterial indicators. Implementation of an appropriate monitoring program can, under some circumstances, be expensive. This study explored the use of composite sampling at two Racine, Wisconsin beaches over a four month period (n = 68 days) to determine whether compositing can provide a valid. unbiased, and cost-effective measure of water quality. Multiple point sampling occurred throughout the bathing season, with water samples collected daily from three or four fixed locations along each beach. From each individual sample, well-mixed aliquots were combined to form a composite sample. Individual and composite samples were assayed identically for Escherichia coli using Colilert-18 and Quanti-Tray 2000 (IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook, ME). Results from this study indicate a reasonable expectation of a simple 1: 1 ratio between the composite samples and the arithmetic mean of the individual samples. Additionally, log variance of the composite sample results did not differ significantly from that of the single sample averages (p > 0.2). Empirical values for log standard deviations varied by no more than 7% between the composite sample and individually assayed samples. Thus compositing. as performed in this study, appears to introduce neither significant bias nor additional variability into the monitoring results and stands as a reasonable alternative to data sets derived from single-sample methods. Regulatory programs adopting this approach could maintain sample integrity while reducing costs associated with recreational water quality assessment.

AB  - River managers require tools to assess the ecological condition of waterways and prioritise management strategies. As benchmarking the condition of an entire waterway with detailed surveys is often not practical, Rapid Environmental Assessment Techniques have been developed to provide an indication of the state of a river's health, both rapidly and at a low cost. In this investigation, three such techniques, developed recently in Australia are applied to the same creek in order to compare the outcomes and the levels and types of resources required for their application.
   The output from the three indices ranges from descriptive to statistically analysed data, making them difficult to compare directly. Overall, the three indices all report that the sample creek had relatively poor health. The results from the Victorian Index of Stream Condition and New South Wales' Pressure, Biota, Habitat Stream Assessment appear to correlate well.
   An important finding of the investigation is the variation in the resources required to apply each assessment technique. Generally, the resource demands increase with the requirement for a higher level of scientific rigour. The methods are either relatively inexpensive and rapid to undertake or more resource intensive, yet thorough in the data collected. A two step process incorporating the techniques in a cost-effective manner is recommended.

AB  - Body composition is a direct measure of body condition and as such integrates seasonal variation in foraging success and energy expenditure. In phocids, body condition is a critical determinant of both reproductive effort and ability to survive periods of poor foraging success. We determined body composition in 29 crabeater seals, Lobodon carcinophaya, during austral autumn (April-May 2002) and late winter (August-September 2001, 2002) off the Antarctic Peninsula by measuring blubber depth and taking morphometric (length, girth) measurements. In 15 of these seals, we also measured body composition using the labeled-water dilution technique. The two methods produced similar body composition estimates, with an average difference of 7%. There were no differences in body composition between adult males and females or between autumn and late winter. These findings Suggest that by autumn, adult seals have replenished their energy stores following reproduction and molt. Similarly, the absence of seasonal variation in adults indicates that seals are Successfully foraging throughout winter. In addition to providing insight into seasonal and age-related variation in body composition, this study provides baseline body condition data that can be used to measure impacts of natural or anthropogenic environmental change oil one of the large consumers of Antarctic krill.

AB  - The Water Framework Directive (article 2, paragraph 21) as well as the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD, Descriptor 4) stress the need for assessing the quality of the structure and the functioning of ecosystems. The MSFD also underlines the urgent need for development, testing, and validation of ecosystem state indicators. Holistic function-based criteria and indicators as provided by Ecological Network Analysis (ENA) could be used to define and assess the 'Good Environmental Status' of marine ecosystems. This approach also feeds Ecosystem Based Management (EBM). ENA generally analyses the fluxes' quality of a single medium such as here the carbon fluxes in a food web and produces a number of useful metrics that indicate, inter alia, the total carbon flow through the system, the quality of the functioning of the system or the trophic efficiency of system. A short list of indices [i.e. Detritivory over Herbivory ratio (D/H), Connectance Index (CI), Transfer Efficiency (TE) over trophic levels, System Omnivory Index (SOI), Finn's Cycling Index (FCI), relative Redundancy (R/DC), Average Mutual Information (AMI) and Interaction Strength (IS)] is proposed for practical use. This paper presents a first framework for OSPAR Regional Sea Convention food web indicators based on ENA. These are presented here focusing on their applicability and what is needed for implementation, illustrating their potential use by case studies.

AB  - Freshwaters commonly face human pressure, which produces multiple stressor scenarios that may threaten their ecological status. Biotic community assessments are useful tools to monitor such changes, and the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) has brought this into the legislative framework. The present study focused on a small mountain river facing multiple stresses, with the purpose of (1) evaluating the sensitivity of the macroinvertebrate community to the stresses, (2) assessing whether the ecological status was impaired in different years and (3) comparing the WFD approach with more refined community analyses. The river was generally in a very good ecological state. Despite seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations, no evident stressor-related effects were detected. We hypothesise that the observed resilience was the result of (1) the current dormant state of the abandoned mining areas (the most relevant potential source of contamination) and (2) the naturalness and strong current of the river, which buffered the impacts of contamination. Such a pattern may be generally valid for small mountain rivers, making them therefore more resilient to stresses. Nevertheless, small changes in community structure in the lowest reach of the river - undetected by the WFD assessment scheme - suggest that some disturbance was present, signalling the need for intervention by managers.

AB  - Following the repeal in 1962 of a long-standing ban on trawling, yields of demersal fish from the Firth of Clyde, southwest Scotland, increased to a maximum in 1973 and then declined until the directed fishery effectively ceased in the early 2000s. Since then, the only landings of demersal fish from the Firth have been by-catch in the Norway lobster fishery. We analysed changes in biomass density, species diversity and length structure of the demersal fish community between 1927 and 2009 from scientific trawl surveys, and related these to the fishery harvesting rate. As yields collapsed, the community transformed from a state in which biomass was distributed across numerous species (high species evenness) and large maximum length taxa were common, to one in which 90 per cent of the biomass was vested in one species (whiting), and both large individuals and large maximum length species were rare. Species evenness recovered quickly once the directed fishery ceased, but 10 years later, the community was still deficient in large individuals. The changes partly reflected events at a larger regional scale but were more extreme. The lag in response with respect to fishing has implications for attempts at managing a restoration of the ecosystem.

AB  - As part of a project to study different methods for the disinfection of effluent water, the inactivation of different microorganisms (Escherichia coli, Deinococcus radiodurans and spores of Bacillus subtilis) using a combination of a photosensitizer (Rose Bengal) with simulated sunlight and oxygen was determined under various environmental conditions (temperature, pH index). Zn parallel, the singlet-oxygen (O-1(2)) production was also measured under the same conditions. Whereas the vegetative cells could be inactivated much more efficiently at increased temperature and altered index of pH, the production of O-1(2) remained essentially the same under these alterations. Additionally, the relations among the sensitivities of different cell types to be killed by our photodynamic treatments (PDT) were opposite to those found after exposure to ionizing radiation. The results of photodynamic experiments do not reflect the cells' capacity to repair DNA strand breaks. Spares of B. subtilis, as a nonvegetative system, could not be inactivated by illuminations up to 100 J cm(-1). Together, these findings indicate that DNA is not the primary target, the inactivation of which leads to the killing of our test organisms, instead, the cellular envelope appears to be the component being assaulted by our PDT.

AB  - Worldwide, ecosystem change compromises the supply of ecosystem services (ES). Better managing ecosystems requires detailed information on these changes and their implications for ES supply. Ecosystem accounting has been developed as an environmental-economic accounting system using concepts aligned with the System of National Accounts. Ecosystem accounting requires spatial information from a local to national scale. The objective of this paper is to explore how remote sensing can be used to analyze ecosystems using an accounting approach in the Orinoco River Basin. We assessed ecosystem assets in terms of extent, condition, and capacity to supply ES. We focus on four specific ES: grasslands grazed by cattle, timber harvesting, oil palm fresh fruit bunches harvesting, and carbon sequestration. We link ES with six ecosystem assets: savannahs, woody grasslands, mixed agroecosystems, very dense forests, dense forest, and oil palm plantations. We used remote sensing vegetation and productivity indexes to measure ecosystem assets. We found that remote sensing is a powerful tool to estimate ecosystem extent. The enhanced vegetation index can be used to assess ecosystems condition, and net primary productivity can be used for the assessment of ecosystem assets capacity to supply ES. Integrating remote sensing and ecological information facilitates efficient monitoring of ecosystem assets. (C) 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

AB  - This research presents a Supervised Intelligent Committee Machine (SICM) model to assess groundwater vulnerability indices of an aquifer. SICM uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to overarch three Artificial Intelligence (AI) models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neuro-Fuzzy (NF) and Gene Expression Programming (GEP). Each model uses the DRASTIC index, the acronym of 7 geological, hydrological and hydrogeological parameters, which collectively represents intrinsic (or natural) vulnerability and gives a sense of contaminants, such as nitrate-N, penetrating aquifers from the surface. These models are trained to modify or condition their DRASTIC index values by measured nitrate-N concentration. The three AI-techniques often perform similarly but have differences as well and therefore SICM exploits the situation to improve the modeled values by producing a hybrid modeling results through selecting better performing SVM, NF and GEP components. The models of the study area at Ardabil aquifer show that the vulnerability indices by the DRASTIC framework produces sharp fronts but AI models smoothen the fronts and reflect a better correlation with observed nitrate values; SICM improves on the performances of three AI models and cope well with heterogeneity and uncertain parameters.

AB  - The aim of this work was to establish the relationship between different Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF) epidemiological situations found at different sites and the related large-scale environmental conditions. Large-scale environmental records (vegetation index, temperature, precipitation and elevation) were obtained from a series of monthly NOAA satellite images and global databases considered suitable for modeling climatic and other environmental determinants of large-scale biogeographical regions. The temporal variation in vegetation for cycles of winter-summer showed a greater variation in the nonendemic region than in the other two regions. On the other hand, the average of the temporal variation in precipitation in cycles of spring-autumn was more different in the historic region than in the other two regions, and land surface temperatures in cycles of spring-autumn showed differences between the epidemic region and the other two regions. We found good separation among the epidemic, historic and nonendemic sites, with the greatest difference found between epidemic and nonendemic sites. The classification of sites showed a tendency for grouping according to the epidemiological situation, but there was some variation. It seems possible to establish a close relationship between the state of AHF incidence and the environmental history of sites suggesting the possibility of predicting epidemiological behavior using environmental conditions derived from satellite data.

AB  - The United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA)(1) 2012 Recreational Water Quality Criteria included an Enterococcus spp. quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method as a supplemental indicator-method. In 2012, performance of qPCR for beach monitoring remained limited, specifically with addressing interference. A systematic literature search of peer-reviewed publications was conducted to identify where Enterococcus spp. and E. coli qPCR methods have been applied in ambient waters. In the present study, we evaluated interference rates, contributing factors resulting in increased interference in these methods, and method improvements that reduced interference. Information on qPCR methods of interest and interference controls were reported in 16 papers for Enterococcus spp. and 13 papers for E. coli. Of the Enterococcus spp. qPCR methods assessed in this effort, the lowest frequencies of interference were reported in samples using Method 1609. Low frequencies of sample interference were also reported EPA's modified E. coli qPCR method, which incorporates the same reagents and interference controls as Method 1609. The literature indicates that more work is needed to demonstrate the utility of E. coli qPCR for widespread beach monitoring purposes, whereas more broad use of Method 1609 for Enterococcus spp. is appropriate when the required and suggested controls are employed.

AB  - Ecosystem considerations may be incorporated into fisheries management by modifying existing overfishing paradigms or by developing new approaches to account for ecosystem structure and function in relation to harvesting. Although existing concepts of overfishing have a strong theoretical basis for evaluating policy choices and much practical use, they do not provide direct guidance on issues such as biodiversity, serial depletion, habitat degradation, and changes in the food web caused by fishing. There is, however, little basis for defining optimum fishing by using related metrics such as diversity indices, slopes of size or diversity spectra, or average trophic level of the catch, and these may produce ambiguous results. If ecosystem-based overfishing concepts are to assume a greater rule in management, unambiguous, quantifiable, and predictive measures of ecosystem state and flux must be developed to index: (1) biomass and production by the ecosystem and relationships among its parts, (2) diversity at different levels of organization, (3) patterns of resource variability, and (4) social and economic benefits. Ecosystem considerations do not need to substitute for existing overfishing concepts. Instead, they should be used to evaluate and modify primary management guidance for important fisheries and species. In practice, they emphasize the need to manage fishing capacity, supported by broader use of technical measures such as marine protected areas and gear restrictions.

AB  - Black flies have medical importance because some species are vectors of the Onchocerciasis and Mansonelosis, nevertheless, their ecology and potential use as bioindicators is still poorly studied in the Neotropical Region. In Brazil, bioindicators use is strongly focused in a multimetrical ecological index approach; this way, we investigated the black fly spatial distribution, in relation to abiotic factors correlated to water quality, to provide baseline information for their utilization as standalone indicators of lotic systems integrity. We have tested the hypothesis that environmental changes related to urbanization, lead to decreased abundance and loss in the number of species of the black fly fauna. The sampling was conducted in 10 urban and 10 preserved streams during the dry season (August-September) of 2012, in the mountainous region of Teresopolis, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The streams were characterized for their environmental integrity conditions and physico-chemical properties of water. In each stream, five different rapid points were sampled in a section of 50 meters, 10 meters apart from each other. The black flies were sampled with a kick-net sampler on rocky substrates. The material was separated and the larvae were sorted in morphotypes, and later, the final instar specimens were dissected and identified with the help of taxonomical literature at species level. A total abundance of 488 larvae from nine species were collected, 5 (1.02 %) in extremely impacted streams, 470 (96.31 %) in intermediate streams and 13 (2.66 %) in preserved streams. The visual evaluation (HIT) differed in relation to the water physico-chemical evaluation, in which more variation in the characterization of the sampling sites was observed. In Canonical Correspondence Analysis Simulium subpallidum, S. inscrustatum and S. pertinax were significantly associated with intermediate values of most of the variables, and then to intermediate impacted sites. On the other hand, Lutzsimulium hirticosta, S. subnigrum and Simulium sp. A were associated to low values of chemical variables, and then to more preserved sites. Most studies on the bioindicator potential of Simuliidae have suggested an approach to agricultural impacts, while our results, on the other hand, showed that Shnuliidae species were present in streams with intermediate urban pollution impacts, but absent in heavily impacted sites. Thus, our data suggested that some species are associated to more pristine breeding sites, such as L. hirticosta and Simulium sp. A, while others may be good bioindicators of moderately impacted streams, such as S. pertinax, S. subnigrum and S. subpallidum.

AB  - The evaluation of scale management suitability provides a comprehensive assessment of the various factors driving farmland management conditions. This research objectively evaluated the conditions for scale management suitability by applying the entropy-TOPSIS method with the aim of effectively balancing the space for agricultural production, the development of towns, and ecological protection. First, to ensure a balance between agricultural production, urban development, and ecological protection, 13 indexes were selected to represent the following three areas: natural factors, socioeconomic factors, and characteristics of cultivated land factors. The original matrix was standardized to evaluate the suitability of natural resources, the social economy, and cultivated land conditions, and a comprehensive suitability evaluation of scale management in the Jiangjin District of Chongqing was conducted. The research results divide the study area into four regions based on the level of scale management suitability. Examining the spatial distribution, the level of scale management suitability decreased gradually from north to south, regions at the high and middle levels of scale management suitability were concentrated in the northern area beside the Yangtze river, and the regions at a low level were concentrated in the southern mountain area. This research can provide a reference for the rational utilization of land resources and land use policymaking.

AB  - Ecosystem carbon (C) fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems are affected by varying environmental conditions (e.g., soil heterogeneity and weather) and land management. However, the interactions between soil respiration (Rs) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and their spatio-temporal dependence on environmental conditions and land management at field scale is not well understood. We performed repeated C flux measurement at 21 sites during the 2013 growing season in a temperate upland grassland in Germany, which was fertilized and cut three times according to the agricultural practice typical of the region. Repeated measurements included determination of NEE, Rs, leaf area index (LAI), meteorological conditions as well as physical and chemical soil properties. Temporal variability of Rs was controlled by air temperature, while LAI influenced the temporal variability of NEE. The three grass cuts reduced LAI and affected NEE markedly. More than 50% of NEE variability was explained by defoliation at field scale. Additionally, soil heterogeneity affected NEE, but to a lower extent (>30%), while Rs remained unaffected. We conclude that grassland management (i.e., repeated defoliation) and soil heterogeneity affects the spatio-temporal variability of NEE at field scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The concentrations of selected heavy metals in sediments and waters in Baychebagh copper mine were determined using ICP-OES. Except for Co, the average concentrations of Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn in sediments from the Ghalechay River in the district exceed the world-average shale and continental upper crust value. Enrichment factors for Pb, Cu, and Cd were significantly enriched in sediments, indicating environmental contamination. Geoaccumulation index calculated for different sampling stations indicates that the sediments are unpolluted with respect to Co and Zn while unpolluted to moderately polluted with Cu and highly polluted with Pb and Cd. The Sediment Quality Guidelines (SQGs) suggest that Cd and Pb may pose the highest risk for the environment. Sequential extraction analyses of sediments revealed that Cu, Co, Pb, and Zn bound to extractable, carbonate, reducible and oxidizable fractions are lower than residual fraction. About 10% of the total Pb was associated with the exchangeable fraction, indicating remobilization, while Cd (89%), Pb (73%) Co (58%), Cu (76%), and Zn (68%) closely associated with the residual and oxidizable fractions, resulting in their environmental immobility. The residual forms are not expected to be released under normal conditions in the river and could be considered an inert phase.

AB  - High resolution records of long chain n-alkane biomarkers from the southern South China Sea reveal tightly response of n-alkane distribution to hydro-climate changes over the past 5 Ma, with increasing longer chain n-C-31 alkanes indicating a correlation with drier conditions and increasing shorter chain n-C-27 alkanes with wetter conditions. The variations of the C-31/C-27 ratio, or the alkane chain length index, imply humid conditions before 2.9 Ma, progressively reduced moisture since then and to bigger fluctuations between wet and dry conditions since 1.2 Ma. This long term hydro-climate trend is superimposed by glacial dry and interglacial wet patterns over the Plio-Pleistocene glacial cycles. Combined with other proxy records, our results indicate that precipitation over the tropical Asia-Pacific strengthened before the onset of the northern hemisphere glaciation and the mid-Pleistocene climate transition at about 1.2 Ma. These dramatic humidity changes over major climate transitions imply a crucial role of tropical hydrology dynamics on global climate change in the late Cenozoic. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The experiment was conducted during 2004-06 to evaluate genetic analysis of moisture-stress tolerance in the segregating populations in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Flori & Paol.), New Delhi. Fifty F-3 and F-4 families of bread wheat derived lines from a cross of resistant parent ('HD 2781') and susceptible parent ('HD 2687') were evaluated in the moisture stress and irrigated conditions using randomized complete block design. Five drought tolerance indices, viz drought tolerance index, stress tolerance, drought susceptibility index, mean productivity and geometric mean productivity were used for evaluation of the material. Analysis of variance indicated the genetic diversity among the families for all the selection indices except droughty susceptibility index. The significant positive correlation of yield (under optimum condition) with mean productivity, geometric mean productivity and drought tolerance index were observed for both the season and negative correlation with drought susceptibility index and tolerance in moisture-stress revealed that selection could be conducted for high mean productivity, geometric mean productivity and drought tolerance index under both the environments. Cluster analysis of the populations using the yield (stress condition), yield (normal condition), drought tolerance index, drought susceptibility index, tolerance, mean productivity and geometric mean productivity categorized the genotypes into 6 groups each having 12, 6, 10, 5, I I and 7 genotypes in both the crop seasons.

AB  - The southeastern USA is home to one of the richest-and most imperiled and threatened-freshwater fish assemblages in North America. For many of these rare and threatened species, conservation efforts are often limited by a lack of data. Drawing on a unique and extensive data set spanning over 20 years, we modeled occurrence probabilities of 126 stream fish species sampled throughout North Carolina, many of which occur more broadly in the southeastern USA. Specifically, we developed species-specific occurrence probabilities from hierarchical Bayesian multispecies models that were based on common land use and land cover covariates. We also used index of biotic integrity tolerance classifications as a second level in the model hierarchy; we identify this level as informative for our work, but it is flexible for future model applications. Based on the partial-pooling property of the models, we were able to generate occurrence probabilities for many imperiled and data-poor species in addition to highlighting a considerable amount of occurrence heterogeneity that supports species-specific investigations whenever possible. Our results provide critical species-level information on many threatened and imperiled species as well as information that may assist with re-evaluation of existing management strategies, such as the use of surrogate species. Finally, we highlight the use of a relatively simple hierarchical model that can easily be generalized for similar situations in which conventional models fail to provide reliable estimates for data-poor groups.

AB  - The lower 10 km of the Buffalo River, a tributary to Lake Erie, was designated as an Area of Concern (AOC) in 1987 through the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement because sediment contamination and habitat alteration from past industrialization caused several Beneficial Use Impairments (BUIs). Extensive reme-diation efforts conducted between 2011 and 2015 removed approximately 688,100 cubic meters of con-taminated sediment from the Buffalo River AOC, and subsequent chemical analysis of sediments indicated that most remedial goals had been achieved. Benthic macroinvertebrate communities and sed-iment toxicity were evaluated in the AOC and an upstream reference area in 2017 and 2020 to determine whether remediation has improved benthic conditions sufficiently that the benthos BUI designation can be removed. Community condition was characterized using the New York State multi-metric index of biological integrity and bed sediments were used for 10-day toxicity tests with Chironomus dilutus and Hyalella azteca. Macroinvertebrate communities were classified as moderately to slightly impacted at most AOC sites compared to slightly impacted at most reference sites, but toxicity tests did not identify any evidence of toxicity in sediments from the AOC. A linear mixed effects model indicated that total organic carbon concentration in sediments, distance upstream from the river mouth, and the relative dominance of zebra mussels Dreissena polymorpha were the primary predictors of macroinvertebrate community condition. These findings are consistent with those from other AOCs in New York which indi-cate that contemporary benthic communities are generally shaped by legacy habitat alterations rather than AOC-specific sediment contamination and toxicity.

AB  - The Sustainable Rivers Audit (SRA) is a systematic assessment of the health of river ecosystems in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), Australia. It has similarities to the United States' Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program, the European Water Framework Directive and the South African River Health Program, but is designed expressly to represent functional and structural links between ecosystem components, biophysical condition and human interventions in the MDB. Environmental metrics derived from field samples and/or modelling are combined as indicators of condition in five themes (Hydrology, Fish, Macroinvertebrates, Vegetation and Physical Form). Condition indicator ratings are combined using expert-system rules to indicate ecosystem health, underpinned by conceptual models. Reference condition, an estimate of condition had there been no significant human intervention in the landscape, provides a benchmark for comparisons. To illustrate, a synopsis is included of health assessments in 2004-2007. This first audit completed assessments of condition and ecosystem health at the valley scale and in altitudinal zones, and future reports will include trend assessments. SRA river-health assessments are expected to play a key role in future water and catchment management through integration in a Basin Plan being developed by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority for implementation after 2011. For example, there could be links to facilitate monitoring against environmental targets.

AB  - The aim of this study was to test the effect of agricultural and forestry land use on the structure of mayfly assemblages in low-order streams. Twenty-nine headwater streams were investigated in the state of Sao Paulo. We analyzed 15 streams in pristine areas (mixed tropical rainforest, semideciduous forest and dense tropical rainforest), and 14 streams covered with sugarcane, eucalyptus and pasture. Mayfly richness obtained by rarefaction curves was higher in pristine areas (21 genera), especially in mixed and semideciduous forest when compared to land use (9 genera), where values were particularly low in sugarcane plantation (3 genera). The non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination showed clear difference in mayfly assemblages between land uses and pristine areas, supported by analysis of similarity (R=0.67, p=0.001). In partial redundancy analysis (pRDA), the environmental descriptors that best explained differences in assemblage structure were Riparian, Channel and Environmental Inventory (RCE) index score, percentage of fine sediment stream substrate, water pH and land elevation. Our results show that agricultural and forestry land use has a strong negative effect on the structure of mayfly assemblages. These results also support the use of mayflies as environmental indicators, as some genera were sensitive to changes in land use, while others responded to naturally occurring changes in the study area.

AB  - Urban air quality is a major concern throughout the world. The concentration of human activities in a relatively small area puts enormous pressure on urban systems and has led to numerous environmental problems which have created major problems for urban air quality management. The complex nature of air pollution, especially with respect to health impacts in urban areas, has prompted attempts to define the so-called indicators that condense and simplify the available monitoring data to make them suitable for public reporting and decision makers. Several concepts and indicators exist to measure and rank urban areas in terms of their infrastructural, socioeconomic and environment-related parameters. In past four decades different indices have been introduced, such as Pollutant Standards Index, Air Quality Index (AQI), Air Quality Health Index and Aggregate Risk Index, but none of them have considered importance of the integrated health, environment and safety factors relevant to the extended risk factors involved, such as diverse economic losses and negative socioeconomic aspects. Therefore an integrated AQI, so-called, Air Quality Risk Index which considers environmental conditions, and economic losses involved were applied for the city of Tehran as a megacity. The results indicated that this index can be applied to define the actual condition(s) of urban air quality and to achieve sustainability and resiliency.

AB  - Different regions in China face greatly dissimilar ecological and environmental problems due to large variations in natural conditions and socioeconomic development levels. Such spatial variability calls for regionalized environmental management and protection policies. Environmental function zoning is an effective tool for the design and implementation of differentiated environmental policies. To contain the ecological degradation in different regions of China, we first created a comprehensive environmental function evaluation index system that included 25 socioeconomic and environmental indicators for the three key elements of natural ecological security protection, healthy human living environment maintenance, and regional environment carrying capacity. To clarify the division of Chinese environmental function zoning in the new period, we use GIS and remote sensing technology. We generated 1-km resolution grid data for the 25 indicators and implemented this index system to evaluate the environmental function of the 2414 counties in China. Differentiated environmental management objectives and strategies were designed and implemented for different zones to avoid the phenomenon of one size fits all. This work lays a scientific foundation and provides a quantitative tool for the design and implementation of differentiated management. By considering not only the natural system but also the social and economic systems and their interactions, this evaluation of environmental function provides a more comprehensive view and thus offers new insights on balancing environmental protection and socioeconomic development.

AB  - We describe a composite freshwater Aquatic Toxicity Index (ATI) for chronic toxicity conditions that can be easily computed for a broad range of chemicals. The ATI expresses the potential toxic impact of chemicals on the ecosystem, scaling the potency of each chemical with respect to a reference compound (1,4 dichlorobenzene). It is based on a simple stochastic process model and a few inherent properties of each chemical, such as chronic toxicity, adsorption coefficient to sediments, and Henry's Law constant. Our goal is to provide a simple compartmental model for obtaining a rough quantitative assessment of the life-cycle environmental impact of life-cycle emissions inventory data.
   To illustrate the potential of our approach we compare the ATI index, for a small set of chemicals, with comparable measures of freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity potential and freshwater sediment ecotoxicity potential obtained by others using the European-based impact assessment tool USES-LCA, which is based on a more elaborate fate and transport model. The rank correlation between the ATI and USES-LCA indices is greater than 0.85, showing surprisingly good agreement given the simple nature of our model. More analysis of the differences between ATI and the results of other models is needed, but these results suggest that our model may be useful for priority setting and meta-modeling applications.

AB  - The selection of adequate methodologies for the assessment of different biological quality elements is urgently needed for the application of the water framework directive (WFD 2000/60/EEC). In the case of macroalgae in coastal waters of the North East Atlantic, two methodologies have been proposed: the reduced species list (RSL) index and the quality of rocky bottoms (CFR) index. Both methods use multimetric approaches to evaluate the quality of macroalgae assemblages, which are based on community characteristics (species/populations richness, cover, percentage of opportunistic species, ecological state groups ratio, etc.). In this paper the results of applying both indices on three different types of pollution gradients in the North coast of Spain (bay of Biscay) are presented, in order to test their usefulness and intercalibration possibilities. In general terms, the CFR index responded more accurately than the RSL index to the pollution gradients under study. With respect to the indicators used in the current evaluation, richness, opportunistic species and cover seemed to be the most accurate for quality assessment of macroalgal communities. While the first two indicators are taken into account in both indices, the latter (cover) is only considered in the CFR index, even though the abundance of macroalgae is one of the aspects to be included in the evaluation of this biological element, according to the WFD.

AB  - Identifying environmentally sensitivity regions and levels is an important aspect of resource management, especially in large arid ecosystems that exhibit sensitivity to climate change. This paper selected northwest China with complex and diverse environmental problems as the study area, and constructed the environmental sensitivity index (ESI) system including human intervention, disaster risk, land environment, biological and climate indicators, which were composed of thirteen factors. Then the environmental sensitivity was analyzed through using geographic information system (GIS) technology and spatial distance index (SDI) method. The temporal and spatial evolution characteristics of environmental sensitivity in Northwest China in the past 16 years were discussed. The results showed that: (1) the environmental sensitivity in the study area was in the medium level and its spatial heterogeneity was significant. The high and extremely sensitivity were mainly concentrated in the western and central areas, while the normal and low sensitivity were mainly distributed in the southeast of northwest China. (2) The ESI value decreased from 0.477 in 1987 to 0.429 in 2016, which reflected that the environmental conditions in northwest China have improved in the past 17 years, but not obviously. The regional sensitivity was still unstable, and the fluctuation change area was 232,136.28 km2, accounts for7.71% of the total area. This showed that local government had made some progress in environmental protection, but it still has a long way to go because of the deterioration of the regional environment in northwest China. (3) The SDI method can simply and directly inflect the environmental sensitivity distribution and change patterns, which provided management partitions with well-founded and more viable for planning and implementing effective environmental management.

AB  - The health impact of haze is of great concern; however, few air quality studies have investigated trace pollutant contamination in the air. Size-segregated atmospheric particles (nine size fractions derived from PM10) were collected in dwelling (indoor) and traffic (outdoor) environments in Xinxiang, China, during light pollution conditions (air quality index (AQI), 60-90) and heavy pollution conditions (AQI, 350-550), and they were analysed for halogenated flame retardants (HFRs), including polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs) and Dechlorane Plus (DP) isomers. HFR occurrence levels generally decreased in the order of PBDEs > NBFRs > DPs. The total mean abundance ratios of heavy pollution/light pollution were 4.0, 2.9, 4.4 and 3.6 for PBDEs, NBFRs, DPs and HFRs, respectively. Meteorological conditions played distinctive roles in the HFR distribution in the air. Apparent differences were found for the particle size distribution of HFRs under light and heavy pollution conditions. In general, for adults, the estimated hazard quotient (HQ) and incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCRBDE-209) values were approximately 1.7 x 10(-2) and 9.3 x 10(-9) in heavy pollution conditions, respectively, which were significantly higher than those in light pollution conditions (1.8 x 10(-3) and 2.1 x 10(-9) respectively).

AB  - The objective of the work was to demonstrate the relationship between the natural environmental characteristics of a reservoir and its catchment and severity of trophic degradation. The shallow, highly-silted Rzeszow Reservoir (SE Poland) was the object of study. The impact on degradation of internal supply from accumulated bottom sediments was also assessed, using water and sediment sampled in 2013 and 2014. A high value for trophic state was identified for the reservoir on the basis of TSI indexes, while assessed natural resilience to degradation and analysis of the catchment as a supplier of biogenic and organic matter both indicate high susceptibility to cultural eutrophication. Obtained values for equilibrium phosphate concentrations under anoxic conditions (EPC-0) point to the possibility of a more intensive process of internal supply in phosphorus. However, the presence of sediments poor in organic matter suggest no major threat of ongoing eutrophication. Desludging and/or dredging are likely to entail elimination from the ecosystem of a large part of the pollutants accumulated in sediments, as well as the internal supply of phosphate to the water column. However, as external sources are responsible for the advanced degradation of Rzeszow Reservoir, any attempts at reclamation within the water will fail to yield persistent effects if appropriate protective procedures in the catchment are not implemented.

AB  - The United States Environment Protection Agency, with support from the US Department of Energy and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, has been evaluating the feasibility of an effects-based (critical loads) approach to atmospheric pollutant regulation and abatement. The rationale used to develop three of the six steps in a flexible assessment framework (Strickland and others, 1992) is presented along with a discussion of a variety of implementation approaches and their ramifications. The rationale proposes that it is necessary to provide an explicit statement of the condition of the resource that is considered valuable (assessment end point) because: (1) individual ecosystem components may be more or less sensitive to deposition, (2) it is necessary to select indicators of ecosystem condition that can be objectively measured and that reflect changes in the quality of the assessment end point, and (3) acceptable status (i.e., value of indicator and quality of assessment end point at critical load) must be defined. The rationale also stresses the importance of defining the assessment regions and subregions to improve the analysis and understanding of the indicator response to deposition. Subregional definition can be based on a variety of criteria, including informed judgment or quantitative procedures. It also depends on the geographic scale at which exposure and effects models are accurate and on data availability, resolution, and quality.

AB  - The impact of wind power plants on the environmental components is assessed taking into account a number of their parameters, in particular the technical characteristics of wind turbines, the characteristics of networks, engineering and other structures. To do this, the scope of the study of wind power plants is determined, the aim and subject of the study are established, and the life cycle of the wind power plants is described taking into account (by way of inventory) all the necessary materials and resources. Based on the inventory and input data on the wind farm under study, a diagram is generated - a tree of life cycle processes of the wind power plant - to determine the potential environmental impacts. A list of impact categories that represent the load on the environment caused by the wind power plant is defined; also, the relative contribution of harmful factors is determined for each category, taking into account possible scenarios of waste management. After normalization and determination of significance (weighing), individual estimates of all indicators and their distribution in three categories of lesions were obtained: human health, ecosystem quality and resources, as well as four stages of the wind farm life cycle: production, dismantling and disposal, operation, transportation and installation.

AB  - There is a growing need to identify effective and efficient biological indicators for wetland assessment, and adult damselflies and dragonflies (Insecta: Odonata) possess several attributes that make them attractive for this application. We introduce a general indicator of freshwater wetland condition based on objectively estimated adult Odonata species conservatism, or sensitivity to human disturbances. We used an extensive opportunistic survey dataset from Rhode Island (USA) to empirically assign a coefficient of conservatism (CoC) to each of 135 Odonata species, based on their exclusivity to categories of degradation among 510 wetlands; the mean CoC of species observed in the adult stage was applied as an index of wetland integrity. An independent sample of 51 wetlands was also drawn from the opportunistic survey to test the performance of the index relative to human disturbance, as measured by multimetric rapid assessment and surrounding impervious surface area. The index was well predicted by both disturbance measures and showed no evidence of dependence on sampling effort, wetland size, or geomorphic class. Our findings suggest that conservatism of adult Odonata averaged across species may provide a robust indicator of freshwater wetland condition. And because adult Odonata are generally easy to identify, especially relative to larval Odonata, the index could be particularly useful for wetland assessment. Our straightforward empirical approach to CoC estimation could be applied to other existing spatially referenced Odonata datasets or to other species assemblages. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present study examined a total of 446 samples of Ompok bimaculatus and describes the condition factor, gonadosomatic index, length-length relationships, sex ratio, size at first maturity. The regression parameter 'b' ranged from 3.06 to 3.76 (r(2) > 0.90). During the pre-monsoon, the allometric coefficient 'b' of the LWR was close to isometric value (b = 3.06) while that of overall was positive allometric (b = 3.31) although it suggested positive allometric growth in monsoon (b = 3.21), and post-monsoon (b = 3.76), periods. The values of condition factor ranged from 0.524 to 0.573. In the study, sex ratio ranged from 1:1.03 to 1:1.3. Males ranged from 14.0-26.6 cm while females varied from 11.2-29.0 cm in length. A significant difference in length at 50% maturity (p < 0.05) was found between both the sexes. First maturity stages in males and females were 22.3 cm and 23.2 cm, respectively. The smallest mature female was 22.0 cm L; the largest immature female was 26.8 cm L. The smallest mature male was 20.0 cm L; the largest immature male was 24.5 cm L. The results of the study could be useful to help in sustainable fisheries management in the Ghaghara River.

AB  - When we actively interact with the environment, it is crucial that we perceive a precise temporal relationship between our own actions and sensory effects to guide our body movements. Thus, we hypothesized that voluntary movements improve perceptual sensitivity to the temporal disparity between auditory and movement related somatosensory events compared to when they are delivered passively to sensory receptors. In the voluntary condition, participants voluntarily tapped a button, and a noise burst was presented at various onset asynchronies relative to the button press. The participants made either "sound-first" or "touch-first" responses. We found that the performance of temporal order judgment (TOJ) in the voluntary condition (as indexed by the just noticeable difference (JND)) was significantly better (M = 42.5 ms +/- 3.8 SEM) than that when their finger was passively stimulated (passive condition: M = 66.8 ms +/- 6.3 SEM). We further examined whether the performance improvement with voluntary action can be attributed to the prediction of the timing of the stimulation from sensory cues (sensory-based prediction), kinesthetic cues contained in voluntary action, and/or to the prediction of stimulation timing from the efference copy of the motor command (motor-based prediction). When three noise bursts were presented before the target burst with regular intervals (predictable condition) and when the participant's finger was moved passively to press the button (involuntary condition), the TOJ performance was not improved from that in the passive condition. These results suggest that the improvement in sensitivity to temporal disparity between somatosensory and auditory events caused by the voluntary action cannot be attributed to sensory-based prediction and kinesthetic cues. Rather, the prediction from the efference copy of the motor command would be crucial for improving the temporal sensitivity.

KW  - environmental regularization
AB  - For a long time, economic activities occurred in the lack of legal rules. Due to advancement of legislation, many activities became in situation of irregularity, mainly by occupying buildings in protected areas. In this condition, the maintenance or destruction of these buildings should be based on an impact comparative analysis of both alternatives. However, a lack of criteria and standardization of procedures has undermined the proper treatment and decision making. Thus, the purpose of this paper was to introduce a methodological proposal for comparative environmental analysis applied to the settlement of irregular activities. For that, an impact global index was constructed, by means of literature review to identify the parameters involved, as well as to its formulation with use of interaction matrices. The method was applied for assessing an activity that made intervention in permanent preservation area, within consolidated urban area without authorization of competent agency. As a result, an index able to support making-decision about maintenance or destruction of irregular buildings was obtained, considering attributes as duration, extension and intensity in the formulation of magnitude of the impact, as well as the parameters of accumulation, reversibility and sensibility to evaluate its importance. Although the proposed method does not eliminate the subjectivity of the environmental assessment, it contributes to standardization through a logical and organized procedure that allows a comparison based on quantitative parameters, especially for smaller projects, usually assessed only according to qualitative attributes.

AB  - The present study describes the seasonal changes in reproductive endpoints of the greenside darter (Etheostoma blennioides) and its implications for environmental monitoring. Fish collections conducted at the appropriate time for the site-specific sentinel fish species can provide a wide variety of population-level information including recruitment, reproduction, and energy storage. The objectives of the present study were to: 1) characterize seasonal changes in reproductive endpoints of the greenside darter (both sexes) to determine the appropriate period for monitoring of this sentinel species; and 2) evaluate the effect of exposure of this sentinel species to tertiary treated municipal effluent at the selected monitoring period. Based on the selected parameters (gonadosomatic index [GSI], liver somatic index [LSI], condition factor, and in vitro gonadal steroid production [testosterone (T) in both sexes; estradiol (E2) in females; and 11-ketotestosterone (11KT) in males]), the present study provides evidence for the value of collecting darters during recrudescence (late fall/early winter) to ensure temporal stability, minimum variability, and stable steroid production capacity. Darters exposed to tertiary treated municipal effluent tended to be larger and heavier relative to reference fish but did not demonstrate any consistent responses in terms of condition or relative liver size. No effect on gonadal development was observed, even though these tertiary-effluent-exposed fish demonstrated a significant reduction in the ability to produce hormones. The present study suggests that although fish exposed to tertiary treated effluent demonstrate no population-level effects, they are still responding at a physiological level. Documentation of the reproductive cycle of sentinel species allows for selection of the most appropriate sampling period to reduce variability and greatly enhances the reliability and interpretation of biological responses.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are priority contaminants in coastal and estuarine ecosystems under anthropogenic pressure. Although PAHs tend to accumulate in the sediment, toxicity for benthic flat fish such as soles may be caused by PAHs released from the sediment to the water column. Within this context, the present investigation aims at recognizing toxicopathic effects elicited after waterborne exposure to benzo [al pyrene B [a] P, a model individual PAH compound, in juvenile Solea senegalensis. Sole juveniles were exposed to various concentrations of waterborne B [a] P for 3 and 7 days. Brain, liver, gills and gonad were the target tissues selected to determine biochemical and lysosomal biomarkers, and histopathology. Biological responses and toxicopathic effects were consistent with B[a]P concentration and exposure time. From day 3, hepatic catalase inhibition indicated potential oxidative effects of B[a]P. At day 7, contaminant exposure produced hepatic glutathione-S-transferase induction at low concentrations and inhibition at higher levels, evidencing a bell-shaped response. A clear gradient in lysosomal membrane destabilisation was observed in relation with B[a]P concentrations. Histopathological lesions were more frequent at day 7 and at higher contaminant levels. It seems that environmentally relevant waterborne concentrations of B [a] P (1000 ng/l) would suffice to cause toxicopathic effects on sole juveniles in relatively short exposure times. In agreement, the Integrative Biological Response index (IBR/n) indicated a dose-dependent decline in health condition upon exposure to B[a]P (IBR/n(HighB[a]P) > IBR/n(MidB[a]P) > IBR/n(LowB[a]P) > IBR/n(DMSO )> IBR/n(Control)). Overall, changes in antioxidant enzymes activity, lysosomal biomarkers and gill and liver histopathology are responsive early-warning signs of health disturbance in sole juveniles exposed to waterborne PAHs.

AB  - The stable development of agriculture is of great significance to alleviate the problem of food insecurity. As a significant yield zone along the Belt and Road Initiative, the Black Sea area is an ideal object for China to invest in agriculture. Therefore, it is particularly important to evaluate the agricultural investment environment in this region reasonably and effectively. This paper selects the countries around the Black Sea as the research objects and uses an Entropy- technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) model to analyse the agricultural investment environment and its influencing factors. The results show that: (a) There are significant differences in the agricultural investment environment among the six countries around the Black Sea, ranking as follows: Russia(0.5583) > Bulgaria(0.4782) > Georgia(0.4072) > Ukraine(0.3539) > Turkey(0.3493) > Romania(0.3167); (b) in primary indexes, agricultural production conditions, political environment, and social development have a relatively large impact, among which agricultural production is the most important factor; (c) among the secondary indexes, human capital index and railway (total kilometres) have high levels of impact. Unemployment rate, inflation rate and employment in agriculture (% of total employment) also have a significant impact. On this basis, suggestions are put forward according to the research results.

AB  - The main goal of the study is to prepare a landslide susceptibility map under Geographical Information System (GIS) environment using statistical index model to identify and demarcate the areas of future landslide occurrence. Firstly, landslide locations were identified with the help of previous reports, satellite images and intensive field study. For the preparation of landslide inventory, 80 landslide locations were identified and randomly separated to create training and validation datasets. Fifty landslides (62.5%) were used as training dataset and remaining 30 landslides (37.5%) were used for validating the model. Twelve landslide conditioning factors, including morphometric factors (slope angle, slope aspect, curvature, relative relief and drainage density) and non-morphometric factors (bedrock geology, soil, distance from drainage, distance from lineament, distance from road, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and land use/land cover), were used to generate landslide susceptibility map of Rorachu river basin. Finally, the accuracy of the model was assessed by area under curve of Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve and landslide density method. The statistics of ROC curve showed that, the landslide susceptibility map using statistical index model has an accuracy of 91% which indicates a very good predictive capacity of the model. The result reveals that, landslide density of the Rorachu river basin is increasing with landslide susceptibility classes.

AB  - Paclitaxel (PTX) is one of the most promising natural anticancer agents with a wide therapeutic range which is limited by its hydrophobic nature, low therapeutic index and more importantly, the emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR). Lapatinib (LPT) is a dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor with a significant potential to inhibit p-glycoproteins which form one of the main groups of proteins responsible for efflux pump mediated MDR. To overcome the PTX related MDR, a novel liposomal formulation was optimized for co-delivery of PTX and LPT by applying the D-optimal response surface methodology. The encapsulation efficiency (EE%) of the optimized formulation for LPT and PTX was 52 +/- 3% and 68 +/- 5, respectively. The optimized formulation showed a narrow size distribution with the average of 235 +/- 12 nm. The transmission electron microscopy image showed that liposomes were round in shape and discrete. The release profile exhibited 93% and 71% drug release for PTX and LPT after 40 h in the sink condition. The differential scanning calorimetry analysis indicated the conversion of both drugs from crystalline state to molecular state in the optimized lyophilized formulation. The cytotoxicity of the prepared formulation was studied against 4T1 murine mammary cells. The liposomal formulation showed better cytotoxicity in comparison to the binary mixture of free drugs.

AB  - Although gross domestic product (GDP) is not intended to be a measure of societal welfare, it is often used as such. One shortcoming as a welfare measure is that it fails to account for the non-marketed value of natural resource flows. The difference between societal welfare and GDP is labelled the 'welfare gap'. A model that accounts for both market and non-market income flows from natural capital is used to examine this gap. Societal welfare depends on private goods and the stock of natural capital. The latter is subject to a logistic growth relationship common to many non-human species. Private goods are produced using human capital and flows of natural capital. An exogenously growing human population either harvests the natural resource, produces human capital or produces the private good. Optimal control theory and dynamic simulations provide steady-state harvest and human capital growth rates which determine the steady-state natural resource stock, GDP and societal welfare growth rates. The model illustrates the feasibility of explicitly accounting for ecological relationships in economic growth models and shows that, depending on one's preferences and the growth rate of human population and the intrinsic growth rate of natural resources, GDP may diverge substantially from the growth rate of societal welfare, leaving a large welfare gap.

AB  - Ecosystems simultaneously deliver multiple functions that relate to both the activities of resident species and environmental conditions. One of the biggest challenges in multifunctionality assessment is balancing analytical simplicity with ecosystem complexity. As an alternative to index-based approaches, we introduce a multivariate network analysis that uses network theory to assess multifunctionality in terms of the relationships between species' functional traits, environmental characteristics, and functions. We tested our approach in a complex and heterogeneous ecosystem, marine intertidal sandflats. We considered eight ecosystem function, five macrofaunal functional trait groups derived from 36 species, and four environmental characteristics. The indicators of ecosystem functions included the standing stock of primary producers, oxygen production, benthic oxygen consumption, DIN (ammonium and NOx efflux) and phosphate release from the sediments, denitrification, and organic matter degradation at the sediment surface. Trait clusters included functional groups of species that shared combinations of biological traits that affect ecosystem function: small mobile top 2 cm dwellers, suspension feeders, deep-dwelling worms, hard-bodied surface dwellers, and tube-forming worms. Environmental characteristics included sediment organic matter, %mud, %shell hash, and %sediment water content. Our results visualize and quantify how multiple ecosystem elements are connected and contribute to the provision of functions. Small mobile top 2 cm dwellers (among trait clusters) and %mud (among environmental characteristics) were the best predictor for multiple functions. Detailed knowledge of multifunctionality relationships can significantly increase our understanding of the real-world complexity of natural ecosystems. Multivariate network analysis, as a standalone method or applied alongside already existing single index multifunctionality methods, provides means to advance our understanding of how environmental change and biodiversity loss can influence ecosystem performance across multiple dimensions of functionality. Embedding such a detailed yet holistic multifunctionality assessment in environmental decision-making will support the assessment of multiple ecosystem services and social-ecological values.

AB  - Urbanization and industrialization have placed most of the aquatic environments in developing countries at great risk. The absence of reliable biological monitoring programmes further complicates the situation. In this study, an attempt was made to assess incidence of deformities among Chironomus spp. response to the level of environmental degradation. For this purpose, chironomid larvae were sampled from Sebeta River (November, 2012) using Surber sampler and/or D-frame dip net. Moreover, physicochemical analysis of the water and sediment heavy metal analysis were carried out at three study sites. The results indicate that most physico-chemical variables were higher at the downstream sites (P < 0.05), together with high levels of Cr, Zn and Cu, which was attributed to untreated effluents that originated from garment and tannery industries. Several forms of deformities (mentum gap, notch, tooth missing and breakage) were encountered, and the majority occurred on mentum followed by pecten epipharynx. Taking 8% as a cut-off value for normal deformities and the moderate rate of deformities detected (16.62% at Sb-2), it is possible to conclude that the ecological state of Sebeta River is at critical condition. Therefore, corrective measures like designing of effective treatment plants and timely set environmental impact assessment must be in place prior to any developmental activity.

AB  - Freshwater mussels perform critical ecosystem functions and provide many valuable ecological services. However, anthropogenic effects have severely decreased mussel diversity and abundance at both local and regional scales. Understanding how human disturbances, particularly landuse change, and fish assemblages are related to mussel assemblages is essential for effective conservation and restoration. We used Random Forests (RF) regressions, a data-mining technique, to examine how mussel species richness, total abundance, and abundances of individual species were related to land use at different spatial scales and to fish species richness and abundance in east central Illinois, USA. Mussel richness increased with % wetlands, % open water, % grassland in the riparian zone, and total fish abundance; decreased with % urban land in the riparian zone; but responded poorly to fish species richness and fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) scores. Total mussel abundance mainly increased with total fish abundance and decreased with both % urban land in the riparian zone and road density. Of 8 mussel species modeled, the abundances of 3 were strongly related to total fish abundance or fish-host abundance, 3 with both fish abundance and land use, and 2 with land use and other physical variables. These findings can help researchers and resource managers explain the spatial variation of mussel assemblages and choose abiotic and biotic variables to monitor or manipulate for maintaining or restoring overall mussel diversity or the populations of individual species.

AB  - Spatial transfers of species distribution models (SDMs) are often applied in the study of land use and climate-change effects, spread of invasive species and conservation planning. However, model transferability and risk of error are rarely evaluated prior to predicting species distribution to different regions. We aim to assess spatial transferability of SDMs for stream fish and to evaluate the effect of model types and habitat heterogeneity on transferability. We developed SDMs for 21 fish species and made predictions of occurrence of these species among five pairs of river catchments (i.e. model transfers). Forty eight transfers were made for each of three modelling approaches (Lasso-regularised logistic regression (LLR), boosted regression trees (BRT) and MaxEnt) after incorporating spatial autocorrelation. In addition to internal and external evaluation of discrimination power, we assessed the cross-catchment consistency of variable selections, fish-habitat relationships and predicted probabilities of species presences. Approximately half of 144 spatial transfers of SDMs had moderate to high discrimination power. Discrimination power was low for the rest of the models. Incorporating spatial autocorrelation could not improve discrimination power in the model transfers. Friedman test showed that BRT did not differ significantly from LLR but it outperformed MaxEnt in terms of AUC in the model transfers. BRT and LLR models tended to have high overall accuracy and specificity, whereas MaxEnt tended to have high sensitivity in the model transfers. The degree of model transferability varied among species, and was asymmetric when reciprocal transfers were made between paired catchments. Ranks of variable importance in BRT models differed among catchments for most species. Temperature, base flow index, altitude and habitat condition index were more often ranked as the most important predictors in the five study river catchments, although the functional forms of their effects on fish presence were sometimes inconsistent between paired catchments. Compared to published transferability of some terrestrial taxa SDMs, spatial transferability of stream-fish distribution models was limited, reflecting the natural barriers to dispersal among catchments, and the necessity of evaluating model transferability in conservation applications (e.g. evaluation of climate- or landscape-change effects, invasive species risk assessments and species reintroduction planning). We suggest the following strategies to enhance spatial transferability: (i) match the range and location of the habitat predictors between the model region and prediction region, or alternatively choose a model training region with a large extent and a wide range of environmental gradients; (ii) use presence-absence models such as BRT and LLR and (iii) include habitat features with a sound ecological basis such as temperature and hydrology.

AB  - Atenolol is a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist ('beta-blocker') widely used for the treatment of angina, glaucoma related conditions. Since atenolol is not appreciably metabolized in humans, the parent compound is the predominant excretory product, and has been detected in sewage effluent discharges and surface waters. Consequently, atenolol has been chosen as a reference pharmaceutical for a European Union-funded research consortium, known as ERAPharm (http://www.erapharm.org), which focused on the fate and effects of pharmaceuticals in the environment. Here, we present data generated within this project from studies assessing population-relevant effects in a freshwater fish species. Using fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) as a standard OECD test species, embryo-larval development (early life stage or ELS) and short-term (21 d) adult reproduction studies were undertaken. In the ELS study, the 4 d embryo NOEChatching and LOEChatching values were 10 and > 10 mg/L, respectively, and after 28 d, NOECgrowth and LOECgrowth values were 3.2 and 10 mg/L, respectively (arithmetic mean measured atenolol concentrations were >90% of these nominal values). In the short-term reproduction study, NOECreproduction and LOECreproduction values were 10 and >10 mg/L, respectively (mean measured concentrations were 77-96% of nominal values), while the most sensitive endpoint was an increase in male fish condition index, giving NOECcondition index and LOECcondition index values of 1.0 and 3.2 mg/L, respectively. The corresponding measured plasma concentration of atenolol in these fish was 0.0518 mg/L. These data collectively suggest that atenolol has low chronic toxicity to fish under the conditions described, particularly considering the low environmental concentrations reported. These data also allowed the assessment of two theoretical approaches proposed as predictors of the environmental impact of human pharmaceuticals: the Huggett 'mammalian-fish leverage model'; and the acute:chronic ratio (ACR). The Huggett model gave a measured human: fish effect ratio (ER) of 19.3 for atenolol, which compared well with the predicted ER of 40.98. Moreover, for an ER of 19.3, the model suggests that chronic testing may be warranted, and from our resultant effects data, atenolol does not cause significant chronic effects in fathead minnow at environmentally realistic concentrations. The calculated ACR for atenolol is >31.25, which is far lower than that of 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol and other potent steroidal oestrogens, thus further supporting the observed low toxicity. The data produced for atenolol here fit well with both approaches, but also highlight the importance of generating 'real' experimental data with which to calibrate and validate such models.

AB  - Urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (OH-Pyr) is widely used for biomonitoring human exposures to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from air pollution and tobacco smoke. However, there have been few rigorous validation studies reported to ensure reliable OH-Pyr determination for occupational health and risk assessment. Herein, we report an inter-laboratory method comparison for urinary OH-Pyr when using gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on urine specimens collected from firefighters (n=42) deployed at the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire. Overall, there was good mutual agreement in urinary OH-Pyr quantification following enzyme deconjugation with an average bias of 39% with no significant deviation from linearity (slope=1.36; p>0.05), whereas technical precision (<12%) and average recovery (>85%) were acceptable when using a stable-isotope internal standard. Faster analysis times (4min) were achieved by LC-MS/MS without chemical derivatization, whereas lower detection limits (0.64ng/L, S/N=3) was realized with solid-phase extraction prior to GC-HRMS. A median creatinine normalized OH-Pyr concentration of 128ng/g was measured for firefighters that were below the recommended biological exposure index due to delays between early stages of emergency firefighting and urine sample collection. Similar outcomes were also measured for 3-hydroxyphenanthrene and 9-hydroxyfluorene that were positively correlated with urinary OH-Pyr (p<0.05), implying similar uptake, distribution, and liver biotransformation processes. Optimal specimen collection strategies post-deployment together with standardized protocols for OH-PAH analysis are critical to accurately evaluate smoke exposure in firefighters, including experimental conditions to ensure quantitative enzyme hydrolysis of urine samples.

AB  - Glutathione S-transferase (GST) assays in non-mammalian organisms are usually conducted inappropriately, since no previous standardization of the optimal concentrations of proteins and substrates and adequate pH is conducted. Standardization is a key task to adjust enzyme assays at their kinetically correct maximal initial velocities, if one wants these velocities to indicate the amount of enzyme in a sample. In this paper GST assays were standardized in liver cytosol to compare seasonal GST levels in liver of mullet from two contaminated lagoons in the Rio de Janeiro to those from a reference bay. GST potential as a biomarker of sublethal intoxication in this species was also evaluated. Mullet liver GST levels assayed with substrates that corresponded to three different GST isoenzymes varied throughout the year. The differences indicated that mullets are suffering from sublethal intoxication from contaminants in these lagoons. Seasonal variations of activity were relevant, since these could indicate differences in xenobiotic input into the areas. An analysis of overall mullet health condition using a morphological index (the Fulton Condition Factor) and macroscopic abnormalities corroborated the differences in GST levels, with fish from one of the sites in worse overall health condition showing lower and significantly different FCF when compared to the reference site. Therefore, GST standardized activity levels are useful biomarkers of environmental contamination for mullet. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A statewide condition assessment of North Dakota wetlands in the summer of 2011 was conducted as part of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Wetland Condition Assessment (NWCA). Two other wetland condition assessments, the Index of Plant Community Integrity (IPCI) and North Dakota Rapid Assessment Method (NDRAM), were also completed at each wetland. Previous studies have identified how the distinct signatures of stable isotopes can be used to determine different land uses, anthropogenic impacts, nutrient cycling, and biological processes. To evaluate if these relationships existed in northern prairie wetlands, the data collected from the wetland assessments were compared with the natural abundance of soil nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopes. Wetland soil delta N-15 was significantly higher (isotopically heavier) in wetlands surrounded by cropland compared to those surrounded by idle or grazed/hayed grasslands, possibly reflecting anthropogenic impacts and multiple nitrogen sources. Soil delta N-15 was significantly correlated with floristic quality, IPCI scores, NDRAM scores, and average buffer width, indicating that soil delta N-15 values may be representative of wetland condition. Soil delta N-15 exhibited significant differences among wetland types, although limited sample sizes of certain wetland types may have affected this result. Additional studies on the natural abundance of wetland soil isotopes need to be performed in northern prairie wetlands. This study is the first step in exploring the potential applications of wetland soil nitrogen isotopes regarding wetland assessment and surrounding land use and provides important insight for future studies.

AB  - Terrestrial ecosystems provide a range of important services to humans, including global and regional climate regulation. These services arise from natural ecosystem functioning as governed by drivers such as climate, atmospheric carbon dioxide mixing ratio, and land-use change. From the perspective of carbon sequestration, numerous studies have assessed trends and projections of the past and future terrestrial carbon cycle, but links to the ecosystem service concept have been hindered by the lack of appropriate quantitative service metrics. The recently introduced concept of the Greenhouse Gas Value (GHGV) accounts for the land-atmosphere exchanges of multiple greenhouse gases by taking into consideration the associated ecosystem pool sizes, annual exchange fluxes and probable effects of natural disturbance in a time-sensitive manner.
   We use here GHGV as an indicator for the carbon sequestration aspects of the climate regulation ecosystem service, and quantify it at global scale using the LPJ-GUESS dynamic global vegetation model. The response of ecosystem dynamics and ecosystem state variables to trends in climate, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and land use simulated by LPJ-GUESS are used to calculate the contribution of carbon dioxide to GHGV. We evaluate global variations in GHGV over historical periods and for future scenarios (1850-2100) on a biome basis following a high and a low emission scenario.
   GHGV is found to vary substantially depending on the biogeochemical processes represented in LPJ-GUESS (e.g. carbon-nitrogen coupling, representation of land use). The consideration of disturbance events that occur as part of an ecosystem's natural dynamics is crucial for realistic GHGV assessments; their omission results in unrealistically high GHGV. By considering the biome-specific response to current climate and land use, and their projections for the future, we highlight the importance of all forest biomes for maintaining and increasing biogeochemical carbon sequestration. Under future climate and carbon dioxide levels following a high emission scenario GHGV values are projected to increase, especially so in tropical forests, but land-use change (e.g. deforestation) opposes this trend. The GHGV of ecosystems, especially when assessed over large areas, is an appropriate metric to assess the contribution of different greenhouse gases to climate and forms a basis for the monetary valuation of the climate regulation service ecosystems provide.

AB  - Perfusion bioreactors, unlike traditional in vitro cell culture systems, offer stringent control of physiological parameters such as pH, flow, temperature, and dissolved oxygen concentration which have been shown to have an impact on cellular behaviour and viability. Due to the relative infancy and the growing interest in these in vitro culture systems, detection methods to monitor cell function under dynamic perfusion bioreactor conditions remains one of the main challenges. In this study, INS-1 cells, a cell line which exhibit glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, were embedded in fibrin and cultured under perfusion bioreactor conditions for 48 h and then exposed to either a high-, or low-glucose concentration for 24 h. These cultures were compared to non-bioreacted controls. Bioreacted cultures exposed to a high-glucose concentration showed the highest glucose-stimulated insulin secretion when compared to those in a low-glucose environment. The stimulation index, a marker for insulin secretion functionality, increased over time. A lower incidence of apoptotic cells was observed in the bioreacted cultures when compared to non-bioreacted ones, as evaluated by a TUNEL assay. Immunofluorescence staining of Ki67 and insulin was performed and showed no differences in the incidence of proliferative cells between conditions (bioreacted and non-bioreacted), where all cells stained positive for insulin.

AB  - For effective management of water and wastewater infrastructure, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) has long emphasized the significant role of risk in prioritizing and optimizing asset management decisions. High risk assets are defined as assets with a high probability of failure (e.g. soon to fail, old, poor condition) and high consequences of failure (e.g. environmental impact, high expense, safety concerns, social disruption). In practice, the consequences of failure are often estimated by experts through a Delphi method. However, the estimation of the probability of failure has been challenging as it requires the thorough analysis of the historical condition assessment data, repair and replacement records, and other factors influencing the deterioration of the asset. The most common predictor in estimating the probability of failure is calendar age. However, a simple reliance on calendar age as a basis for estimating the asset's deterioration pattern completely ignores the different aging characteristics influenced by various operational and environmental conditions. This paper introduces a new approach of using 'real age' in estimating the probability of failure. Unlike the traditional calendar age method, the real age represents the adjusted age based on the unique operational and environmental conditions of the asset. Depending on the individual deterioration pattern, the real age could be higher or lower than its calendar age. Using the concept of real age, the probability of failure of an asset can be more accurately estimated.

AB  - The United States Environmental Protection Agency recommends density thresholds for the fecal indicator organism Escherichia coli in order to ensure the safety of recreational waters. A number of studies published over the past ten years indicate that E. coli is encountered frequently in sand at recreational beaches. While a majority of the sand-associated E. coli may be commensal or environmental strains, the potential for pathogenic strains of E. coli to be present exists. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the presence of attachment and virulence genes associated with enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic strains of E. coli (EPEC and EHEC) in populations of E. coli recovered from swash zone sand from seven recreational beaches along Lake Huron and Lake St. Clair in eastern Michigan, USA. Genes coding for attachment proteins in EPEC and EHEC were very prevalent in sand E. coli, but genes coding for toxin genes were uncommon. The paucity of genes associated with E. coli toxins suggests that the EPEC and EHEC pathotypes are not common in sand; however, the high prevalence of genes associated with attachment in E. coli pathotypes suggests that these genes are being retained within the beach sand E. coli population.

AB  - The study is focused on diatom communities as indicators of the water quality of aquatic ecosystems. The study included watercourses of the Timok River Basin in eastern Serbia. Sampling of algological material and physicochemical measurements were conducted at 30 locations in September 2016. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) showed that conductivity had an effect on the spatial variability of the diatom communities. At locations under influence of acid mine drainage along the Borska river, its tributaries and the Timok river, the diversity of benthic diatoms decreased and the abundance of metal tolerant taxa Achnanthidium minutissimum, Nitzschia capitellata and Nitzschia palea increased. Our study revealed that the combined effect of different pollutants significantly impacted on diatom assemblages; diatoms are good bioindicators of multiple pressures; and diatom indices with different types of pollution, may show an unreliable picture of the actual state, therefore, biological and physico-chemical parameters should also be observed when interpreting the results of a solely diatom-based assessment of the ecological condition of freshwaters.

AB  - Uneaten feeding pellets and fish released faeces cause the most severe impact on the benthos beneath aquaculture offshore sea-cages. A modelling tool, 'MACAROMOD', composed of particulate waste dispersion and benthic response, was developed to predict the environmental disturbances of offshore sea-bream (Sparus aurata), sea-bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) and meagre (Argyrosomus regius) aquaculture in the Macaronesian region (oceanic archipelagos in the north-eastern Atlantic). MACAROMOD was tested at 8 sites (7 farms in the Canary Islands and 1 farm in Madeira), hence covering a high variability in oceanographic and environmental conditions. In general, a low percentage of lost pellets was found (3%), while a high rate of pellets were consumed by wild fishes (97%). Considering all studied sites, significant correlations were shown between observed and predicted solid fluxes (R-2 = 0.89), and also between solid fluxes and the depositional footprint on the benthos, by taken advantage of observed and predicted values of the ecological status AMBI index (R-2 = 0.6966). A flux threshold of 12 kg solids m(-2) yr(-1) was predicted as a boundary from which ecological degradation occurs for the study region. MACAROMOD is therefore a valid tool to improve planning and monitoring Macaronesian aquaculture. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Temporary ponds are specific freshwater habitats in which the characteristic fauna of aquatic organisms i s formed. One of the large groups of invertebrates in temporary water bodies is water mites. In this work, water mites were studied in three different types of temporary ponds in the vicinity of the city of Tyumen, Wester n Siberia. The studies were carried out in two periods with a long time interval between them: in 2008-2010 an d 2018-2019. In total, 33 species of water mites from 7 families were identified in the studied ponds. All ponds were dominated by vernal mite species typical for this type of water bodies. Also, they were characterized b y similar seasonal dynamics of numbers. The species composition and the number of mites in different ponds varied, which is associated with different physicochemical parameters and the fauna of invertebrates, whic h served as food objects and hosts for the adults and larvae. Despite the small size and periodic drying of the ponds, the fauna of the mites inhabiting them has changed little over the long period of time that separates the studies. Only in one pond, which became permanent due to the rise of groundwater, significant changes in acarofauna were observed. Considering such constancy of the fauna of water mites of temporary ponds, they can be used as bioindicators of the ecological state of water bodies.

AB  - The paper contains the results of natural film experiments carried out on inland waters in the Dead Vistula (Martwa Wisla) catchment area during 1999-2002 using the integrated Langmuir trough-Wilhelmy plate system, which 'cuts out' all undisturbed film-covered area without any physicochemical sample processing. The static film parameters result from the generalized scaling procedures applied to the surface pressure-area isotherms. They appear to correspond well to observations of the film composition (A(lim), M-W, E-isoth), film solubility and the miscibility of its components (via R, DeltaS(c) and y factors), and surface concentration (pi(eq), Gamma(eq)). A novel approach is presented for the adsorption dynamics on the basis of the mixed kinetic-diffusion model and analyses of the dynamic surface pressure plots, which leads to the determination of the effective relative diffusion coefficient D-eff/D and activation energy barrier E-a/RT. There is reason to believe that certain classes of film-forming components or 'end-members' may dominate the static and dynamic surface properties. Some of these substances can be used as source-specific surface-active biomarkers to trace temporal and spatial changes due to environmental factors or the production of biological matter. The concept was tested for the Dead Vistula river and its tributaries. The results demonstrate that natural films are a complex mixture of biopolymeric molecules covering a wide range of solubilities, surface activities and molecular masses with an apparent structural film architecture. Such studies could lead to the development of film structure parameters - indicators of ecosystem quality and the state of the environment.

AB  - The Bembezar river, with a basin close to 2000 km2 of surface and a capacity of impounded water of 355.5 hm3, presents evidence of hydromorphological alteration in its lower section. Based on the study of flow series (2000-2019) provided by the Guadalquivir Automatic Hydrological Information System and the analysis of aerial photographs from different years (1956 and 2010), the main alterations detected in its lower section are the following: decrease by 58 % of the circulating flow through the channel, increase in seasonal irregularity with seven months of low water, absence of ecological flow on 66% of the days, functionality of the flood plain only in extraordinary floods, change in the morphological pattern of the river, reduction of the average width of the channel by 53%, general incision throughout the section and invasion of exotic species.
   The assessment of the ecological status of this waterbody carried out by the competent Basin Authority, evolves from bad in 2015 to worse than good in 2018, as a consequence of the poor results provided by the biological indicators. The environmental objective for this waterbody was that of good ecological potential in 2015. It also shows the poor suitability of both the hydromorphological indicators used in the definition of the ecological status and the actions that are carried out to guarantee the conservation of riverbeds and banks.

AB  - The European Biodiversity Strategy asks EU Member States for an assessment, mapping and valuing of Ecosystem Services (ES). While terrestrial ES concept is advanced and different tools are available, they are largely lacking for coastal and marine systems. We develop a stepwise methodological process to assess ES in coastal and marine systems which we name Marine Ecosystem Services Assessment Tool. We applied it to two large Baltic lagoons, the Szczecin and the Curonian Lagoons demonstrating a quantitative and qualitative assessment approach. Firstly, an initial status is defined reflecting, according to the European Water Framework Directive, a past situation when the ecosystems where in a so called good ecological state. In both Baltic lagoons, this refers to a situation around 1960. Secondly, a present state is defined, assessed and compared to the initial status. Increasing anthropogenic impacts in Szczecin Lagoon caused an overall decrease ecological status which may influence the system's ability to provide services. Assessing ES changes semi-quantitatively via 39 indicators and 22 services, we show a decrease in provisioning and regulating and maintenance and an increase of cultural services' provision. According to 15 expert valuations, the Curonian Lagoon displays no changes in provisioning but an increase in regulating and maintenance and cultural service provision. We discuss how these results can serve different marine management approaches and support different polices. Through our application we show how the tool can be used to assess ES changes over time and thus provide key information on sustainable use and ES for future generations.

AB  - Pollution is a major concern in urban areas. Due to its biological significance, genotoxicity should be a main focus for pollution biomonitoring, due mainly to the increasing complexity of the chemical environment in which organisms are exposed. Diluvio's Basin (Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil) is a heavily polluted urban ecosystem impacted by urban wastewater. Planarians are useful organism for evaluating environmental genotoxicity because of their high sensitivity, low cost, high proliferative rate and also because of their basal evolutionary position in relation to complex metazoans. Comet assay is a powerful and highly sensitive method of evaluating primary DNA lesions. Based on the unique features of planarians and the current environmental state of Diluvio's Basin, the aim of this work was to evaluate the genotoxic potential of this body of water using comet assay in planarians. Planarians were exposed to the water for 13 days in a laboratory and comet assay was performed in order to screen possible DNA damages. The results indicated an increasing gradient of damage towards basin's mouth. Such a gradient could be related to the gradual increase of pollutants among the different sample sites. Moreover, there seems to be a correlation between the urbanization gradient that exists within the watershed and the genotoxicity. Historical physical-chemical data was also gathered and examined for possible correlations with genotoxicity. Comet assay in planarians is a very promising test for environmental monitoring studies. Its application should be expanded. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - 1. Recent studies have demonstrated that there is generally no unambiguous relationship between plant species composition and specific environmental conditions in rivers. Nevertheless, indices of environmental pressures based on macrophytes are flourishing, because of the requirements of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). 2. We first reviewed nine such indices against 13 criteria for bioindicators. Then, using data from France and England, we tested whether the IBMR (Macrophyte Biological Index for Rivers) and LEAFPACS (predictions and classification system for macrophytes) methods could reliably indicate nutrient and hydromorphological pressures. Finally, we used an improved bootstrapping method to estimate accuracy. 3. Currently, most indices lack ecological meaning for a variety of reasons, including partial sampling (backwaters are excluded); reliance on list of taxa (there are identification difficulties) rather than structure and functions; correlation rather than causation; application within a limited biogeographical area; reliance on expert judgement; high precision but poor accuracy; poorly defined reference conditions; lack of independent tests; and an inability to discriminate reliably between the target pressures of interest from confounding background variables. 4. IBMR was a far better indicator of pH (or HCO3-pCO2) than it was of soluble reactive phosphorus, SRP (or SRP-NH4). While there was a highly significant correlation between IBMR and SRP after removing the effect of pH, the relationship was weak (r2 = 0.08, n = 215, P < 0.001). 5. LEAFPACS is a multi-metric method summing up five individual indices, each compliant with the WFD. Its individual metrics were not better correlated with nutrient and hydromorphological pressures (with r2 < 0.1, n = 62, P < 0.05) than was the IBMR. The meaning of the overall metric is questionable. 6. There are problems in determining the precision of the indices, owing to uncertainties in recording, but they are less than the uncertainties in determining accuracy (because species optima and tolerances are sometimes poorly known). 7. Reliable information is needed to improve the state of our rivers. Macrophyte indices are able to detect statistically significant pressures from a large population of sites but cannot be applied at specific sites, as required by the WFD, owing to large uncertainties and low explanatory power. Typically, more than 90% of the variability in macrophyte indices is attributed to factors other than human pressure. The WFD would be better served by a simpler, holistic approach based on our current mechanistic understanding of river processes. These findings are likely to apply also to other taxonomic groups (macroinvertebrates, diatoms, fish) used in the assessment of purported ecological quality and to palaeolimnological measures of reference status.

AB  - Black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis spp.) are critically endangered species, with less than 65 individual animals housed in captivity within Association of Zoos and Aquariums-accredited zoos within the United States, and an estimated 5,500 individual animals of all subspecies surviving in the wild. Previously published reference values for circulating vitamin D, (25OHD,; 55.7 +/- 34.2 ng/ml) were based upon samples from free-ranging black rhinoceros in Africa. Recent research in human medicine has highlighted the importance of subclinical vitamin D deficiency, with links to increased risks for developing various health conditions. Serum samples collected opportunistically from two captive Eastern black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis michaeh) housed with seasonal access outdoors in a North American zoo were tested for 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25OHD) levels over a 3-yr period. A commercially prepared pelleted diet containing vitamin D, was fed to both rhinos. This study correlates environmental ultraviolet (UV) index, dietary supplementation, and seasonal serum 25OHD levels to compare with known 25OHD, levels in free-ranging African black rhinoceros. Results in these two individuals suggest that D. bicornis spp. are dependent upon sunlight or UVB for measurable circulating 25OHD, and that current vitamin D, supplementation levels may have little effect for Diceros spp. in human care housed in northern latitudes.

AB  - Drought stress is one of the most important abiotic stresses influencing performance of crop plants. Therefore, the identification or development of tolerant genotypes is of high importance for incorporating in cotton production. In this study to evaluate the effect of drought stress on some cotton traits, 5 improved cotton varieties were studied in a split plot design with three replications in 2 years (2000-2001) at 2 locations (Hashemabad and Anbaroloom); one with Mediterranean climate and the other with drought-stress condition. Treatments were irrigation as main plot in 3 levels (I-0=without irrigation, I-1=one time irrigation; that carried out 70 days after sowing, and I-2=at least 3 times irrigation) and varieties as subplot in 5 levels (5 genotypes). In the basis of combined variance analysis significant differences were detected among varieties for yield, boll number, boll weight, length and number of sympodial and monopodial branches. Drought stress decreased yield, boll number, boll weight, and induced earliness. With increasing irrigation frequency, earliness lightly reduced in the former climate probably because of inducing vegetative growth and retarding in generative phase. In latter climate increased irrigation frequency had a positive effect on the yield. It seems that water deficiency has reduced yield via decreasing boll number. The number of formed bolls in stressful conditions was less than that of in non-stressful conditions. Stress tolerance index (STI) revealed that Siokra-324 and Tabladila were more tolerant and stable varieties.

This article reviews the technical aspects of breath analysis including sample collection, analyte preconcentration, vapor desorption, and various measurement techniques, as well as some recent developments in the field. Because the exhaled breath is affected by the composition of ambient air, the elimination of background influence on the analyte detection is also discussed. Both advantages and major obstacles of breath analysis techniques in clinical practice are presented and summarized.

AB  - Improving natural disaster resilience is one of the important methods for coping with climate change and natural disasters, and quantitative evaluation of natural disaster resilience is the primary problem to be solved urgently. In this paper, an index system for evaluating regional flood disaster resilience is constructed based on a review of the literature regarding natural disaster resilience and with full consideration of the five dimensions (i.e., nature, society, economy, technology and management) which have a great influence on flood disaster resilience. Subsequently, the overall level and five dimensions of flood disaster resilience in the Chaohu Lake Basin can be evaluated quantitatively by adopting analytic network process to dynamically analyze the influencing relationships of factors. The results obtained in this research indicate that: (1) overall, the majority of the Chaohu Lake Basin exhibits intermediate to high flood disaster resilience, but there are distinct variations within the basin. The resilience is clearly influenced by the natural dimension indexes, the highest resilience levels are mainly located in the hilly, mountainous regions, and the lowest resilience levels mainly occur in the south-southeast plain of the Chaohu Lake Basin and the river estuary of the Chaohu Lake. Considering the administrative regions, the regions with the greatest areas of intermediate and high resilience are Hefei Municipal District, Chaohu City, Feidong County, Feixi County, Lujiang County, Hanshan County, Shucheng County, most parts of He County, Wuwei County and Jiujiang District of Wuhu City. (2) Preliminary validation indicates that evaluation results regarding flood disaster resilience in the Chaohu Lake Basin are consistent with the actual conditions. Therefore, the evaluation results and method can provide a valuable approach to the rapid diagnosis of weak links in the construction of flood disaster resilience infrastructure and will ultimately improve the level of flood disaster resilience in the Chaohu Lake Basin.

AB  - We describe a novel, weight of evidence-based approach for selecting fish community metrics to assess estuarine health, and its application in selecting metrics for a multi-metric health index for the Swan Estuary, Western Australia. In the absence of reliable, independent measures of estuarine condition against which to test the sensitivity of candidate metrics, objective, multivariate statistical analyses and multi-model inference were employed to select metric subsets likely to be most sensitive to inter-annual changes in the health of this ecosystem. Novel pre-treatment techniques were first applied to down-weight the influence of highly erratic metrics and to minimise the effects of seasonal and spatial differences in sampling upon metric variability. A weight of evidence approach was then adopted to select those metrics which responded most consistently across multiple analyses of nearshore and offshore fish abundance data sets collected between 1976 and 2009. Sets of 11 and seven metrics were selected for assessing the health of the nearshore and offshore waters of the Swan Estuary, respectively. Selected metrics represented species composition and diversity, trophic structure, life history and habitat functions and, in the case of the nearshore index, a potential sentinel species. These metric sets are currently being used to construct a multi-metric health index for the Swan Estuary, which is the first such tool to be developed for assessing the health of estuaries in Australia. More broadly, while the methodology has in the present case been applied to the fish fauna of the Swan Estuary, it is generally applicable to any ecosystem and type of biotic community from which an ecosystem health index might be sensibly derived.

TI  - A place for subterranean estuaries in the coastal zone
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - Willard S. Moore coined the term subterranean estuary (STE) as that part of the coastal aquifer 'where groundwater derived from land drainage measurably dilutes seawater that has invaded the aquifer through a free connection to the sea' more than two decades ago (Moore, 1999). In doing so, Moore was calling attention to the potential importance of this zone, long studied by terrestrial hydrologists, to marine systems. Since then, we have accumulated indisputable evidence of the importance of STEs and their associated submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) in coastal ecosystem function. Yet, subterranean estuaries are often not considered distinct systems in the land-ocean continuum either from an academic viewpoint or for developing integrative monitoring and management. This invisibility means that the impact of STEs on ecosystem state has been neglected when environmental assessments that aim to meet coastal water quality and ecosystem health targets are performed. It is possible that our current broad definition of STEs, as well as misuse and misunderstanding of terminology, partly explain their de-facto transparency to the wider coastal scientific community. Here, we argue for the inclusion of STEs as important, interconnected systems driving water quality, ecology, and biogeochemical cycles in nearby coastal ecosystems. To achieve broader recognition, we first need to address the perceived compartmentalization of surface and groundwater systems, as well as overcome a pigeon-holed approach to research often confined within narrow disciplinary boundaries. The establishment of open-water estuarine science over the last several decades shows that such obstacles are surmountable. A lack of awareness and recognition of STE functions impedes a holistic understanding of coastal ecosystems and slows down the development of cause-effect relationships for a science-based approach to ecosystem management.

AB  - We explored the relationships between classical estimators of autotrophic biomass and primary production, such as chlorophyll a concentration and C-14-fixation rates, and biochemical indices based on DNA and RNA determinations, which have been proposed as indicators of physiological state in natural plankton populations. The measurements were made during two cruises across the Catalan Front, carried out in May 1989 and February 1990, corresponding respectively, to periods of stratification and moderate mixing. DNA and RNA concentrations (measured by a double-staining fluorimetric technique) were significantly correlated with chlorophyll a in February 1990, but not in May 1989, when a marked deep chlorophyll maximum was present. Significant positive correlations between RNA concentration and primary production and between RNA:DNA and primary production were found during both surveys, probably reflecting both higher RNA concentrations per cell and enhanced bacterial and microheterotrophic growth in high primary production situations. The results support the potential usefulness, in biological oceanography, of biochemical indicators based on DNA and RNA concentrations.

AB  - The main growth period of the sea urchin Sphaerechinus granularis (Lamarck) in Brittany occurs in summer and autumn with a faster growth rate in the juveniles. The growth curve was similar in laboratory and field populations except during the winter phase where growth rate decreased in the field but was negative from the second year-class in laboratory conditions.
   To determine the factors which regulate somatic growth, the seasonal variations in feeding, gonadal growth and temperature were analysed. The ingestion rate of laboratory urchins and the repletion index of the natural population were low from December to April and at the end of summer irrespective of the age of the sea urchins. The changes however were less obvious in the juveniles. In the adults, the gonad index increased from February to April before spawning. The decrease in the growth rate in October was influenced more by falling sea temperature than by a change in the feeding rate which decreased a month later. Temperature is not the only factor involved in the reinitiation of growth, in April. This coincides with the end of spawning and when the feeding activity recommenced. The resumption of feeding is influenced by the temperature as indicated by a significant correlation between the feeding indices and the seawater temperature one month before.

AB  - Regime shifts are massive changes among alternate ecosystem states. Predicting regime shifts is difficult, but statistical indicators such as increasing variance or autocorrelation may provide early warnings of their impending onset. We conducted a 4 yr lake manipulation to test for early warnings prior to a food-web transition by adding largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) to a lake dominated by small fishes, and thereby drive a trophic cascade that altered zooplankton biomass, community composition, and body size. Declining catches of small fishes were associated with shifts to larger bodied species of Daphnia. We measured zooplankton biomass daily in a reference and manipulated lake and calculated variance and autocorrelation of the zooplankton time series using 28 d rolling windows. We asked whether the variance in the manipulated lake (relative to the reference lake) increased and whether autocorrelation approached unity (a value suggested by theory) prior to the food-web regime shift. The variance and autocorrelation of zooplankton biomass were similar between the two lakes in the first 2 yr of the manipulation. During the third year, variance was much higher and autocorrelation approached unity for sustained periods in the manipulated but not in the reference lake. Variance and autocorrelation were similar between the two lakes during the fourth year as the food-web transition moved to completion. The joint response of variance and autocorrelation in year 3 provided an early warning of the food-web transition consistent with theoretical expectation.

AB  - The objective of the current study was to examine fine spatial scale variation in aboveground decomposition rate over a barrier island dime/swale gradient in relation to the ground-water-free surface, soil nitrogen, and associated ecosystem states in order to identify thresholds of process or state change. The litterbag study was conducted on the Virginia Coast Reserve-Long Term Ecological Research Site in Virginia, United States. Mean aboveground decay rate (yr(-1)) ranged from 0.339 (upper dune) to 0.699 (marsh/lower dune transition). The upper dune, marsh, and lower dune (Morella thicket side) had the lowest aboveground decay rates. The marsh edge, marsh/lower dune transition and Morella thicket exhibited the highest decomposition rates. Our results did not suggest that soil N content was a good indicator of state change or system process rates, whereas, distance to ground water demonstrated a significant relationship with aboveground decay. Relatively small (approximately 0.2-0.4 m) increases or decreases in elevation affected decay rates and community state. Free-surface thresholds that cause state changes or shifts in ecosystem processes provide the capability to project changes prompted by sea-level rise or shifts in other free surfaces over entire landscapes. Our results suggest that the ground-water-free surface is a good candidate for making such projections.

AB  - Iron and steel are highly important materials used in a wide range of products with important contribution to the economic development. The processes for making iron and steel are energy intensive and known to contribute to local pollution. Deposition of the metals may also have adverse impacts on soil quality, which requires detailed assessment. The aim of this study was to investigate the impacts of iron and steelmaking facilities on the local soil quality. Soil samples were collected in the vicinity of two steelmaking sites in Australia, one based on blast furnace steelmaking operation, while the second site was based on electric arc furnace steel recycling. The soil samples were compared to a background site where no industrial impact is expected. The soil collected near industrial facilities contained larger toxic metal contents, however this concentration for all priority metals was within the Australian National Environmental Protection Measure guidelines for the acceptable recreational soil quality. When compared to the international soil quality guidelines, some of the soils collected near the industrial sites, particularly near the blast furnace operated steelmaking, exceeded the arsenic, iron and manganese (according to United States Environmental Protection Agency guidelines) and chromium, copper and nickel concentrations (according to the Canadian guidelines). The work further provided a novel environmental assessment model taking into consideration the environmental and health impacts of each element. The environmental assessment revealed most significant contribution of manganese, followed by titanium, zinc, chromium and lead. Titanium was the second most important contributor to the soil quality, however this metal is currently not included in any of the international soil quality guidelines. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Aim. The article presented results of a research designed to compare the feeling of guilt in healthy adults and in persons diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.
   Method. One hundred people diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia participated in the research and 100 people without diagnosed psychopathology (control group).
   Results. The findings of the research showed that the persons from the clinical group obtained much higher results in all the tests measuring a sense of guilt and that interpersonal guilt in persons suffering from paranoid schizophrenia in a majority of cases significantly is not correlated with clinical symptoms thus it can be assessed in a relatively independent manner from a patient's behaviour and cognitive state. However, it has been proved that the strongest indications of positive symptoms of schizophrenia are: Sense of guilt related to helplessness (IGQ), Sense of guilt related to induced self-hate (IGQ), Guilt as a state (GI) and Guilt as a feature (GI), whereas indicators of negative symptoms and a general result Guilt as a stale (GI).
   Conclusion. One might suppose that such a pattern of results indicates the primacy of a characteristic (guilt as a characteristic according to the Inventory of a Sense of Guilt), which is proved by a lack of correlation between schizophrenia symptoms (being more of a state nature) and the most important dimensions of the sense of guilt (being more of a characteristic nature). Moreover, the research results give grounds to confirm the existence of significant differences in the intensity of the experienced sense of guilt (Guilt as a state and Sense of guilt related to induced self-hate guilt) among outpatients and all-day treatment patients.

AB  - The Republic of Sakha (Yakutia; RS(Y)) is located in the northeast of Siberia (Russia) in the basins of the Lena, Yana, and Indigirka rivers, in the lower reaches of the Kolyma River. Yakutia is an industrial-agrarian republic with a developed mining, fuel, and energy industry. Indigenous peoples live mainly in the Arctic regions, where the large-scale development of mineral resources is planned, and South Yakutia, where the mining industry is well developed. The aim of this study is the development of methodological approaches to assessing the impact of the mining industry on the natural environment and the social sphere in the places of residence and traditional economic activities of the indigenous peoples of the North. We used the results of research work (R&D), materials of expeditionary work, and regulatory documents of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) and the Russian Federation (RF). The state of the environment (ES) was assessed on the basis of the analysis of indicators for three areas: (a) anthropogenic load, (b) environmental and social consequences, and (c) resistance of natural complexes to technogenic impacts. In total, 22 indicators were used for the 3 areas, for example, population density, person/km(2); the volume of extraction of rock mass, million m(3); and emissions, t/year. To bring dissimilar indicators into comparable ones, we used a methodological approach with the use of the social risk index (SRI). In Arctic regions (mainly agricultural), the ES is in a favorable and relatively favorable state: SRI 0.61-0.70; in the central regions (mainly agricultural), it is satisfactory and relatively satisfactory: SRI 0.71-1.0; in the southern and western regions with a developed mining industry, it is relatively tense and tense: SRI 1.01-3.0. An extremely tense state of environmental conditions has developed in the city of Yakutsk: SRI >= 3. Generally, the deterioration of the environmental situation and vital activity of the indigenous peoples in investigated Arctic region correlated with the impact of the mining industry.

AB  - Managing freshwater systems has become a challenge for global water utilities given that cyanobacterial blooms have been increasing in frequency and intensity. Consequently, a water quality index that uses conventional measurements to assess toxic cyanobacterial hazards and guide the selection of proper treatment technologies could benefit water resource managers about water quality parameters routinely analyzed in line with environmental changes. An index model, called Icyano, showed that chlorophyll-a, cyanobacterial concentration, and total nitrogen were most important for the index. All reservoirs classified as good by Icyano used direct filtration water treatment technology. Many of the medium Icyano-classified reservoirs used a pre-treatment unit followed by a direct filtration unit. Two reservoirs that were classified as bad or very bad have been utilizing pre-treatment + direct filtration or a complete cycle technology, respectively. As the Icyano index increases, water treatment plants should switch from direct filtration to using a pre-treatment to improve finished water quality. Findings from this project suggest that the direct filtration technology initially used in water treatment plants is not capable of meeting the current water quality guidelines in reservoirs that contain adverse water quality conditions, mostly related to an increase in toxic cyanobacterial blooms. As such, based on our findings, we recommend prioritizing financial resources towards pre-treatment technology or changes to more advanced technologies when Icyano index values increase.

AB  - The refractive index increment (dn/dc) of a solution is a constant that indicates the variation of the refractive index with the solute concentration. It is used in the multi-angle light scattering technique to determine the concentration and the weight-average molar mass of polymers. It depends on many parameters, including the structure of the polymer, the solvent, the wavelength of the light and the temperature of the solution. To obtain accurate results, it is necessary to determine the dn/dc at the same condition as for the multi-angle light scattering measurement. In this work, the dn/dc at 633nm of standard synthetic monodispere poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) (PI) and natural rubber (NR) solutions in THF were determined at 25 and 40 degrees C using an Optilab DSP refractometer. The mean value of the dn/dc obtained for NR and PI was 0.13mL/g. No significant difference between different types of samples and temperatures (25 degrees C and 40 degrees C) were observed. The nanoaggregates in NR solution that were not retained after filtration through 1m filter had no effect on the dn/dc. The intercept value of the conformation plot increased in line with the dn/dc, but the Flory exponent remained unchanged.

KW  - UNCERTAINTY
AB  - In this paper the Gaussian Atmospheric Dispersion Modeling System (ADMS4) was coupled with field observations of surface meteorology and concentrations of several air quality indicators (nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO),,fine particulate matter (PM10) and sulfur dioxide (SO2)) to test the applicability of source emission factors set by the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) at an industrial complex. Best emission factors and data groupings based on receptor location, type of terrain and wind speed, were relied upon to examine model performance using statistical analyses of simulated and observed data. The model performance was deemed satisfactory for several scenarios when receptors were located at downwind sites with index of agreement 'd' values reaching 0.58, fractional bias 'FB' and geometric mean bias 'MG' values approaching 0 and 1, respectively, and normalized mean square error 'NMSE' values as low as 2.17. However median ratios of predicted to observed concentrations 'Cp/Co' at variable downstream distances were 0.010 0.36, 0.76 and 0.19 for NOx, CO, PM10 and SO2, respectively, and the fraction of redictions within a factor of two of observations 'FAC2' values were lower than 0.5, indicating that the model could not adequately replicate all observed variations in emittant concentrations. Also, the model was found to he significantly sensitive to the input emission factor bringing into light the deficiency in regulatory compliance modeling which alien uses internationally reported emission factors without testing their applicability.

AB  - How to maintain and improve ecological security in the process of green economy development is of great significance in terms of both theory and practice. Hence, in this paper, based on the framework of DPESAR (driving force-pressure-exposure-sensitivity-adaptation-response), we establish a structural model using SPASS and Eviews6 software to identify the contributing factors for green economy development. We use panel data of Liaoning Province, China, from 1995 to 2017 to analyze the relationships among these factors and their indicators. Furthermore, we simulate and identify the ideal evolution status of the ecological security and green economy development up to the year of 2022. Our results show that first, those adjusted indicators of ecological security can greatly promote green economy development. Second, specific regulation indicators and scope can be obtained by identifying the evolutionary state of ecological security. Third, the interactions among the government, firms, and the public should be considered to further develop regional ecological security and green economy.

AB  - Air environmental health indicators were defined operationally as a combination of "air quality" and "air-related health" indicators. Clean air is a basic precondition of human health. Air pollutants had been identified with potential negative impact on health especially on respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Thus, studies are necessary to identify and understand the state of environmental health. This study was aimed to examine and analyse the air environmental health condition in city of Kuala Lumpur by using a set of indicators. House to house questionnaire survey was carried out to collect air-related health data, and air quality sampling was carried out to identify ambient air quality level of the city. In general, city of Kuala Lumpur was found to have a "moderate level" of air quality. Air-related illnesses indicated by acute respiratory infection and asthma were found to be higher in more developed or higher density zones, as compared to other zones. Besides, air-related illnesses were significantly correlated to respondents' exposure to air pollution. The findings imply that human health can be improved by managing the urban development and its environmental quality properly.

AB  - Growth, Condition Index (CI) and survival of the pearl oysters, Pinctada maxima and R margaritifera, were measured in three size groups of oysters over 14 months at two dissimilar environments in the Great Barrier Reef lagoon. These were the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) in a mainland bay and Orpheus Island Research Station (OIRS) in coral reef waters. Temperature, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and particulate organic matter (POM) were monitored during the study. Temperature at AIMS fluctuated more widely than at OIRS both daily and seasonally, with annual ranges 20-31 degrees C and 22-30 degrees C, respectively. Mean SPM concentration at AIMS (11.1 mg l(-1)) was much higher than at OIRS (1.4 mg l(-1)) and fluctuated widely (2-60 mg l(-1)). Mean POM level was also substantially higher at AIMS, being 2.1 mg l(-1) compared with 0.56 mg l(-1) at OIRS. Von Bertalatiffy growth curve analyses showed that P. maxima grew more rapidly and to larger sizes than P. margaritifera at both sites. For the shell height (SH) of R maxima, growth index phi'=4.31 and 4.24, asymptotic size SHinfinity = 229 and 205 mm, and time to reach 120 mm SH (T-(120))= 1.9 and 2.1 years at AIMS and OIRS, respectively. While for P margaritifera, phi'=4.00 and 4.15, SHinfinity = 136 and 157 mm, and T-(120) = 2.5 and 3.9 years at AIMS and OIRS, respectively. R maxima had significantly lower growth rates and lower survival of small oysters during winter compared with summer. There were, however, no significant differences between the two sites in growth rates of P. maxima and final Cl values. In contrast, P. margaritifiera showed significant differences between sites and not seasons, with lower growth rates, survival of small oysters, final Cl values and asymptotic sizes at AIMS. The winter low temperatures, but not high SPM at AIMS, adversely affected P. maxima. Conversely, the high SPM levels at AIMS, but not temperature, adversely affected P. margaritifera. This was in accordance with earlier laboratory-based energetics studies of the effects of temperature and SPM on these two species. P maxima has potential to be commercially cultured in ca. > 25 degrees C waters with a wide range of SPM levels, including oligotrophic coral reef waters with appropriate particle sizes. It is possible to culture R margaritifera in turbid conditions, but its poor performance in these conditions makes commercial culture unlikely. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study reviews and compares indicators that can serve to characterize numerically the nature of state sequences. It also introduces several new indicators. Alongside basic measures such as the length, the number of visited distinct states, and the number of state changes, we shall consider composite measures such as turbulence and the complexity index, and measures that take account of the nature (e.g., positive vs. negative or ranking) of the states. The discussion points out the strange behavior of some of the measures-Elzinga's turbulence and the precarity index of Ritschard, Bussi, and O'Reilly in particular-and propositions are made to avoid these flaws. The usage of the indicators is illustrated with two applications using data from the Swiss Household Panel. The first application tests the U-shape hypothesis about the evolution of life satisfaction along the life course, and the second one examines the scarring effect of earlier employment sequences.

AB  - Development of urban bird indicators using data from monitoring schemes in two large European cities.-Bird monitoring projects have provided valuable data for developing biological indicators to evaluate the state of natural and agricultural habitats. However, fewer advances have been made in urban environments. In this study we used bird monitoring data from 2002 to 2012 in two cities with different climates (Brussels and Barcelona), to generate two multi-species urban indicators to evaluate temporal trends on abundance of urban avifauna. To do this we used two different conceptual approaches, one based on a list of widespread species in European cities (WSEC) and another based exclusively on species widespread at city level (WCS) regardless of the birds occurring in other cities. The two indicators gave a similar general pattern, although we found a 3% difference in the mean annual change in both cities, thus suggesting that the values provided by urban indicators may differ depending on the conceptual approach and, hence, by the species list used to generate them. However, both indicators may have their own value and could be treated as complementary indices.

AB  - Sustainability is a key concept in economic and policy debates. Nevertheless, it is usually treated only in a qualitative way and has eluded quantitative analysis. Here, we propose a sustainability index based on the premise that sustainable systems do not lose or gain Fisher Information over time. We test this approach using time series data from the Ameri-Flux network that measures ecosystem respiration, water and energy fluxes in order to elucidate two key sustainability features: ecosystem health and stability. A novel definition of ecosystem health is developed based on the concept of criticality, which implies that if a system's fluctuations are scale invariant then the system is in a balance between robustness and adaptability. We define ecosystem stability by taking an information theory approach that measures its entropy and Fisher information. Analysis of the Ameriflux consortium big data set of ecosystem respiration time series is contrasted with land condition data. In general we find a good agreement between the sustainability index and land condition data. However, we acknowledge that the results are a preliminary test of the approach and further verification will require a multi-signal analysis. For example, high values of the sustainability index for some croplands are counter-intuitive and we interpret these results as ecosystems maintained in artificial health due to continuous human-induced inflows of matter and energy in the form of soil nutrients and control of competition, pests and disease.

AB  - After the eruption of the Chaiten Volcano (Chile) and the destruction of the neighboring Chaiten city, some alternative sites were evaluated for the relocation of administrative facilities and housing for the displaced. Three towns (Fandango, Santa Barbara and Bahia Pumalin) were evaluated by means of a multi-criteria analysis, including the impact that a new urban development would have on local biodiversity. This impact was evaluated through a landscape analysis. The landscape attributes studied were (1) composition and representation of each ecosystem type, (2) connectivity, and (3) environmental value, based on a classification of the prevailing ecosystems and their respective stages of succession, defined as a function of ecosystem heterogeneity and maturity. Landscape metrics were calculated from LANDSAT 5 satellite imagery (November 17(th), 2008) with ArcView (R) 3.2 (ESRI) and Fragstats, including the surface cover of each ecosystem type, the number of patches and the cohesion index (CI). Environmental value was determined qualitatively in situ. Santa Barbara was selected by authorities as the best place for New Chaiten City. Over 70% of this is area is covered by forest, achieving a high degree of forest connectivity (CI > 99.0) and shrubs (CI > 94.0), with an advanced stage of succession, a high level of heterogeneity (species and strata) and a high level of inland environmental value. On the coast, Santa Barbara has anthropic influence, but maintains an advanced state of succession, a high level of heterogeneity, and a medium-high degree of environmental value. Regarding the future urban development at this location, the recommendations were: maintenance of riverside integrity and the continuity of forests in Santa Barbara. The proposed methodology proved to be: (1) useful for biodiversity assessment, despite the lack of information at species level, (2) easily replicable, due to the use of standard categories (ecosystem types) and easier access to satellite images, and (3) able to integrate environmental criteria at early stages of decision making in land use and urban planning processes

AB  - Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) is a versatile crop species that is well adapted to arid and semiarid conditions. Limited information is available on the response of safflower genotypes to salinity stress under field conditions. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of field salinity on seed yield, yield components, and leaf ionic concentrations in different safflower genotypes. A 2-yr field experiment was conducted in normal (E1) and saline (E2) field conditions using 64 safflower genotypes. Plant height, number of capitula per plant, number of seeds per capitulum, 1000-seed weight, seed yield, biological yield, and harvest index were determined in this study. Leaf concentrations of Na+ and K+ were also measured and the K+/Na+ ratio calculated. Results indicated that under salinity all the traits significantly decreased except tissue Na+ content and harvest index. Linear regression and genotype-by-traits analyses revealed a strong inverse association between leaf Na+ concentration and salinity tolerance. Results of stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that plant height, number of capitula per plant, biological yield, harvest index, and leaf Na+ content were the strongest predictors of seed yield, collectively explaining 97% of the variation in seed yield under saline conditions. Therefore, the only ionic predictor of salinity tolerance in the regression model, leaf Na+ concentration, can be suggested as an effective indirect screening criterion for salinity tolerance in safflower. The mechanisms of Na+ homoeostasis, including Na+-specific transport or K+/Na+ co-transport, could also be explored using the most contrasting genotypes with respect to salinity stress.

AB  - Patches of vegetation consist of dense clusters of shrubs, grass, or trees, often found to be circular characteristic size, defined by the properties of the vegetation and terrain. Therefore, vegetation patches can be interpreted as localized structures. Previous findings have shown that such localized structures can self-replicate in a binary fashion, where a single vegetation patch elongates and divides into two new patches, in a process resembling cellular mitosis. Here, we extend these previous results by considering the more general case, where the plants interact non-locally, this extension adds an extra level of complexity and shrinks the gap between the model and real ecosystems, where it is known that the plant-to-plant competition through roots and above-ground facilitating interactions have non-local effects, i.e. they extend further away than the nearest neighbor distance. Through numerical simulations, we show that for a moderate level of aridity, a transition from a single patch to periodic pattern occurs. Moreover, for large values of the hydric stress, we predict an opposing route to the formation of periodic patterns, where a homogeneous cover of vegetation may decay to spot-like patterns. The evolution of the biomass of vegetation patches can be used as an indicator of the state of an ecosystem, allowing to distinguish if a system is in a self-replicating or decaying dynamics. In an attempt to relate the theoretical predictions to real ecosystems, we analyze landscapes in Zambia and Mozambique, where vegetation forms patches of tens of meters in diameter. We show that the properties of the patches together with their spatial distributions are consistent with the self-organization hypothesis. We argue that the characteristics of the observed landscapes may be a consequence of patch self-replication, however, detailed field and temporal data is fundamental to assess the real state of the ecosystems.

AB  - The industrial and agricultural activities of mankind, which includes chemical pollution, building of dams and hydroelectric power stations and their use of the biomass of freshwater ecosystems, have had considerable impacts on freshwater ecosystems, the abundance of aquatic species, and the vital capacity of those species' populations. A variety of aquatic organisms are feasible indicators and they can be used for evaluation water quality through analysis of their population diversity, composition and abundance. The most significant threats for freshwater biodiversity and the integrity of aquatic ecosystems are activities in the watershed's terrestrial realm, disturbances occurring in aquatic and riparian environments and threats that affect freshwater organisms. There are changes of functional structure of biological community due to reducing biodiversity and the dominance of opportunistic species. A lot of changes in characteristics of biological communities can be assessed by using different kinds of evaluations, including the index of biological integrity, saprobity system and geographic information system technology. An effective predictor of great number of disturbances to freshwater ecosystems is the density of human population. Approaches that directly evaluate the level of threat to freshwater biodiversity typically use species composition and abundance data. Methods that indirectly assess the biotic community evaluate the ecological integrity of aquatic ecosystems. For large-scale, resource-limited, time-constrained biodiversity conservation planning, the most appropriate method for assessing the impairment of freshwater systems is relativistic evaluation of biological integrity using geospatial data. For aquatic threat assessments, the most meaningful level of analysis is the drainage basin and its subbasins. The concept of ecoregions covers all freshwater ecosystems. This approach provides biologically meaningful units for further large-scale studies of existing and potential threats to biodiversity. The size of drainage basins can be defined from digital elevation models, which exist as global network in high quality resolution. At the level of drainage basin, using high-resolution remote sensing imagery is often feasible from a financial and workload perspective.

AB  - Conservation planning aims to protect biodiversity by sustainng the natural physical, chemical, and biological processes within representative ecosystems. Often data to measure these components are inadequate or unavailable. The impact of human activities on ecosystem processes complicates integrity assessments and might alter ecosystem organization at multiple spatial scales. Freshwater conservation targets, such as populations and communities, are influenced by both intrinsic aquatic properties and the surrounding landscape, and locally collected data might not accurately reflect potential impacts. We suggest that changes in five major biotic drivers-energy sources, physical habitat, flow regime, water quality, and biotic interactions-might be used as surrogates to inform conservation planners of the ecological integrity of freshwater ecosystems. Threats to freshwater systems might be evaluated based on their impact to these drivers to provide an overview of potential risk to conservation targets. We developed a risk-based protocol, the Ecological Risk Index (ERI), to identify watersheds with least/most risk to conservation targets. Our protocol combines risk-based components, specifically the frequency and severity of human-induced stressors, with biotic drivers and mappable land- and water-use data to provide a summary of relative risk to watersheds. We illustrate application of our protocol with a case study of the upper Tennessee River basin, USA. Differences in risk patterns among the major drainages in the basin reflect dominant land uses, such as mining and agriculture. A principal components analysis showed that localized, moderately severe threats accounted for most of the threat composition differences among our watersheds. We also found that the relative importance of threats is sensitive to the spatial grain of the analysis. Our case study demonstrates that the ERI is useful for evaluating the frequency and severity of ecosystemwide risk, which can inform local and regional conservation planning.

AB  - Exergy is considered as a goal function or ecological orientor. Normally at the edge of oscillation exergy reaches to its maximum value when the ecosystem had no adaptation on it. To study the variation of exergy in different states of ecosystem, a simple three species (phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish) food chain model has been considered. From the model it is shown that the system moves from steady state to chaotic state by decreasing zooplankton body volume in turn increasing its grazing rate. By the property of self-adaptability the system tries to overcome this situation. Two such possible processes are described here: (i) by the toxic effect of phytoplankton and (ii) by reducing half saturation constant of fishes. In both this cases exergy value reduces and the system reaches to stable state. Through the analysis of exergy variation in all these situations this paper shows that the system chose the process in which the reduction of exergy will be the minimum. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A rapid, precise, selective and robust UPLC method for simultaneous estimation of diloxanide furoate, metronidazole benzoate, methyl paraben and propyl paraben in pharmaceutical suspension was developed and subsequently validated as per ICH guidelines. Chromatographic separation was achieved using gradient elution with 0.01 M KHPO4 and a mixture of methanol-acetonitrile (50: 50) on Acquity BEH-C18 (carbon 17.7 %) and BEH-Shield RP18 (carbon 16.6 %) columns (100 x 2.1 mm, 1.7 mu m particle size) maintained at 40 degrees C with flow rate of 0.45 mL/min at 260 nm. The retention times of methyl paraben, propyl paraben, metronidazole benzoate and diloxanide furoate were found to be 0.82, 1.31, 2.34 and 3.45 min respectively. The calibration curve was linear over a concentration range of 8-16 mu g/mL and 0.8-1.6 mu g/mL for the assay of methyl paraben and propyl paraben, while 8-40 mu g/mL concentration range was used for metronidazole benzoate and diloxanide furoate. The percentage recovery for spiked concentration in drug formulation was found excellent for all the four components under investigation. The sensitivity of method is presented by low detection limits. After the application of all stress conditions peak purity index was > 0.9999 for analyte indicating its complete separation from degradation products peaks demonstrated the selectivity of method.

AB  - Environmental conditions during early development, from conception to sexual maturity, can have lasting consequences on fitness components. Although adult life span often accounts for much of the variation in fitness in long-lived animals, we know little about how early environment affects adult life span in the wild, and even less about whether these effects differ between the sexes. Using data collected over 45years from wild bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), we investigated the effects of early environment on adult mortality in both sexes, distinguishing between natural and anthropogenic sources of mortality. We used the average body mass of yearlings (at about 15months of age) as a yearly index of environmental quality. We first examined sex differences in natural mortality responses to early environment by censoring harvested males in the year they were shot. We then investigated sex differences in the effects of early environment on overall mortality (natural and hunting mortality combined). Finally, we used path analysis to separate the direct influence of early environment from indirect influences, mediated by age at first reproduction, adult mass and horn length. As early environmental conditions improved, natural adult mortality decreased in both sexes, although for males the effect was not statistically supported. Sex differences in the effects of early environment on adult mortality were detected only when natural and hunting mortality were pooled. Males that experienced favourable early environment had longer horns as adults and died earlier because of trophy hunting, which does not mimic natural mortality. Females that experienced favourable early environment started to reproduce earlier and early primiparity was associated with reduced mortality, suggesting a silver-spoon effect. Our results show that early conditions affect males and females differently because of trophy hunting. These findings highlight the importance of considering natural and anthropogenic environmental factors across different life stages to understand sex differences in mortality.

AB  - Benthic macroinvertebrates are integral components of stream ecosystems and are often used to assess the ecological integrity of streams. We sampled streams in the upper Clear Creek drainage in the Klamath-Siskiyou Ecoregion of northwestern California in fall 2004 (17 sites) and 2005 (original 17 plus 4 new sites) with the objectives of documenting the benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages supported by the streams in the area, determining how those assemblages respond to environmental variables, assessing the biological condition of the streams using a benthic index of biotic integrity (IBI), and understanding the assemblages in the context of biodiversity of the ecoregion. We collected both reach-wide (RW) and targeted-riffle (TR) macroinvertebrate samples at each site. The macroinvertebrate assemblages were diverse, with over 150 genera collected for each sampling protocol. The macroinvertebrate assemblages appeared to be most responsive to a general habitat gradient based on stream size, gradient, flow, and dominance of riffles. A second important habitat gradient was based on elevation and dominance of riffles. A gradient in water quality based on concentrations of dissolved ions and metals was also important. Models based on these 3 gradients had Spearman's rank correlations with macroinvertebrate taxonomic composition of 0.60 and 0.50 for the TR and RW samples, respectively. The majority (>50%) of the sites were in good or very good biological condition based on IBI scores. The diversity of macroinvertebrate assemblages is associated with the diversity of habitats available in the Klamath-Siskiyou Ecoregion. Maintaining the aquatic habitats in good condition is important in itself but is also vital to maintaining biodiversity in this diverse and unique ecoregion.

AB  - Annual expenditures by the federal government in the United States for agricultural conservation programs increased about 80 percent with passage of the 2002 Farm Bill. However, environmental benefits of these programs have not been quantified. A national project is under way to estimate the effect of conservation practices on environmental resources. The watershed models intended for use in that project are focused on water quantity and quality and have minimal habitat assessment capability. Major impairments to aquatic ecosystems in many watersheds consist of physical habitat degradation, not water quality, suggesting that current models for this national initiative do not address one of the most significant aspects of aquatic ecosystem degradation. Currently used models contain some components relevant to aquatic habitat, and this paper describes specific components that should be added to allow rudimentary stream habitat quality assessments. At least six types of variables could be examined for ecological impact: land use, streamflow, water temperature, streambed material type, large woody debris, and hydraulic conditions at base flow. All of these variables are influenced by the presence, location, and quality of buffers. Generation of stream corridor ecological or habitat quality indices might contribute to assessments of the success or failure of conservation programs. Additional research is needed to refine procedures for combining specific measures of stream habitat into ecologically meaningful indices.

AB  - Breeding birds in forest ecosystems are generally diverse, habitat selective, and easily sampled. Because they must integrate environmental variables over space and time, local populations of forest birds (like other animal and plant taxa) may provide meaningful signals of local forest health or degradation. We evaluated 949 breeding bird surveys in areas ranging from degraded urban/suburban forest remnants to relatively pristine old growth forests in the western Laurentian Great Lakes region of North America. The "human footprint'' across this landscape was represented by a one-dimensional numeric gradient derived from land cover variables, forest fragmentation metrics, and publicly available data on housing density and transportation corridors. We used an iterative, maximum likelihood approach to quantify species-specific responses to this human disturbance gradient. Many species showed significant directional responses, consistent with known life history attributes. Other species were most commonly detected at intermediate levels of anthropogenic disturbance, yielding unimodal responses. Relationships between the "human footprint'' and occurrences of 38 bird species were illustrated by general Gaussian functions that represented both unidirectional and unimodal patterns. These biotic response (BR) functions were combined into a bird-based index of ecological condition (IEC) ranging from 0 (maximally degraded) to 10 (minimally degraded). We described a successful application of the IEC method at the Wild Rivers Legacy Forest (WRLF), a >260 km(2) conservation landscape in northeastern Wisconsin, USA, managed primarily under a working forest conservation easement established in 2006. In general, areas within the WRLF yielded high IEC values (7.0-9.0), but nearby forest areas not under the conservation easement were characterized by significantly lower IEC values based on breeding bird assemblages.

AB  - Fungi are the most active biodeteriorators of natural and man-made materials. The article presents generalizations of the studies (20012019) of communities of microscopic fungi within biofilms on various substrates: shells of live Mytilus (Mytilus galloprovincialis, 670 specimens) and Ostreidae (Crassostrea gigas, 90 specimens), fragments of driftwood (over 7,000), stones (40), concrete of hydrotechnical constructions along the shoreline (80) and wood between concrete blocks in constructions on the shores (80). The studies were carried out in Odessa Oblast, the coastal zone of Sevastopol and open area of the Black Sea. There were identified 123 species of micromycetes, belonging to 65 genera, 33 families, 21 orders, 10 classes, 4 divisions, 2 kingdoms: Fungi and Chromista (fungi-like organisms). The Chromista kingdom was represented by 1 species - Ostracoblabe implexa, on shells of C. gigas. The number of species of micromycetes on various substrates varied 23 (wood between concrete blocks of hydrotechnical constructions) to 74 (shells of M. galloprovincialis at the depths of 3 and 6 m). On all the substrates, the following species were found; Alternaria alternata, Botryotrichum murorum. The communities were found to contain pathogenic fungi Aspergillus fumigatus (shells of mollusks, stones, concrete), A. terreus (concrete), Fusarium oxysporum, Pseudallescheria boydii (shells of mollusks). The best representation was seen for the Pleosporales order - from 12.9% (shells of M. galloprovincialis, 0.3 m depth) to 33.3% (shells of C. gigas) of the species composition. Toxin-producing species of Microascales in mycological communities accounted for 1.6% (driftwood) to 40.0% (concrete), and were also observed on shells of Bivalvia - 11.1-32.3%. Similarity of species composition of mycological communities according to Bray-Curtis coefficient varied 21.1% (driftwood and concrete, 10 shared species) to 72.7% (shells of M. galloprovincialis, the depths of 3 and 7 m and shells of C. gigas, 45 shared species). Using graphs of indices of mean taxonomic distinctness (AvTD, Delta+) and variation (Variation in Taxonomic Distinctness index, VarTD, Delta+), we determined deviations of taxonomic structure of the studied mycological communities from the level of mean expected values, calculated based on the list of species, taking into account their systematic positions. The lowest values of index Delta+ were determined for communities on shells of M. galloprovincialis, 0.3 m depth, driftwood, stones and concrete. These communities had uneven distribution of species according to higher taxonomic ranks and minimum number of the highest taxa: 4-6 classes, 1-2 divisions, Fungi kingdom. Disproportion in species composition with decrease in the number of the highest taxa occurred in extreme environmental conditions. Using index.+, we found that the most complex taxonomic structure of fungi communities has developed on concrete and shells of C. gigas. In mycological communities on those substrates, the number of species was low (25 and 46), but they belonged to 4-7 classes, 2-3 divisions, 1-2 kingdoms. To compare the structures of mycological communities that have developed in such substrates in biotopes sea, sea-land-air, land-air, we compiled a list of fungi based on the literature data, which, taking into account our data, comprised 445 species of 240 genera, 103 families, 51 orders, 15 classes, 5 divisions, 2 kingdoms.
   The analysis revealed that on substrates with similar chemical composition, in all the biotopes, the species of the same divisions dominated (genus and family may vary). Therefore, in the biotope land-air - Hypocreales, Pleosporales, Eurotiales (genera Acremonium, Fusarium, Alternaria, Aspergillus, Penicillium); sea - Pleosporales, Eurotiales, Microascales (Alternaria, Aspergillus, Penicillium, Corollospora); sea-land-air - Pleosporales, Microascales (Alternaria, Leptosphaeria, Aspergillus, Penicillium, Corollospora, Halosarpheia). Monitoring of species composition of myxomycetes is needed in farms that cultivate industrial objects, recreation sites, various buildings for prevention of mycotoxin intoxication and infestation by mycodermatoses and other diseases caused by opportunistic and pathogenic fungi.

AB  - The objective of this study was to compare the responses of diatoms, macroinvertebrates and fish to agriculture, urbanization and mining in the Manyame River Basin. Water quality sampling and benthic diatom, macroinvertebrate and fish community data were collected in April (end of the rain season) and September (dry season) 2013 at 44 sampling stations spread out across three land-use categories: commercial agricultural, communal agricultural and urban-mining areas. Commercial agricultural areas were relatively pristine as they were characterized by mature deciduous riparian forest strips which acted as riparian buffers thus protecting water resources from nonpoint source pollution. In communal agricultural areas a combination of poor agricultural practices (stream bank cultivation, overgrazing, soil erosions) and high human population densities had negative effects on water quality of streams draining these areas. Streams in urban-mining areas were highly stressed, being impacted primarily by physical habitat degradation and both point and nonpoint sources of pollution. A suite of environmental variables that varied with land-use pattern was assessed to find the combination of variables that best explained patterns of biota community composition. Community metrics i.e. the Trophic Diatom Index (TDI) based on diatoms, the South African Scoring system version 5 (SASS 5) based on macroinvertebrates and the Fish Assemblage Integrity Index (FAIL) were used to determine the ecological status of study streams in relation to human-induced stressors. Data were also subjected to multivariate statistical techniques; canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), mantel test and cluster analysis to determine environmental gradients along which the diatom, macroinvertebrate and fish assemblages were distributed as well as to elucidate hypothesized differences in response to stressors among communities per land-use type. Using CCA, we assessed the individual importance of a set of environmental variables on each biotic community structure. ANOVA, showed a significant difference (p < 0.05) in physical and chemical variables among commercial agricultural, communal agricultural and urban-mining sampling stations with no significant differences (p > 0.05) between the 2 sampling periods. Based on CCAs carried out using individual variables, the strengths of relationships between diatoms and macroinvertebrates was generally high for nutrient levels, organic and metal pollution and other variables. However, fish assemblages showed a relatively low association with all water quality variables in the study; this might be explained by the high abundance of omnivores and air breathers which are able to tolerate a variety of environmental conditions. These patterns were also confirmed by the mantel test as well as the other CCAs carried out to investigate the simultaneous effects of environmental variables. These findings indicate that diatoms are more powerful indicators in accessing ecological stream/river quality and have potential for application in routine monitoring programs in tropical streams.

AB  - Global climate change is predicted to increase heat, drought, and soil-drying conditions, and thereby increase crop sensitivity to water vapour pressure deficit, resulting in productivity losses. Increasing competition between agricultural freshwater use and municipal or industrial uses suggest that crops with greater heat and drought durability and greater water-use efficiency will be crucial for sustainable biomass production systems in the future. Agave (Agavaceae) and Opuntia (Cactaceae) represent highly water-use efficient bioenergy crops that could diversify bioenergy feedstock supply yet preserve or expand feedstock production into semi-arid, abandoned, or degraded agricultural lands, and reclaim drylands. Agave and Opuntia are crassulacean acid metabolism species that can achieve high water-use efficiencies and grow in water-limited areas with insufficient precipitation to support traditional C-3 or C-4 bioenergy crops. Both Agave and Opuntia have the potential to produce above-ground biomass rivalling that of C-3 and C-4 crops under optimal growing conditions. The low lignin and high amorphous cellulose contents of Agave and Opuntia lignocellulosic biomass will be less recalcitrant to deconstruction than traditional feedstocks, as confirmed by pretreatments that improve saccharification of Agave. Refined environmental productivity indices and geographical information systems modelling have provided estimates of Agave and Opuntia biomass productivity and terrestrial sequestration of atmospheric CO2; however, the accuracy of such modelling efforts can be improved through the expansion of field trials in diverse geographical settings. Lastly, life cycle analysis indicates that Agave would have productivity, life cycle energy, and greenhouse gas balances comparable or superior to those of traditional bioenergy feedstocks, but would be far more water-use efficient.

AB  - Estimating exposure in receiving waterbodies is a key step in the regulatory process to evaluate potential ecological risks posed by the use of agricultural pesticides. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) currently uses the Variable Volume Water Model (VVWM) to predict environmental concentrations of pesticides in static waterbodies (ponds) that receive edge-of-field runoff inputs from the Pesticide Root Zone Model (PRZM). This regulatory model, however, does not adequately characterize potential pesticide concentrations in flowing water systems (streams and rivers) drained from watershed areas. This study aims at addressing this gap by coupling the regulatory PRZM model with a watershed-level hydrological model, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), to predict pesticide concentrations in flowing water habitats for aquatic organisms. This coupled PRZM-SWAT model was applied in a test watershed (-.HUC12), a headwater watershed of Goodwater Creek in Missouri, and simulation results at the outlet of this watershed were compared to daily and near-daily measured streamflow and atrazine concentration data from a decade-long sampling campaign. Overall, the PRZM-SWAT model captured (1) the general magnitude and temporal trend of daily atrazine concentrations, (2) the observed high-end of exposure levels (>3 ppb) of atrazine concentrations, and (3) the 90 th centile annual maximum for various exposure durations (1-, 4-, 7-, 21-, and 60-day rolling average), which are important exposure metrics used in assessing the potential ecological risks posed by the application of pesticides. The PRZM-SWAT model is expected to expand the utility of the field-scale regulatory model to include pesticide exposure prediction capability in flowing waterbodies from agricultural watersheds.

AB  - The aim was to review ecosystem state changes and the role of palaeo-ecological tools with application to intertidal subtropical and tropical intertidal wetlands. These systems are especially vulnerable to stress from sea-level change, climate change, and development activities. Responses to stress can lead to significant state changes with the system passing thresholds, potentially beyond recovery. Indicators of state changes and approaching tipping points include a critical slowing down following perturbation signalled by, for example, slowing recovery rates, increased attribute variance, and changed skewness. To identify such changes, data are needed for the relevant variables such as vegetation, sea level, and sediment processes so as to observe the indicative changes and their timing. Because changes may be relatively slow in ecological terms, very long-term data are needed to inform management about future likely states or thresholds so that mitigation or adaptation can be planned. One approach is to use palaeo-ecological data. These data are relatively scarce in tropical intertidal systems. This paper reviews a range of palaeo-indicators. These include state indicators (pollen, foraminifera, and diatoms), stable isotope analysis, and stratigraphy and temporal indicators involving sediment dating. Each is potentially useful, although there are uncertainties related to, for example, the redistribution organic matter in sediment cores. In conclusion, it is recommended that integrating or combining several indicators can assist in triangulating results, thereby increasing confidence in their interpretation. It is also suggested that data, if available, can be retrofitted to assess at least some of the state change indicators, such as data variance and skewness.

AB  - Because of the heterogeneity of the human population, it is generally expected that there will be a broad range of observed susceptibilities to the biological effects of exposure to chemicals or drugs. Often it is possible to distinguish specific classes of individuals, such as infants or the elderly, who appear to be more susceptible to a specific effect. Non-cancer risk assessments often address this variability by dividing the experimentally determined acceptable exposure level by an uncertainty factor of 10 to protect sensitive individuals; cancer risk assessments typically do not address this issue in any quantitative fashion. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling provides the capability to quantitatively describe the potential impact of pharmacokinetic factors on the variability of individual risk. In particular, PBPK models can be used to determine the impact of differences in key metabolism enzymes, whether due to multiple genotypic expression, such as cytochrome P450 polymorphisms, or just due to normal variation in enzyme activities within the general population. Other potential modulators of sensitivity which can be addressed quantitatively with a PBPK model include physical condition, level of activity, disease states, age, hormonal status, and interactions with other chemicals and drugs. In each case, the PBPK model provides a quantitative structure for determining the effect of these various factors on the relationship between the external (environmental) exposure and the internal (biologically effective) target tissue exposure. When coupled with Monte Carlo analysis, the PBPK model provides a method to assess the quantitative impact of these sources of variability on individual risk (as opposed to average population risk) by comparing model-predicted risks over the distribution of individual parameter values.

AB  - Agroecosystem health derives from a combination of biophysical and socioeconomic conditions that jointly influence such properties as productivity, sustainability, stability, and equitability. In this case study, we describe and analyze a method to quantify agroecosystem health through a combination of geographically referenced data at various spatial scales. Six key variables were hypothesized to provide a minimum set of conditions required to quantify agroecosystem health: soil health, biodiversity, topography, farm economics, land economics, and social organization. Each of these key variables was quantified by one or more attributes of a study area near Wooster, Ohio. Data sources included remote sensing, digital elevation models, soil maps, county auditor records, and a structured questionnaire of landowners in the study area. These data were combined by an analytical hierarchy process to yield an agroecosystem health index. The two steps in the process were first to combine the data at the pixel scale (30 m(2)) into key variables with normalized values, and then to combine the key variables into the final index. The analytical hierarchy process model was developed by panels of experts for each key variable and by participants in the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center's Agroecosystems Management Program for the final agroecosystem health index value. Observed spatial patterns of the agroecosystem health index were then analyzed with respect to the underlying data. Consistent with our hypothesis and the definition of agroecosystems, spatial patterns in the agroecosystem health index were an emergent property of combined socioeconomic and biophysical conditions not apparent in any of the underlying data or key variables. The method proposed in this study permits estimation of agroecosystem health as a function of specific underlying conditions, which combine in complex ways. Because values of the agroecosystem health index and the data underlying them can be analyzed for a particular landscape, the method proposed could be useful to policy makers, educators, service agencies, organizations, and the people who live in the area for finding opportunities to improve the health of their agroecosystem.

AB  - The model QUEFTS (QUantitative Evaluation of the Fertility of Tropical Soils) was calibrated using data from maize fertilizer trials in Kenya. QUEFTS describes, in four steps, relations between (i) chemical soil test values, (ii) potential NPK supply from soils and fertilizer, (iii) actual NPK uptake, and (iv) maize grain yield, acknowledging interactions between the three macronutrients. All steps were calibrated separately, and yield a modified version of QUEFTS. Major changes were the inclusion of ambient temperature and clay content in explaining potential nitrogen supply, and the replacement of the parabolic relation between potential supply and actual uptake by an exponential relation. The goodness of fit (r(2)) between measured and calculated yield was improved from 0.66 in the original version to 0.78 in the modified version of QUEFTS and, when including a boundary condition for harvest index, to 0.88. A satisfactory validation was conducted with input data from fertilizer experiments in other parts of Kenya. Sensitivity analysis revealed that changing the parameters pH and organic N by 20% caused yield differences of at least 10%.
   The basic thinking and theoretical concepts underlying the original version of QUEFTS Still apply to the modified version. Agronomists in tropical environments are encouraged to collect the relatively few input data to further validate the two versions of the model. As a consequence, QUEFTS can contribute to a more efficient procurement and use of mineral fertilizers at both regional and farm level.

AB  - Assessment of water pollution in a rural area is often not taken on priority as compared to urban areas. However, rural activities such as bathing, washing etc in vicinity of water sources can lead to contamination of water. Assessment of water quality in such cases at regular interval is necessary in order to minimise the impact of water pollution. In this study, groundwater quality of the rural environment of Satlasana Taluka in the state of Gujarat, India has been assessed through application of Weighted Arithmetic Water Quality Index (WAWQI) and Canadian Council Ministers of Environment Water Quality Index (CCMEWQI). Water from 50 groundwater sources from 9 villages had been used to assess the quality. The parameters such as pH, Turbidity, TDS, Total Hardness, Total Alkalinity, Dissolved Oxygen, and Chloride were analysed in these groundwater sources consecutive six months. WAWQI, and CCMEWQI were calculated for each water source and the reference standards used for the comparative assessment of the parameters were IS, WHO and CPCB. Assessment using WAWQI, revealed that 46% of the sources were found to be of good water quality, while using CCMEWQI, 54% of the sources were found to be of marginal water quality. Majorly exceeding parameters were Total Hardness, Total Alkalinity, TDS, and Turbidity. Treatment of these parameters with appropriate conventional strategies can make the groundwater safe for drinking purposes. This study sheds light on the pristine condition of the groundwater quality in the rural environment and thus is appropriate for water quality assessment in different rural villages.

AB  - Original Canadian Council of Minster of the Environment Water Quality Index (CCME WQI) is being used for assessing the water quality of surface water sources and distribution systems on a case by case basis. Its full potential as a management tool for complete water supply systems (WSSs) has yet to be recognized at the global level. A framework is developed using the modified CCME WQI to assess spatiotemporal water quality from groundwater source to treatment and distribution networks in smaller systems. The modified index resolves a limitation of the original index by also evaluating the microbiological water quality parameters which have to be completely absent for meeting desired drinking water quality standards. The framework divides the distribution network in different zones, which are further segregated into districts, to improve the decision-making process. Temporal assessment identifies the seasons with higher probabilities of failures, while the spatial assessment provides an insight on the performance (i.e., Excellent to Poor) of each district in a distribution network. In addition to failure probability, risk mapping gives appropriate attention to the number of consumers in different districts. Application of the framework on two smaller WSSs (population less than 50,000) in Qassim region revealed that the remotely located districts from the treatment facility underperform in comparison to the closely situated districts. Managers can effectively apply the proposed framework to identify the locations and periods of water quality failures in each component (i.e., source, treatment, and distribution) of a smaller WSS for effective utilization of their resources in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere with similar conditions.

AB  - The potential ecological and economic effects of climate change for tropical islands were studied using output from 12 statistically downscaled general circulation models (GCMs) taking Puerto Rico as a test case. Two model selection/model averaging strategies were used: the average of all available GCMs and the average of the models that are able to reproduce the observed large-scale dynamics that control precipitation over the Caribbean. Five island-wide and multidecadal averages of daily precipitation and temperature were estimated by way of a climatology-informed interpolation of the site-specific downscaled climate model output. Annual cooling degree-days (CDD) were calculated as a proxy index for air-conditioning energy demand, and two measures of annual no-rainfall days were used as drought indices. Holdridge life zone classification was used to map the possible ecological effects of climate change. Precipitation is predicted to decline in both model ensembles, but the decrease was more severe in the "regionally consistent" models. The precipitation declines cause gradual and linear increases in drought intensity and extremes. The warming from the 1960-90 period to the 2071-99 period was 4.6 degrees-9 degrees C depending on the global emission scenarios and location. This warming may cause increases in CDD, and consequently increasing energy demands. Life zones may shift from wetter to drier zones with the possibility of losing most, if not all, of the subtropical rain forests and extinction risks to rain forest specialists or obligates.

AB  - Preharvest sprouting is common in cereals that lack grain dormancy if maturing grain is exposed to rain. Over three successive seasons wheat genotypes with a range of dormancy levels, were exposed to moisture stress and periods of high temperature stress (> 30 degrees C) in controlled field trials. Dormancy assessments were based on a germination index of hand threshed grain throughout grain filling. There were three main results. First, moisture stress combined with consistently high temperature during grain filling was associated with induced dormancy in Cunderdin, (germination index of 0.41) in a normally non-dormant genotype (germination index normally > 0.80), but no additional dormancy in DM 2001, a dormant genotype (germination index normally < 0.10). In contrast sudden heat shocks (> 30 degrees C max. for > 12 days) at 30-50 days post-anthesis reduced dormancy, germination index increase of 0.42 on average across five genotypes. Secondly, whilst dormancy was affected by moisture and heat stress, genotypes maintained their relative rankings across environments and genotype had the most effect on dormancy (70-92% of the variation in germination index) with DM 2001 and DH 22 more dormant than DH 56, DH 45 and Cunderdin. Finally, the effect of environment was different for different genotypes; those with partial dormancy (germination index usually 0.20-0.50, DH 56 and DH 45) were most influenced by the environmental conditions with germination indexes ranging from 0.06 to 0.85 depending on environment. Consequently avoidance of high temperatures, moisture stress, and maturity x stress interactions, are important prerequisites in screening for genotypes with genetic differences in dormancy.

AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP) is one of the essential indicators of regional eco-environment security. In ecologically fragile areas, debris flow prone areas are extremely sensitive to human and natural impacts. In this study, our goal was to explore the main driving forces and their characteristics that caused changes in NPP. This was achieved by collecting and analyzing mull-source data of a typical region in SW China. A pixel-based spatial analysis method was conducted in this study to quantify the co-evolution characteristics between NPP and the main driving forces. Our results showed that the overall NPP in the region exhibits an increasing trend. The main driving forces are NDVI and population density, which can explain > 70% of the environmental states. In addition, co-evolution characteristics were obvious; generally, NDVI had a positive effect and population density had a negative effect. However, extremely significant negative correlations between NPP and NDVI were found in 12.01% of the study area. Therefore, carrying out reasonable ecological restoration and applicable human activities in debris flow prone areas could ensure eco-environment security and sustainable development. This study contributes to improving our understanding of eco-environment evolution of critical zones and provides a scientific basis for regional eco-environment security construction and eco-treatment of debris flow.

AB  - The occurrence and causes of abrupt transitions, thresholds, or regime shifts between ecosystem states are of great concern and the likelihood of such transitions is increasing for many ecological systems. General understanding of abrupt transitions has been advanced by theory, but hindered by the lack of a common, accessible, and data-driven approach to characterizing them. We apply such an approach to 30-60 years of data on environmental drivers, biological responses, and associated evidence from pelagic ocean, coastal benthic, polar marine, and semi-arid grassland ecosystems. Our analyses revealed one case in which the response (krill abundance) linearly tracked abrupt changes in the driver (Pacific Decadal Oscillation), but abrupt transitions detected in the three other cases (sea cucumber abundance, penguin abundance, and black grama grass production) exhibited hysteretic relationships with drivers (wave intensity, sea-ice duration, and amounts of monsoonal rainfall, respectively) through a variety of response mechanisms. The use of a common approach across these case studies illustrates that: the utility of leading indicators is often limited and can depend on the abruptness of a transition relative to the lifespan of responsive organisms and observation intervals; information on spatiotemporal context is useful for comparing transitions; and ancillary information from associated experiments and observations aids interpretation of response-driver relationships. The understanding of abrupt transitions offered by this approach provides information that can be used to manage state changes

AB  - The relevance of the discussed issue is caused by the necessity to enhance the objectivity and reliability of information on land plots in relation with the conducting reform of the system of State real property cadastre. The integration of an environmental component into the system of State real property cadastre is relevant to the maintenance of high-polluted urban territories. Nowadays there are no approved standards in this field, and various techniques proposed by experts are based on analysis and assessment of existing contamination levels of environment components. The urban environment is not considered as a dynamic system, and its development over time and space is not taken into account. Thus, the complex analysis of time and space dynamics of pollutants in accordance with natural conditions and city infrastructure is essential for the system analysis of urban environment.
   The aim of the study was to determine an approach to integrate environmental component into the system of State real property cadastre by geoin formation analysis and 3D cartographic modeling of time and space dynamics of pollutants in urban environment.
   The methods: geoin formation analysis, cartographic modeling, cartographic visualization techniques, 3D cartographic modeling.
   The results. The authors have proposed the approach to assess urban environment taking into account the patterns of pollution dissemination and proved the logical sequence of integration of heterogeneous environmental data for modeling pollution distribution. The digital relief model and digital terrain model of Novosibirsk city were formed. The environmental database of Novosibirsk city was developed. The authors carried out the zoning of city territory by composite index regarding environmental risk and designed a 3D model of pollution dissemination.
   Conclusion. The approach introduced provides the dynamic analysis of urban environment as a result of interaction of natural and anthropogenic processes determining pollution dissemination. This provides the detailed and objective assessment of environment of cadastral quarters and lays the foundation for integration of the environmental component into the system of State real property cadastre.

AB  - There is an urgent need to track how natural systems are responding to global change in order to better guide management efforts. Traditionally, taxonomically based metrics have been used as indicators of ecosystem integrity and conservation status. However, functional approaches offer promising advantages that can improve bioassessment performance. In this study, we aim to test the applicability of functional redundancy (FR), a functional feature related to the stability, resistance and resilience of ecosystems, as a tool for bioassessment, looking at woody riparian communities in particular. We used linear mixed-effect models to investigate the response of FR and other traditional biomonitoring indices to natural (drought duration) and anthropogenic stress gradients (flow regulation and agriculture) in a Mediterranean basin. Such indices include species richness, a taxonomic index, and the Riparian Quality Index, which is an index of ecological status. Then, we explored the ability of FR and the other indices to discriminate between different intensities of human alteration. FR showed higher explanatory capacity in response to multiple stressors, although we found significant negative relationships between all the biological indices (taxonomic, functional and ecological quality) and stress gradients. In addition, FR was the most accurate index to discriminate among different categories of human alteration in both perennial and intermittent river reaches, which allowed us to set threshold values to identify undisturbed (reference condition), moderately disturbed and highly disturbed reaches in the two types of river. Using these thresholds and the best-fitting model, we generated a map of human impact on the functional redundancy of riparian communities for all the stretches of the river network. Our results demonstrate that FR presents clear advantages over traditional methods, which suggests that it should be part of the biomonitoring toolbox used for environmental management so as to obtain better predictions of ecosystem response to environmental changes.

AB  - We examined patterns of concordance between macroinvertebrate and fish communities among adventitious and ordinate tributaries of the Monongahela River in southwestern Pennsylvania in order to determine their efficacy as mutual surrogates for the assessment of ecosystem integrity. Fish, macroinvertebrates, and 19 water quality parameters were sampled from 20 streams. Collected data were analyzed by principal components analysis, redundancy analysis, and Ward's distance clustering matrices to determine degrees of community concordance and similarity. Fish and macroinvertebrate communities were assessed utilizing Indices of Biotic Integrity (IBI) in order to compare stream ecosystem health as expressed by each index. Adventitious and ordinate macroinvertebrate communities largely clustered in like groups with adventitious tributaries dominated by the crustacean Gammarus sp. and ordinate streams dominated by the trichopteran, Hydropsyche sp. Adventitious communities were strongly influenced by elevated total alkalinity and total suspended solids; ordinate communities by contrast to elevated total organic carbon and specific conductance. Fish communities showed no significant relationship to water quality parameters among either tributary type, but often grouped with their nearest geographic neighbor. The respective indices revealed a discord between the two communities suggesting that neither community serves as a surrogate for the other as an indicator of stream health in this basin. Both communities appeared to be driven by differences in local environmental conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Microwave (MW) sensing offers noninvasive, real-time detection of the electromagnetic properties of biological materials via the highly concentrated electromagnetic fields, for which advantages include wide bandwidth, small size, and cost-effective fabrication. In this paper, we present the application of MW broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) coupled to a fabricated biological thin film for evaluating ultraviolet-C (UV-C) exposure effects. The BDS thin film technique could be deployed as a biological indicator for assessing whole-room UV-C surface disinfection. The disinfection process is monitored by BDS as changes in the electrical properties of surface-confined biological thin films photodegraded with UV-C radiation. Fetal bovine serum (FBS, a surrogate for protein) and bacteriophage lambda double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (dsDNA) were continuously monitored with BDS during UV-C radiation exposure. The electrical resistance of FBS films yielded promising yet imprecise readings, whereas the resistance of dsDNA films discernibly decreased with UV-C exposure. The observations are consistent with the expected photo-oxidation and photodecomposition of protein and DNA. While further research is needed to characterize these measurements, this study presents the first application of BDS to evaluate the electrical properties of solid-state biological thin films. This technique shows promise toward the development of a test method and a standard biological test to determine the efficacy of UV-C disinfection. Such a test with biological indicators could easily be applied to hospital rooms between patient occupancy for a multipoint evaluation to determine if a room meets a disinfection threshold set for new patients.

AB  - The sales of sachet water (SW), also known as "pure water" (PW), in Nigeria is a lucrative business. It serves many people, especially low-income earners, by providing a more affordable access to safe drinking water when compared with table water. However, some of the producers of SW do not effectively treat raw water before packaging them for sale. This study investigates the presence and concentrations of heavy metals, such as chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), aluminum (Al), and zinc (Zn) in some samples of SW sold within Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria. Samples of SW from nine different producers were purchased for four consecutive weeks and analyzed to determine the concentrations of these heavy metals in them. Furthermore, health risk indicators, such as chronic daily intake (CDI) and health risk indices (HRI) for children and adults, were calculated separately. The metal concentrations were compared with allowable limits set by the World Health Organization (WHO), Nigerian Industrial Standard (NIS), and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). High concentrations of Cr, Fe, and Al were found in all the nine samples and exceeded the maximum allowable limits (MAL) of all the standards considered. However, the concentrations of Zn, Mn, and Cu were within permissible limits. The HRIs of heavy metals were in the order of Cu > Fe > Zn > Mn > Al > Cr, but since the standard limits set for some metals were exceeded, proper and effective treatment is required to safeguard the health of consumers.

AB  - The ecological risk of heavy metals (HM) resulting from the use of sewage sludge compost (SSC) as an amendment to flower garden soil (FGS) and to abandoned phosphate mine soil (APMS) influenced by acid rain were simulated in lysimeter trials and the potential ecological risk index (PERI) was evaluated with minor modifications. The use of SSC indeed increased the mobility and release of HMs in FGS and APMS under conditions of acid rain. The leaching dynamics of HMs was found to be influenced by Fe/Al oxides and organic matter (OM) in the soil. The application of SSC as a fertilizer to barren APMS dramatically decreased the mobility of Cr, Cu and Pb by 51-56% due to their retention by particulate organic matter, while the leaching of As, Cd and Ni was increased as the result of competition with OM for available Fe/Al oxides (As) and proton-metal exchange reactions that occurred in HM-OM complexes (Cd and Ni). The ecological risk of FGS and APMS resulting from HM migration was actually low (PERI = 0.07-0.12), but the increased potential ecological risk resulting from the use of SSC were estimated to be moderate (a 16.0-33.5% increase in PERI for SSC-amended FGS) or high (a 140% increase in PERI for SSC-amended APMS). Ni, Cd and Cu were identified as the three main HMs responsible for increasing the ecological risk in soil which was mainly composed of fine-grained particles, whereas Cd and As were key ecological risks HMs in soil that was mainly composed of coarse-grained particles.

AB  - Established populations of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) have recently been reported in South America, at both Atlantic and Pacific basins. Several studies have evaluated different aspects of their life histories; however, little is known about the use of the estuaries by the juveniles of these populations. We examined spawning time, seaward migration timing, growth rate, scale patterns, diet, and geometric morphometric, contrasting the early life history during freshwater and estuary residence of a chinook population established in Lapataia Basin. Fall run spawning took place in. March April and the parr emerged in September. Two distinct seaward migration patterns were identified from sein net fishing records: one population segment migrating earlier to the estuary in October and a second group migrating later in February. The growth rate of fish captured at the estuary was significantly higher than the fish captured in freshwater. In addition, higher scale intercirculi distances were observed in estuary fish showing differences in growth rate. The feeding habitat in fish captured in both environments changed through time from bottom feeding to surface feeding and from significant diet overlap to no overlap. The morphology of the fish captured at the estuary was associated with the elongation of the caudal peduncle and a decrease in the condition factor index, both changes related to smolt transformation. The earlier migration and the higher growth rate of juveniles in the estuary together with fish of 1 + yo captured in this environment reveal that the estuary of Lapataia Basin is not only a stopover for the chinook salmon, but also a key habitat to reside and feed previous to the final seaward migration.

AB  - To determine the quality of sediments and extent of contaminant impacts, a Sediment Quality Triad (SQT) study was conducted at 36 sites in the Corpus Christi Bay, Texas, USA, system. Fifteen of the 36 sites were located near storm-water outfalls, but 13 other sites (i.e., industrial and domestic outfalls, oil field-produced water discharges, and dredging activity) and eight reference sites were also evaluated. Sediment samples were collected and analyzed for physical-chemical characteristics, contaminant concentrations (metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs], polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs], and pesticides), toxicity (amphipod and mysid solid phase and sea urchin pore-water fertilization and embryological development tests), and a benthic index of biotic integrity (BIBI) composed of 10 independent metrics calculated for each site. This large data matrix was reduced using multivariate analysis to create new variables for each component representing overall means and containing most of the variance in the larger data set. The new variables were used to conduct the correlation analysis. Toxicity was significantly correlated with both chemistry and ecological responses, whereas no correlations between the benthic metrics and sediment chemistry were observed. Using the combined information from the SQT, four of the five most degraded sites were storm-water outfall sites. Although estuaries are naturally stressful environments because of salinity and temperature fluctuations, this ecosystem appears to have been compromised by anthropogenic influences similar to what has been observed for other heavily urbanized bay systems along the Texas and Gulf coast.

AB  - An emerging area of migration research is the complex relationship between migration and environmental hazards, broadly defined. Environmental hazards are best viewed through a vulnerability lens, which has two components. The first is exposurethe frequency and duration of the hazardous eventsand the second is adaptive capacitythe ability of communities to mitigate, deflect, or absorb the effects of exposure. Because migration is selective of individuals and places, it changes both the population's size and composition, thus affecting its exposure and adaptive capacity. In this article we examine how migration varies among sets of counties that experience significantly different exposures to all environmental hazards in the United States. We create an environmental hazards impact index in an attempt to measure the impacts of environmental hazards at the county level over a period of years. We found that counties that experience the greatest impacts from environmental hazards are losing income as a result of the migration. In counties with the highest impacts, income is lost through both net outmigration as well as income loss through out-migrants having higher incomes than in-migrants.

   Un area emergente en las investigaciones sobre migracion es la compleja relacion que existe entre migracion y riesgos ambientales, en sentido amplio. Los riesgos ambientales se miran mejor a traves de una lente de vulnerabilidad, que tiene dos componentes. El primero de ellos es la exposicionfrecuencia y duracion de los eventos calamitososy el segundo es la capacidad adaptativala habilidad de las comunidades para aliviar, reorientar o absorber los efectos de la exposicion. Debido a su caracter selectivo en terminos de individuos y lugares, la migracion cambia tanto el tamano de la poblacion como su composicion, afectando de ese modo su exposicion y capacidad adaptativa. En este articulo examinamos la manera como la migracion varia entre conjuntos de condados que experimentan exposiciones significativamente diferentes a todos los riesgos ambientales en los Estados Unidos. Creamos un indice de impacto de los riesgos ambientales a titulo de intento para medir estos impactos a nivel de condado en un determinado periodo de anos. Hallamos que los condados que sufren los mas altos impactos por riesgos ambientales estan perdiendo ingresos como resultado de la migracion. En los condados que tienen los mas altos impactos, el ingreso se pierde a traves de emigracion neta lo mismo que por las perdidas resultantes de las diferencias de ingreso de los emigrantes con ingresos mas altos en comparacion con los que ganan los inmigrantes.

AB  - As a pioneering effort to assess the health of marine ecosystems in Korea, coastal ecosystem components were monitored in the Busan coastal area from 2013 to 2015. Pelagic ecosystem assessment focused on eutrophication and plankton communities in surface waters. For benthic ecosystem assessment, sediment environments with regard to toxic organic compounds and heavy metals as well as benthos communities were investigated. Preestablished indicators and criteria based on the relationships between chemical pressures and biological responses were applied to the assessment. Water and sediment qualities and community health of plankton and benthos were expressed in their respective individual indices and finally integrated into a holistic health index or score. From observation across the three-year study period in the Busan coastal waters, water quality index and plankton health index were assessed as Fair or Good. Sediment quality index was Very poor or Poor inside harbor areas such as Busan North Port, Busan South Port, Gamchun Port, and Dadaepo Port. Benthic pollution index evaluating the health status of macrobenthic communities also exhibited an unhealthy condition in the harbor areas. The annual health map of the Busan coastal ecosystem was consecutively updated from 2013 to 2015 to provide scientific information on unhealthy spaces and indicators in the Busan coastal area. The annual health maps displayed a hot spot of Poor' grade in the Busan South Port. Therefore, it is suggested that the top priority for the Busan coastal ecosystem management should be paid to the hot spot to restore the ecosystem health of the Busan coastal waters by especially focusing on the benthic ecosystem. Future coastal management should focus on the mitigation of problematic factors and should be connected to and provide feedback to the health assessment results of the Busan coastal area.

AB  - Capsule: Plumage colour of Northern Saw-whet Owls Aegolius acadicus was strongly associated with body condition and may be used to distinguish the highest quality individuals. Relationships between eye colour and body condition were more complex and deserve further study.Aims: We explored the association of colouration with body condition of Northern Saw-whet Owls during their autumnal migration across Pennsylvania, USA from 1999 to 2012.Methods: We used fat and keel scores of female owls to index body condition. Since feathers are laid down during pre-migration moult, we hypothesized that facial white plumage would be more strongly associated with long-term condition (keel scores) whereas eye colour should indicate short-term condition (fat scores).Results: Facial white plumage and eye colour were largely uncorrelated, but were strongly associated with both fat and keel scores. Contrary to our hypothesis, owls with more facial white plumage had both higher fat and keel scores, indicating that facial white was strongly associated with both short- and long-term condition. This appears to be because facial white was highest in individuals most capable of maintaining good condition in both scores (the highest quality owls). Relationships between condition and eye colour were more complex, since owls with highest fat scores but lowest keel scores had lightest eyes, possibly resulting from trade-offs with pigment function and immunocompetence. Our results also demonstrated environmental forcing (cyclic prey availability) of colouration and body condition, although not the relationship between them which remained consistent between years and for different ages.Conclusion: Facial white, but not eye colour, was a robust predictor of short- and long-term body condition, permitting detection of individuals in the best and most consistent condition. Further study of colouration and condition are needed to elucidate the extent of genetic control and environmental factors in feather melanization.

AB  - As an important approach to the realization of agricultural sustainable development, multifunctionality has become a hot spot in the field of urban agriculture. Taking 13 agricultural counties of Beijing City as the assessing units, this study selects 10 assessing index from ecological, economic and social aspects, determines the index weight using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, and establishes an index system for the integrated agricultural function. Based on standardized data from agricultural census and remote sensing, the integrated function and multifunctionality of urban agriculture in Beijing City are assessed through the index grade mapping. The results show that agricultural counties with the highest score in ecological, economic, and social function are Yanqing, Changping, and Miyun, respectively; and the greatest disparity among those counties is economic function, followed by social and ecological function. Topography and human disturbance may be the factors that affect integrated agricultural function. The integrated agricultural function of Beijing rises at the beginning then drops later with the increase of mean slope, average altitude, and distance from the city. The whole city behaves balance among ecological, economic, and social functions at the macro level, with 8 out of the 13 counties belonging to ecology-society-economy balanced areas, while no county is dominant in only one of the three functions. On the micro scale, however, different counties have their own functional inclination: Miyun, Yanqing, Mentougou, and Fengtai are ecology-society dominant, and Tongzhou is ecology-economy dominant. The agricultural multifunctionality in Beijing City declines from the north to the south, with Pinggu having the most significant agricultural multifunctionality. The results match up well with the objective condition of Beijing's urban agriculture planning, which has proved the methodological rationality of the assessment to a certain extent.

AB  - Biologically based control methods offer many advantages for the control of invasive plant species; however, these methods are not without risks to native species. Thus, there is a need for more effective and efficient methods of risk analysis for biological control agents. We show how the process of ecological risk assessment established by the United States' Environmental Protection Agency may be adapted to improve assessment of the risks of proposed biological control agents. We discuss the risks posed by weed biological control agents, and present a simple individual-based model of herbivorous insect movement and oviposition on two species of host plant, a target invasive plant species and a non-target native species, in simulated landscapes. The model shows that risks of non-target impacts may be influenced by the details of the movement behavior of biological control agents in heterogeneous landscapes. The specific details of insect movement that appear to be relevant are readily measured in field trials and the general modeling approach is readily adapted to real landscapes. Current biological control risk assessments typically emphasize effects analysis at the expense of exposure analysis; the modeling approach presented here provides a simple and feasible way to incorporate exposure analyses. We conclude that models such as ours should be given serious consideration as part of a comprehensive strategy of risk assessment for proposed weed biological control agents. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Estuarine sediments are increasingly contaminated by heavy metals as a result of urbanization and human activities. Continuous multi-heavy metal accumulation in the ecosystem can provoke new effects on top of the complex environmental interactions already present in estuarine ecosystems. It is important to study their integrated influence on imperative microbial communities to reflect on the environmental and ecological risks they may impose. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy analysis for five metals Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn showed that Cr and Cu concentrations in intertidal sediments of the urbanized Yangtze River estuary in China have consistently exceeded respective threshold effect concentration (TEC) levels. The geo-accumulation and potential ecological risk index results of the five metals showed that all sampling sites were weakly to moderately polluted, and at considerable to high ecological risk, respectively. Redundancy and correlation analyses showed that Zn followed by Cr in the ecosystem were explanatory of the shifts in recorded microbial community structures. However, the spatial variation in metal concentrations did not correspond to the selection of metal resistance genes (MRGs). Unlike many other dominant bacterial taxa, most of the sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and associated sulfate respiration as the dominant microbially contributed ecological function were found to negatively correlate with Zn and total heavy metal pollution. Zn concentration was proposed to be a potent indicator for heavy metal pollution-associated microbial community compositional shifts under urbanized estuarine conditions. The associations between heavy metals and estuarine microbial communities in this study demonstrate the influence of heavy metals on microbial community structure and adaptations that is often overshadowed by environmental factors (i.e., salinity and nutrients).

AB  - Forest fragmentation, a result of deforestation, not only decreases the amount of habitat available for wildlife, but also increases the isolation of the remaining fragments and the area of edges surrounding them. Also, deforestation often leads to the creation of a dynamic regenerating matrix where cleared land is subsequently abandoned. Here we examine the effects of fragmentation and landscape change on the nutritional condition of Amazonian rainforest birds at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project, near Manaus, Brazil. We analyzed ptilochronology-based measurements of feather growth rate in 12 species living in fragments within a dynamic landscape over 21 years. Ptilochronology serves as an index of nutritional condition by revealing energy available for maintenance over 1-2 weeks while the feather is grown, allowing intraspecific comparison across treatments. Feather growth rate decreased in fragments surrounded by young second-growth borders but increased as fragment size and age of adjacent second-growth vegetation increased. Results from this simple, yet informative, measure of nutritional condition reveal physiological impacts of land cover change, including the response of birds to changes occurring at both local and landscape levels. Our results highlight the importance of looking beyond presence/absence data to describe fragmentation effects, and support the value of landscape-scale approaches for the conservation of tropical forest biodiversity.

AB  - We used mist-netting to study summer bat assemblages in 3 state nature biosphere reserves in the European part of Russia from 26 June to 29 July 2013: Oksky, Ryazan region (54 degrees 44'N, 40 degrees 54'E); Voronezhsky, Voronezh region (51 degrees 55'N, 39 degrees 38'E); and "Bryansky Les", Bryansk region (52 degrees 27'N, 33 degrees 53'E). The main research efforts were in locations where Nyctalus lasiopterus had been captured in the past. In total, 1229 specimens of 12 bat species (Myotis daubentonii, M. dasycneme, M. brandtii, M. mystacinus, Nyctalus noctula, N. lasiopterus, N. leisleri, Eptesicus serotinus, Pipistrellus nathusii, P. pygmaeus, Vespertilio murinus, and Plecotus auritus) were caught. N. lasiopterus (a female subadult) was confirmed only in the Voronezhsky Reserve. The bat assemblages could be classified as forest-dwelling and dominated by long-distance migratory species (genera Nyctalus, Pipistrellus, and Vespertilio). Females also dominated and breeding was recorded for most of the species. The highest bat abundance (b/h index: 4.54) was in the Voronezhsky Reserve (the most southeasterly location) and the lowest (b/h index: 1.75) was in "Bryansky Les" (the most southwesterly location). The Shannon-Wiener index was higher in the Voronezhsky and Oksky Reserves but the evenness index was similar for all reserves. Bat assemblage structure in strictly protected forest areas (such as the Voronezhsky Reserve) has been stable for decades.

AB  - Land-based activities, including deforestation, agriculture, and urbanisation, cause increased erosion, reduced inland and coastal water quality, and subsequent loss or degradation of downstream coastal marine ecosystems. Quantitative approaches to link sediment loads from catchments to metrics of downstream marine ecosystem state are required to calculate the cost effectiveness of taking conservation actions on land to benefits accrued in the ocean. Here we quantify the relationship between sediment loads derived from landscapes to habitat suitability of seagrass meadows in Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia. We use the following approach: (1) a catchment hydrological model generates sediment loads; (2) a statistical model links sediment loads to water clarity at monthly time-steps; (3) a species distribution model (SDM) factors in water clarity, bathymetry, wave height, and substrate suitability to predict seagrass habitat suitability at monthly time-steps; and (4) a statistical model quantifies the effect of sediment loads on area of seagrass suitable habitat in a given year. The relationship between sediment loads and seagrass suitable habitat is non-linear: large increases in sediment have a disproportionately large negative impact on availability of seagrass suitable habitat. Varying the temporal scale of analysis (monthly vs. yearly), or varying the threshold value used to delineate predicted seagrass presence vs. absence, both affect the magnitude, but not the overall shape, of the relationship between sediment loads and seagrass suitable habitat area. Quantifying the link between sediment produced from catchments and extent of downstream marine ecosystems allows assessment of the relative costs and benefits of taking conservation actions on land or in the ocean, respectively, to marine ecosystems.

AB  - Municipal solid waste (MSW) categories, as specified by United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), were evaluated for their relative contribution of pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and protozoan parasites into MSW landfills from 1960 to 2007. The purpose of this study was to identify trends and quantify the potential contribution of pathogens in MSW as an aid to the assessment of potential public health risks. A review of the literature was conducted to estimate values for the concentrations of faecal indicator bacteria and pathogens in the major categories of MSW. The major sources of MSW contributing enteric pathogens were food waste, pet faeces, absorbent products, and biosolids. During the last 47 years, recycling of glass, metals, plastic, paper and some organic wastes in MSW has increased, resulting in a decreased proportion of these materials in the total landfilled MSW. The relative proportion of remaining waste materials has increased; several of these waste categories contain pathogens. For all potential sources, food waste contributes the greatest number of faecal coliforms (80.62%). The largest contribution of salmonellae (97.27%), human enteroviruses (94.88%) and protozoan parasites (97%) are expected to come from pet faeces. Biosolids from wastewater treatment sludge contribute the greatest number of human noroviruses (99.94%). By comparison, absorbent hygiene products do not appear to contribute significantly to overall pathogen loading for any group of pathogens. This is largely due to the relatively low volume of these pathogen sources in MSW, compared, for example, with food waste at almost 40% of total MSW.

AB  - The largest market segment of global tourism is coastal tourism, which is strongly dependent on the destination's thermal climate. To date, outdoor bioclimatic comfort assessments have focused exclusively on local residents in open urban areas, making it unclear whether outdoor comfort is perceived differently in non-urban environments or by non-residents (i.e. tourists) with different weather expectations and activity patterns. This study provides needed insight into the perception of outdoor microclimatic conditions in a coastal environment while simultaneously identifying important psychological factors that differentiate tourists from everyday users of urban spaces. Concurrent micrometeorological measurements were taken on several Caribbean beaches in the islands of Barbados, Saint Lucia and Tobago, while a questionnaire survey was used to examine the thermal comfort of subjects (n = 472). Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) conditions of 32 to 39 A degrees C were recorded, which were perceived as being "slightly warm" or "warm" by respondents. Most beach users (48 to 77 %) would not change the thermal conditions, with some (4 to 15 %) preferring even warmer conditions. Even at UTCI of 39 A degrees C, 62 % of respondents voted for no change to current thermal conditions, with an additional 10 % stating that they would like to feel even warmer. These results indicate that beach users' thermal preferences are up to 18 A degrees C warmer than the preferred thermal conditions identified in existing outdoor bioclimatic studies from urban park settings. This indicates that beach users hold fundamentally different comfort perceptions and preferences compared to people using urban spaces. Statistically significant differences (p a parts per thousand currency signaEuro parts per thousand.05) were also recorded for demographic groups (gender, age) and place of origin (climatic region).

AB  - Toxicokinetic (TK) models have many uses, some of which are now regarded as almost routine, in areas related to pharmaceutics, toxicology, and chemical risk assessment. These TK models span a range from simple empirical curve-fitting analyses of blood/tissue time courses to physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) models that incorporate anatomical, physiological, and biochemical properties of laboratory animals and humans. While the PBTK models require more effort to develop and validate than do data-based compartmental models, the biological detail in these descriptions permits extrapolation to different doses, different exposure conditions, and different species, including humans. Efforts to develop PBTK models are frequently rewarded with reduced work on subsequent compounds, since the physiologic structure, once developed for a particular life stage and class of compounds, is not expected to change for other compounds in the class. A review of the literature shows that TK models have had many uses in occupational health and industrial hygiene; however, they have not been widely or systematically employed in these disciplines. This over-view discusses the history of uses of TK models in occupational health areas and suggests future possibilities for these models. Notably, TK models and especially PBTK models could play much more important roles in establishing occupational exposure limits such as the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Permissible Exposure Limits based on either animal or human studies; in assessing the range of susceptibility of diverse human populations based on individual variability; in interpreting epidemiological and biomarker studies for various exposure situations; in developing common methods to assess risks for exposures to both the general population and to worker populations; and in assessing exposures to chemical mixtures.

AB  - As an important causative factor of environmental accidents, natural disasters have recently received much attention for environmental risk assessment. Typhoons are one of the most frequent natural disasters in the northern Pacific Ocean and South China Sea and cause enormous damage to agriculture, daily livelihood, and industry. In this study, an environmental risk assessment for industrial enterprises is conducted when considering typhoon disasters. First, a Na-tech (natural hazard triggering technological disasters) environmental risk assessment index system with the aid of ananalytic hierarchy process and fuzzy evaluation model (ERA-FAM) is developed to explore the major determinants related to risk level. The impact of typhoon disasters on environmental risk from chemical enterprises is discussed using a comparative analysis of risk levels with and without typhoon disaster scenarios. A chemical plant located in Zhejiang, China, is selected as a case study using this methodology. Three hypothetical scenarios are assumed, based on actual situations, to explore the impact of various factors on environmental risk. The results demonstrate that production factors and surrounding environmental conditions are the most sensitive factors for typhoon disasters, while emergency preparation is most important for reducing environmental risk. The influence of typhoons on environmental risk values is much higher for enterprises with imperfect management and vulnerable water risk receptors. Incorporating disaster management into environmental risk management will aid in developing strategies and policies for environmental risk mitigation and risk reduction practices.

AB  - Land degradation (LD) is a global problem which involves climate, soil, vegetation, economic, and population conditions. In Mediterranean Europe climatic variability and human pressure combine to produce soil sealing, erosion, salinisation, fire risk, and landscape fragmentation, all regarded as important factors to start LD. The aim of this paper is to introduce a time-series evaluation of land vulnerability to degradation based on nine ecological and economic variables. The analysis was carried out over 1970-2000 at the municipality level in Latium (central Italy), a region which has shown increasing land vulnerability in the last years. A multiway data analysis (MDA) was applied in order to explore the relationship among indicators over the study period. Their importance in determining LD vulnerability was estimated through a weighting system based on MDA results. A composite index of land vulnerability (LVI) was obtained as the weighted average of the nine variables transformed into single indicators, according to their relationship with LD. Considerable increases in LVI were observed in dry coastal and lowland municipalities close to Rome, thus indicating that climate aridity, population growth, and land use changes are important determinants of land vulnerability in Latium. LVI was positively correlated to the environmental sensitive area index (ESAI) measured on the same spatial and time scales, thus suggesting that a sound evaluation of land vulnerability is possible through LVI score.

AB  - Few studies have investigated the effects of mercury (Hg) on wild fish from remote areas, even though these fish can have high total Hg concentrations. In Kejimkujik National Park and National Historic Site (KNPNHS), Nova Scotia, Canada, concentrations of total Hg in many yellow perch (Perca flavescens) currently exceed the estimated threshold level for adverse effects in fish (0.2 mu gHgg1 (wet wt), whole body). To determine whether Hg exposure is adversely affecting the general health of these fish, the authors collected male and female perch in the fall of 2009 and 2010 from 12 lakes within KNPNHS. The health endpoints condition, liver somatic index (LSI), and macrophage aggregates (MAs; indicators of oxidative stress and tissue damage) in the liver, kidney, and spleen were examined, and in female perch were compared between lakes and related to Hg concentrations measured in the muscle and liver tissue. No negative relationships between fish condition or LSI and Hg were found. However, within the liver, kidney, and spleen tissues of females, the relative area occupied by MAs was positively related to both muscle and liver Hg concentrations, indicating the health of these perch was adversely affected at the cellular level. These findings raise concerns for the health of these perch as well as for other wild fish populations known to have similarly elevated Hg concentrations. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2013;32:627637.

AB  - We developed an index of biotic integrity based on bird communities in the central Appalachians. As one component of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program's (EPA-EMAP) Mid-Atlantic Highlands Assessment (MAHA), the index is intended to indicate landscape-scale stressors to upland environments in the central Appalachians. The Bird Community Index (BCI) ranks bird communities according to the proportional representation of 16 behavioral and physiological response guilds. We developed the index from 34 sites in central Pennsylvania that represented a gradient of human disturbance from near pristine to degraded. Upon satisfactory demonstration that the BCI could discriminate between categories of biotic integrity identified from the human disturbance gradient, we applied it to an independent, probability-based sample of 126 sites across the MAHA area. Our assessment indicates that 16% of the area is in "excellent" condition, 27% is in "good" condition, 36% is in "fair" condition, and 21% is in "poor" condition. Sites in poor condition were dominated by either urban or agricultural bird communities, but these communities could not be numerically distinguished from each other by BCI score. Forested sites in good and excellent condition supported different bird communities and ground-level vegetation attributes but could not be separated by land cover composition alone. In general, the shift from medium to poor ecological condition defined by bird communities coincided with a shift in land cover composition from forested to nonforested.

AB  - Assessment of stream physical habitat condition is important for evaluating stream quality globally. However, the diversity of metrics and methods for assessing physical habitat condition confounds comparisons among practitioners. We surveyed 51 previously sampled stream sites (0.0-6.3 m wide) located in regions of row-crop agriculture in Oregon, California, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and West Virginia to evaluate the comparability of four indexes of physical habitat condition relative to each other. We also compared the indexes to previously calculated indexes of fish and macroinvertebrate condition. The physical habitat indexes included the Stream Visual Assessment Protocol Version 2 of the Natural Resources Conservation Service, the qualitative habitat evaluation index of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, the rapid bioassessment protocol of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), and a qualitative physical habitat index based on USEPA quantitative physical habitat measurements. All four indexes were highly correlated with each other, but low-to-moderately correlated with biotic index scores for fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages. Moderately high correlations occurred between some macroinvertebrate biotic index scores and quantitative metrics. We conclude that additional research is needed to increase the predictive and diagnostic capabilities of qualitative physical habitat indexes.

AB  - Monitoring wetlands at the ecoregion level provides information beyond the site scale and can inform regional prioritization of management and restoration projects. Our study was a component of the United States Environmental Protection Agency's 2002 Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program Western Pilot and is the first quantitative comparison of regional condition of California estuarine wetland plant communities. We measured indicators of estuarine emergent wetland condition in southern California and San Francisco Bay at probabilistically selected sites. In southern California, we also assessed potential anthropogenic stressors (presence of modified tidal hydrology, intensity of surrounding land use, and population density). Southern California salt marsh exhibited higher species diversity and greater percent cover of invasives. Seven of eight common plant species showed less variation in their distributions (zonation) across the marsh in southern California than in San Francisco Bay. Modified tidal hydrology was associated with absence, in our data, of certain native species, and higher relative percent cover of invasives across the marsh; however, our measures of landscape-level anthropogenic stress did not correlate with cover of invasives. We discuss lessons learned regarding the use of probabilistic site selection combined with our spatially complex data-collection arrays, and comment on utility of our protocol and indicators.

AB  - The prioritization of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for monitoring programmes and/or environmental risk assessment (ERA) purposes is based on several criteria, including environmental occurrence data. However, data on API occurrence in Brazilian surface freshwaters are still scarce. The Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) provides several medicines free-of-charge, including medications that have bezafibrate, fluoxetine and levothyroxine as the API. Thus, our objective was to investigate the occurrence of bezafibrate, fluoxetine and levothyroxine in samples collected at sampling sites included in the surface freshwater monitoring program of the Sao Paulo State Environmental Agency (CETESB); caffeine was also included in the analysis because it is commonly used as an anthropogenic marker of aquatic environment contamination. Monitoring results showed that levothyroxine was not found in any of the analysed samples. Caffeine was ubiquitous in the analysed samples, thus indicating anthropic contamination in the studied water bodies. Caffeine and bezafibrate presented risk quotient (RQ) < 1 for all the sampling sites and periods evaluated in this study. For fluoxetine, RQs > 1 were found in all water samples in which this API was found, indicating a potential risk for freshwater pelagic biota. Thus, fluoxetine should be regulated in Sao Paulo State in order to protect the aquatic biota. Additional occurrence studies in other Brazilian states are still needed to evaluate if fluoxetine is a nationwide pollutant.

AB  - A sustainable ecosystem-based management, as postulated by the European Union-Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), requires a sound understanding of the cause-effect relationships between human pressures and ecosystem states. In this study, cross-correlations are used to introduce a protocol for the analysis of time-lagged relationships between pressure and state indicators. To perform meaningful cross-correlations, the time-series of the pressure and the state indicator should be prewhitened by fitting autoregressive integrated moving average models to the pressure indicator time-series. This study provides some theoretical examples on the implications of non-prewhitened and prewhitened cross-correlations and exemplifies the use of prewhitened cross-correlations to compare the pressure-state relationship of a well-established indicator suite vs. the relationship of a new indicator proposed under the MSFD. The established indicator suite is fishing mortality (F) vs. spawning-stock biomass (SSB), the new indicator suite is F vs. the 95% percentile of the length frequency distribution (L95). The L95 aims to characterize the proportion of large individuals within a population. The prewhitened cross-correlations for F and SSB are significant for all four analysed species (cod, haddock, saithe, and plaice), the L95 is correlated with F for cod, haddock, and saithe. However, the L95 was also influenced by the annual survey catch and recruitment.

AB  - This study compared the use of sentinel species- and community-based field approaches for assessing the biological status of fish living in a river receiving pulp and paper mill effluents. Three approaches were compared. Two approaches used sentinel species. One of these involved an internal/external examination of the fish that leads to the calculation of a fish health assessment index (HAI) and the other involved biochemical measurements of hepatic mixed function oxidase (MFO) activity and plasma steroid levels. The third approach characterized the fish community structure according to an index of biotic integrity (1131). The comparison focused on how the methods respond to the hypothesis that recent process modifications/effluent treatment changes, resulting in demonstrable improvements in effluent quality, have beneficial effects on fish. Neither of the approaches using sentinel fish indicated clear mill-related influences either before or after the process modifications/effluent treatment changes. There was no evidence of depressed plasma steroids and increased MFO activity in fish frequently associated with mill effluent exposure in previous studies. While the HAI was higher at stations downstream from two mills, this could not be linked to effluent exposure alone. In contrast, the study of community structure showed a substantial improvement in fish assemblages at all the mill sites. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aquatic insect fauna of salt marshes is poorly characterized, with the possible exception of biting Diptera. Aquatic insects play a vital role in salt marsh ecology, and have great potential importance as biological indicators for assessing marsh health. In addition, they may be impacted by measures to control mosquitoes such as changes to the marsh habitat, altered hydrology, or the application of pesticides. Given these concerns, the goals of this study were to conduct the first taxonomic survey of salt marsh aquatic insects on Long Island, New York, USA and to evaluate their utility for non-target pesticide impacts and environmental biomonitoring. A total of 18 species from 11 families and five orders were collected repeatedly during the five month study period. Diptera was the most diverse order with nine species from four families, followed by Coleoptera with four species from two families, Heteroptera with three species from three families, then Odonata and the hexapod Collembola with one species each. Water boatmen, Trichocorixa verticalis Fieber (Heteroptera: Corixidae) and a shore fly, Ephydra subopaca Loew (Diptera: Ephydridae), were the two most commonly encountered species. An additional six species; Anurida maritima Guerin-Meneville (Collembola: Neanuridae), Mesovelia mulsanti White (Heteroptera: Mesovelidae), Enochrus hamiltoni Horn (Coleoptera: Hydrophilidae), Tropisternus quadristriatus Horn (Coleoptera: Hydrophilidae), Dasyhelea pseudocincta Waugh and Wirth (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae), and Brachydeutera argentata Walker (Diptera: Ephydridae), were found regularly. Together with the less common Erythrodiplax berenice Drury (Odonata: Libellulidae), these nine species were identified as the most suitable candidates for pesticide and environmental impact monitoring due to abundance, position in the food chain, and extended seasonal occurrence. This study represents a first step towards developing an insect-based index of biological integrity for salt marsh health assessment.

AB  - Pesticides are widely used to alleviate pest pressure in agricultural systems, and atrazine is a typical diffuse pollutant and serves a sensitivity index for environmental characteristics. Based on the physicochemical properties of parent substances, degradation products of pesticides may pose a greater threat to aquatic ecosystems than pesticides. Atrazine and three primary degradation products (deethylatrazine (DEA), deisopropylatrazine (DIA) and didealkylatrazine (DDA)) were investigated in a semienclosed bay of the western Pacific Ocean. Seasonal surface water and suspended particulate sediment (SPS) samples were collected from the estuary and bay in January, April, and August 2019. The level of pesticide contamination was lower in the bay than in the estuary, and the pesticide concentration in the dissolved phase was higher than that in the adsorbed phase. The average concentrations of atrazine and the three degradation products in the three seasons ranged from 2.42 to 328.46 ng/L in water and from 0.07 to 12.75 ng/L in SPS. The proportion of atrazine among the four detected pollutants decreased from 0.7 to 0.1 in surface water and from 0.3 to 0.1 in SPS over the seasons. As the main degradation products, the concentration proportions of DDA and DEA reached as high as 0.6 in August. The ratio of DEA to atrazine (DEA/ATR) increased from January to August, which indicated the progressive degradation process in the bay. Single-factor analysis of variance and principal component analysis indicated that atrazine degradation was sensitive to temperature, dissolved oxygen, and salinity. These three factors accounted for almost 70% of the seasonal variance in atrazine without a quantification assessment of photolysis or bacteria. The spatial distributions of DEA in the three seasons demonstrated that wind and currents also played important roles in pollutant redistribution. The seasonal temporal and spatial correlations between water and SPS demonstrated the degradation patterns of atrazine in marine conditions, supporting the need for future detailed toxicity studies. 0 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Fish are exposed to multiple stressors, often acting concurrently, in their environment. To evaluate the potential of Cu to act as a chemical stressor, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were exposed to Cu (30 or 80 mu g/l) for 30 days in the laboratory and they were subjected to a physical stressor (1 min air exposure) before sampling. Physiological stress indicators in the whole fish as well as cortisol secretion by adrenocortical cells in vitro were measured. Fish exposed to Cu had a lower condition factor, hepatosomatic index, plasma glucose, hepatic glycogen and gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity compared to controls. Exposure to Cu did not have an effect on basal plasma cortisol (fish sampled without air exposure stress) however, the air exposure-induced increase in plasma cortisol was lower in fish exposed to Cu. Cortisol secretion stimulated by ACTH in vitro was greater in adrenocortical cells isolated from fish exposed to Cu in vivo but in vitro exposure to Cu consistently impaired cortisol secretion. Our results indicate that Cu at high concentrations disrupts cortisol secretion through a direct toxic effect on adrenocortical cells while low concentrations resulting from a 30-day exposure to environmentally relevant Cu concentrations enhances cortisol secretion in response to ACTH in vitro.

AB  - Trees provide important ecosystem services and benefits, with some, such as air pollutant and heat reductions, being linked to improved human health and well-being. The uneven distribution of tree cover in urban areas and subsequently the ecosystem services and benefits it provides has potential implications related to environmental justice, especially if disadvantaged socio-demographic or socio-economic and marginalized communities lack these services and benefits. This study explores the distribution of ecosystem services and benefits provided by tree cover in the Bronx, NY. Utilizing census block group specific spatial datasets, we employ a Mann-Kendall trend test and the Sen slope estimator to describe the relationship between median income, per capita income, percent minorities, population density, poverty percent and total educational attainment, and carbon storage and sequestration, stormwater runoff reduction, air pollutant removal and heat index reduction ecosystem services and benefits for 2010 tree cover conditions. We explore the equality in ecosystem service and benefit distributions across socio-demographic and socio-economic subgroups using the Atkinson inequality and Theil entropy indices decomposed into within and between subgroup inequalities for each ecosystem service and benefit. These inequality indices allow us to better assess current inequalities and work to achieve greater equity in the distribution of ecosystem services. Using population and ecosystem service data, all ecosystem services and benefits appear to be unequally and inequitably distributed in the Bronx, with disadvantaged socio-demographic and socio-economic block groups receiving disproportionately lower ecosystem services from urban trees. The vast majority of the inequality is explained by variations within each socio-demographic and socio-economic subgroup rather than variations between subgroups. To reduce this inequity, efforts should be made to strategically increase services and benefits by initially targeting disadvantaged block groups with extremely low tree cover.

AB  - For more than 20 years creative industries (CI) have been experiencing increasing attention from both academia and policymakers alike. Capable of creating jobs, invigorating cities and regions, cultural and social life, contributing to the increase in value added, exports and quality of life, numerous studies proved CI to have broad impact on national economy, as evident not only in economic, but also in sociocultural and environmental areas. Authors aim to develop a model of CI impact on national economy integrating economic, sociocultural, and environmental indicators, to create the index for measuring the CI impact on national economy, and to adapt it empirically to the case of the EU countries in 2008 - 2016. Research confirms that the impact of CI is observed in economic, sociocultural, and environmental impact areas. CIIE index allows estimating CI impact on national economy and enables to draw comparisons among the EU countries in 2008 - 2016 based on CI impact on national economy. This study reveals direct dependence between the factors of CI development and CI impact on national economy. With reference to the index describing the conditions of CI development (Global Creativity Index), three clusters of the EU countries were identified using CI impact on national economy (CIIE) index. Clustering confirms that historical, social, economic, and political development of a country determines conditions for CI emergence and development, and, consequently, influences CI impact on national economy.

AB  - The impact of biochar application on soil ecological functions depends on the diversity of soil conditions and of the feedstocks from which biochar is obtained. Moreover, little information is available on the effect of biochar on dynamic changes in microorganisms with the development of rice plants in multi-metal-contaminated paddy soil amended with wine-lees-derived biochar. In this paper, biochar obtained from the pyrolysis of wine lees at 600 C was used to investigate the potential role of biochar in maintaining soil ecological functions, with,consideration of the alteration of the microbial population over periods of rice growth. Biochar increased the soil nutrient availability, suppressed the toxicity of heavy metals and benefited the rice growth. Enzymic activities initially increased and then decreased with increasing biochar addition as well as with the growth stage. High-throughput sequencing results indicated that biochar application shifted the soil microbial community, increased the bacterial diversity and reduced the bacterial richness. The relative abundances of Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes and Cyanobacteria increased with increasing biochar addition, whereas the abundance of Gemmatimonadetes decreased at higher biochar applications. With increasing biochar application, Nitrospirae, which were lowest in the 1% biochar addition treatment, first decreased and then increased. The results from this study indicated that biochar addition increased N-2 fixation and improved C cycling. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that RI (potential ecological risk index), AN (available nitrogen) and AP (available phosphorus) were the most important factors for bacteria and accounted for 68.7%, 58.3% and 52.4% of the variation, respectively. Therefore, the reduction of metal toxicity and the improvement of soil fertility are important mechanisms for higher bacterial abundances. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We analysed the effects of local- (sea-surface temperature [SST] and windspeed) and large- (multivariate El Nino index) scale weather conditions and timing of breeding on reproductive parameters of tropical roseate terns Sterna dougallii on Aride Island, Seychelles, using up to 17 years of data. The size of the breeding population and initiation of breeding were negatively and positively correlated, respectively, with both SST and the multivariate El Nino index for the laying season (May-June). It is the first time that an El Nino index obtained for the Pacific Ocean is shown to be correlated with reproductive parameters of seabirds in the Indian Ocean. Hatching success decreased significantly with later initiation of breeding. Virtually no chicks fledged when breeding started in June (40 % of the years monitored). We suggest that oceanographic conditions over a relatively large scale have an influence on tern arrival date to the breeding grounds and that SST abound the breeding colony influences the number of birds that attempt to breed. Despite the influence of factors such as predatory fish on food availability, this influence appears to be overridden by the importance of weather events and oceanographic conditions, which are likely to determine marine productivity. This study suggests that ecosystem-level phenomena appear to be important in shaping the population dynamics of tropical roseate terns.

AB  - Aquatic macrophytes shape trophic web dynamics, provide food and refuge for macroinvertebrates and fish, and increase nutrient retention, sediment stabilization, and water clarity. Macrophytes are well-suited as indictors of ecological health because they are immobile, relatively easy to sample and identify, and respond to anthropogenic disturbance on an ecological time scale. Aquatic plant monitoring programs can provide valuable information to water resource managers, especially in conjunction with macrophyte-based indices of biotic integrity (IBI). However, there are several current sampling designs and the precision of IBI scores has not been evaluated across different surveys. We evaluated the performance of the Minnesota macrophyte-based IBI for two survey designs; a point intercept (PI) survey and a belt transect (BT) survey. PI surveys are time intensive, especially on large lakes, whereas BT are less time intensive and have been used historically in Minnesota. Our objectives were to compare the PI surveys with BT surveys on the same lakes, and to modify the BT survey (MT survey) to improve information obtained from BT surveys. BT surveys consistently overestimated IBI scores compared to the PI method (t = 6.268, df = 60, p < 0.001). Overall IBI scores calculated from MT surveys differed significantly from PI scores, but on average, MT surveys predicted scores only 3% lower than PI scores. Implementation of the Minnesota macrophyte-based IBI through the adoption of the MT survey approach would improve sampling efficiency and enable widespread documentation of the effects of landscape change, shifts in hydrologic regimes, and other anthropogenic activities on the integrity of lacustrine systems.

AB  - In the analysis of clustered and/or longitudinal data, it is usually desirable to ignore covariate information for other cluster members as well as future covariate information when predicting outcome for a given subject at a given time. This can be accomplished through con-ditional mean models which merely condition on the considered subject's covariate history at each time. Pepe & Anderson (Commun. Stat. Simul. Comput. 23, 1994, 939) have shown that ordinary generalized estimating equations may yield biased estimates for the parameters in such models, but that valid inferences can be guaranteed by using a diagonal working covariance matrix in the equations. In this paper, we provide insight into the nature of this problem by uncovering substantive data-generating mechanisms under which such biases will result. We then propose a class of asymptotically unbiased estimators for the parameters indexing the suggested conditional mean models. In addition, we provide a representation for the efficient estimator in our class, which attains the semi-parametric efficiency bound under the model, along with an efficient algorithm for calculating it. This algorithm is easy to apply and may realize major efficiency improvements as demonstrated through simulation studies. The results suggest ways to improve the efficiency of inverse-probability-of-treatment estimators which adjust for time-varying confounding, and are used to estimate the effect of discontinuing highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) on viral load in HIV-infected patients.

AB  - Urbanization of watersheds call impose multiple stressors oil stream, wetland, and lake ecosystems. Sediment contamination alterations to the natural hydrologic regime, and nutrient loading are examples of these stressors which often Occur simultaneously. As, a consequence, restoration is challenged by the multi-stressor reality of most urban watersheds. The goal of this study was to compare two watersheds in western Michigan, both with substantial urban development, but with different levels of sediment contamination resulting from historic industrial activities, to determine the effects of contamination on invertebrate and fish community structure. The study included multiple sites on both streams, two wetlands adjacent to each stream, and the embayments where each stream emptied into Mona Lake. We compared a suite of abiotic parameters including sediment contamination, sediment toxicity, and water Column chemical/physical conditions as well as fish and invertebrate community structure. Sediment contaminants, including heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, were found in higher concentrations and survival of test organisms in toxicity bioassays was reduced in the more industrialized watershed. Fewer insect taxa, especially the sensitive Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera, were found in the more industrialized system. Fish taxa richness and catch per unit effort were reduced in the wetlands of the more industrialized watershed as well and both invertebrate and fish index of biotic integrity scores were also lower in the more industrialized system. Our Study demonstrates that contamination due to historic industrial activities call have Substantial and lasting effects oil biotic communities Of Multiple habitat types well downstream of where the activities Occurred.

AB  - A modern and scientifically based indicators forecast of toxic and potentially toxic element concentrations allows us to develop and plan organizational and technical- technological measures aimed at reducing the negative impact of the coal industry and heating enterprises on the ecological state of the environment. For this purpose it is necessary to have data about concentration, character and features of the distribution of toxic and potentially toxic elements, including nickel, lead and chromium in coal and the rocks that contain it. Toxic elements are one of the main sources of environmental pollution that negatively affects human health. Research in this direction is conducted to reduce the degree of negative effects and additional pollution of the environment. Increasing requirements for environmental protection in the coal-mining industry sector of Ukraine stipulates the need for new scientifically grounded methods for forecasting the content of toxic and potentially toxic elements in the rock mass which is extracted by mines, the waste of coal extraction and coal enrichment and also the influence of the coal-heating enterprises on the environment. In the article, the results of investigations of toxic elements in coal seams of the Donetsk-Makiivka geological and industrial area of the Donbas are considered. The research covered the whole territory of one of the most studied geological and industrial districts of the Donbas - Donetsk-Makiivka. As a result of the Andy, correlation coefficients were calculated that allow us to predict the concentration of nickel, lead and chromium in the products and wastes of coal enrichment and correct the technological schemes of coal enrichment taking into account their content. We also calculated the regression equation between these elements and the ash content of the coal, which will allow us to predict their concentration in the main working coal seams of the Donetsk-Makiivka geological and industrial districts relative to the values of coal ash content. The character of the distribution is established and the weighted average concentrations and basic descriptive statistics for nickel, lead, and chromium in the coal seams and suites are calculated. The composition and character of their typomorphic geochemical associations, as well as the features and regularities of their accumulation in the coal seams of the Donetsk-Makiivka geological and industrial districts are revealed.

AB  - Relationships between environmental variability and movement are poorly understood, due to both their complexity and the limited ecological scope of most movement studies. We studied movements of fantail (Etheostoma flabellare), riverweed (E. podostemone), and Roanoke darters (Percina roanoka) through two stream systems during two summers. We then related movement to variability in measured habitat attributes using logistic regression and exploratory data plots. We indexed habitat conditions at both microhabitat (i.e., patches of uniform depth, velocity, and substrate) and mesohabitat (i.e., riffle and pool channel units) spatial scales, and determined how local habitat conditions were affected by landscape spatial (i.e., longitudinal position, land use) and temporal contexts. Most spatial variability in habitat conditions and fish movement was unexplained by a site's location on the landscape. Exceptions were microhabitat diversity, which was greater in the less-disturbed watershed, and riffle isolation and predator density in pools, which were greater at more-downstream sites. Habitat conditions and movement also exhibited only minor temporal variability, but the relative influences of habitat attributes on movement were quite variable over time. During the first year, movements of fantail and riverweed darters were triggered predominantly by loss of shallow microhabitats; whereas, during the second year, microhabitat diversity was more strongly related (though in opposite directions) to movement of these two species. Roanoke darters did not move in response to microhabitat-scale variables, presumably because of the species' preference for deeper microhabitats that changed little over time. Conversely, movement of all species appeared to be constrained by riffle isolation and predator density in pools, two mesohabitat-scale attributes. Relationships between environmental variability and movement depended on both the spatiotemporal scale of consideration and the ecology of the species. Future studies that integrate across scales, taxa, and life-histories are likely to provide greater insight into movement ecology than will traditional, single-season, single-species approaches.

AB  - Rangelands throughout the world provide clean water, fix solar energy in plants, sequester carbon, and offer recreational opportunities, with other ecosystem goods and services, including food from wild and domestic herbivores. Grazing rangelands with cattle requires constant management to balance the economic sustainability of the farm with other ecological services that rangelands provide. The challenges in management arise from the diversity of the rangeland forage resources at extremely large spatial and temporal scales. To be able to predict the performance of cattle grazing in extensive rangeland environments, estimating herbage intake is paramount because it quantifies energy intake and performance. Nutrient demand is the major driver of herbage intake, and characteristics of the sward and terrain of the landscape dictate how this demand is met. System models that integrate changes in weather patterns and herbage over long periods of time will allow farmers and scientist to monitor changes in herbage mass and utilisation. Dynamic models that include herbage growth components sensitive to weather patterns and animal demands are needed to predict how long-term changes in beef herd management will affect performance and range condition. Vegetation indexes captured across biomes with satellites can accurately quantify the dynamics of aboveground net primary production and changes in nutritional value with confidence. The computer software, PCRANCH, is a program for simulating cow-calf herd dynamics over long periods of time. The models within the PCRANCH software can simulate herbage growth and animal utilisation at large spatial and temporal scales needed for rangeland management and allow ranchers to evaluate the impacts of management on other ecological services. Knowing the long-term impact of management changes on swards enable ranchers to anticipate the ecological and economic benefits of improvements or demonstrate a protection of current ecological services.

AB  - Interannual air temperature variability has changed over some regions in Northern Hemisphere (NH), accompanying with climate warming. However, whether and to what extent it regulates the interannual sensitivity of vegetation growth to temperature variability (i.e., interannual temperature sensitivity)-one central issue in understanding and predicting the responses of vegetation growth to changing climate-still remains poorly quantified and understood. Here we quantify the relationships between the interannual temperature sensitivity of mean growing-season (April-October) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and ecosystem model simulations of gross primary productivity (GPP), and variability in mean growing-season temperature for forest, shrub, and grass over NH. We find that higher interannual variability in mean growing-season temperature leads to consistent decrease in interannual temperature sensitivity of mean growing-season NDVI among all vegetation types but not in model simulations of GPP. Drier condition associates with similar to 130 +/- 150% further decrease in interannual temperature sensitivity of mean growing-season NDVI by temperature variability in forest and shrub. These results illustrate that varying temperature variability can significantly regulate the interannual temperature sensitivity of vegetation growth over NH, interacted with drought variability and nonlinear responses of photosynthesis to temperature. Our findings call for an improved characterization of the nonlinear effects of temperature variability on vegetation growth within global ecosystem models.

AB  - A rapid, precise, selective and robust UPLC-PDA method for simultaneous estimation of methyl paraben, propyl paraben and loratadine in pharmaceutical suspension was developed and subsequently validated as per ICH guidelines. Chromatographic separation was achieved using gradient elution with 0.01 M KHPO4 and a mixture of methanol-acetonitrile (50: 50) on Acquity BEH-C18 (carbon 17.7 %) and BEH-Shield RP18 (carbon 16.6 %) columns (100 x 2.1 mm, 1.7 mu m particle size) maintained at 25 degrees C with flow rate of 0.45 mL/min at 254 nm. The retention times of methyl paraben, propyl paraben and loratadine were found to be 0.8, 1.3 and 2.2 min respectively. The calibration curve was linear over a concentration range of 4-12 mu g/mL, 8-16 mu g/mL and 0.8-1.2 mu g/mL for the assay of methyl paraben, propyl paraben and loratadine respectively. The percentage recovery for spiked concentration in drug formulation, human urine and plasma was found excellent for three components under investigation. The sensitivity of method is presented by low detection limits. After the application of all stress conditions peak purity index was >= 0.9999 for analyte indicating its complete separation from degradation products peaks demonstrated the selectivity of method.

AB  - Totoaba macdonaldi is a carnivorous endemic fish from the Gulf of California currently being evaluated as an aquaculture candidate. Due to the lack of specific formulations for totoaba, it is usually fed with diets for other species that may or may not satisfy its protein requirement, affecting in turn its growth performance and the profitability of its culture. The aim of this study was to evaluate three dietary protein levels for totoaba juveniles cultured in a Recirculation Aquaculture System (RAS) as an early step to determine its optimal requirement at this particular life stage. A simple experimental design was used to formulate three iso-lipidic (8% crude fat) diets with 47, 52 and 55% crude protein (CP). A commercial diet (38% CP) served as a reference, but data were not included in the statistical analysis. A total of 120 juvenile totoabas were randomly distributed in 24 (250 L) tanks (5 fish in every one), and each diet was assigned to six replicates. Diets were fed for 8 weeks and at the end of the trial no statistical differences among treatments were observed for growth, survival, weight gain, specific growth rate, protein efficiency ratio, feed conversion ratio, survival, hepatosomatic index, or condition factor. All indices of biological performance showed acceptable values, especially when compared to other marine fish, for instance, 2.1-2.3 g day(-1) of daily weight increment, 1.7-1.8% day(-1) of specific growth rate, and feed conversion ratios ranging from 2.2-2.3. Experimental diets' basic and acidic degree of hydrolysis was evaluated in vitro. The 52% CP diet showed a significantly lower (P=0.003) degree of acidic hydrolysis (92.6%). It was concluded that aquafeeds for totoaba juveniles may be formulated to contain 47% CP, but future research should evaluate lower levels of inclusion. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - There are global concerns regarding the detrimental environmental impacts of industrial forest plantations developed over the past 30 years. To address this concern, the Landscape Function Analysis methodology was used to rapidly assess indices of soil stability, water infiltration, and nutrient cycling within eucalypt plantations at different growth stages and under different management regimes in Guangxi Province, China. Results showed that these plantations under both regimes were approaching an ecologically functional state by the time of harvest. However, within the plantation management that included the burning of post-harvest biomass residues, indices of water infiltration, and nutrient cycling were significantly lower than within the plantation that retained post-harvest residues. Indicators of rain splash protection, perennial vegetation cover, and litter accumulation were all lower in the plantation that practiced residue burning and pre-planting cultivation. Retention of post-harvest residues improves landscape functionality at the time of re-planting. Our results indicate that burning and extensive cultivation prior to re-planting should be minimized.

AB  - Respiratory water loss during metabolic gas exchange is an unavoidable cost of living for terrestrial insects. It has been suggested to depend on several factors, such as the mode of gas exchange (convective vs. diffusive), species habitat (aridity), body size and measurement conditions (temperature). We measured this cost in terms of respiratory water loss relative to metabolic rate (respiratory water cost of gas exchange; RWL/(V)over dot(CO2)) for adults of two insect species, the speckled cockroach (Nauphoeta cinerea) and the darkling beetle (Zophobas morio), which are similar in their mode of gas exchange (dominantly convective), habitat (mesic), body size and measurement conditions, by measuring gas exchange patterns using flow-through respirometry. The speckled cockroaches showed both continuous and discontinuous gas exchange patterns, which had significantly a different metabolic rate and respiratory water loss but the same respiratory water cost of gas exchange. The darkling beetles showed continuous gas exchange pattern only, and their metabolic rate, respiratory water loss and respiratory cost of gas exchange were equivalent to those cockroaches using continuous gas exchange. This outcome from our study highlights that the respiratory water cost of gas exchange is similar between species, regardless of gas exchange pattern used, when the confounding factors affecting this cost are controlled. However, the total evaporative water cost of gas exchange is much higher than the respiratory cost because cuticular water loss contributes considerably more to the overall evaporative water loss than respiratory water. We suggest that the total water cost of gas exchange is likely to be a more useful index of environmental adaptation (e.g., aridity) than just the respiratory water cost.

KW  - Durum wheat yield

KW  - NO-TILL
AB  - In the field of conservative agriculture, no-till (NT) management has been receiving increasing interest, with 45 million ha of land under no-till management in 1999 to 155 million ha in 2014. Up until now, no-till has only been observed to perform better under rainfed conditions, especially in dry climates mainly because the reduced tillage system retains more soil moisture. However, the adoption of alternative agricultural practices (NT) can be improved only if uncertain and consequent assumption of risk is well known and accepted. For these reasons, the aim of this research is (i) to define durum wheat suitability under NT soil management in terms of yield success probability and (ii) to determine the suitable area for NT wheat cultivation within three climatic periods (the past, present, and future). The probability distribution of the aridity index (AI) was used to derive the non-exceedance conditional probability of NT yield success in comparison to conventional tillage (CT) on arable land in the Sicilian Region (southern Italy). The probability of NT management resulting in a higher yield than CT management for each specific environment was predicted. The latter made it possible to determine the probability of a higher yield under NT practice in comparison to CT, considering both the environment (aridity index) and different management practices (cropping system and residue management). An analysis of the relationship between the crop yield and the AI showed that the probability of NT success in durum wheat yield is affected by cropping systems and residue management and that Sicilian climatic trends will determine an increase in the areas suitable for NT durum wheat management. The uncertainty quantification or the success yield probability of NT could be used to target incentives for NT durum wheat cultivation in areas (within a region) where the mean yield and non-exceedance probability are low.

AB  - Featured Application Nanoclays can be used as adsorbent for waste water in several industries as textile. In addition the hybrid composites generated after the dye adsorption can be used as pigments in several applications as textile stamp, polymer composites (filature), 3d printing, ceramic, cosmetic or even food industries depending on the hybrid components (natural dyes). Finally the desorption of the dyes is also possible with the nanoclays, allowing their reuse in other applications as textile dyeing, closing the manufacture circle without residues. Wastewater recovery is one of the most pressing contaminant-related subjects in the textile industry. Many cleaning and recovery techniques have been applied in recent decades, from physical separation to chemical separation. This work reviews textile wastewater recovery by focusing on natural or synthetic nanoclays in order to compare their capabilities. Presently, a wide variety of nanoclays are available that can adsorb substances dissolved in water. This review summarizes and describes nanoclay modifications for different structures (laminar, tubular, etc.) to compare adsorption performance under the best conditions. This adsorbent capacity can be used in contaminant industries to recover water that can be used and be recontaminated during a second use to close the production circle. It explores and proposes future perspectives for the nanoclay hybrid compounds generated after certain cleaning steps. This is a critical review of works that have studied adsorption or desorption procedures for different nanoclay structures. Finally, it makes a future application proposal by taking into account the summarized pros and cons of each nanoclay. This work addresses contaminant reuse, where part of the employed dyes can be reused in printing or even dyeing processes, depending on the fixing capacity of the dye in the nanoclay, which is herein discussed.

AB  - Corticosterone is known as a biological stress index in many species including birds. Feather corticosterone concentration (FCC) has increasingly been used as a measure for chronic stress status in broiler chickens. As sample preparation is the first step of analytical process, different techniques of feather matrix disruption need to be validated for obtaining better result in analysing corticosterone extraction. The current study was a validation of pulverizing the feather by bead beater (BB) and surgical scissors (SS) processing prior to corticosterone extraction in feather of broiler chickens. The type of feather processing prior to the hormone extraction may alter the final output. Thereby, finding a standard method according to laboratory facilities is pivotal. This study carried out to determine the effects of feather pulverization methods on the extraction amount of corticosterone in broiler chickens. Feathers were sampled from four weeks old Ross 308 broiler chickens (n = 12 birds). All broiler chickens were kept under the same environmental condition and had access to feed and water. Feather samples were assigned to one of the following processing methods 1) using a BB for pulverizing and 2) using a SS for chopping into tiny pieces. Each sample was duplicated into two wells during enzyme immunoassay (EIA) analysis to improve the accuracy of the obtained data. The results showed lower standard errors and constant output of FCC by using the BB method compared with the SS method. Overall comparison of FCC showed a significantly higher (p < 0.001) amount of the FCC in the BB compared with the SS. Overall, using the BB method is recommended over the SS method for feather processing due to the ability to homogenize a large number of samples simultaneously, ease of use and greater extraction of feather corticosterone.

AB  - Macrobenthic organisms are much used nowadays as bio-indicators for their ability to reflect different disturbances of aquatic ecosystems. However, they have never been used to assess the ecological status of the lagoons of Benin. The current study aims at revealing the ecological state of the lagoon of Porto-Novo through the study of changes in the settlement of benthic organisms collected in this lagoon. The sampling was carried out from July 2007 to June 2009 on a frequency of four seasons of collection per year. The self-organizing map (SOM) of Kohonen has been used for various patterns of distribution of collected organisms. A discriminant analysis (AFD) has allowed the identification of the parameters that govern the patterns observed in this environment. Four groups of macrobenthic communities emerged that were well predicted (75%). The distribution of benthic macro invertebrates of this lagoon is therefore zonal, seasonal and discriminated by variables of mineralization and sediment grain size. The difference in taxonomic richness corresponds to environmental conditions of stations appearing more or less stable and highlighting a gradient of the stress on organisms. Places with unstable conditions are affected by human activities due to their proximity to homes that are enriched in organic matter. These places are full of polluted-tolerant species such as the Gastropods Potamididae, Cirratulidae Polychaetes, Diptera Chironomidae and Oligochaeta. The macrobenthic fauna, which is well differentiated in the groups, is then subjected to human disturbance. (C) 2013 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Buriti and pequi oils are rich in carotenoids and beneficial to human health; however, carotenoid oxidation during storage causes color loss in foods, making it difficult to use these oils in food products. This research aimed to encapsulate pequi oil and co-encapsulate pequi and buriti oils by emulsification using whey protein isolate (WPI) as an emulsifier in two forms, natural (unheated) and heated, followed by freeze-drying. The emulsions were studied by droplet size under different stress conditions, instability index, and rheology. The freeze-dried (FD) samples were studied after accelerated oxidation and the total carotenoid retention was determined; for the reconstituted FD, the zeta potential and droplet size were recorded after storage at 37 degrees C for 30 days. The emulsions were stable in all conditions, with average droplet sizes between 0.88 +/- 0.03 and 2.33 +/- 0.02 pm, and formulations with heated WPI presented the lowest instability index values. The FD's zeta potential values ranged from - 50 +/- 3 to -32 +/- 3 mV. The co-encapsulated oils presented higher carotenoid retention (50 +/- 1 and 48 +/- 1%) than the free oils (31 +/- 2%) after 30 days. The oxidative stability indexes were 51 +/- 4 and 46 +/- 3 for the co-encapsulated oils with unheated and heated WPI, respectively, and 20.5 +/- 0.1 h for the free oils. FD formulations with 1:3 ratio of oil: aqueous phase and heated or unheated WPI showed the best carotenoid retention and oxidative stability, indicating that FD oil emulsions have potential as next-generation bioactive compound carriers.

AB  - The goal of this paper is to illustrate the value and importance of the "weight of evidence" approach (use of multiple lines of evidence from field and laboratory data) to assess the occurrence or absence of ecological impairment in the aquatic environment. Single species toxicity tests, microcosms, and community metric approaches such as the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) are discussed. Single species toxicity tests or other single lines of evidence are valuable first tier assessments that should be used as screening tools to identify potentially toxic conditions in a effluent or the ambient environment but these tests should not be used as the final quantitative indicator of absolute ecological impairment that may result in regulatory action. Both false positive and false negative predictions of ecological effects can occur due to the inherent variability of measurement endpoints such as survival, growth and reproduction used in single species toxicity tests. A comparison of single species ambient toxicity test results with field data showed that false positives are common and likely related to experimental variability or toxicity to selected test species without measureable effects on the ecosystem. Results from microcosm studies have consistently demonstrated that chemical exposures exceeding the acute or chronic toxicity concentrations for highly sensitive species may cause little or no ecologically significant damage to an aquatic ecosystem. Sources of uncertainty identified when extrapolating from single species tests to ecological effects were: variability in individual response to pesticide exposure; variation among species in sensitivity to pesticides; effects of time varying and repeated exposures; and extrapolation from individual to population-level endpoints. Data sets from the Chesapeake Bay area (Maryland) were used to show the importance of using "multiple lines of evidence" when assessing biological impact due to conflicting results reported from ambient water column and sediment toxicity tests and biological indices (benthic and fish IBIs). Results from water column and sediment toxicity tests with multiple species in tidal areas showed that no single species was consistently the most sensitive. There was also a high degree of disagreement between benthic and fish IBI data for the various stations. The lack of agreement for these biological community indices is not surprising due to the differences in exposure among habitats occupied by these different taxonomic assemblages. Data from a fish IBI, benthic IBI and Maryland Physical Habitat Index (MPHI) were compared for approximately 1100 first through third-order Maryland non-tidal streams to show the complexity of data interpretation and the incidence of conflicting lines of evidence. A key finding from this non-tidal data set was the need for using more than one biological indicator to increase the discriminatory power of identifying impaired streams and reduce the possibility of "false negative results". Based on historical data, temporal variability associated with an IBI in undisturbed areas was reported to be lower than the variability associated with single species toxicity tests.

AB  - Drought and salinity are the main limiting environmental factors that restrict the establishment of soya bean plants. In order to recommend genotypes for cultivation under adverse drought and saline stress conditions, multi-environment trials (MET) are needed. However, MET analysis is usually performed considering a single trait, which provides lower reliability in recommending genotypes when compared to multi-trait analysis. Thus, this study was carried out to investigate the stability of multi-trait stability index (MTSI) in 46 soya bean cultivars under the effects of drought and saline stress on seed germination and initial seedling growth. Drought and saline stresses were imposed by seed exposure to -0.20 MPa iso-osmotic solutions with polyethylene glycol-PEG 6000 (119.6 g/L) or NaCl (2.36 g/L) for 12 days at 25 degrees C. The germination rate, seedling length and seedling dry matter were measured. We showed here how genotypic stability can be quantified by MTSI when comparing drought and salinity conditions in relation to non-stressful environment (control) and how this index can be employed under different conditions. When considering the index for multiple environments, we can select as the most stable genotypes TMG 716 RR, FPS Antares RR, AS 3610 IPRO, NS 7300 IPRO and FPS Solar IPRO among the 46 tested genotypes. Owing to high stability and gains with selection verified for these genotypes under salinity and drought conditions, they can be used as genitors in breeding programs aimed at obtaining offspring with higher resistance to antibiotic stresses.

AB  - Morbidity and mortality impacts of extreme heat amplified by climate change will be unequally distributed among communities given pre-existing differences in socioeconomic, health, and environmental conditions. Many governments are interested in adaptation policies that target those especially vulnerable to the risks, but there are important questions about how to effectively identify and support communities most in need of heat adaptations. Here, we use an equity-oriented adaptation program from the state of California as a case study to evaluate the implications of the currently used environmental justice index (CalEnviroScreen 3.0) for the identification of socially vulnerable communities with climate change adaptation needs. As CalEnviroScreen is geared towards air and water pollution, we assess how community heat risks and adaptation needs would be evaluated differently under two more adaptation-relevant vulnerability indices: the Social Vulnerability Index and the Heat-Health Action Index. Our analysis considers communities at the census tract scale, as well as the patterns emerging at the regional scale. Using the current index, the state designates 25% of its census tracts as "disadvantaged" communities eligible for special adaptation funds. However, an additional 12.6% of the state's communities could be considered vulnerable if the two other indices were considered instead. Only 13.4% of communities are vulnerable across all three vulnerability indices studied. Choice of vulnerability index shapes statewide trends in extreme heat risk and is linked to a community's likelihood of receiving heat-related California Climate Investments (CCI) projects. Tracts that are vulnerable under the current pollution-focused index, but not under the heat-health specific index, received four times the number of heat-related interventions as tracts vulnerable under the reverse scenario. This study demonstrates important nuances relevant to implementing equity-oriented adaptation and explores the challenges, trade-offs, and opportunities in quantifying vulnerability.

AB  - A. nebrodensis (Nebrodi fir, Sicilian fir) is restricted to a small area of the Madonie Natural Park in Sicily. According to recent estimates, its only population consists of 30 adult individuals and a fluctuating number of juveniles derived from natural regeneration; besides, some hundreds of cultivated plants are preserved as ex situ collection. We used RAPD data from six 10-mer primers to examine the consequences of extensive historical clearance and human pressures on the extant population. Data from multiple life stages and different habitat conditions were considered, affording an opportunity to ascertain for the first time the structure of genetic variation in the extant uneven-aged population on both spatial and temporal scale. Consistent with previous works, we found that the history of disturbance and past land use did not affect drastically the biological diversity of the present-day population. Considerable levels of genetic variation were detected both in adult and juvenile sets. The non-significant correlation between genetic and physical distances (Mantel test; r = - 0.075) revealed a random distribution of genotypes in the natural stand. When the juvenile set was divided in 17 subsets, based on maternal provenance and growing conditions, Shannon's index (54%) and AMOVA analysis (84%) indicated that most of genetic variation resides within subsets. Neighbour-joining cluster analysis supported the hypothesis of high crossfertilization rates expected for a woody perennial species; nevertheless some grouping of related individuals suggested partial inbreeding and a weak pattern of genetic structure. Changes in structure can occur as the progeny ages and offspring thinning is responsible for moulding patterns of genetic diversity and population structure in time.

AB  - Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are global pollutants that can migrate over long distances and bioaccumulate through food webs, posing health risks to wildlife and humans. Multilateral environmental agreements, such as the Stockholm Convention on POPs, were enacted to identify POPs and establish the conditions to control their release, production and use. A Global Monitoring Plan was initiated under the Stockholm Convention calling for POP monitoring in air as a core medium; however long temporal trends (>10 years) of atmospheric POPs are only available at a few selected sites. Spatial coverage of air monitoring for POPs has recently significantly improved with the introduction and advancement of passive air samplers. Here, we review the status of air monitoring and modeling activities and note major uncertainties in data comparability, deficiencies of air monitoring and modeling in urban and alpine areas, and lack of emission inventories for most POPs. A vision for an internationally-integrated strategic monitoring plan is proposed which could provide consistent and comparable monitoring data for POPs supported and supplemented by global and regional transport models. Key recommendations include developing expertise in all aspects of air monitoring to ensure data comparability and consistency; partnering with existing air quality and meteorological networks to leverage synergies; facilitating data sharing with international data archives; and expanding spatial coverage with passive air samplers. Enhancing research on the stability of particle-bound chemicals is needed to assess exposure and deposition in urban areas, and to elucidate long-range transport. Conducting targeted measurement campaigns in specific source areas would enhance regional models which can be extrapolated to similar regions to estimate emissions. Ultimately, reverse-modeling combined with air measurements can be used to derive "emission" as an indicator to assess environmental performance with respect to POPs on the country, region, or global level.

AB  - Usage of the radon flux density at the Earth's surface as an indicator of seismic activity is proposed in addition to unit-volume radon activity in the soil air that has previously been used for this purpose. Numerical calculations based on the diffusion-convection equation for radon transport in porous media are presented, which confirm that the radon flux density is more sensitive to changes in convection rate than unit-volume radon activity. It has been indicated that the advantage in using radon flux density could be greatest for homogeneous geological media.

AB  - The assessment of the impact of an environmental disturbance on biological parameters in aquatic organisms involves the measure and calibration of the control values. In the fishes, the definition of ecophysiological standard values is difficult due to the diversity of origin and the variability of the sampled organisms. The scope of this study is to appraise the influence of ecophysiological parameters which could be considered as potential biomarkers of chemical contamination in eels of Camargue. These parameters stand as both morphometric and functional data: enzymatical activities involved in the energetic metabolism and the osmoregulation (gill and muscle ATPases); detoxitication activities as the hepatic multienzymatic cytochrome P450-dependant system [ethoxyresorufine-O-deethylase (EROD), uridine diphospho-glucuronyl transferase (UDPGT) and glutathion S-transferases GST)]; antioxidant enzymes [superoxide dismutases (SOD), selenium dependant gluthation peroxidase (SeGPx) and catalase], as well as neuronal activity (acetylcholinesterase, AChE). All over the 2 years (1999-2000) of our study, the size-weight relationship (on the basis of the condition index) proved well balanced in the sampled eel population without noticeable variations in three Vaccares sites and in spite of chronic parasitism due to the nematode Anguillicola crassus (about 40% of the population). The major hepatic and muscular components (proteins, lipids and glycogen) showed a seasonal variability associated to the environmental factors and the energetic requirement of eels. The basal level of detoxitication activities - EROD, GST and UDPGT - has proven hard to define due to a number of temporal variations of these enzymes probably linked to the thermal fluctuation occurring in the habitat and/or to ignored history of the exposure of the individuals of the sampled fishes to toxic xenobiotics. The sampling season stands as the major factor which acts on antioxydant system in liver and red blood cells. Nevertheless the nutritional status and maturity of the fishes exert as well a modulating effect on hepatic peroxydases. By contrast, the presence of the nematode Anguillicola crassus in swimbladder does not modify neither hepatic biotransformation activities nor oxydative metabolism. Despite a given data variability the gill ATPases does not seem influenced by the studied biotic and abiotic factors. At the opposite the muscular ATPase shows seasonal variations indicating an adaptive process to physical factors (temperature and salinity). Intensity of feeding promotes significant variations of the total ATPases activities relative to the need of ATP, but sexual maturity and parasitism have no influence. The muscle and brain AChE are obviously partly under the control of the nutritional status and, in a lesser extent, of the season one's but unrelated to maturity and parasitism. Finally, these studies carried out on the European eel stress the necessity to assess the natural range of variation of the ecophysiological parameters thereupon considered prior to their use as contamination biomarkers.

AB  - Field studies were conducted during the winter seasons of 1995-96 and 1996-97 at the Agricultural Farm of Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, India on mustard (Brassica juncea L. Czern a Coss., var. Alankar) under non-irrigated conditions, to evaluate the effect of foliar spray of 200 p.p.m. ethrel (2-chloroethyl phosphonic acid) at flowering growth stage along with basal 0, 40, 80 or 120 kg N ha(-1) on net photosynthetic rate (P-N), stomatal conductance (C-S), stomatal resistance (R-S), leaf K content, relative water content (RWC), leaf area index (LAI) and total dry matter (TDM) production monitored at 20 days after spray application, and plant N content, seed N content, nitrogen harvest index (NHI), nitrogen yield merit (NYM), pods plant(-1), 1000 seed weight, seed yield, biological yield, harvest index (HI), seed yield merit (SYM) and merit of genotype (MOG) at harvest. Results indicated that, at 0 or 40 kg N ha(-1), ethrel did not produce any significance effect, but at basal 80 kg N ha(-1), ethrel affected the parameters favourably with the exception of 1000 seed weight, HI, seed N and NHI. Ethrel-sprayed plants utilized N from the soil more affectively and showed increased NYM. Yield attributes, seed yield and merit of genotype (in terms of NYM and SYM) were also enhanced. Ethrel spray enhanced seed yield under water stress conditions mainly by increasing K uptake and retaining higher RWC? thereby decreasing R-S and increasing LAI, P-N and TDM production.

AB  - Mast cell stabilizer and histamine receptor antagonist olopatadine hydrochloride (OPT) assay method predicated on LC have been established for the analysis in multiple formulations. The current method dealt with ophthalmic solution, nasal spray, and tablet formulation products. The isocratic chromatography method was optimized and validated with a Boston green C8 column (150 x 4.6 mm, 5 mu m i.d.). Sodium dihydrogen phosphate buffer (pH 3.5) with acetonitrile in the ratio of 75:25 (v/v) was used as a mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min(-1) and at the column temperature of 30 degrees C, and the detection was done at 299 nm. The method was validated as per International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines and United States Pharmacopoeia (USP). The accuracy results ranged from 99.9 to 100.7%, % relative standard deviation (RSD) from the precision was 0.5, and correlation coefficient from the linearity experiment was > 0.999. Solution stability was established for 24 h at room temperature and refrigerator conditions, and it was found that the solutions were stable. Using quality by design-based experiment designs, critical quality attributes were studied and it was found that the method was robust. In all the forced degradation studies peak purity was passed, and no interference was found at the retention time of the active component. The method validation data demonstrated that the developed method is linear, precise, accurate, specific, robust, and stable for the determination of OPT from multiple formulations. Analytical eco-scale tool, Green Analytical Procedure Index (GAPI) tool, and the National Environmental Method Index (NEMI) were used to evaluate the greenness of the method, and the analytical eco-score of 77 for the presented method was found to be excellent.

AB  - To investigate seasonal and annual influences of environmental conditions on leaf net CO2 uptake (A), three codominant species from the north-western Sonoran Desert differing in photosynthetic pathway and leaf phenology were examined: the C-3 deciduous sub-shrub Encelia farinosa, the C-4 deciduous bunchgrass Pleuraphis rigida, and the CAM evergreen leaf succulent Agave deserti. To allow interspecific comparisons and to predict field responses from 1974 through 1995, an environmental productivity index (EPI) model previously developed for CAM plants was used, which scaled the responses of A to water, temperature, and photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) over 24-h periods to individual dimensionless values. The net CO2 uptake predicted using the EPI approach agreed well with field measurements. Agave deserti was the most drought-tolerant and E. farinosa was the least; the optimum day/night air temperatures and the PPF requirement for A were highest for FI rigida and lowest for A, deserti. For 1974 through 1995, daily EPI averaged over a year was highest for E. farinosa, indicating that it operates closest to its photosynthetic optimum. However, the predicted A was highest for P. rigida. Variations in A were annually bimodal, with the greatest differences among the three species in wet years. A for all three species increased linearly as annual rainfall increased. Leaf area per plant for E. farinosa was highest in the winter and early spring and did not respond appreciably to summer rainfall; leaf area for P. rigida was also highest in the winter. For the evergreen A. deserti, which based on ground cover is the dominant species at the field site, new leaves unfolded in response to both winter and summer rainfall but most photosynthetic area was contributed by older leaves, leading to the highest annual plant net CO2 uptake.

AB  - The hydrodynamically and thermally fully developed Herchel-Bulkley fluids flows in circular and planar microducts with constant heat flux at the wall was investigated by applying second law analysis while imposing slip boundary condition and including viscous dissipation. To determine tendencies of effects of Brinkman number, slip boundary condition, flow behavior index, cross sectional ratio and heat flux on the Nusselt number, entropy generation rate and thus, irreversibility distribution ratio were investigated. One-dimensional momentum and energy equations with viscous dissipation term were analytically solved to obtain equations for the velocity, temperature distribution, Nusselt number, entropy generation and irreversibility distribution ratio. It was observed that the slip coefficient and the Brinkman number and thus viscous dissipation affecting the Nusselt number, entropy generation and thus, irreversibility distribution ratio cannot be ignored in the analysis. This research illustrates that the Nu increases with increasing the slip coefficient and decreases with increasing the Br and n. The entropy generation rate and thus, the irreversibility distribution ratio increases with increasing the n and Br and decreases with increasing the beta. The obtained results from this study are compared with those obtained from the related experimental and theoretical studies and reasonable agreement is achieved.

AB  - The United States' National Environmental Policy Act is a knowledge production process required by federal government agencies to assist in their evaluation of the environmental (and social) impacts of proposed federal agency actions prior to their implementation. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which manages immigrant detention in the United States, is included among these federal agencies. Using Texas as a case study, we explore how the National Environmental Policy Act process, as it relates to immigrant detention, systematically produces ignorance while also producing knowledge. We identify four forms of absence: absence of process in Department of Homeland Security's use of Categorical Exclusions and programmatic Environmental Assessments, absence of actors in the exclusion of people who are detained as an "affected" social group, absence of alternatives in how "meaningful alternatives" are identified in Environmental Assessments, and absence of discourse with the public in the Environmental Assessment process. In addition, we consider how these absences reflect and perpetuate existing social and environmental inequalities.

AB  - 1. An individual-based simulation model was developed to investigate the long-term dynamics of slug populations using the field slug Deroceras reticulatum as the test species.
   2. The model consisted of two components: a model to provide meteorological data and simulate crop growth; and a model to simulate slug life histories. The patterns of slug population dynamics produced by the model matched the characteristic bivoltine life cycle of D. reticulatum observed in field studies.
   3. A sensitivity analysis showed that the output of the model was significantly influenced by soil moisture, air temperature and leaf area index. These three environmental factors relate directly to important features in the biology of slugs. Of the life-history variables used as inputs to the model, growth rate, environmental mortality and the mortality of sexually mature slugs had a significant effect on the population dynamics predicted by the model.
   4. The model output was compared with the observed dynamics of slug populations collected in the field. Predicted slug dynamics and observed slug numbers showed a high degree of fidelity.
   5. The simulation model was used to investigate the effects of varying the timing of control methods used to combat slug damage to crops. This result suggested that there is a 'window of opportunity', immediately post-harvest, when slug control is likely to have a significant effect on both the current slug population and the slug numbers in the following spring.
   6. Modelling approaches that link crop growth and population dynamics of pests have potential in assessing their agricultural impacts and in evaluating alternative strategies for their management.

AB  - The quality and availability of water resources in tropical watersheds are threatened by increased multiple use demands by human populations. Therefore, there is a need for cost-effective ecological indicators of water body status and trends. Multimetric indices (MMIs), based on responses of biological assemblages to anthropogenic disturbances, are excellent examples of such indicators and they have been applied globally. However, creating new MMIs for each water body or study area requires considerable analytical effort and hinders our ability to make regional or global comparisons. Therefore, we tested the effectiveness of 17 published benthic macro-invertebrate MMIs for assessing the environmental quality of a tropical anthropogenically least-disturbed river basin in the Neotropical Savanna (Brazilian Cerrado) biome. We tested those MMIs through use of macro-invertebrate data sampled at 40 stream sites in the Pandeiros River basin, Brazil. Disturbances in the basin were related to local factors such as pasture, garbage, and cropland in stream riparian areas. Index performance was tested by comparing precision, bias, responsiveness and sensitivity to anthropogenic pressures and stressors. Ten indices performed satisfactorily in evaluating the environmental condition of the basin. Therefore, we do not recommend developing new benthic MMIs for rapid environmental quality assessments. On the other hand, we do recommend using standard data collection methods for evaluating conditions throughout the biome.

AB  - We examine the feasibility of improving connectivity between of two dryland woodland types (espinal, a savanna type habitat, and sclerophyllous forest) in the Mediterranean climate zone of Chile, for restoration purposes. The restoration approach we examine involves the reintroduction of guanacos (Lama guanicoe) in a transhumant rewilding model. The guanacos stimulate the growth of Acacia caven in espinal through browsing, and also provide seed and nutrient dispersal and connectivity between the two woodland types. As in many drylands, degradation is problematic in this region, but clear criteria or maps of degradation are lacking. Thus to assess where restoration is required, how degradation has varied with ENSO across years, and how degraded areas are distributed across the region, we construct an index of woodland condition from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Net Primary Production (NPP) and evapotranspiration (ET), derived from MODIS data at 1 km resolution for each year between 2000 and 2013 inclusive. We construct a least-cost path for each year, which models the possible transhumant movements of herded guanacos between low and high quality woodlands each year. We find highly fragmented areas of espinal, sclerophyllous forest, and overlap between these, which we identified as sucessional habitat. We also found a fully-connected network linking low-quality and high-quality fragments of all types of woodland in each year. This shows that guanaco transhumant herding has the capacity to be used to create regional connectivity and restoration services. (C) 2017 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecologica e Conservacao.

AB  - The European Water Framework Directive clearly indicates that fish is one of the "quality elements" to be considered for the assessment of lentic systems. However, few fish-based indices (FBIs) of biotic integrity have been developed for lakes so far.
   Hence, the aim of our study was to develop such a tool for French lakes. Fish surveys, lakes natural environmental parameters, catchment-scale anthropogenic pressures, and local pressures were collected for 67 reservoirs and 24 natural lakes throughout France. After assigning fish species into trophic, reproductive, and tolerance guilds, we derived a set of metrics reflecting complementary aspects of community functioning and condition. Other community-level traits such as richness and evenness were added. These metrics were modeled vs. natural environmental variables and pressures. Reference conditions at each site were then assessed using hindcasting modeling. Separate indices were eventually obtained for natural and artificial lakes by combining selected metrics. Fifteen out of 73 candidate fish metrics, covering all three groups of functional traits, displayed a significant response to anthropogenic pressures. After removal of the redundant traits, the final indices for natural lakes and reservoirs included three and six metrics, respectively. Agricultural-related impacts were prominent for reservoirs, whereas for natural lakes urban and local pressures displayed the most significant effects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Managing nonpoint sources of nutrients and sediments is the primary challenge for improving conditions in the Susquehanna-Chesapeake basin. Aquatic macroinvertebrates are widely used indicators of stream ecological integrity, but the relationship between nutrient runoff and macroinvertebrate response remains indistinct. Logistical and financial hurdles hinder collection of high-resolution empirical nutrient data, but landscape-based models like the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) offer a more practical approach. Nutrient runoff was simulated with SWAT for a small, upland, agricultural Pennsylvania watershed. Three levels of ecological assessment were used to interpret SWAT results. Macroinvertebrate communities (intensive) were sampled at 14 sites and described using an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI). Biological integrity was moderately degraded in many reaches. The Stream-Wetland-Riparian (SWR) Index (rapid) and landscape metrics (remote) also indicated prevalent agricultural stressors. Baseflow nitrate grab samples, collected once per season, showed no significant relationship with IBI score. Thirty spatiotemporal scales of nutrient data were extracted from SWAT for phosphorus, nitrate, and organic nitrogen. Best subsets regression was performed on IBI scores using SWAT, land cover, and SWR variables. Results were significant (p < .001) with high R-2 values (84.8 and 86.2), signifying a negative relationship between instream nutrient concentration and IBI score. This study demonstrates the viability of SWAT as an alternative to in-field nutrient sampling, the value of spatiotemporal scale in model outputs, and the importance of site condition variables in relating nutrients to stream ecological health.

AB  - Genetic programming (GP) is an orderly method based on natural evolution rules for getting computers to regularly solve a problem. In the present study, GP is presented as a novel approach for modeling the gas sparging assisted microfiltration of oil-in-water emulsion process. The effects of gas flow rate (Q(G)), oil concentration (C-oil), transmembrane pressure (TMP), and liquid flow rate (Q(L)) on the permeate flux and oil rejection were studied and the GP models were developed to predict the membrane performance. C-oil andTMP showed significant effects on both permeate flux and rejection. An interaction between C-oil and TMP was detected, at low C-oil and high TMP, in which the permeate flux increased considerably. It was found that Q(L) has a low effect on permeate flux, but its impact on rejection was significant. Increasing Q(L) from 0.5 to 2.75L/min led to a considerable increment in rejection; however, further increase in the liquid flow rate decreased the oil rejection. On the contrary, Q(G) showed a small effect on oil rejection, but its effect on permeate flux was notable. To determine the optimum conditions, the performance index was maximized using the developed genetic algorithm. Under the obtained optimal conditions, maximum permeate flux and rejection (%) were 121.6 (Lm(2)/h) and 93.0%, respectively.

AB  - The change in microbial diversity in a submerged aerobic biofilter, into which a persistent chemical of dimethylformamide was fed, were analyzed based on the quinone profiles using a new diversity index of the respiratory quinones (DQ) and an index of equitability of the distribution of quinone species (EQ) originally proposed in this study: D xQ = (Sigma f(k)(1.2))(2), EQ = DQ/n. Where, f(k) is the mole fraction of quinone species k and n is the number of quinone species, respectively. The DQ value increases with an increase in the number and the equitability of the distribution of quinone species. In the case where the mole fractions of all quinone species are equal. the value of DQ becomes equal to the number of quinone species and the EQ value becomes 1. A simulation analyses shows that DQ has a higher sensitivity to the change in number of quinone species than Shannon's index, i.e; one of the most widely used diversity indices. The relative sensitivity of DQ to the change in mole fraction of quinone species is higher than that of Shannon's diversity index for natural ecosystems in which many kinds of quinone species exist and occupy smaller fractions.
   The quinone profiles of the biofilm significantly changed and the values of DQ and EQ increased during the acclimation of the biofilm to dimethylformamide in the biofilter. The plot,of the mole fraction of dominant quinone species to the DQ values showed higher sensitivity to the change in the microbial community, These results indicated that DQ and EQ are useful indices for the evaluation of the changes;in the microbial community in response to environmental conditions.

AB  - The use of aspects of quality of life in the studies of fishing sustainability has shown to be a promising approach and the use of indicators permits an integrated analysis, allowing the inclusion of qualitative and subjective aspects. The indicators Quality of Conditions for Living Index (QCLI) and Life Quality Index (LQI) provide an appropriate analysis of the proximity or distance between the technical and the fishermen's views about their quality of life and allow the evaluation of public policies. These indicators, which have been applied in agriculture and mariculture, in environmental, social and economic dimensions, are being tested in small-scale fisheries, with the added governance dimension. The quality of life in the fishing community of Pereque, in the central coast of Sao Paulo, Brazil was studied through the LQI and QCLI indicators. Structured and open interviews were applied, as well direct observation of the local fisheries' reality. The environmental and governance dimensions received the worst scores, in both the assessments of community members and the technician. The economic dimension was well scored by both, but the social dimension was better scored by fishermen, demonstrating the value of local social connections. The small gap between LQI and QCLI reveals the closeness between the two views about the priorities in public policies investment in the community. The results were compared with other quality of life indices, IDHm and GINI index, revealing the good performance of the method used.

AB  - The biota in the Arabian Gulf faces stress both from natural (i.e., hyper salinity and high sea surface temperature), and human (i.e., from oil-related activities) sources. The western Arabian Gulf was also impacted by world's largest oil spill (1991 Oil Spill). However, benthic research in this region is scarce and most of the studies have been conducted only in small areas. Here, we present data on macrobenthos collected during 2002-2003 from the open waters and inner bays in the northwestern Arabian Gulf aimed to assess the ecological status and also to evaluate the long-term impact, if any, of the 1991 Oil Spill. A total of 392 macrobenthic taxa with an average (+/- SE) species richness (5) of 71 +/- 2, Shannon-Wiener species diversity (H') of 4.9 +/- 0.1, and density of 3,181 +/- 359 ind.m(-2) was recorded from the open water stations. The open waters have "slightly disturbed" (according to AZTI's Marine Biotic Index, AMBI) conditions, with-good-high" (according to multivariate-AMBI, M-AMBI) ecological status indicating the absence of long-term impacts of the oil spill. Overall, 162 taxa were recorded from inner bays with average (+SE) values of S 41 +/- 9, H' 3.48 +/- 0.39, and density 4,203 +/- 1,042 ind. m(-2). The lower TPH (Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons) stations (LTS, TPH concentrations mg kg(-2)) show relatively higher S, H' and density compared to the higher TPH stations (HTS, TPH concentrations >100 mg kg(-2)). In the inner bays, AMBI values indicate slightly disturbed conditions at all stations except one, which is moderately disturbed. M-AMBI values indicate good status at LTS, while, high, good, moderate, and poor status at HTS. The "moderately disturbed" conditions with "moderate-poor" ecological status in some locations of the inner bays specify a severe long-term impact of the oil spill.

AB  - Because of their easy implementation and low maintenance, extensive green roofs have become established during the last few decades as one of the best options for integrating vegetation on the built environment. The success of these systems involves having of a plant species palette well adapted to extreme conditions, especially in drought environments. Among the available ones, the Sedum genus has stood out due to its tolerance to climate extreme conditions and its use has been widespread throughout the world. In previous research, efforts have been mainly concentrated on selecting the most drought tolerant Sedum species, without considering other important parameters for the suitable provision of ecosystem services from the green roof, such as coverage capacity, shape and structure or growth strategy, among others. In this study, five species of Sedum (Sedum album, S. sediforme, S. sexangulare, Sedum spurium cf. oCoccineum' (syn. Phedimus spurius cf. oCoccineum') and Sedum spurium cf. oSummer Glory' (syn. Phedimus spurius cf. oSummer Glory') were tested in a dry continental Mediterranean climate with the aim of observing their patterns of growth and development. Results revealed that Sedum album, S. sediforme, S. sexangulare are recommended species for their use on extensive green roofs in this climate, whereas both varieties of S. spurium, particularly var. "Coccineum", present some limitations for their use, basically due to their shape, plant structure, pigmentation and lack of adaptation to winter conditions. Shape Index could be an adequate tool for decision-making in the selection of plant species in the design of green roofs because it provides information not only about the shape and size but also related to the growth strategy of these plants.

AB  - We investigated the feasibility of using the structure of fish and benthic macroinvertebrate communities to distinguish among major types of stressors (e.g., siltation, nutrient enrichment, and stream structural degradation) using spatially and temporally matched data on stressors and responses. The 19 stressor variables addressed stream chemistry and in-stream habitat and included biological oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids, nitrogen, phosphorus, and components of the Qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index. The 42 response variables addressed fish and invertebrate community structure and included many of the component metrics of the Index of Biological Integrity and the Invertebrate Community Index as well as variables specifically calculated for this project. All data were collected between 1988 and 1994 by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency in the Eastern Corn Belt Plains ecoregion. Prior to analysis, variables were transformed to near normality, and variables significantly correlated with drainage area were fit to regression models and the resulting residuals used in the analyses. Multivariate analyses included factor and discriminant analysis. The first six stressor factors explained 69% of the variation. Discriminant functions formed using the response variables significantly separated site clusters classified into high, medium, and low categories along stressor gradients. Both fish and macroinvertebrate variables were important in distinguishing site categories. For example, percentage Tanytarsini midges and percentage Glyptotendipes were important in distinguishing sites having high and low BOD. Percentage darters was associated with sites having high scores for stream corridor structure and low concentrations of inorganic nutrients, and percentage round-bodied suckers was associated with sites having low BOD and low concentrations of zinc and lead. These results indicate that diagnostic models may be developed that will be useful for site-specific and regional assessments.

AB  - Thanks to their short life cycles, rotifers react rapidly to changes in environmental conditions and so may be useful for biological monitoring. The objective of this paper was to investigate the applicability of rotifer trophic state indices as indicators of the trophic state of brackish waters, as exemplified by the Vistula Lagoon. Carried out in summer from 2007 to 2011, this study showed no significant correlation between the Lagoon's trophic state and the rotifer structure. This confirms the limited applicability of rotifer trophic state indices for evaluating water quality in brackish water bodies.

AB  - 1. The statistical rigour and interpretability of ecological assessments is strongly affected by how well we predict the biological assemblages expected to occur in the absence of human-caused stress, i.e. the reference condition. In this study, we examined how the specific method used to predict the reference condition affected the performance of two commonly used types of ecological index: RIVPACS-based O/E indices and multimetric indices (MMIs).
   2. These two types of index have generally relied on different approaches to predicting the reference condition. For MMIs, some type of regionalisation is typically used to describe the range of metric values among reference sites and hence the expected range at assessed sites. For O/E indices, continuous modelling is used to predict how the biota varies among sites both among and within regions. Because the prediction method differs for these two types of index, it has been impossible to judge if differences in index performance (accuracy, precision, responsiveness and sensitivity) are caused by differences in the way reference condition biota are predicted or by differences in what the indices measure.
   3. We used a common data set of 94 reference sites and 255 managed sites and the same potential set of predictor variables to compare the performance of five different MMIs and three O/E indices that were derived from different prediction methods: null models, multiple linear regression (MLR), classification and regression trees, Random Forests (RF) and linear discriminant functions models (LDM). We then calculated values of these indices for samples collected from the managed catchments as well as samples collected from 13 reference sites that were progressively altered in known ways by a simulation programme.
   4. Both the type of predictor used and the type of index affected overall index performance. Modelled indices generally had the greatest sensitivity in assessing managed sites as biologically different from reference. Index sensitivity was determined by both an aspect of index precision (10th percentile of reference condition values) and responsiveness. The O/E indices showed the best scope of response to known biological alteration. All three O/E indices decreased linearly in response to simulated alteration in both overall assemblage structure (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) and taxa loss. The MMIs declined linearly from low to intermediate levels of assemblage alteration but were less responsive between intermediate and high levels of biological alteration.
   5. Insights gained from simulations can aid in testing assumptions regarding index response to stress and help ensure that we select indices that are ecologically interpretable and most useful to resource managers.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the influence of heavy metals on biological soil quality assessments in Vaccinium myrtillus L. rhizosphere soil as well as in non-rhizosphere soil from different polluted sites. The presented study was also conducted in order to determine any differences in the soil physicochemical and biological properties between the Vaccinium rhizosphere soil and the non-rhizosphere soil. The content of heavy metals and their potential bioavailability, content of macronutrients, physicochemical soil properties, activity of six soil enzymes and microarthropod communities were determined. Soil organic matter, the levels of C, N and all the studied macronutrients and almost all enzyme activity were significantly higher in the rhizosphere soil than in the non-rhizosphere soil. At the most contaminated site, the content of heavy metals was also higher in the rhizosphere soil, but their bioavailability was lower than in the non-rhizosphere soil. The beta-glucosidase and urease activity in the soil correlated most negatively with the examined metals. The levels of two enzymes were also strongly impacted by the organic matter-the C and N levels and pH. The number of microarthropods as well as the QBS (soil biological quality index) and F-EMI (abundance-based fauna index) were higher in the rhizosphere soil. The bilberry rhizosphere soil had stronger correlation coefficient values between the measured parameters than the non-rhizosphere soil, which suggests that rhizosphere soil is more sensitive and could be used in the monitoring and assessment of forest ecosystems. beta-glucosidase and urease were the most sensitive indicators of the adverse impact of Cd, Zn and Pb. The F-EMI index seems to be a better indicator than the QBS for identifying differences in soil quality.

AB  - Converting swine manure into biochar has increasingly been considered a useful method to reduce heavy metal (HM) availability; however, the associated environmental risks need further exploration. In this study, swine manure was pyrolyzed at diff;erent temperatures ranging from 200 to 700 degrees C; this was aimed at studying the effect of temperature on the swine manure biochar properties, while elucidating the environmental risks of HMs. The aromaticity and oxidation-resistance stability of biochar improved with an increase in the pyrolysis temperature. Cu and Zn concentration in biochar (except 200 degrees C) were significantly higher than manure (maximum increase of 91.9 % for Cu and 85.1 % for Zn). The residual ratios (R) of Cu and Zn gradually decreased as the temperature increased from 200 to 500 degrees C and increased over 500 degrees C. The R of Cd decreased dramatically as the temperature increased from 200 to 700 degrees C (79.1 % at 200 degrees C versus 1.34 % at 700 degrees C). The HM speciation in biochar was affected by the temperature. High temperatures caused HMs to transition from unstable to stable fractions, thereby reducing the leaching toxicity and environmental risks. There was also a significant correlation between the potential ecological risk index and the O/C ratio (Regression coefficients (R-2) = 0.98, P-value of a hypothesis test (p) <0.01), indicating that the O/C index is a good tool to assess the environmental risks of HMs in biochar. Based on the environmental risk assessment value, this study highlights that pyrolysis at 600 degrees C is probably the most optimal temperature condition for treating livestock manure with high concentrations of Cu, Cd, and Zn.

AB  - Indices of biological integrity of wetlands based on vascular plants (VIBIs) have been developed in many areas in the USA. Knowledge of the best predictors of VIBIs would enable management agencies to make better decisions regarding mitigation site selection and performance monitoring criteria. We use a novel statistical technique to develop predictive models for an established index of wetland vegetation integrity (Ohio VIBI), using as independent variables 20 indices and metrics of habitat quality, wetland disturbance, and buffer area land use from 149 wetlands in Ohio, USA. For emergent and forest wetlands, predictive models explained 61% and 54% of the variability, respectively, in Ohio VIBI scores. In both cases the most important predictor of Ohio VIBI score was a metric that assessed habitat alteration and development in the wetland. Of secondary importance as a predictor was a metric that assessed microtopography, interspersion, and quality of vegetation communities in the wetland. Metrics and indices assessing disturbance and land use of the buffer area were generally poor predictors of Ohio VIBI scores. Our results suggest that vegetation integrity of emergent and forest wetlands could be most directly enhanced by minimizing substrate and habitat disturbance within the wetland. Such efforts could include reducing or eliminating any practices that disturb the soil profile, such as nutrient enrichment from adjacent farm land, mowing, grazing, or cutting or removing woody plants.

AB  - Tillering determines the plant size of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and an understanding of its regulation is important to match genotypes to prevalent growing conditions in target production environments. The aim of this study was to determine the physiological and environmental regulation of variability in tillering among sorghum genotypes, and to develop a framework for this regulation.
   Diverse sorghum genotypes were grown in three experiments with contrasting temperature, radiation and plant density to create variation in tillering. Data on phenology, tillering, and leaf and plant size were collected. A carbohydrate supply/demand (S/D) index that incorporated environmental and genotypic parameters was developed to represent the effects of assimilate availability on tillering. Genotypic differences in tillering not explained by this index were defined as propensity to tiller (PTT) and probably represented hormonal effects.
   Genotypic variation in tillering was associated with differences in leaf width, stem diameter and PTT. The S/D index captured most of the environmental effects on tillering and PTT most of the genotypic effects.
   A framework that captures genetic and environmental regulation of tillering through assimilate availability and PTT was developed, and provides a basis for the development of a model that connects genetic control of tillering to its phenotypic consequences.

TI  - Stability of cotton cultivars for early crop maturity across variable plant spacing and sowing times
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
LA  - English
KW  - X ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION
AB  - Earliness of crop maturity being a complex trait in cotton is significantly altered by a number of agronomic practices including inter plant spacing and sowing time thus making identification of true early maturing cultivars a difficult task under field conditions. In this study, cotton cultivars were subjected to twelve environments provided through three plant spacings, two sowing dates over two years to assess phenotypic stability for earliness index. The stability parameters were calculated following Eberhart & Russell. Stability analysis revealed presence of genetic differences among cultivars for earliness index. Significant cultivar X environment (linear) indicated differential response of cultivars to various environments for earliness index. Cotton cultivars 15/2S and Krishna showing near unity (< 1.0) regression coefficient (b) were regarded as above average stable which can mature early under all environments. CIM-448, despite showing higher mean value, had b value significantly distant from unity, hence regarded as unstable for earliness over variable growing conditions. CIM-448, under May sowing and CIM-1100 under June sowing, can be utilized as substitutes in the absence of true early maturing cultivars. Cultivars Krishna and 15/2S were found to be stable for earliness of crop maturity over a range of environments and can safely be utilized as early maturing parents in any cotton crop maturity improvement programme.

AB  - In the under-ice plume of the Grande riviere de la Baleine (Great Whale River) and offshore waters of southeastern Hudson Bay (Canada), several environmental factors influence the distribution, growth, taxonomic composition and sedimentation of algae found in the sea ice, at the ice-water interface and in the underlying water column. During the spring and early summer, these factors include: salinity of bottom ice, water turbidity, nutrients and vertical stability of the water column. In the present study, relationships between three predictor variables (water salinity, river runoff and seasonal air temperature index) and biological variables are used to assess the impact of freshwater on production and export of microalgae. Relationships are derived from existing data, which were collected between 1978 and 1990. Correlations with water salinity are positive for some variables (salinity of bottom ice, phosphate, ammonium, Sigma N:Si, and algae in bottom ice and at the interface) and negative for others (coefficient of light attenuation, silicate, Sigma N:P, Sigma Si:P and water column phytoplankton). Using together salinity and the seasonal index leads to improved proportions of explained variance for nitrate, ammonium, Sigma N:P and phytoplankton. The amount of sedimenting algae is positively correlated with runoff, and chemical composition (C/N) of the sedimenting material is negatively correlated with salinity. The empirical relationships are applied to the results of a model of river plume dynamics, for three runoff conditions. Seasonally averaged total Chl. a concentrations, derived from the model, are higher for maximum river runoff than for mean or minimum conditions. This is because, in the studied environment, areal concentrations of phytoplankton are higher than those of ice algae, especially under condition of maximum runoff.

AB  - Eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) inhabit highly variable environments and are exposed to large seasonal shifts in temperature. Prevalence and intensity of oyster diseases, particularly Perkinsus marinas (Dermo), increase during thermally stressful periods, thus posing additional stress on the oyster host. Heat shock proteins (hsps) are important in protecting organisms from thermal and overall environmental stress. Additionally, hsps may play protective roles for both the host and parasite during infection. The interactive effects of temperature and disease on heat shock protein expression in oysters, however, are unknown. In this study, using slot and western blotting assays, seasonal and intraspecific variation in heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) expression was compared among stocks of C. virginica known to be resistant or susceptible to Dermo at two sites in the Chesapeake Bay. Mortalities, shell heights, condition, and P. marinus infections were also compared among stocks to examine relationships between hsp70 and these variables. Hsp70 was analyzed at 4 seasonal samplings (fall, winter, spring, and summer months), while all other variables were measured bimonthly. Patterns and amounts of hsp70 expression varied significantly across different seasons, but did not correspond with seasonal temperature. Total amounts of hsp70 were significantly highest in the fall. Seasonal variation in specific isoforms of hsp70 (69 kDa and 72 kDa) was observed. Highest amounts of each were expressed in the spring and fall, respectively, and they were inversely proportional to each other. Differential expression was observed during the winter and spring, with several individuals expressing only hsp72 in the winter and only hsp69 in the spring. Although hsp72 changed concurrently with seasonal changes in infection, both hsp72 and hsp69 did not vary significantly between stocks or with levels of P. marinus infection. This study reveals that measuring total levels of hsp70 do not sufficiently describe the effect of seasonal temperatures on hsp70 expression. Stock mortalities were consistent with the patterns of disease resistance exhibited by their stock parentage, implying existence of a strong genetic component to resistance to Dermo disease. Differences in shell heights, condition index, and P. marinus infection differences showed significant associations among stock, site, and time. Variation in hsp70 did not reflect differences in infection among oyster stocks, indicating that hsp70 may not be a useful indicator to distinguish the effects of pathogenic stress between resistant and susceptible oyster stocks. Differences in expression between hsp69 and hsp72 suggest that seasonal patterns of specific hsp70 isoforms must be understood to determine the role of hsp70 proteins in stress and disease resistance in oysters.

AB  - The aquatic environment is the final sink of various pollutants including metals, which can pose a threat for aquatic organisms. Waterborne metal mixture toxicity might be influenced by environmental parameters such as the temperature. In the present study, common carp were exposed for 27 days to a ternary metal mixture of Cu, Zn, and Cd at two different temperatures, 10 and 20 degrees C. The exposure concentrations represent 10% of the 96 h-LC50 (concentration lethal for the 50% of the population in 96 h) for each metal (nominal metal concentrations of Cu: 0.08 mu M; Cd: 0.02 mu M and Zn: 3 mu M). Metal bioaccumulation and toxicity as well as changes in the gene expression of enzymes responsible for ionoregulation and induction of defensive responses were investigated. Furthermore the hepatosomatic index and condition factor were measured as crude indication of overall health and energy reserves. The obtained results showed a rapid Cu and Cd increase in the gills at both temperatures. Cadmium accumulation was higher at 20 degrees C compared to 10 degrees C, whereas Cu and Zn accumulation was not, suggesting that at 20 degrees C, fish had more efficient depuration processes for Cu and Zn. Electrolyte (Ca, Mg, Na, and K) levels were analyzed in different tissues (gills, liver, brain, muscle) and in the remaining carcasses. However, no major electrolyte losses were observed. The toxic effect of the trace metal ion mixture on major ion uptake mechanisms may have been compensated by ion uptake from the food. Finally, the metal exposure triggered the upregulation of the metallothionein gene in the gills as defensive response for the organism. These results, show the ability of common carp to cope with these metal levels, at least under the condition used in this experiment.

AB  - The occurrence of environmental conditions favorable for severe convective storms was assessed in an ensemble of 14 regional climate models covering Europe and the Mediterranean with a horizontal grid spacing of 0.44 degrees. These conditions included the collocated presence of latent instability and strong deep-layer (surface to 500 hPa) wind shear, which is conducive to the severe andwell-organized convective storms. The occurrence of precipitation in the models was used as a proxy for convective initiation. Two climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) were investigated by comparing two future periods (2021-50 and 2071-2100) to a historical period (1971-2000) for each of these scenarios. The ensemble simulates a robust increase (change larger than twice the ensemble sample standard deviation) in the frequency of occurrence of unstable environments (lifted index <= -22) across central and south-central Europe in the RCP8.5 scenario in the late twenty-first century. This increase coincides with the increase in lower-tropospheric moisture. Smaller, less robust changes were found until midcentury in the RCP8.5 scenario and in the RCP4.5 scenario. Changes in the frequency of situations with strong (>= 15ms(-1)) deep-layer shear were found to be small and not robust, except across far northern Europe, where a decrease in shear is projected. By the end of the century, the simultaneous occurrence of latent instability, strong deep-layer shear, andmodel precipitation is simulated to increase by up to 100% across central and eastern Europe in the RCP8.5 and by 30%-50% in the RCP4.5 scenario. Until midcentury, increases in the 10%-25% range are forecast formost regions. Alarge intermodel variability is present in the ensemble and is primarily due to the uncertainties in the frequency of the occurrence of unstable environments.

AB  - This study intended to investigate and discuss the effect of sample diameter on the relationships between index properties and P-wave velocities of carbonate rock in natural, dry, and saturated environmental conditions using the complete experimental data. From representative limestone rock blocks, 190 core samples with five different diameters and various lengths were prepared. Based on the ASTM and ISRM standards, the UPV and index tests such as density (rho), unit weight (gamma), specific gravity (G(s)), water absorption (w(c)), and porosity (n) were performed on the prepared core samples. The results showed the relationships between index properties; natural, dry, and saturated densities (rho(n), rho(d), and rho(s)) and unit weights (gamma(n), gamma(d), and gamma(s)), specific gravity (G(s)), water absorption (w(c)), and porosity (n) and natural, dry, and saturated P-wave velocities (V-p(n), V-p(d), V-p(s)) of limestone indicated increasing or decreasing trend with respect to five different core sample diameters. The study revealed that the effects of different sample diameters on the relationships between index properties; rho(n), rho(d), rho(s), gamma(n), gamma(d), gamma(s), G(s), w(c), n, and V-p(n), V-p(d), V-p(s) of were limited because all best-fit lines were located in a narrow band. Furthermore, the purposed empirical equations were validated using t- and F-tests that indicated a strong relationship between the P-wave velocities (V-p(n), V-p(d), V-p(s)) and the densities (rho(n), rho(d), and rho(s)), unit weights (gamma(n), gamma(d), and gamma(s)), G(s), w(c), and n of limestone. This study showed that the index properties of intact limestone could be used to estimate P-wave velocities (V-p(n), V-p(d), V-p(s)).

AB  - China's hog production is facing the dual pressures of the market and environment. A systematic analysis of the ecological efficiency (eco-efficiency) of hog cultivation is of great significance for the development of sustainability and distribution optimization in the industry. This paper investigates the eco-efficiency of hog production and the determinants of eco-efficiency in China using panel data (2004-2018). An optimal super efficiency slacks-based measure (SBM)-Malmquist-Tobit model is adopted for hog production analysis, and the empirical results show a great variation in eco-efficiency across provinces, ranging from 0.557 to 1.19 with a mean value of 0.937 in 2018. The predominant production area of hogs is found being transferred from north to south, with small- and medium-scale predominant production areas shifted from East China to Southwest China, and large-scale predominant production areas shifted from North China to South Central China. Another finding is that eco-efficiency increased by the improvement of technical efficiency. In addition, the Tobit regression results show that rural economic development, the government's investment in environmental control, the market advantage index, and transportation conditions had positive effects on the eco-efficiency; meanwhile, the forbidden policy for livestock cultivation in certain areas, the structure of the hog breeding industry, the density of slaughtered fattened hogs, and the prices of hogs had negative effects on the eco-efficiency.

AB  - Studies of schizophrenic patients in psychotic and clinically remitted states and of biological relatives indicate that subtle anomalies in information processing may be critical components of neuropsychological vulnerability to schizophrenia. We describe a conception of possible abnormalities and several recent strategies to differentiate these possibilities. Within Continuous Performance Test conditions, varying the perceptual load vs. the active, working memory load yields a distinction between a stable vulnerability factor across clinical states and a potential mediating vulnerability factor. Specialized backward masking paradigms offer ways to separate two initial sensory-perceptual processes from attentional shifting processes. Top-down attentional influences on sensorimotor gating allow examination of the role of central executive processes in modulating early sensory processes. Initial results are discussed.

AB  - The extensive exploitation and use of land resources has caused a variety of land degradation problems including soil erosion, desertification and salinization in China, which gradually raises our concerns of ecological security. However, there still lacks an understanding of ecological security of land resources at the national scale. More -over, few studies conduct the validation and uncertainty analysis of models for ecological security evaluation, which tends to undermine the reliability of evaluation results. Here we followed the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) framework to systematically construct the evaluation index system for ecological security, and developed fuzzy evaluation models to convert the original index data into individual index scores. After that, we used the multiplicative model to aggregate the individual index scores into a comprehensive evaluation score for the eco-logical security level of land resources across the Chinese mainland. To enhance the reliability of evaluation re-sults, we validated our results by comparing with the proxies of ecological effects including landscape pattern index, land use change rate and net primary productivity, and made uncertainty analysis using the Monte Carlo method. Finally, we applied an obstacle model to quantify the negative contribution of pressure, state and response which would deter the security from achieving the optimal condition. The results showed that our model could effectively reflect the ecological security level of land resources. The pressure was higher in the east and lower in the west of China, and that of urban areas was much higher than the rural areas, reflecting the disturbance of socio-economic activities. The state condition was strongly related to natural conditions. The response level, determined mainly by socio-economic conditions, was higher in the southeast and northwest of China but lower in the northeast and southwest of China. The ecological security level was structured by natural and socio-economic conditions and demonstrated a high level of security in the southeast while a low level in the northwest. Developed urban areas often had low security due to strong socio-economic pressure. Areas with un-favorable natural and environmental conditions had poor state level, which tended to cause lower response capability, and consequently led to a low security level. Our research improves the understanding of national ecological security and its obstacle factors, which supports the management and sustainable use of land resources at the national scale.

AB  - Hummocky bedforms are mainly studied in ancient sedimentary outcrops; they are interpreted to be associated with storms, an inference that is based on paleohydraulic conditions derived from sedimentary deposits. However, the modem hummocky bedform catalog is sparse, with few associations of hydraulic conditions resulting in their deposition and preservation. In this study we investigate small-scale ( < 20 m wide) surficial bedforms superimposed on top of large-scale (200-3000 m wide) westward-migrating shoreface-attached sand ridges and sorted bedforms, using multibeam bathymetry surveys acquired two months after "superstorm" Sandy offshore of Fire Island, NY. Geostatistical analysis of two post-storm surveys, one along the western half of the island dominated by 1-3 km-wide sand ridges, and the other to the east, dominated by 0.2-1.0 km-wide sorted bedforms, is utilized in conjunction with robust visualization techniques to classify the surficial bedforms into medium dunes (7.4-13.6 m wavelength, 2.2-4.6 cm high), hummocky bedforms (4.9-9.4 m wavelength, 2.6-6.7 cm high) and 2.5-dimensional dunes (4.7-6.8 m wavelength, 3.9-7.2 cm high). Storm-driven hydrodynamics that drive the migration of the large-scale shoreface-attached bedforms effect the grain size distribution and hence the distribution of small-scale bedforms across both sand ridges and sorted bedforms. The small-scale bedforms are interpreted to have formed under wave-dominated conditions, based on the near-zero asymmetry index. The nature and character of hummocky bedforms examined in this study improves our three-dimensional perspective of this sedimentary structure, providing tools for better identification of the structure from the past geological record, and interpretation of hydraulic processes attributed to its origin.

AB  - Atlantic cod is a species with a high biological potential for aquaculture. Nowadays, as a result of the decline of natural stocks and increase in market value of cod, it is regarded as an alternative species with high potential for commercial farming. Therefore, one of the priorities for development of a profitable commercial activity is formulation of cost-effective diets.
   The present work was developed with the aim of testing four extruded diets differing in the levels of protein (48% or 58%) and lipid (12% and 16%). A second objective was to verify whether the producers could profit from the lipid-rich livers characteristic of farmed cod, exploiting it as a source of cod liver oil for human health purposes.
   A 16-week growth trial was conducted with juvenile cod (233 g, average total weight) using three replicates per treatment. Length measurements were performed every 4 weeks and samples of muscle and liver were taken for total lipid, lipid classes and fatty acid determination, proximate analysis and liver histology. The effect of the diets was evaluated based on growth (SGR and GF3), feeding performance (FCE, PER), condition, hepatosomatic index and biochemical composition.
   The tested diets induced good performance results, with a protein sparing effect by lipid and a more efficient use of protein in diets with a lower protein content being clear at 12 weeks but not so obvious after 16 weeks of culture. It is the authors' opinion that the 48/16 diet appeared to be the best compromise between growth, feed utilisation and cost. The diets with a higher lipid level induced a higher HSI and lipid content in the liver, The muscle and particularly the liver FA profile, reflected that of the diets. The FA profile of farmed cod liver oil showed promising properties, despite having a slightly higher content of saturated fatty acids and linoleic acid, compared to "natural" cod liver oil.

AB  - We examined relationships of watershed housing density with instream environmental conditions and fish assemblage attributes in Mountain Creek, a third-order Ridge and Valley stream in Hamilton County, Tennessee (Chattanooga area). Habitat features and fish assemblages were sampled in May-June 2005 at seven sites (drainage areas <17 km(2)) in the middle-upper reaches of the Mountain Creek system (Tennessee River drainage). Watershed housing density upstream of the sites ranged from 49 housing units/km(2) to 72 housing units/km(2). Twenty-two fish species and 3,686 individuals were found at the seven sites. Native species richness per catchment area ranged from 1 species/km(2) to 6 species/km(2) at the individual sites. Index of biotic integrity (IBI) ratings varied from poor to fair/good. Housing density was directly correlated with stream temperature, variation in discharge, fine sediment depth, and abundances of introduced and tolerant species; it was inversely correlated with dissolved oxygen, pH, variation in depth, substrate diversity, and native species richness. Although pockets in upper Mountain Creek appeared moderately healthy, most reaches exhibited signs of degradation. Catchments with > 60 housing units per km(2) (four of seven sites) received IBI ratings of poor or poor/fair. Our results underscore the negative effects of residential development on water quality, hydrology, habitat complexity, and fish assemblages in a suburban stream.

AB  - The increasing urbanization has hampered the overall livelihood of urban dwellers. Urban heat island (UHI) is a significant consequence of urbanization on the earth's environment. Its geographical pattern, impact, and mitigation strategies remain poorly understood over large areas. The study aims at determining and analyzing how changing landscape patterns (at macro-level) and dynamics (at micro-level) affect the land surface temperature (LST). The macro pattern analysis is performed by examining the spatial variation of LST with the distribution of green space (GS) and impervious surface (IS). Whereas, micro dynamics analysis is carried out by critical examination of the city's environmental health condition. To this end, an environmental health index (EHI) is derived based on the relation of land surface temperature variation index (LSTVI) with (i) UHI intensity, (ii) green space density (GSD), and (iii) impervious surface density (ISD). Moreover, we determined the impact of various types of sprawl expansion and drivers in developing UHI phenomenon in Lucknow city, India, from 2005-2016. The results show an increased impervious density and decreased greenness density over the study years. The mean LST of IS is found to be 4 degrees C higher than that of GS in 2005, which further increased to 6 degrees C in the year 2016. The results from macro pattern analysis depict a significantly strong correlation between mean LST, ISD (positive) and GSD (negative) along the rural-urban gradients. The results from the micro dynamics analysis are interpreted as an EHI rating for specific zones going through the UHI phenomenon. Overall the study reveals an adverse effect of decreasing greenness density and advocates the vital role of GS in mitigating UHI effects. Our study also highlights UHI spatial pattern and its driving factors, suggesting various effective mitigation strategies for suppressing the UHI effect and providing a scientific basis for sustainable development.

AB  - The current study examined whether the presence and absence of discrete environmental stimuli controlling water-reinforced lever-pressing response could change the well known behavior attenuating effects of dopamine D-2 receptor antagonist haloperidol (0.00, 0.08, 0.16 and 0.32 mg/kg, ip). 21 rats were trained to bar press to obtain water, and then, divided into three groups. One of the groups was the control group. Remaining two groups I of rats were trained to bar press to obtain water in the presence of either an auditory (sound group) or a visual cue (light group). The number of lever-pressing responses for the subjects were recorded in the presence (S+) and absence (S-) of environmental stimuli and reinforcer. Haloperidol suppressed the mean number of responses for all groups, regardless of stimulus conditions. However, the index of persistence obtained for each subject by dividing the number of responses emitted during the presence of respective environmental cue to the number of total responses executed by the same subject under the same conditions, remained the same after haloperidol pretreatment. The results showed that although haloperidol attenuated the number of operant lever-pressing responses, the conditioned motivational properties of environmental cues are unaltered by treatment with the same D-2 receptor antagonist.

AB  - Stem rot is a serious disease in Jerusalem artichoke (JA). To reduce the impact of this disease on yield and quality farmers often use fungicides, but this control method can be expensive and leave chemical residues. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of two biological control agents, Trichoderma harzianum T9 and Bacillus firmus BSR032 for control of Sclerotium rolfsii under field conditions. Four accessions of JA (HEL246, HEL65, JA47, and JA12) were treated or notreated with T. harzianum T9 and B. firmus BSR032 in a 4 x 2 x 2 factorial experiment in two fields (environments), one unfertilized and one fertilized. Plants were inoculated with S. rolfsii and disease was evaluated at 3-day intervals for 46 days. T. harzianum T9 and B. firmus BSR032 reduced disease incidence by 48% and 49%, respectively, whereas T. harzianum T9 + B. firmus BSR032 reduced disease incidence by 37%. The efficacy of T. harzianum T9 and B. firmus BSR032 for control of S. rolfsii was dependent on environments and genotypes. The expression of host plant resistance also depended on the environment. However, HEL246 showed consistently low disease incidence and severity index in both environments (fertilized and unfertilized). Individually, T. harzianum T9, B. firmus BSR032, or host plant resistance control stem rot caused by S. rolfsii in JA. However, no combination of these treatments provided more effective control than each alone.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) is one of the main factors that determine postharvest stability and therefore commercial possibilities of peach orchards. Since the activity of this enzyme depends on several variables of different nature, stating the relationships among them is essential to manage crop inputs so as to achieve the desired quality.
   RESULTS: Multivariate projection techniques were used to identify these relationships throughout on-tree maturation in flat peach samples that had received different fertilisation doses, but harvested in equal conditions of soluble solids, fruit weight, diameter, firmness and skin and flesh colour. A relatively low fertilisation dose that was enough to avoid any lack of nutrients provided the lowest crop yield, but also with the lowest PPO activity. Fruit N/Ca ratio turned out to be a better indicator of PPO activity than isolated nitrogen or calcium content. Nutrient analyses on leaves did not have strong correlations with any significant parameter. The most useful variables to predict PPO activity before harvest were fruit firmness and skin colour, both of them read at the onset of on-tree maturation.
   CONCLUSION: High fertilisation doses resulted in greater yields, but also with higher PPO activity, which is detrimental for the commercial chances of the fruit. (C) 2013 Society of Chemical Industry

AB  - A split plot design field study was conducted during summer month of 2012 and 2013 at the vegetable block of Indian Institute of Horticultural Research in Bangalore, India to evaluate if priming could improve grain yield and water use efficiency of cowpea under limited water supply condition through drip system. Seeds of cultivar Arka garima received the following priming treatments: they were soaked in GA(3), Calcium Chloride, Ammonium Molybdate, Potassium Bromide, Magnesium Nitrate, Zinc Sulphate solutions, and aerated distil water (hydropriming) for 24 hours at 15 degrees C. Crops were subjected to three irrigation intervals in which the irrigation was applied at 0.9, 0.7, 0.5 Epan Replenishment of evaporation. Seed priming treatments reduced the mean emergence time, promoted germination, early canopy development and flower initiation in comparison to the untreated control. Plant height, number of branches, total dry matter accumulation, number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod, 1000 seed weight and grain and biological yield, harvest index and irrigation water use efficiency increased by different priming treatments. Seed priming increased the irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) of all irrigation regimes. Grain yields linearly increased at 0.9 Epan Replenishment while maximum IWUE was achieved at 0.5 Epan Replenishment. Results suggest that the use of seed priming with either GA(3) (100ppm) or Ammonium Molybdate (10(-3) M) for 24 hours at low concentration can be helpful in cowpea under both optimum as well as limited water conditions.

AB  - Acidification of the World's oceans may directly impact reproduction, performance and shell formation of marine calcifying organisms. In addition, since shell production is costly and stress in general draws on an organism's energy budget, shell growth and stability of bivalves should indirectly be affected by environmental stress. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a combination of warming and acidification leads to increased physiological stress (lipofuscin accumulation and mortality) and affects the performance [shell growth, shell breaking force, condition index (C-i)] of young Mytilus edulis and Arctica islandica from the Baltic Sea. We cultured the bivalves in a fully-crossed 2-factorial experimental setup (seawater (sw) pCO(2) levels "low", "medium" and "high" for both species, temperature levels 7.5, 10, 16, 20 and 25 A degrees C for M. edulis and 7.5, 10 and 16 A degrees C for A. islandica) for 13 weeks in summer. Mytilus edulis and A. islandica appeared to tolerate wide ranges of sw temperature and pCO(2). Lipofuscin accumulation of M. edulis increased with temperature while the C-i decreased, but shell growth of the mussels only sharply decreased while its mortality increased between 20 and 25 A degrees C. In A. islandica, lipofuscin accumulation increased with temperature, whereas the C-i, shell growth and shell breaking force decreased. The pCO(2) treatment had only marginal effects on the measured parameters of both bivalve species. Shell growth of both bivalve species was not impaired by under-saturation of the sea water with respect to aragonite and calcite. Furthermore, independently of water temperatures shell breaking force of both species and shell growth of A. islandica remained unaffected by the applied elevated sw pCO(2) for several months. Only at the highest temperature (25 A degrees C), growth arrest of M. edulis was recorded at the high sw pCO(2) treatment and the C-i of M. edulis was slightly higher at the medium sw pCO(2) treatment than at the low and high sw pCO(2) treatments. The only effect of elevated sw pCO(2) on A. islandica was an increase in lipofuscin accumulation at the high sw pCO(2) treatment compared to the medium sw pCO(2) treatment. Our results show that, despite this robustness, growth of both M. edulis and A. islandica can be reduced if sw temperatures remain high for several weeks in summer. As large body size constitutes an escape from crab and sea star predation, this can make bivalves presumably more vulnerable to predation-with possible negative consequences on population growth. In M. edulis, but not in A. islandica, this effect is amplified by elevated sw pCO(2). We follow that combined effects of elevated sw pCO(2) and ocean warming might cause shifts in future Western Baltic Sea community structures and ecosystem services; however, only if predators or other interacting species do not suffer as strong from these stressors.

AB  - In the present work, an analytical solution for the free vibration of nanoplates made of functionally graded materials (FGMs) under various boundary conditions is provided. In this context, a new refined plate theory with four variables based on the theory of non-local elasticity including the small-scale influences is adopted. Using the rule of mixture, the material properties of nanoplates are supposed to vary continuously across the thickness direction. Based on Eringen's non-local elasticity theory, the equations of motion of functionally graded (FG) nanoplate are derived using Hamilton's principle, and the obtained equations are solved analytically. Here, the number of unknowns and governing equations of the present model are reduced to four separating the vertical displacement into shear and bending components, and so the number of unknowns has become less than the other alternative theories. The influences of the different parameters such as vibration mode, the aspect ratio, boundary conditions, power-law index, and non-local parameter on the natural frequencies of the FG nanoplate are discussed, in detail. Finally, it is decided that the considered parameters have major influence on the natural frequencies of the FG nanoplates. Furthermore, the proposed solution method not only satisfactorily handled the present problem and yielded successful results but also it supplied ease in the examination of non-local free vibration of FG nanoplates.

AB  - The hardware instability of a ground penetrating radar (GPR) system has a severe impact on the quantitative analysis of GPR data, which is aimed for material characterization and subsurface monitoring. In this letter, an instability index is proposed to quantify the stability performance of a GPR system and the influences of the GPR system type, warm-up time, environmental noise, and the antenna vibration on it are evaluated through a series of laboratory experiments on a sandbox model. It is found that the GPR signal recorded by a stepped-frequency GPR system based on a vector network analyzer is much more stable than that by a commercial impulse GPR system at a cost of more sweep time. A warm-up time of several minutes is enough for an impulse GPR system. Environmental noise has a negligible influence on the stability performance of a GPR system. Mechanical vibrations of GPR antennas have a severe impact on the stability performance of the GPR system, and the instability index and timing jitter can be increased by more than one order of magnitude in a vibrating condition over those in a static condition. The instability index of the direct signal has a negligible difference with that of the reflection signal from a metal plate; thus, a simple measurement of direct signal on the ground surface is suggested for the evaluation of the instability of a GPR system in field in the future.

AB  - The aim of the study is to compare spatial variation of macrofauna communities in the near- and offshore zone of the beach system of the island of Spiekeroog (German North Sea) in order to environmental parameters such as hydrodynamics and sediment type. The analysis of hydroacoustic backscatter signals have been used to classify the sea bottom characteristics in terms of surface roughness. Sampling was carried out in May 2014. Samples were taken along a 3.4 km transect in north-south direction. The analyses of the spatial distribution structure of the environmental parameters and the macrofauna communities revealed a clear zonation of the transect line into an inner, outer nearshore, and offshore zone. The inner nearshore was exposed to high hydrodynamic energy with a high variability in sediment composition, a lack of biogenic structures, lowest taxa numbers, but a considerably high diversity (Shannon Wiener index). The hydrodynamic conditions in the nearshore zone were more stable. Sediment distribution was homogenous. Taxa number and abundances increased and polychaete species such as Magelona johnstonii, Spiophanes bombyx, and Lanice conchilega characterized the community. In the offshore zone, taxa number and abundances increased even further. Lanice conchilega dominated the community. While current velocities of the bottom layers decreased, mud contents slightly increased.

AB  - Unconventional natural gas development and hydraulic fracturing practices (fracking) are increasing worldwide due to global energy demands. Research has only recently begun to assess fracking impacts to surrounding environments, and very little research is aimed at determining effects on aquatic biodiversity and contaminant biomagnification. Twenty-seven remotely-located streams in Pennsylvania's Marcellus Shale basin were sampled during June and July of 2012 and 2013. At each stream, stream physiochemical properties, trophic biodiversity, and structure and mercury levels were assessed. We used delta 15N, delta 13C, and methyl mercury to determine whether changes in methyl mercury biomagnification were related to the fracking occurring within the streams' watersheds. While we observed no difference in rates of biomagnificaion related to within-watershed fracking activities, we did observe elevated methyl mercury concentrations that were influenced by decreased stream pH, elevated dissolved stream water Hg values, decreased macroinvertebrate Index for Biotic Integrity scores, and lower Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera macroinvertebrate richness at stream sites where fracking had occurred within their watershed. We documented the loss of scrapers from streams with the highest well densities, and no fish or no fish diversity at streams with documented frackwater fluid spills. Our results suggest fracking has the potential to alter aquatic biodiversity and methyl mercury concentrations at the base of food webs.

AB  - The construction of levees breaks the connection of floodplains with river channels. Few assessments have examined the impacts on aquatic ecosystems. We developed a multi-metric index (MMI) based on aquatic invertebrates to assess floodplain wetland condition in the Wusuli River, northeastern China. We sampled the aquatic invertebrate communities in 18 floodplain wetlands along the Wusuli River including wetlands from headwater, middle river, and downstream reaches. Each site included paired wetlands with a wetland connected to the river floodplain and a wetland isolated from the floodplain by levees. Metrics related to the aquatic invertebrate community were selected as candidate metrics for the MMI. Then, a range test, discrimination analysis, and correlation analytics were used to select the candidate metrics based on their ability to distinguish reference and isolated wetlands. Four core indicators were selected to build the MMI: total number of taxa, %Gastropoda, Pielou's index, and %Collector-Gatherers. Four ordinal rating categories were defined: poor, fair, good, and excellent condition. The results showed 88.9% of the levee-isolated wetlands, which were identified as being in poor or fair condition. Levee construction has a consistent negative impact on floodplain wetland condition. Our MMI provides a biomonitoring way to determine the success of restoration strategies.

AB  - Individual traits and population parameters can be used as proxies of processes taking place within a range of scales, thus improving the way we can evaluate species response to environmental variability. In intertidal rocky shores, patterns at the within-site scale, i.e., between centimeters to hundreds of meters, are important for understanding the population response into these highly variable environments. Here, we studied a rocky-shore mussel population at the within-site spatial scale (1) to test how intertidal height and orientation of the shore affect individual traits and population parameters, (2) to infer the link between individual and population level features, and (3) to explore the upscaling mechanisms driving population structure and processes. We analyzed the patterns of six population parameters: density, biomass, crowding, median individual size, recruitment and mortality rate, and four individual traits: growth rate, spawning phenology, size and condition index. Crowding was defined as the degree of overlapping of individuals within a given area, for which we created a "crowding index". Mussels were studied along the intertidal height gradient in two rocky shores with contrasted orientation at one site over a full year. Our results showed a significant effect of intertidal height and shore orientation on most of individual traits and population parameters studied. In contrast, biomass contained in a full covered surface did not vary in space nor in time. This pattern likely results from relatively constant crowding and a trade-off between median individuals' size and density. We hypothesize that growth, mortality and recruitment rates may all play roles in the stability of the crowding structure of mussel aggregations. Variation in spawning phenology between the two shores in the study site was also observed, suggesting different temporal dynamics of microclimate conditions. Interestingly, despite the different population size distribution between the two shores, our estimates indicate similar potential reproductive output. We hypothesize that the structure of the patches would tend to maintain or carry a maximum of biomass due to trade-offs between density and size while maintaining and maximizing the reproductive output. The patterns of spatial variability of individual traits and population parameters in our study site suggest that heterogeneous within-site conditions influence variation in individual performance and population processes. These results provide insights about the relationship between individual traits and how these relationships make patterns at the population level emerge. They provide baseline information necessary to improve models of metapopulation with spatially explicit processes.

AB  - Recent findings indicate that different Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) interfere with lipid metabolic pathways in mammals and promote fat accumulation, a previously unknown site of action for these compounds. The antifoulant and environmental pollutant tributyltin (TBT), which causes imposex in gastropod snails, induces an "obesogenic" phenotype in mammals, through the activation of the nuclear receptors retinoid X receptor (RXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR.). In teleosts, the effects of TBT on the lipid metabolism are poorly understood, particularly following exposure to low, environmental concentrations. In this context, the present work shows that exposure of zebrafish to 10 and 50 ng/L of TBT (as Sn) from pre-hatch to 9 months of age alters the body weight, condition factor, hepatosomatic index and hepatic triglycerides in a gender and dose related manner. Furthermore, TBT modulated the transcription of key lipid regulating factors and enzymes involved in adipogenesis, lipogenesis, glucocorticoid metabolism, growth and development in the brain and liver of exposed fish, revealing sexual dimorphic effects in the latter. Overall, the present study shows that the model mammalian obesogen TBT interferes with triglyceride accumulation and the transcriptional regulation of lipid metabolism in zebrafish and indentifies the brain lipogenic transcription profile of fish as a new target of this compound.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the health of an urban stream after the completion of a restoration project using multiple modeling approaches with chemical measurements, a physical habitat model, and a biological integrity model. For the study, six sampling sites including the control were selected along the upstream to downstream longitudinal gradient and 45 reference streams also were selected for health assessment. Mean concentrations of organic matter (BOD, COD) and nutrients (N, P) decreased slightly in the downstream region after restoration, but water chemistry did not differ significantly between the periods before and after restoration (B-R and A(R), respectively). The evaluation of the stream restoration project using maximum species richness lines showed that even after restoration, about 50% of the total observations for all variables indicated poor stream health conditions, which was similar to the non-restored condition. Residual analysis of B-R vs. A(R) indicated no significant (p < 0.005) difference among biotic variables. A multimetric fish model based on an index of biological integrity (IBI) revealed no significant difference between B-R (mean = 24.9, range = 18-32) and A(R) (mean = 26.7, range = 20-32). A regression model of IBI demonstrated that biotic health had no significant linear relationship (R-2 ranges = 0.031-0.464) with nutrients (N, P), but was largely determined (R-2 = 0.503, p < 0.01) by the tolerance guilds. Principal component analysis indicated that downstream biological health was largely determined by chemical degradation, but upstream health was influenced by habitat modification. Overall, the model values of integrative restoration assessment (IRA) suggested that the recovery of stream restoration, based on chemical health, biological health, and physical habitat health, was minor despite the large investments in the restoration efforts. A modeling approach using IRA may be a key tool for the identification of physical, chemical, and biological health components that can be recovered in an urban ecosystem. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this study, energy, exergy, and environmental (3E) assessments have been conducted on a proposed combined-cycle power plant (CCPP) with three pressure levels of the HRSG and reheating process. 3E design approaches cross-link mechano-electric and environmental objectives. Herewith, the suggested combined-cycle is formed by a gas unit, condenser, steam turbines, triple-pressure heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) and also utilizes reheat facilities and auxiliary components. It is observed that more than 56% of total exergy destruction occurs in the combustor, followed by HRSG (15.29%), steam turbines (roughly 15.02%), gas turbine (8.93%), air compressor (1.79%), and condenser (0.66%). A parametric study is also presented that examines the sensitivity of performance indicators to various environmental states, steam pressures, pinch points, and steam mass flow rates. Moreover, it is presented that the implementation of Siemens SGT-100-1S over other GT configurations can considerably reduce deficiency of the overall cycle. The effects of each contaminant mass flowrate (NOx, CO, UHC, and CO2) and adiabatic flame temperature (AFT) are also studied when the gas unit operates under partial power and incomplete combustion conditions. In conclusion, a number of potential causes of irreversibilities and corrective optimization guidance are offered for each main equipment of the CCPP.

AB  - The paper presents analysis of the accumulation of toxic and vital chemical elements in discrete links of the food chain under conditions of a biogeochemical province in relation to the accumulation of phytochelatins and metallothioneins in the leaves of white birch (Betula pubescens). Gradients of metal concentrations are determined in the soils with increasing distance from the Unal tailing dump and the effects of these gradients on the concentrations of the elements in birch leaves. Correlations are determined between the concentrations of toxic elements in the pulp and leaves separately for the native sample and water washout. A strong correlation was found between the total dissolved concentration of all metals and the total metallothionein and glutathione concentrations. It is hypothesized that the biochemical system of glutathione is more closely related to the accumulation of metals by plants than the system of metallothioneins. Estimates are made whether it is possible to apply the method of bioindication of the ecological state of a territory by determining the fluctuating asymmetry of birch leaves. This bioindication parameter was evaluated separately for each of the cardinal points. It is demonstrated that a high total concentrations of the metals in soils and birch leaves is correlated with an increase in the fluctuating asymmetry of the leaves and the concentration level of sulfur-bearing biological active compounds. The bioindication technique is however still far from perfect and is difficult to apply and, hence, requires further studies.

AB  - In the midwestern United States, ermine (Mustela erminea) are economically important because they are legally harvested for pelts. Information on parasites of ermine is lacking, and the effects that nematode parasites have on body condition of ermine hosts are unknown. We identified Skrjabingylus nasicola and Filaroides martis in ermine trapped from 2007 to 2013 from 6 counties in Wisconsin. Small mammals, commonly consumed by ermine, serve as paratenic hosts for both parasites. Our goal was to identify how age and sex of ermine, along with year, influence nematode parasitism. We also investigated how infection affected body condition for male and female ermine using body mass standardized by length as an index of body condition. We commonly found S. nasicola and F. martis in male and female ermine, but both prevalence and intensity of infection were higher for males. Relative to juveniles (<1 yr), adult (>1 yr) male ermine did not exhibit significantly higher intensity or prevalence of either parasite. We found that body condition was not compromised by infection for either sex, and intensity of S. nasicola and prevalence of F. martis were highest during the 2010-2011 trapping season. Of the 6 yr studied, precipitation was highest during the summer before the 2010-2011 season, and increased precipitation can cause increases in populations of gastropod intermediate hosts. We think that several distinct natural history components, namely, mating structure, diet, and metabolic rate, influence nematode parasitism in ermine.

AB  - Growing pressures from development activities, oil aquatic environments in South American Countries, have created an urgent need for tools to measure the quality of aquatic systems. The index of biotic integrity, based oil fish assemblages, elaborated in North America, constitutes a basis for the development of these tools. However, its direct application is problematic in regions having a rich and diverse ichthyofauna and where the knowledge of fish species ecology is incomplete. The response of taxonomic or trophic groups is often unknown and the selection of fish assemblage metrics cannot be based on previous knowledge, as in intensely studied regions. This work proposes a method, similar to the approach recently pursued in Europe, based on comparing the variability of fish assemblages in reference Situations with their variability influenced by human-induced perturbations. The method was developed from 53 samples of 27 reaches in 7 hydrographic basins of French Guiana. For each of 28 fish assemblage descriptors, stepwise Multiple linear regressions with 28 habitat variables were carried out. The residuals of the models obtained were used as candidate metrics independent of natural environmental factors. Nine metrics showing significant differences , between reference and disturbed samples were selected to constitute the index. The index was validated by analysing a temporal data series obtained from a reach disturbed by dam Construction.

AB  - Prairie reconstruction has become a common method for reestablishing tallgrass prairie communities in the central United States. With the objective of creating plant communities that approximate remnant (reference) prairies, managers are interested in identifying: (1) best methods for reconstructing reference community conditions; (2) the rate of change in plant communities through time following reconstruction; and (3) species present in remnant communities but missing from reconstructed communities. This information is important in the development of adaptive management strategies during active reconstruction. We used a chronosequence approach to assess the success of two reconstruction methods in emulating local, reference remnant prairie plant communities. We compared broadcast dormant seeding following two types of site preparation, agricultural cropping (Crop) or herbicide control in existing grass assemblages (Grass), and remnant communities. The Crop site preparation method resulted in a rapid increase in richness shortly following seeding. Although more similar to remnant assemblages initially, the Grass method took longer for mean coefficient of conservatism and floristic quality index to approach conditions of the reference communities. However, neither method resulted in plant community compositions that converged with the reference through time. Further, indicator species analysis identified a diverse assemblage of species lacking from the reconstructed prairies. These results suggest the need to develop management strategies for establishing the "missing" species during reconstruction and provide further support for protection and conservation of existing remnant prairies.

AB  - Multimetric biotic indices increasingly are used to complement physicochemical data in assessments of stream quality. We initiated development of multimetric indices, based on fish communities, to assess biotic integrity of streams in two physiographic regions of central Romania. Unlike previous efforts to develop such indices for European streams, our metrics and scoring criteria were selected largely on the basis of empirical relations in the regions of interest. We categorised 54 fish species with respect to ten natural-history attributes, then used this information to compute 32 candidate metrics of five types ( taxonomic, tolerance, abundance, reproductive, and feeding) for each of 35 sites. We assessed the utility of candidate metrics for detecting anthropogenic impact based on three criteria: ( a) range of values taken, (b) relation to a site-quality index (SQI), which incorporated information on hydrologic alteration, channel alteration, land-use intensity, and water chemistry, and ( c) metric redundancy. We chose seven metrics from each region to include in preliminary multimetric indices (PMIs). Both PMIs included taxonomic, tolerance, and feeding metrics, but only two metrics were common to both PMIs. Although we could not validate our PMIs, their strong association with the SQI in each region suggests that such indices would be valuable tools for assessing stream quality and could provide more comprehensive assessments than the traditional approaches based solely on water chemistry.

AB  - In order to assess the long-term lysosomal responses to the Prestige oil spill (POS), mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis, were collected in 22 localities from Galicia and the Bay of Biscay (North Iberian peninsula) in July, and September 2003, April, July, and October 2004-2005 and April 2006. Lysosomal membrane stability (labilisation period, LP) and lysosomal structural changes (lysosomal volume density, V-vL and lysosomal surface-to-volume ratio, S/V-L) were measured as general stress biomarkers. The most remarkable long-term effects after the POS were drastic changes in lysosomal size (lysosomal enlargement) and membrane stability (extremely low LP values) up to April-04. Later on, a recovery trend was envisaged all along the studied area after July-04, albeit membrane stability continued to be below 20 min throughout the studied period up to April-06, which indicates a "distress-to-moderatestress'' condition. Lysosomal Response Index (LRI) revealed that environmental stress was more marked in Galicia than in the Bay of Biscay, mainly in the first sampling year, although a "moderate-to-high-stress'' condition persisted until July-05. Overall, although lysosomal size returned to reference values, membrane stability was not fully recovered indicating a stress situation throughout the studied period.

AB  - To estimate the freshwater loss in coastal aquifers due to salinisation, a numerical model based on the sharp interface assumption has been introduced. The developed methodology will be useful in areas where limited hydrological data are available. This model will elaborate on the changes in fresh groundwater loss with respect to climate change, land use pattern and hydrologic soil condition. The aridity index has been introduced to represent the variations in precipitation and temperature. The interesting finding is that the deforestation leads to increase groundwater recharge in and areas, because deforestation leads to reduce evapotranspiration even though it favors runoff. The combined climate and land use scenarios show that when the aridity index is less than 60, the agricultural lands give higher groundwater recharge than other land use patterns for all hydrologic soil conditions. The calculated recharge was then used to estimate the freshwater-saltwater interface and percentage of freshwater loss due to salinity intrusion. We found that in arid areas, the fresh groundwater loss increases as the percentage of forest cover increases. The combined effects of deforestation and aridity index on fresh groundwater loss show that deforestation causes an increase in the recharge and existing fresh groundwater resource in areas having low precipitation and high temperature (arid climates).

AB  - Ecological regions are areas of similar climate, landform, soil, potential natural vegetation, hydrology, or other ecologically relevant variables. The makeup of aquatic biological assemblages (e.g., fish, macroinvertebrates, algae, riparian birds, etc.) varies dramatically over the landscape, as do the environmental stresses that affect the condition of those assemblages. Ecoregions delineate areas where similar assemblages are likely to occur and, therefore, where similar expectations can be established. For this reason, ecological regions have proven to be an important tool for use in the process of ecological assessment. This article describes four examples of the use of ecological regions in important aspects of environmental monitoring and assessment: (1) design of monitoring networks; (2) estimating expected conditions (criteria development); (3) reporting of results; (4) setting priorities for future monitoring and restoration. By delineating geographic areas with similar characteristics, ecological regions provide a framework for developing relevant indicators, setting expectations through the use of regional reference sites, establishing ecoregion-specific criteria and/or standards, presenting results, focusing models based on relationships between landscape and surface water metrics, and setting regional priorities for management and restoration. The Environmental Protection Agency and many state environmental departments currently use ecoregions to aid the development of environmental criteria, to illustrate current environmental condition, and to guide efforts to maintain and restore physical, chemical and biological integrity in lakes, streams, and rivers.

AB  - Aim. The aim of our investigation was to study the possibility of using the visual pathologies of fish as biomarkers of pollution to identify those fish species most sensitive in this way as biological monitors in assessing the ecological state of Sevastopol waters.
   Material and Methods. 461 specimens of eleven common species of fish from the waters of Sevastopol were subjected to external examination and dissection in 2018. A semi-quantitative gradation of the identified pathologies was conducted using the Health Assessment Index (HAI).
   Results. Twenty three types of visual pathology were recorded. Abnormalities in the skin and gills, fin alterations, skeletal deformities, pathologies of liver, spleen and gonads and parasitic invasions were noted. Analysis of external anomalies using the Health Assessment Index (HAI) revealed that the most potentially indicative species for visual biomonitoring were the following demersal fishes: knout goby Mesogobius batrachocephalus Pallas, 1814, round goby Neogobius melanostomus Pallas, 1814 and East Atlantic peacock wrasse Symphodus tinca Linnaeus, 1758. Liver changes detected in these three fish species may indicate chronic exposure and reaction to xenobiotics and the presence of ectoparasites would indicate a weakening of the immune status of the individual specimens studied.
   Conclusions. Pathological studies of fish in Sevastopol's coastal zone indicated that the condition of their organs and tissues is related to environmental factors and that there are sensitivities to habitat pollution. The results of the study are of interest in the future development of monitoring programs for bioassays and bioindication of hydrobionts using fish as biomarkers.

AB  - Microbes are vital components of atmospheric fine particle matter (PM2.5), and can have critical effects on human health (such as causing infectious diseases). Moreover, although China suffers from extensive concerns regarding human health issues related to air pollution, relatively few studies have focused on the characteristics of airborne microorganisms with respect to variations in air pollution, particularly under non-serious conditions. In this study, we used the modified fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis method to measure the seasonal microbial activity in PM2.5 during two levels of air pollution in Beijing. The mean microbial activity under excellent and good conditions (air quality index of < 100) was distinctly higher than that under slight and moderate conditions (101-200) during all four seasons. We further explored relationships between microbial activity and bacterial species richness and community diversity. The relative abundance of pathogenic bacteria was quite low overall, being highest in autumn (0.229%) and declining through winter (0.207%), summer (0.034%), and spring (0.022%), the same pattern observed for microbial activity. However, there was no statistical difference in the relative seasonal abundance of pathogens. Of the six types identified, streptococcus was most prevalent (0.23%). This study provides a reference and starting point for future research into the mostly unexplored field of pathogenic mechanisms during non-serious air pollution conditions.

AB  - The use of dispersants is an integral part of offshore oil spill contingency plans in various countries. In the Russian Federation, dispersants can be used in accordance with the document STO 318.4.02-2005. The document is of a recommendatory nature and provides for preliminary environmental studies as part of the procedures for the analysis of the total environmental benefit (Environmental Impact Assessment) with the passage of the State Environmental Expertise. The rules provide information on the dispersibility of some types of oil, the entry of which into the sea areas of the Russian Federation is most likely. In the absence of a certain oil product in the document, it is necessary to experimentally check their effectiveness, while there are no indications for the use of a specific method. In this regard, it is necessary to analyze the current state of this problem and its solutions in various countries.
   The paper summarizes the historically established experience of using laboratory methods for assessing the effectiveness of dispersants and testing approaches used in Europe and North America, analyzes their advantages and disadvantages. Various methods of quantitative assessment of the efficiency indicator of a dispersant and the factors that have the greatest influence on the dispersion process are considered, and the design features of a laboratory experiment are described. At the end of the work, the main recommendations are formulated that allow choosing a laboratory method for assessing the effectiveness of a dispersant with optimal characteristics and a general approach to testing.

AB  - The present study was performed in a randomized complete block design with three replications to identify higher yielding genotypes and putative traits for grain yield improvement under a rainfed environment. Genotypes recorded highly significant variation for most of the observed agro-morphological traits except the number of effective tillers/m(2). IR102774-31-21-2-4-7 (5.40 t/ha) followed by IR99739: 2-1-1-2-1 (5.22 t/ha), and IR103587-23-2-1-B (5.05 t/ha) respectively were the higher grain yielders. These high yielders were among the sets of early flowering (85-96 days) and maturing (120-130 days) genotypes. Plant height (PHT-86.62% and 25.69%), harvest index (HI 87.17% and 44.66%), and thousand-grain weight (TGW-71.06% and 30.05%) recorded high heritability values coupled with higher genetic advance as a percentage of the mean (GAM). IR102774-31-21-2-47 produced superior agro-morphological character for several traits like grain yield, thousand-grain weight, biological yield, plant height, and days to flowering and maturity. Plant height, biological yield, harvest index, days to flowering, and maturity were highly associated with grain yield and had medium to high heritability and GAM values. Therefore, these traits might be of importance for selection in grain yield improvement of rice under rainfed lowland conditions.

AB  - Cyclic peatland surface variability is influenced by hydrological conditions that highly depend on climate and/or anthropogenic activities. A low water level leads to a decrease of peatland surface and an increase of C emissions into the atmosphere, whereas a high water level leads to an increase of peatland surface and carbon sequestration in peatlands. The main aim of this article is to evaluate the influence of hydrometeorological conditions toward the peatland surface and its feedback toward the water regime. A regional survey of the raised bog water table fluctuation and surface variability was made in one of the largest peatlands in Lithuania. Two appropriate indicators for different peatland surface variability periods (increase and decrease) were detected. The first one is an similar to 200 mm y(-1) average net rainfall over a three-year range. The second one is an average annual water depth of 25-30 cm. The application of these indicators enabled the reconstruction of Cepkeliai peatland surface variability during a 100 year period. Processes of peatland surface variability differ in time and in separate parts of peatland. Therefore, internal subbasins in peatland are formed. Subbasins involve autogenic processes that can later affect their internal hydrology, nutrient status, and vegetation succession. Internal hydrological conditions, surface fluctuation, and vegetation succession in peatland subbasins should be taken into account during evaluation of their state, nature management projects, and other peatland research works.

AB  - Anthropogenic eutrophication affects the Mediterranean, Black, North and Baltic Seas to various extents. Responses to nutrient loading and methods of monitoring relevant indicators vary regionally, hindering interpretation of ecosystem state changes and preventing a straightforward pan-European assessment of eutrophication symptoms. Here we summarize responses to nutrient enrichment in Europe's seas, comparing existing time-series of selected pelagic (phytoplankton biomass and community composition, turbidity, N:P ratio) and benthic (macro flora and faunal communities, bottom oxygen condition) indicators based on their effectiveness in assessing eutrophication effects. Our results suggest that the Black Sea and Northern Adriatic appear to be recovering from eutrophication due to economic reorganization in the Black Sea catchment and nutrient abatement measures in the case of the Northern Adriatic. The Baltic is most strongly impacted by eutrophication due to its limited exchange and the prevalence of nutrient recycling. Eutrophication in the North Sea is primarily a coastal problem, but may be exacerbated by climatic changes. Indicator interpretation is strongly dependent on sea-specific knowledge of ecosystem characteristics, and no single indicator can be employed to adequately compare eutrophication state between European seas. Communicating eutrophication-related information to policy-makers could be facilitated through the use of consistent indicator selection and monitoring methodologies across European seas. This work is discussed in the context of the European Commission's recently published Marine Strategy Directive. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper presents a new approach to solving the problem of water quality control in rivers. We proposed an intelligent system that monitors and controls the quality of water in a river. The distributed measuring system works with a central control system that uses the intelligent analytical computing system. The Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Dissolved Oxygens (DO) index was used to assess the state of water quality. Because the results for the DO measurement are immediate, while the measurement of the BOD parameter is performed in a laboratory environment over a period of several days, we used Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for immediate estimation BOD to overcome the problem of controlling river water quality in real time. Mathematical models of varying complexity that represent indicators of water quality in the form of BOD and DO were presented and described with ordinary and distributed-parameters differential equations. The two-layered feed-forward neural network learned with supervised strategy has been tasked with estimating the BOD state coordinate. Using classic ANN properties, the difficult-to-measure river ecological state parameters interpolation effect was achieved. The quality of the estimation obtained in this way was compared to the quality of the estimation obtained using the Kalman-Bucy filter. Based on the results of simulation studies obtained, it was proved that it is possible to control river aeration based on the measurements of particular state coordinates and the use of an intelligent module that completes the knowledge concerning unmeasured data. The presented models can be further applied to describe other cascade objects.

AB  - This investigation examines the variable production of alveolar laterals in Barcelonan Spanish as a case study evidencing the effects of language contact between a majority language, Spanish, and a minority language, Catalan. The Catalan-Spanish speech community constitutes a rather unique case of majority-minority language contact, particularly within the Spanish-speaking world, as Catalan, though a minority language in Spain, is characterized by such a high degree of linguistic vitality, linguistic capital, and social prestige in the autonomous region of Catalonia that its status as a minority language is to a degree, questionable. I account for sociophonetic variability in the production of Barcelonan Spanish /l/ by a set of linguistic (phonological context, cognate status) and social factors (gender, age, style, language dominance) that support an analysis of lateral velarization as contact-induced and situate this case of language contact as a natural or otherwise predictable outcome of this community's sociolinguistic and sociodemographic history, notably concerning changes in immigration patterns, language ideologies, and language use in the last century. Additionally, I highlight how the gradient nature of select sociophonetic variables uniquely conditions nuanced social indexation in the speech community, specifically in the absence of any one singular or discrete, community-wide acoustic variant.

AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key process of the climate system because it links water, energy and carbon cycles. In this study we modified a Penman-Monteith based algorithm to estimate ET on the Tibetan Plateau at a 1-km spatial resolution for the period 2000-2010 using meteorological and satellite remote sensing data. The results showed that the average annual ET on the Tibetan Plateau was 350.3mm year(-1) and decreased from the southeast toward the northwest. The highest ET value was found in open water bodies (680.9mm year(-1)) and the lowest ET value was found in open shrubland (254.0mm year(-1)). Overall, the inter-annual ET decreased from 2000 to 2010 and there was significant negative ET trend over 42% of the region, primarily in the northwest of the Tibetan Plateau. Relative humidity was the dominant factor in controlling long-term variations of ET in the arid northwest plateau. But under moist conditions, leaf area index or temperature drove ET. In addition, P-ET on the Tibetan Plateau significantly increased and about 37% of the region showed strong positive P-ET trend primarily in the central of the Tibetan Plateau. The positive P-ET trend in four seasons suggested that the Tibetan Plateau might have become wetter during the past decade.

AB  - Estimating the fractional coverage of the photosynthetic vegetation (f(PV)) and non-photosynthetic vegetation (f(NPV)) is essential for assessing the growth conditions of vegetation growth in arid areas and for monitoring environmental changes and desertification. The aim of this study was to estimate the f(PV), f(NPV) and the fractional coverage of the bare soil (f(BS)) in the lower reaches of Tarim River quantitatively. The study acquired field data during September 2020 for obtaining the f(PV), f(NPV) and f(BS). Firstly, six photosynthetic vegetation indices (PVIs) and six non-photosynthetic vegetation indices (NPVIs) were calculated from Sentinel-2A image data. The PVIs include normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), ratio vegetation index (RVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), reduced simple ratio index (RSR) and global environment monitoring index (GEMI). Meanwhile, normalized difference index (NDI), normalized difference tillage index (NDTI), normalized difference senescent vegetation index (NDSVI), soil tillage index (STI), shortwave infrared ratio (SWIR32) and dead fuel index (DFI) constitutes the NPVIs. We then established linear regression model of different PVIs and f(PV), and NPVIs and f(NPV), respectively. Finally, we applied the GEMI-DFI model to analyze the spatial and seasonal variation of f(PV) and f(NPV) in the study area in 2020. The results showed that the GEMI and f(PV) revealed the best correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.59, while DFI and f(NPV) had the best correlation of R-2 = 0.45. The accuracy of f(PV), f(NPV) and f(BS) based on the determined PVIs and NPVIs as calculated by GEMI-DFI model are 0.69, 0.58 and 0.43, respectively. The f(PV) and f(NPV) are consistent with the vegetation phonological development characteristics in the study area. The study concluded that the application of the GEMI-DFI model in the f(PV) and f(NPV) estimation was sufficiently significant for monitoring the spatial and seasonal variation of vegetation and its ecological functions in arid areas.

AB  - Simple Summary In the natural aquatic environment, fish obtain their carotenoid requirements from the natural food web. Meanwhile, under aquaculture conditions, especially intensive culture, fish are deprived in terms of their carotenoids requirements from the environment. Accordingly, the artificial diet formula must consider the carotenoids accessibility and maintain its efficient utilization. Moreover, in fish larvae, the absorption of carotenoids as lutein (LTN) is not efficient. Therefore, as LTN is fat-soluble carotenoid, the improvement of fat digestion and absorption could improve LTN utilization. The present work evaluated the effect of individual or co-supplementation of LTN and bile salts (BS) in the diets of rabbitfish (Siganus rivulatus) larvae. The results revealed an improvement of growth performance and survival (%) with dietary supplementation with LTN and BS, which could enhance the cost-benefit of farming rabbitfish. Also, the carotenoid deposition, antioxidant status, lipase activity, and lipid metabolism improved with co-supplementation of LTN and BS than its individual supplementation. A 60-day feeding trial was conducted to assess the effects of dietary supplementation with bile salts (BS), lutein (LTN), and their combination on growth, survival, carotenoid content, and antioxidant status of rabbitfish (Siganus rivulatus) larvae. Fish were fed four isonitrogenous (34.39% protein) and isoenergetic (20.57 kJ/g) diets supplemented with BS (0.15 g kg(-1)), LTN (0.1 g kg(-1)), BS+LTN (0.15 and 0.1 g kg(-1), respectively), and a non-supplemented control diet. The results revealed that fish fed BS+LTN had the highest significant specific growth rate (4.37% day(-1)), feed efficiency (46.55%), and survival (97.78%). Lutein supplementation improved whole-body protein content, meanwhile, fish fed a BS-supplemented diet had a higher lipid content. The carotenoid deposition was significantly increased with LTN and BS+LTN in skin, muscle, and whole body compared to the control and BS treatment. All dietary supplementation of BS and LTN showed significant improvement in total antioxidant capacity, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities. Additionally, LTN alone or BS+LTN significantly reduced malondialdehyde levels by 5.30 and 29.91%, respectively compared to the control. BS supplementation modulated aminopeptidases activities, triglycerides, cholesterol, and increased the activity of pancreatic lipase. Therefore, it could be inferred that dietary supplementation with LTN in combination with BS could improve the growth performance, carotenoid deposition, antioxidant status, lipid digestion, and metabolism ofS. rivulatus.

AB  - Understanding the interaction between sexual and natural selection within variable environments is crucial to our understanding of evolutionary processes. The handicap principle predicts females will prefer males with exaggerated traits provided those traits are indicators of male quality to ensure direct or indirect female benefits. Spatial variability in ecological factors is expected to alter the balance between sexual and natural selection that defines the evolution of such traits. Male and female blackspotted topminnows (Fundulidae: Fundulus olivaceus) display prominent black dorsolateral spots that are variable in number across its broad range. We investigated variability in spot phenotypes at 117 sites across 13 river systems and asked if the trait was sexually dimorphic and positively correlated with measures of fitness (condition and gonadosomatic index [GSI]). Laboratory and mesocosm experiments assessed femalemate choice and predation pressure on spot phenotypes. Environmental and community data collected at sampling locations were used to assess predictive models of spot density at the individual, site, and river system level. Greater number of spots was positively correlated with measures of fitness in males. Males with more spots were preferred by females and suffered greater mortality due to predation. Water clarity (turbidity) was the best predictor of spot density on the drainage scale, indicating that sexual and natural selection for the trait may be mediated by local light environments.

AB  - 1. Allochthonous carbon is the basis of the detrital food web in low-order, warmwater stream ecosystems, and stream-bed sediments typically function as carbon reservoirs. Many of the same factors that govern carbon input and storage to streams (e.g. riparian vegetation, large wood, heterogeneous boundaries) have also been identified as key attributes of stream fish habitat.
   2. Effects of channel incision on sand-bed stream carbon reservoirs and indices of biological integrity (IBIS) based on fish collections were examined for four streams exhibiting a range of incisement in northern Mississippi. Observed mean C concentrations (mass percentage) ranged from 0.24 +/- 036% for a non-incised stream to only 0.01 +/- 0.02% for a severely incised channel, and were not correlated with large wood (LW) density, perhaps because LW density Lit one site was elevated by a habitat rehabilitation project and at another site by accelerated inputs from incision-related riparian tree fall. Fish IBI was positively correlated with bed C (r = 0.70, p = 0.003), and IBIS for reference streams were more than 50% greater than those computed for the most severely degraded sites.
   3. More testing is needed to determine the efficacy of stream bed C as an indicator, but its importance to warmwater stream ecosystems, and the importance of covarying physical and hydrologic conditions seems evident. Published in 2008 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - 1. Monthly series of abundance indexes for the English Channel squid stock, based on fishery statistics of the United Kingdom (1980-93) and France (1986-96), were compared with water temperature data. The two objectives of the study were to test empirical predictive models and to analyse the stock-environment relationship at various time scales; both correlation and time-series statistical techniques were applied. Sea surface temperature (SST) showed inter-annual fluctuations and month-to-month auto-correlation in addition to the annual cycle.
   2. Trends in squid landings and temperature at the annual scale were found to be related, whatever the statistical method used (moving averages, cumulative functions or regression using averaged data).
   3. Variable selection applied in a 'multi-month' model suggested that fishing season indexes could be predicted from temperatures observed in the previous winter. The link between mild winter conditions and cohort success in winter/spring spawning species suggested that early life survival (and/or growth) was involved. This empirical model is a first step in the development of environment-predicted recruitment indexes useful for management advice.
   4. Seasonal decomposition was performed on both the squid resource data and SST data in search of short-term relationships. In spite of the flexibility of the loliginid life-cycle, no significant relationship was found between squid seasonally adjusted indexes and temperature anomalies in the previous months. This underlined the conclusion that temperature effect on cohort success was not constant throughout the year.

AB  - Over the past 20 years, rules concerning wastewater treatment and quality of water discharged into the environment have changed considerably. Huge investments have been made in Paris conurbation to improve waste water treatment processes in accordance with the European Water Framework Directive. The interdepartmental association for sewage disposal in Paris conurbation (SIAAP) carried out a monitoring of both fish assemblages and water quality in the Seine River around the Paris conurbation (France) since the early 90's. The main goal of this study was to estimate the influence of the water quality improvement on fish. On one hand, the study confirmed the improvement of the water quality (dissolved oxygen, ammonia nitrogen, organic matter) in the Seine River, mostly focused downstream of Paris conurbation. On the other hand, an increase of the number of species occurred from 1990 (14) to 2013 (21). Moreover, changes in the river Seine assemblages happened over that 23-year period with emergence of sensitive species (ruffe, scalpin and pike-perch). The improvement of the water quality was also reported with respect to the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI). However, no variation of pollutant concentrations in roach, eel and chub muscles has been observed. An exceedance of the environmental quality standards have even been reported all over this period as regards mercury and organochlorine. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Large and severe wildfires can dramatically alter terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. We documented changes in benthic macroinvertebrate communities and physical habitat at two sites along Angora Creek, CA, USA for 2 years following a severe fire. Although post-fire years had low precipitation, canopy cover and bank stability declined dramatically following the wildfire (canopy cover: 88% pre-fire, 22% post-fire; stable bank: 93% pre-fire, 11% post-fire). Substrate also changed substantially, with fine sediment 8x more abundant post-fire and cobble 7x less abundant post-fire. We found no consistent changes in taxonomic richness or diversity following the fire, but post-fire densities and percentage of sensitive taxa were significantly reduced. We observed large reductions in relative abundances of shredder and scraper taxa, while collector-gatherer abundances increased. Community composition shifted away from pre-fire configurations, and continued to diverge in the second year following the fire. Scores from a regionally derived index of biotic integrity (IBI) were variable but overall much lower in post-fire samples and did not show recovery after 2 years. Overall, our study demonstrated substantial post-fire effects to aquatic ecosystems even in the absence of large flooding or scouring events, and showed that these effects can be transmitted downstream into unburned reaches.

AB  - The effects of declining Arctic sea ice on local ecosystem productivity are not well understood but have been shown to vary inter-specifically, spatially, and temporally. Because marine mammals occupy upper trophic levels in Arctic food webs, they may be useful indicators for understanding variation in ecosystem productivity. Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are apex predators that primarily consume benthic and pelagic-feeding ice-associated seals. As such, their productivity integrates sea ice conditions and the ecosystem supporting them. Declining sea ice availability has been linked to negative population effects for polar bears but does not fully explain observed population changes. We examined relationships between spring foraging success of polar bears and sea ice conditions, prey productivity, and general patterns of ecosystem productivity in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas (CSs). Fasting status (>= 7 days) was estimated using serum urea and creatinine levels of 1,448 samples collected from 1,177 adult and subadult bears across three subpopulations. Fasting increased in the Beaufort Sea between 1983-1999 and 2000-2016 and was related to an index of ringed seal body condition. This change was concurrent with declines in body condition of polar bears and observed changes in the diet, condition and/or reproduction of four other vertebrate consumers within the food chain. In contrast, fasting declined in CS polar bears between periods and was less common than in the two Beaufort Sea subpopulations consistent with studies demonstrating higher primary productivity and maintenance or improved body condition in polar bears, ringed seals, and bearded seals despite recent sea ice loss in this region. Consistency between regional and temporal variation in spring polar bear fasting and food web productivity suggests that polar bears may be a useful indicator species. Furthermore, our results suggest that spatial and temporal ecological variation is important in affecting upper trophic-level productivity in these marine ecosystems.

AB  - Fish life history is shaped by environmental and ecological circumstances but constrained by phylogeny. Life-history trade-offs can be exposed in a comparison of closely related species with similar niches. We compare the life histories of four closely related and similar-sized, sympatric, omnivorous seabreams (Sparidae) that share the same physical habitat, namely the steentjieSpondyliosoma emarginatum, hottentotPachymetopon blochii, white stumpnoseRhabdosargus globicepsand FransmadamBoopsoidea inornata. Samples of each species were obtained in every season from the southwestern Cape, South Africa, to obtain measures of length, mass, gonadosomatic index (GSI) and condition. Large variations in sex ratio, GSI, and spawning season length (SSL) among species are described. Differences in patterns of sex-specific GSI and condition point to different mating systems.Spondyliosoma emarginatumis a nest-guarding, short-lived, protogynous hermaphrodite.Pachymetopon blochiiis a resident group-spawner.Rhabdosargus globicepsis a moderately long-lived migrant group-spawner, with a sex ratio closest to 1:1.Boopsoidea inornatais a polygamous, long-lived resident with low annual fecundity. Trade-offs are apparent between annual fecundity and longevity, parental care and male GSI, parental care and SSL, migration and SSL, hermaphroditism and migration, and hermaphroditism and bet-hedging. The cost of sequential hermaphroditism in marine fish is considered in terms of reproductive success in highly variable environments.

AB  - Biological quality elements have been developed worldwide to assess whether a water body is in a good status or not. However, current studies mainly focus on a single taxonomic group or a small set of species, often limited by methods of morphological identification, and lack further aspects of biodiversity (e.g., across taxa and multiple attributes) and ecosystem functions. Here, we advance a framework for assessing the river's ecological status based on complete biodiversity data measured by environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding and measurements of ecosystem functions in addition to physicochemical elements across a large riverine system in China. We identified 40 indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem functions, covering five taxonomic groups from bacteria to invertebrates, and associated with multiple attributes of biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Our data show that human impact on ecosystems could be accurately predicted by these eDNA-based indicators and ecosystem functions, using cross-validation with a known stressor gradient. Moreover, indices based on these indicators of biodiversity and ecosystem functions not only distinguish the physicochemical characteristics of the sites but also improve the assessment accuracy of 20-30% for the river's ecological status. Overall, by incorporating eDNA-based biodiversity with physicochemical and ecosystem functional elements, the multidimensional perspectives of ecosystem states provide additional information to protect and maintain a good ecological status of rivers.

AB  - An individual's physiological condition early in ontogeny often regulates natal dispersal and philopatry decisions; however, increased condition promotes dispersal in some organisms and philopatry in others. These disparate findings likely arise from interactions among an individual's early life stage physiological condition, its likelihood of surviving a dispersal event (i.e., dispersal capacity), and its motivation to leave its natal site (i.e., dispersal propensity). Due to the broad importance of reproductive site selection to population structure and dynamics, studies disentangling these various phenotype-dependent effects are critical. We evaluated the relationships between two aspects of larval physiological condition and natal philopatry in Arizona tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum nebulosum) in an isolated pond system. In this population, geographic distance between ponds is small, adult survivorship is very high, and thus the likelihood of a successful breeding event should mediate reproductive site selection as opposed to the likelihood of surviving the dispersal event. We found that natal philopatry increased with an estimate of long-term body condition in males, but there was no relationship in females. However, natal philopatry decreased with an estimate of short-term body condition. We also found that an individual's natal pond had effects on philopatry that influenced both sexes and were independent of the pond's direct effects on body condition. Together, these findings strongly support the importance of an individual's early developmental experience in the natal environment to its reproductive behaviors across its lifespan, and further highlight the value of considering how phenotype-dependent dispersal mechanisms may vary between the sexes.
   Previous research has not discerned a generalizable relationship between larval physiological condition and natal philopatry, likely because of the complex interaction between an individual's ability (dispersal capacity) and its motivation (dispersal propensity) to reproduce in its natal habitat. Using a salamander population with small inter-pond distances and high adult survival, we isolated the effects of two aspects of physiological condition on dispersal propensity. We found that increased long-term larval physiological condition was associated with natal philopatry in male, but not female, tiger salamanders, as well as differences in philopatry based on natal pond. In contrast, short-term larval physiological condition was negatively associated with philopatry. Our findings suggest an important, long-lasting role of the natal environment on reproductive site selection, and further implicate that the conditions experienced in early development can strongly affect reproductive behaviors across the life cycle.

AB  - Substances derived from anthropogenic activities induce changes in the physical and chemical characteristics of the aquatic environment. Physicochemical and biological studies are necessary to understand how changes in landscape affect the health of the aquatic environment. The main goal of this study was to evaluate how the landscape at different spatial scales affects (1) water quality and (2) the health status of Heptapterus mustelinus, based on several biomarkers. During the dry season, individuals were caught in three sites with different degrees of anthropogenic activity. The quality of the terrestrial environment was assessed using the Riparian Quality and Land Use Indices. The water quality condition was evaluated using a water quality index, and pesticides and pharmaceuticals were measured in water. The following biomarkers were analyzed in the fish: general health status (Condition Factor, Hepatosomatic index and energetic costs), enzymatic activity (GST, CAT, AchE), carbonyl content in proteins and histopathological responses in liver and gills. The most impacted sites by the presence of pesticides showed more alterations in the surrounding landscape; specially, changes in the riparian area. In this area, biomarkers denoted more damage than in sites with protected riparian zone. Conservation status of riparian ecosystems is crucial in the determination of rivers ecological quality. Our results demonstrate the importance of monitoring the environmental quality through an integrated analysis, using native fish to understand the effects of human activities on the biota.

AB  - This article provides analyses of data on the premises infestation by commensal rodents collected during the 2006 Urban Rodent Survey, in Sao Paulo city, Brazil. A two-stage cluster sample survey was used to visit 23,512 premises, and logistic regression models were estimated in order to understand the relationships among the risk factors and the infestation probability. The premises infestation rates were 23.1% for all rodents, 12.7% for roof rat, 9.4% for Norway rat and 1.7% for house mouse. Factors found to be related to infestation levels were: socioeconomic conditions (human development index and income), premises features (commercial, strictly residential and vacant lots), and environmental resources (access, harborage and food). The analysis of odds ratios showed that access by the building structure favours roof rat and access by the sewage system favours Norway rat. Harborage in ceiling cracks are determinant for roof rat, harborage in wall cracks and in dense bush for Norway rat, and harborage in waste or in building material for house mouse infestations. Available animal food favour all the three species, fruit trees favour Norway and roof rats, human food is important for house mouse: therefore a natural partition of the environmental resources among the species was observed. The results obtained in this article add some knowledge on the biology and behaviour of commensal rodents.

AB  - The study presents the delimitation of problem areas carried out at the Institute of Geography and Spatial Organization of PAS on behalf of the Ministry of Development of Poland (2015-2016), first and foremost to meet the practical needs of the development policy being pursued at state, regional and local government levels. The study was elaborated for the 2479 Polish communes (gminas) by reference to 21 indicators mainly concerned with the state of the natural environment and socio-economic conditions, as well as features of spatial and local development. The three categories of area ultimately identified were the natural, the social and the economic aspects, the combination of which yielded several main types of problem area. A last stage then entailed a division into regions, i.e. the designation and naming of particular geographical areas.

AB  - The dynamics of benthic communities of various reaches of the Kuibyshev Reservoir over a long-term observation period 1966 to 2016 has been statistically analyzed. The results of a comparison of the spatial-temporal distribution of structural indicators of chironomid (Chironomidae) communities, including the species diversity and abundance of 48 taxa based on hydrobiological survey data in nine large parts of the reservoir for different years, are presented. Nonparametric analysis of variance revealed a high statistical significance of the variability of the species composition of benthic communities under the influence of temporal and spatial factors. Using multidimensional ordination and generalized Procrustes analysis, the dynamics of the distribution of ecosystem objects (individual species and areas) in the coordinates of two latent axes of maximum variation is shown. A geometric analysis of the multidimensional trajectories of changes in the community of aquatic organisms in individual reaches for different periods of time is carried out. Similar developmental processes of chironomid communities were revealed in a longitudinal succession of reaches on the former channel and sunken floodplain, while the analogous structural characteristics of the Kamskiy reach and eutrophic Cheremshanskiy Bay are specific. The priority role of chironomids as the most important indicator group necessary for biotic assessment of long-term (50 years) changes in the ecological state of a large reservoir is considered.

AB  - Spatial self-organization of dryland vegetation constitutes one of the most promising indicators for an ecosystem's proximity to desertification. This insight is based on studies of reaction- diffusion models that reproduce visual characteristics of vegetation patterns observed on aerial photographs. However, until now, the development of reliable early warning systems has been hampered by the lack of more in-depth comparisons between model predictions and real ecosystem patterns. In this paper, we combined topographical data, (remotely sensed) optical data, and in situ biomass measurements from two sites in Somalia to generate a multilevel description of dryland vegetation patterns. We performed an in-depth comparison between these observed vegetation pattern characteristics and predictions made by the extended-Klausmeier model for dryland vegetation patterning. Consistent with model predictions, we found that for a given topography, there is multistability of ecosystem states with different pattern wavenumbers. Furthermore, observations corroborated model predictions regarding the relationships between pattern wavenumber, total biomass, and maximum biomass. In contrast, model predictions regarding the role of slope angles were not corroborated by the empirical data, suggesting that inclusion of small-scale topographical heterogeneity is a promising avenue for future model development. Our findings suggest that patterned dryland ecosystems may be more resilient to environmental change than previously anticipated, but this enhanced resilience crucially depends on the adaptive capacity of vegetation patterns.

AB  - The DPSIR framework helps to identify and situate stressors, drivers and pressure variables within a dynamic environmental process composed of cause-effect relations. However, an important aspect related to its structural deficiency implies the use of unidirectional causalities between variables. In this work, we extend the capacities of the DPSIR framework by addressing three important points. Firstly, causal networks are built instead of unidirectional causalities, the former based on paths represented by sequences of cause-effect relations between involved variables. These paths are derived from the population growth as a driving force variable, along with CO2 emissions, waste, water and loss of vegetation cover as pressure variables. Trends of these paths are combined to determine and quantitatively assess a global environmental state trend whose impacts on the environment require corrective management actions as a response. Secondly, quantitative assessments of environmental trends are transformed into fuzzy-qualitative data to facilitate their interpretation. Thirdly, a method based on weighted environmental management actions is presented to decision-makers who aspire to change current path trends in order to approach desirable scenarios similar to those put forth by the OECD outlook towards 2030. The results obtained applying this framework to the State of Morelos, Mexico, show that it can be a useful support tool in the selection and monitoring of management actions capable of reaching favorable environmental trends.

AB  - Many studies assessing the quality of sediments and their pollution impact use monitoring data consisting predominantly of chemical indicators. Recently, ecotoxicity estimates have been used as very important parameters of the ecological state of sediment samples. Thus, a more complete sediment risk assessment is achieved and more reliable information on the sediment pollution history is extracted. The data interpretation could be improved if multivariate statistical techniques were applied to data classification, modelling and interpretation. The starting classification of the data was performed using self-organizing maps (SOM) approach in order to reveal specific relationship patterns for objects and for variables. The original element of the present study is the use of the Hasse diagram technique (HOT) for partial ordering in order to explain some specific relations between the chemical indicators analysed (heavy metal content in different sediment compartments) and the ecotoxicity tests for acute and chronic toxicity. In principle, a reliable estimate of the pollution impact of a large environmental object (the Mar Menor lagoon in Spain) is achieved. The specific role of each one of the five heavy metals involved (Zn, Cu, Mn, Pb, and Cd) is interpreted in the context of the additional ecotoxicity tests. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Three sampling campaigns were performed in the Lis River (Leiria, Portugal) in February of 2018, November of 2018, and May of 2019. River water and wastewater (influent and effluent) samples of two wastewater treatment plants were target of the study. A total of 25 samples were collected and 50 pesticides were monitored, including organochlorines, triazines, pyrethroids, and organophosphorus, among others. Most of the detected pesticides were insecticides and mainly organochlorines. Concentrations between 1.29 and 2134 ng/L were found. Aldrin, gamma-HCH, and cypermethrin were detected in some samples in mu g/L, being gamma-HCH the pesticide most frequently detected with concentration in mu g/L level. The pesticides with the highest detection frequency were (i) cypermethrin, HCB, methoxychlor, and zeta-HCH in river waters; (ii) isoproturon, cypermethrin, methoxychlor, pyrimethanil, gamma-HCH, dieldrin, diuron, alpha-HCH, and alpha-endosulfan in effluents; and (iii) diuron and isoproturon in influents. The detection of the organochlorides and their degradation products is a consequence of their persistence in the environment, as their usage has long been prohibited in the European Union. Pesticides were grouped by their types in herbicides, insecticides, or fungicides and the detection and concentration for each type were discussed with the climatic conditions. Pesticide toxicity index was determined in the samples collected in the river.

AB  - In Mediterranean-type ecosystems, water availability is one of the most significant variables that regulates whole plant leaf area. An equilibrium should exist between climate, soil and leaf area in such water-limited conditions. The aim of this study was to identify the relations between leaf area index (LAI), environment (climate, soil) and fluxes (water, carbon) in Mediterranean evergreen oak (Quercus ilex L.) ecosystems. To achieve this objective, 50-years simulations were performed using the FOREST-BGC model by varying LAI for a reference site and for different climates and soil water holding capacities (SWC). Transpiration, drought stress, net photosynthesis and canopy water use efficiency (WUE) were examined on a yearly basis for the last ten years of the simulation. Similar to other findings, our results show that LAI depends on site water availability, including both climate (precipitation, potential evapotranspiration) and soil factors (e.g. water storage capacity). Low SWC limit the development of the ecosystem. On high SWC soils, development is mainly limited by the climate. When LAI increases under constant SWC and climate conditions, the decrease in annual transpiration per unit of LAI is accompanied by an increase in drought stress. Equilibrium LAI maximizes carbon assimilation. For the reference site, the equilibrium LAI is close to the observed value, 3.25. The corresponding transpiration, assimilation and WUE are 375 mm, 1251 g C m(-2) and 3.1 mmol CO2 mol(-1) (HO)-O-2, respectively. For the different sites, there is an hyperbolic decline of WUE with increasing SWC. This implies that production efficiency per unit leaf area is higher in most water-limited environments. Our study shows that a model such as FOREST-BGC allows inter-relations between water balance, carbon balance and drought stress to be taken into account to better understand ecosystem LAI.

AB  - Tundra lakes located in the Mackenzie Delta uplands, NWT, Canada, are increasingly being affected by permafrost thaw in the form of shoreline retrogressive thaw slumping. This form of thaw-induced disturbance is used as a surrogate indicator of landscape-related disturbance linked to regional climate warming. We compared 22 lakes, half affected by thaw slumping and half unaffected, to determine whether water column nutrient concentrations, light availability, and plankton biomass differed between these two lake types. Total phosphorus (TP), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and chlorophyll a concentrations were higher in unaffected lakes than in slump-affected lakes. Absorbance related to water colour of both UV and photosynthetically active radiation in the water column was also higher in unaffected lakes, but bacterioplankton abundance was not different between lake types. UV light absorbance was found to be the best predictor of pelagic chlorophyll a concentrations in unaffected lakes, whereas TDN (and to a lesser extent TP) were the best predictors of pelagic chlorophyll a in slump-affected lakes. These findings indicate that slumping arising from permafrost thaw produces a shift in tundra lake nutrient, light, and phytoplankton relationships. Given the projections of continued warming, this result has significant implications for the future biogeochemical and ecological states of Arctic tundra lakes.

AB  - Environmental indicators play an important role in assessing the state of the environment and understanding the trend of environmental changes. Iron oxide nanostructures are widespread in multiple ecosystems, and are therefore suitable for providing environmental indicators with measurable physical or chemical properties that are sensitive to the environmental conditions. It has been found that the morphologies of natural hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) nanocrystals have large variations depending on thermodynamic and chemical conditions of their formation environments. To assess the applicability of nanomorphology as an environmental indicator, we construct a morphology map of hematite nanocrystals in hydrous environments, characterized with different temperatures, humidity and supersaturation of oxygen. Our model indicates that the fractional surface areas of morphologically significant facets change with humidity and temperature, and can be used to track the variation of these environmental conditions.

AB  - Twenty sites in the lower San Joaquin River drainage, California, were sampled from 1993 to 1995 to characterize fish communities and their associations with measures of water quality and habitat quality. The feasibility of developing an Index of Biotic Integrity was assessed by evaluating four fish community metrics, including percentages of native fish, omnivorous fish, fish intolerant of environmental degradation, and fish with external anomalies. Of the thirty-one taxa of fish captured during the study, only 10 taxa were native to the drainage. Multivariate analyses of percentage data identified four site groups characterized by different groups of species. The distributions of fish species were related to specific conductance, gradient, and mean depth; however, specific conductance acted as a surrogate variable for a large group of correlated variables. Two of the fish community metrics - percentage of introduced fish and percentage of intolerant fish - appeared to be responsive to environmental quality but the responses of the other two metrics - percentage of omnivorous fish and percentage of fish with anomalies - were less direct. The conclusion of the study is that fish communities are responsive to environmental conditions, including conditions associated with human-caused disturbances, particularly agriculture and water development. The results suggest that changes in water management and water quality could result in changes in species distributions. Balancing the costs and benefits of such changes poses a considerable challenge to resource managers.

AB  - The global 2030 agenda for promoting clean energy development explicitly calls for the implementation of official policy related to sustainable development. China pledged to formulate an energy structure that focuses on non-fossil energy and natural gas towards 2030. Natural gas is therefore entering a new critical and potentially advantageous development stage. Optimizing the utilization structure in a scientific manner can be regarded as the significant means to increase natural gas consumption in order to achieve the targets upon 2020 and 2030. In this study, what ultimately matters from a sustainable lens is not whether the future natural gas consumption increases but rather whether the restricted and limited proven reserves should be arranged and utilized to reach the best effectiveness on economy-energy-environment system to further ensure sustainable development. Herein, with aims to offering operationally actionable-related insights on the optimal natural gas consumption pathways for policy governors, this paper examined the multiple effectiveness of a spectrum of representing indicators selected from the economy-energy-environment system in China under natural gas consumption structure constraint policy scenarios using a dynamic CGE approach and Markov Chains forecasting technique. Consequently, this study recommends one optimal natural gas consumption structure scenario to policy governors given its comprehensive effectiveness in promoting sustainable development in China according to horizontal and vertical comparative analyses.

AB  - The aim of the present work was to extend our knowledge on the variability of trace metals in sea urchin tissues, focusing on seasonal fluctuations (2010 February for "winter," May for "spring," August for "summer," November for "autumn") in the three different sampling sites of Algerian west coast (Oran Harbor (S1), Ain Defla (S2), and Hadjaj (belonging to Mostaganem City S3)). For this purpose, the bioavailability (metal indices) and bioaccumulation (metal concentrations in soft tissues) of heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Pb, and Cd), the physiological characteristics (e.g., biological indices such as condition index (CI), repletion index (RI), gonad index (GI)), and the biometric parameters (diameter (D) and the height (H)) of sea urchins Paracentrotus lividus were assessed and related to seasons and sites. To investigate the metal bioavailability to sea urchins more precisely, the metal indices were used as a reliable tool in the present work, instead of the metal concentrations only. The interest to standardize metal concentrations with the weight of the urchin test is to overcome the metal burden variations in the soft tissues of urchin related to the seasonal weight changes of the soft body of animal. We evidence that the most contaminated sites were S1 and S2. Furthermore, it should be noted that the bioavailability of metals, corresponding to the values of metal indices, is also more pronounced in S1 and S2 compared to that measured in S3. Thus, a correlation is observed between seasonal metal content in urchin tissues from the three sites and the corresponding metal indices. The high metal concentrations were obtained during the period when RI and CI were highest. So, it appears that the bioaccumulation of metals in sea urchins of the three sites studied is significantly influenced by the reproductive cycle and diet, feeding activity, and physiological state of these organisms. We noticed that the sea urchins from the sites S1 and S2 were small in size. It is probable that these animals, whose internal tissues contained high concentrations of metals, have been exposed to metal pollution, which might have affected both their growth and altered their physiological capacity. This approach is very original and might be used in the monitoring of the quality of coastal waters, and the present work provided a useful data set for Mediterranean monitoring network.

AB  - Considering the need for evidence-based information to support the improvement of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) practice and given the few papers devoted to this aspect in Brazil, the present paper is focused on the systematic quality review of Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) submitted to the environmental licensing process. The EIA system as implemented in the Espirito Santo state was adopted as a research object, which provided 21 EISs to be reviewed, corresponding to 57% of the EISs submitted to the state environmental agency from 2007 to 2013. The studies include different projects such as oil and gas, thermoelectric power plants, ports, transmission lines, roads, housing and so on. EIS quality review was done by following the Lee and Colley Review Package, which is widely applied and recognized in the international literature. The outcomes reveal some aspects of the state EIA system to be improved, moreover in terms of the identification and assessment of relevant impacts, association between the impact and the environmental baseline, the consideration of cumulative effects, prediction of magnitude and significance assessment of impacts. Positive aspects include the description of environment and baseline, and the organization and presentation of data/information. Although similar to other contexts, the results allow to the conclusion that EIS are delivering information of low quality to support EIA decisions in the state of Espirito Santo, thus contributing to a low effectiveness of the state EIA system.

AB  - Long-term studies of pelagic nekton in the Southern Ocean and their responses to ongoing environmental change are rare. Using stable isotope ratios measured in squid beaks recovered from diet samples of wandering albatrosses Diomedea exulans, we assessed decadal variation (from 1976 to 2016) in the habitat (delta C-13) and trophic level (delta N-15) of five important Southern Ocean squid species in relation to indices of environmental conditions-Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Based on delta C-13 values, corrected for the Suess effect, habitat had changed over the last 50 years for Taonius sp. B (Voss), Gonatus antarcticus, Galiteuthis glacialis and Histioteuthis atlantica but not Moroteuthopsis longimana. By comparison, mean delta N-15 values were similar across decades for all five species, suggesting minimal changes in trophic levels. Both SAM and SOI have increased in strength and frequency over the study period but, of the five species, only in Taonius sp. B (Voss) did these indices correlate with, delta C-13 and delta N-15 values, indicating direct relationships between environmental conditions, habitat and trophic level. The five cephalopod species therefore changed their habitats with changing environmental conditions over the last 50 years but maintained similar trophic levels. Hence, cephalopods are likely to remain important prey for top predators in Southern Ocean food webs, despite ongoing climate change.

AB  - 1. Evaluations of stream geomorphic condition may increase our understanding of the composite effects of human-induced habitat change on fish communities. Using systematic sampling of 44 reaches spread across 26 rivers in Vermont from 2002 through 2004, we tested the hypothesis that stream reaches in reference geomorphic condition would support fish assemblages that differed in diversity and productivity from fish communities found in reaches of poorer geomorphic condition.
   2. At each study reach, we sampled the fish community, identified the morphological unit according to common stream classification systems and then evaluated the extent of deviation from reference geomorphic condition using a regionally adapted geomorphic assessment methodology.
   3. We used principal component analysis (PCA) and linear regression to build exploratory models linking stream geomorphic condition to fish community characteristics.
   4. Our results suggest that geomorphic condition significantly influences fish community diversity, productivity and condition. Geomorphic condition was a significant factor in all of our fish community models. In conjunction with additional reach characteristics, geomorphic condition explained up to 31% of the total variance observed in models for species diversity of fish communities, 44% of the variance in assemblage biomass and 45% of the variance in a regional index of biotic integrity.
   5. Our work builds on single-species evidence that geomorphic characteristics represent important local-scale fish-habitat variables, showing that stream geomorphic condition is a dominant factor affecting entire fish communities. Our results enhance our understanding of the hierarchy of factors that influences fish community diversity and organisation and support the use of geomorphic condition assessments in stream management.

AB  - Plantations can provide a large amount of wood products for human society but also have incredible potential to sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere due to its growth. However, management of these even-aged plantations to maximize the joint benefits of wood production and carbon sequestration objectives for forest managers and policymakers remains unclear, especially under the stringent targets of 2 degrees C climatic change mitigation. Therefore, an efficient theoretical framework based on the typical Hartman model was developed in this paper to determine the optimal rotations of even-aged plantations, in which multiple wood products and carbon pools within an infinite time horizon were considered. As an example, the sensitivity of the optimal rotations and their corresponding land expectation values (LEVs) with respect to different carbon pools (i.e., wood products, bioenergy, harvested residuals, stump roots, and naturally generated dead organic matter), as well as a set of stand conditions (site index and stand density) and economic parameters (carbon price and discount rate) were quantitatively evaluated for state-owned larch plantations in northeast China. The results showed that the alternative carbon pools could increase the optimal rotations of larch plantations by 1-3 years for a commonly used management scenario (site index = 16 m, carbon price = 100 CNY/ton)). The optimal rotations decreased linearly with increasing site indices (R-2 = 0.95) and initial densities (R-2 = 0.98) but in-creased linearly with increasing carbon prices (R-2 = 0.99); however, significant negative exponential trends were observed with increasing discount rates (R-2 = 0.92). Except for some extreme cases (site index <= 12 m, discount rate >= 6%), the optimal rotations of LEVs are usually larger than those of maximizing sustainable timber yield, in which the differences between them were as much as approximately 4 years of site index (20 m), 6 years of initial density (6666 trees/ha), 15 years of carbon price (1000 CNY/ton) and 9 years of discount rate (3%).

AB  - The common dentex Dentex dentex is an iconic endangered species in the Mediterranean, where it is a target species that is sought after for small-scale, recreational and spearfishing fisheries. The reproductive biology of D. dentex in the natural environment is poorly known; therefore, the reproductive strategy of the species was assessed through a combination of reproductive traits and growth characteristics (estimated from length-at-age data), the size/age of sexual maturity and the energetic dynamics. A total of 358 wild fish, ranging in total length (L-T) from 19 to 84.7 cm, was sampled at Mallorca Island (Western Mediterranean) from March 1996 to June 1999. The sex ratio was skewed towards females (1.361); however, the length composition was not different between sexes (p = 0.551). Three young immature individuals (< 28 cm L-T, 0.8% individuals) were rudimentary hermaphrodites, offering support for classification as a late gonochoristic species. The age composition, determined based on the sagittal otolith, ranged from 0 to 26 years (yr). The von Bertalanffy growth function did not differ between sexes (F = 2.58, p = 0.762): L-infinity = 76.581 cm, K = 0.127 yr(-1), t(0) = -2.335 in a combined function. The maturity ogives for size and age showed that females achieved 50% maturity at 34.922 cm L-T and 3.3 yr, and males, at 33.812 cm L-T and 2.5 yrs. The onset of annual ripening took place in December, whereas vitellogenesis occurred from February to April. The spawning peak was in April and May for both males and females. A generalised linear model (GLM) showed that female size did not significantly affect the spawning season, whilst the seasonal component affected both the onset and end of spawning (GLM, p < 0.005). The gonadosomatic index (I-G), hepatosomatic index (I-H) and relative condition index (K-R) varied significantly with the reproductive season for females, and IG varied for males. The microscopic observation of the gonads showed that fecundity is likely determinate, with an asynchronous oocyte development before spawning and a clear ovarian bimodal organization after the onset of spawning. The oocyte density variance of 85% was explained by the oocyte diameter, which also offered support for the trait of determinate fecundity. Female weight explained 84% of the observed variance for fecundity. Liver storage seemed to be the primary source of energy for maturity, which suggests a combination of capital and income breeding. The results suggested a reproductive strategy of type A, with balanced trade-offs between survival, growth and reproduction. At present, no management measures are being directed to D. dentex; herein, we suggest a minimum landing size of 35 cm L-T to ensure a higher proportion of larger fish to preserve the stock.

AB  - Free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) provides a realistic, cost-effective method for evaluating the effects of supra-ambient CO2 concentrations on growth, development, yield, and water use of agricultural crops and natural ecosystems with very few of the problems normally associated with glasshouse or chamber type research. There are no walls interfering with incident radiation and no artificial constraints on rooting depth. With current FACE technology, CO2 enriched air is injected around the perimeter of circular plots and natural wind disperses the CO2 across the experimental area. Under stable, night-time wind conditions found in FACE wheat experiments at Maricopa, Arizona, the blowers used to inject CO2 exerted subtle effects on the microclimate in a manner analogous to wind machines used for orchard frost protection. Plots equipped with blowers had nighttime foliage and air temperatures that averaged 0.6-1.0 degrees C warmer than controls without blowers. A secondary effect of these elevated temperatures was that plots equipped with blowers displayed differences in dew duration (time that leaves were wet was reduced 30%), plant development (anthesis occurred 4 days earlier), and senescence [as measured with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)]. Natural wind and turbulence appear to overcome the blower effect during daytime treatments and on some nights. Aerial thermal imagery (8-12 mu m) acquired during the 1998 FACE experiment with grain sorghum provided additional evidence of the blower effect on canopy temperatures. Since increased plant tissue temperatures also occur when elevated CO2 induces partial stomatal closure and reduces transpiration, not all instances of canopy temperature elevation in CO2 enriched plots can be ascribed solely to the presence of blowers. It is concluded that proper controls for FACE facilities should have similar air hows to those used in the FACE plots. Advantages and disadvantages to nighttime CO2 enrichment are discussed.

AB  - The goal of the current study is to test the applicability of innovative ecological descriptors for assessment of the ecological status of transitional waters according to biological quality element benthic invertebrate fauna. The body size descriptors have been verified in relation to abiotic parameters of environment and the structure and disturbance of benthic communities. The assessment of ecological status performed by size descriptors has been compared with the assessment made by univariate and multivariate indices. The results showed that the size-based approach appears to be an objective taxonomic free method for assessment of the ecological status, trophic state and organic load of environment and for description of the ecological structure and disturbance of macrozoobenthic communities.

AB  - The physical condition of Isard (Rupicapra pyrenaica) during winter was estimated from 1984 to 1995 in two neighbouring sectors of the Pyrenees National Park on the basis of the body mass of both 152 captured individuals by means of footsnares and 37 fresh and whole carcases of dead animals. We found that the growth of isard ended at ca. 7 years old. The growing and the full growth animals having different energetic expenditures, these two categories were then considered separately. The body mass of captured isards was found not to be related to their sex or to the location. A strong linear relationship was observed for the growing animals between their body mass and the natural log-transformation of their age, more than the four fifths of the variability in body mass can be explained by age variation (r(2) = 0,814). Kids attain a body weight half that of their maximal weight at 8 months old. Significant differences in the physical condition of isards occurred between the years of capture. Nevertheless, growing and full growth animals may react differently in similar weather conditions, the first category being more affected by low temperatures and the second by steady snow on ground. Whatever the year of discovery, the carcases of dead animals weighted ca. 20 % less than the body mass of captured animals with similar age class.

AB  - In this paper, we identified seven ecological network analysis (ENA) metrics that, in our opinion, have high potential to provide useful and practical information for environmental decision-makers and stakeholders. Measurement and quantification of the network indicators requires that an ecosystem level assessment is implemented. The ENA metrics convey the status of the ecological system state variables, and mostly, the flows and relations between the various nodes of the network. The seven metrics are: 1) Average Path Length (APL), 2) Finn Cycling Index (FCI), 3) Mean Trophic level (MTL), 4) Detritivory to Herbivory ratio (D:H), 5) Keystoneness, 6) Structural Information (SI), and 7) Flow-based Information indices. The procedure for calculating each metric is detailed along with a short evaluation of their potential assessment of environmental status.

AB  - The current environmental state of Kotlin Island and coastal areas reflects the negative impact of industry, transport and urban utilities that has lead to increased heavy metal content in soils, in terrestrial and aquatic vegetation and in the water of the Gulf of Finland. Based on the analysis of pollutant metals in roots and shoots of native plants grown on Kotlin Island, species with high metal-accumulating capacity have been identified. Of these, there were dandelion and coltsfoot demonstrating high mobility in heavy metals, especially Zn, upward transfer. These could therefore be promising as bioindicators and phytoremediators of polluted areas pointing to origins of contamination. The presence of heavy metal contamination in the coastal waters of the gulf and its variability along the coastline is regarded as dependent on multiple sources of pollution associated with Kotlin Island, namely industrial and municipal waste waters, ship and vehicle traffic, aerosol deposits, contamination by dredging activity in a new port as well as the result of metals leaching from the soils of the island (Zn, Cu, Ni). Metal-accumulating coastal plants such as cane can be a source of secondary pollution of the gulf waters during their seasonal decomposition. The data showed significantly elevated concentrations of Ni, Zn and Cd in the hair of children living in the town of Kronstadt located on Kotlin Island that confirms the adequacy of the proposed indicating methodology and shows the unfavourable environmental situation in the region.

AB  - The Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (B-IBI) was developed and is currently employed for environmental assessment in Chesapeake Bay. The index consists of a variety of benthic community metrics (e.g. abundance, biomass, diversity, stress tolerance groups, etc.) scored by thresholds applied to seven benthic community habitats (tidal freshwater, oligohaline, low mesohaline, high mesohaline mud, high mesohaline sand, polyhaline mud, and polyhaline sand) This index was verified as being a sensitive and robust tool for summarizing the status of benthic communities. In our study we tested the classification efficiency of the index using new benthic data by characterizing each sample a priori as degraded or undegraded using criteria of sediment contaminant levels, bioassays and bottom dissolved oxygen levels. A primary objective of our study was to test the classification efficiency of the B-IBI in small water bodies connected to larger water bodies of the mainstems of the large rivers of Chesapeake Bay, as well as the efficiency of the index over time (1990 through 2009). The B-IBI was affected by the size of the water body, e.g., index accuracy was higher for water bodies in small watersheds in lower salinity habitats, whereas large water bodies of the mainstem of rivers were better classified by the B-IBI in habitats with higher salinities. Across the seven benthic habitat types overall correct classification was moderate to low and lower for correctly classifying undegraded sites. In general the index metrics showed some deficiencies that suggest improvements could be made by recalibrating existing metric thresholds or selecting new suitable metrics. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A study was conducted in November 1999 to assess sediment quality and condition of benthic fauna in the Neuse River Estuary (NRE), North Carolina, USA, following the passage of three Atlantic hurricanes during the two months prior. Samples for analysis of macroinfauna (> 0.5 mm sieve size), chemical contamination of sediments, and other abiotic environmental variables (salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, depth, sediment granulometry) were collected at 20 sites from the mouth of the Neuse River at Pamlico Sound to approximately 90 km upstream. Results were compared to those obtained from the same area in July 1998 using similar protocols. Depressed salinity, caused by extreme rainfall and associated high freshwater flow, persisted throughout much of the estuary, which had experienced periods of water-column stratification and hypoxia of underlying waters. Fifteen of the 20 sites, representing 299 km(2) (76% of the survey area), also showed signs of benthic stress based on a multi-metric benthic index of biotic integrity (B-IBI). Benthic impacts included reductions in the abundance, diversity, and numbers of species and shifts in taxonomic composition, with a notable increase in dominance of the opportunistic polychaete Mediomastus ambiseta as other former dominant species declined. There was no significant increase in the extent of chemical contamination compared to pre-hurricane conditions. Storm-related reductions in dissoved oxygen and salinity were the more likely causes of the observed benthic impacts, though it was not possible, based on these results, to separate storm effects from seasonal changes in the benthos and annual episodes of summer anoxia and hypoxia.

AB  - The evaluation of water resources quality is an important tool for controlling and monitoring water bodies, among which, the evaluation of toxic metal levels in benthic macroinvertebrates has been highlighted. This study aimed to evaluate the biological quality of the Alvorada and Mandaguari rivers and to evaluate the metal bioaccumulation by means of the metal concentrations in surface waters, bottom sediments and benthic macroinvertebrates. Samples of water, biological material and sediments were conducted at six sampling points, 3 points in each river during 12 months. Macroinvertebrates were sorted, identified and analysed from the biological metrics, BMWP' index and statistical analyses. The samples of benthic macroinvertebrates and sediments were submitted to nitroperchloric digestion for further determination of the metal content. The metal concentrations in sediment had become high in both rivers, reaching values of up to 1752.50 mg kg(-1) of Pb in point M1 and 53.80 mg kg(-1) of Cd in point M3. Macroinvertebrate tissues exhibited high levels of toxic metals, reaching values of 146.11 mg kg(-1) of Cr in point M1, 144.28 mg kg(-1) of Pb and 3.11 mg kg(-1) of Cd in point M3, which indicates the occurrence of bioaccumulation and insertion in the food chain. The results from the evaluation using the BMWP' index do not present the real conditions of the watersheds, which suggests a review of the evaluation method. In addition, the environmental evaluation using macroinvertebrates is a good tool to verify the impacts in a river.

AB  - Aquatic environments are the ultimate sink for most of anthropogenic pollutants. The Zayandeh Roud River is the most important river in the central Iranian Plateau, supplying water to a large population. In order to determine the potential occurrence and in vivo effects of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) with estrogenic or anti-androgenic properties we analyzed the wild populations of an extensively distributed endemic fish species, Petroleuciscus esfahani For this purpose, specimens were caught from two sites upstream and two sites downstream of the expected major anthropogenic pollution sources. P. esfahani full-length cDNAs for vitellogenin (vtg), with 4177 base pairs (bp) encoding a 1339 amino acids (aa), and for beta-actin (actb), with 1776 bp encoding a 375 aa, were amplified and cloned. Hepatic vtg mRNA expression levels were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Condition factor, gonadosomatic index and sex ratio were calculated and compared with vtg expression. Gonad histology was performed to study the possible presence of intersex condition. Detection of vtg transcripts in male individuals from the two downstream sampling sites supports the hypothesis of exposure to EDCs in these regions. Higher vtg expression in male individuals, together with reduced gonad size and condition factor, in specimens from the site located downstream of the major steel mill plant suggest a major endocrine disruption in this area.

AB  - This study analyzed monthly and inter-annual variability of mesoscale phenomena, including the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) climate indexes and wind intensity considering their influence on sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll a (Chl-a). These analyses were performed to determine the effects, if any, of climate indexes and oceanographic and environmental variability on the central and southern coastal ecosystem of Sonora in the Gulf of California (GC). Monthly satellite images of SST (degrees C) and Chl-a concentration were used with a 1-km resolution for oceanographic and environmental description, as well as monthly data of the climate indexes and wind intensity from 2002-2015. Significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed while analyzing the monthly variability results of mesoscale phenomena, SST and Chl-a, where the greatest percentage of anti-cyclonic gyres and filaments was correlated with a greater Chl-a concentration in the area of study, low temperatures and, thus, greater productivity. Moreover, the greatest percentage of intrusion was correlated with the increase in temperature and cyclonic gyres and a strong decrease of Chl-a concentration values, causing oligotrophic conditions in the ecosystem and a decrease in upwelling and filament occurrence. As for the analysis of the interannual variability of mesoscales phenomena, SST, Chl-a and winds, the variability between years was not significant (p > 0.05), so no correlation was observed between variabilities or phenomena. The results of the monthly analyses of climate indexes, environmental variables and wind intensity did not show significant differences for the ENSO and PDO indexes (p > 0.05). Nonetheless, an important correlation could be observed between the months of negative anomalies of the ENSO with high Chl-a concentration values and intense winds, as well as with low SST values. The months with positive ENSO anomalies were correlated with high SST values, low Chl-a concentration and moderate winds. Significant inter-annual differences were observed for climate indexes where the years with high SST values were related to the greatest positive anomaly of ENSO, of which 2002 and 2009 stood out, characterized as moderate Nino years, and 2015 as a strong El Nino year. The years with the negative ENSO anomaly were related to the years of lower SST values, of which 2007-2008 and 2010-2011 stood out, characterized as moderate Ninas. Thus, variability associated with mesoscale oceanographic phenomena and seasonal and inter-annual variations of climate indexes had a great influence on the environmental conditions of the coastal ecosystem of Sonora in the Gulf of California.

AB  - As the primary land use in the Karoo, extensive small-stock farming contributes significantly towards the agricultural economy of the region. However, the sustainability of this practice has been questioned for many years. This led to the establishment of a long-term stocking-density trial in 1988 at the Carnarvon Research Station. The trial was designed on a three-camp rotational grazing system under four stocking densities (8, 7, 5.5 and 4 ha SSU-1). Following continuous treatment over 28 years, the results from a once-off assessment in February 2016 portrayed no significant differences between treatments with regard to plant height, cover, species diversity, ecological and grazing index scores. Animal production varied among treatments where the mean production per hectare was found to be the highest under the high stocking-density treatment. Due to the absence of historical data, the results from this study are not conclusive with regards to changes in the vegetation dynamics over time and therefore does not lend itself to making conclusions concerning stocking densities. It can, however, be concluded that the vegetation of the Western Upper Karoo is remarkably resilient to the perceived higher stocking densities set at the time, on condition that an appropriate grazing management strategy is applied.

AB  - Environmental degradation is threatening biodiversity and ecosystem function globally. Mandating ecosystem-level protection in policy and legislative frameworks is essential to prevent biodiversity loss. Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 is the key legislative mechanism for supporting biodiversity at the national level, but has so far been ineffective at protecting habitat and ecological communities. Here we identify a major flaw in the current approach to listing threatened ecological communities (TECs): restrictive condition thresholds that threaten ecosystem function in dynamic ecosystems. Using two wetland TECs as a case study (Upland Wetlands and Coolibah-Black Box Woodlands), we argue that Australia's environmental legislation should adopt a landscape-scale approach to TEC protection that acknowledges ecosystem function, accounts for different states in temporally dynamic systems, and sustains landscape connectivity of TEC distribution. We present a state-and-transition model for each TEC to show how human activities affect the reference-state continuum of wet and dry phases. We also show that the current listed condition thresholds do not acknowledge alternative ecosystem states and exclude areas that may be important for restoration and conservation of the TEC at the landscape-scale. Description of alternative and transitional states for dynamic systems, including how, when and why ecological communities shift between different states, should be formally integrated into the TEC listing process to protect Australia's vulnerable ecosystems from further degradation and loss.

AB  - Dragonflies (Odonata: Anisoptera) are often used as indicators of habitat type and quality due to their varied use of aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Species differ in their preferences for lotic and lentic waters, but community changes across ecotones, or transitional zones between distinct habitats (e.g. lotic and lentic), are not well understood. We quantified dragonfly species richness, abundance, and composition along a gradient of habitat types, including streams, stream mouths (ecotones), and open waters (lakes and ponds). We tested if dragonfly assemblages in aquatic ecotones differ from adjacent stream and open water habitats, and how species respond to riparian forest cover across these habitat types. Adult dragonflies were sampled in all habitat types at four sites in southwest Ohio during the summer of 2016. Riparian canopy cover and relative densities of algal mats and emergent vegetation were recorded. We sampled 157 individuals of 12 dragonfly species and found significant differences in community composition between stream and ecotone habitats, both forming subsets of the open water community. Canopy cover explained 55% and 75% of abundance and species richness variance across habitat types, respectively, but these relationships were strongest at ecotones. Finally, the Odonata Index of Wetland Integrity (OIWI), which uses sensitivities of adult odonates to habitat disturbances to evaluate wetland conditions, showed that species composition at ecotones uniquely represents the ecological integrity of the entire wetland system. Thus, transition zones may provide an effective and more efficient alternative to rapidly assess wetland quality for conservation monitoring than sampling the entire wetland.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to assess risk in order to substantiate the economic and organizational efficiency of housing and industrial construction. The authors study methods related to quantifying environmental risk and making decisions under conditions of uncertainty. An algorithm for making sound decisions is proposed as a result of a quantitative analysis of the identified risks. A quantitative risk assessment of pessimistic and optimistic options for preventing environmental damage was made using the Monte Carlo method. The results of simulation modeling clearly illustrate the choice of the general principle of assessment and adoption of the optimal decision. The results of a sensitivity analysis are also presented to prove the hypothesis. This risk analysis technique has a computer implementation. The result of Monte Carlo modeling is a graphical representation of the log-normal probability distribution of possible outcomes of the preset emergency scenarios in the form of a curve on a scalable field of the estimated consequences. The model has reproduced the distribution derived from the evidence-based data selection. The Monte Carlo method is one of the scientifically based methods for analyzing the characteristics of a random process and making optimal decisions in order to reduce risk and minimize environmental damage. It could become the desired basis for interaction between the State Environmental Expert Review (SEER) and environmental impact assessment (EIA) in order to make sound decisions and actions in conditions of uncertainty and choosing environmentally friendly options for economic projects.

AB  - Researchers worldwide are studying the environmental distribution and impacts of manufactured or environmentally fragmented small pieces of plastics, so called microplastics (<5 mm). These microplastics eventually build up in the marine environment, threatening marine ecosystems. The magnitude, fate and effects of these microplastics across the food web are largely unknown. Here, we measured digested microplastics in a top predator and critically endangered species, the NorthEast Atlantic Porbeagle shark (Lamna nasus), and compared this with general health conditions. A method for quantifying microplastics in spiral valves of porbeagle sharks was developed. Microplastics were detected in all spiral valves, up to 10.4 particles per g wet weight (w.w.) content and 9.5 particles per g w.w. tissue. This equates to individual microplastics loads as high as 3850 particles per spiral valve, most likely a result of trophic transfer. No statistically significant correlations were found between the average number of plastic particles in spiral valve content and tissue and the Condition and Hepatosomatic Index of porbeagle sharks. The results of this research show that North-East Atlantic porbeagle sharks ingest and digest microplastics and that there is a potential for microplastic biomonitoring using this species. More research is needed to detect possible health effects of microplastic contamination in these apex predators.

AB  - The evaluation of the air quality in light shafts requires a specific study of its air renewal ability due to building shape, dimensions and other external conditions. This research has studied the capacity of light shafts to provide natural ventilation through the air change efficiency concept. A methodology based on the limitation of the computational urban domain is used to adapt the indoor air change efficiency index for outdoor environments. Numerical simulations were performed using CFD and a model that was experimentally validated.
   The aim is to evaluate the effect of the centreline building width and light shaft dimensions in the air change quality within several wind climates. Results would provide a numerically proven tool for designers, summarised in some design-based strategies in order to select which one improves the air change quality.
   The results indicate that the light shaft dimension perpendicular to the wind direction has a negligible effect on efficiency. For the range of wind velocities studied (0.75-9.00 m/s), the efficiency decreases at higher velocities, up to -7.41% with respect to the mean. For variations in the wind velocity and the centreline building width, a mean variation of +/-18.77% in the efficiency is obtained.
   Practical applications: The present methodology defines a proceeding to numerically evaluate the air change efficiency in light shafts inside different dimensional cases of buildings within several urban wind conditions.

AB  - A pressure-state-response framework was customized to outline the watershed health (WH) concept. To achieve this, the watershed indicators of pressure, state (S), and response (R) were conceptualized according to 17 climatic, anthropogenic, and hydrologic criteria. Four node years of 1986, 1998, 2008, and 2014 were selected to provide a running picture of the Shazand Watershed condition. The WH index was then calculated using geometric mean of pressure, S, and R indicators and assigned a range of values varied from 0 (unhealthiest) to 1 (healthiest). (a) The main pressures on the Shazand Watershed come from climatic factors in 1998 and 2008 and human factors in all study years. (b) The climatic factor and then anthropogenic factors had the maximum effectiveness in explaining the S indicator. (c) In calculating R indicator, the anthropogenic factors in 1986 and the hydrologic factors in other study years played significant contributions. (d) The greatest percentage of the study area were assigned to moderate condition of S indicator in 1986, 1998, and 2008 with value of 42, 46, and 73%, respectively, whereas in 2014, 44 and 42% of the watershed were respectively recognized as relatively healthy and moderately healthy in terms of S indicator. (e) For the first to fourth study node years, some 53, 77, 78, and 60% of the Shazand Watershed had the relatively unhealthy condition, respectively. (f) The Shazand WH decreased about 12% during periods of 1986-1998 and 1986-2008. (g) An improving trend was also found in WH for some sub-watersheds.

AB  - Droughts are amongst the most destructive natural disasters in the world. In large regions of Africa, where water is a limiting factor and people strongly rely on rain-fed agriculture, droughts have frequently led to crop failure, food shortages and even humanitarian crises. In eastern and southern Africa, major drought episodes have been linked to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. In this context and with limited in-situ data available, remote sensing provides valuable opportunities for continent-wide assessment of droughts with high spatial and temporal resolutions. This study aimed to monitor agriculturally relevant droughts over Africa between 2000-2016 with a specific focus on growing seasons using remote sensing-based drought indices. Special attention was paid to the observation of drought dynamics during major ENSO episodes to illuminate the connection between ENSO and droughts in eastern and southern Africa. We utilized Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)-based Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) with 0.25 degrees resolution and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) with 500 m resolution as indices for analysing the spatio-temporal patterns of droughts. We combined the drought indices with information on the timing of site-specific growing seasons derived from MODIS-based multi-annual average of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We proved the applicability of SPI-3 and VCI as indices for a comprehensive continental-scale monitoring of agriculturally relevant droughts. The years 2009 and 2011 could be revealed as major drought years in eastern Africa, whereas southern Africa was affected by severe droughts in 2003 and 2015/2016. Drought episodes occurred over large parts of southern Africa during strong El Nino events. We observed a mixed drought pattern in eastern Africa, where areas with two growing seasons were frequently affected by droughts during La Nina and zones of unimodal rainfall regimes showed droughts during the onset of El Nino. During La Nina 2010/2011, large parts of cropland areas in Somalia (88%), Sudan (64%) and South Sudan (51%) were affected by severe to extreme droughts during the growing seasons. However, no universal El Nino- or La Nina-related response pattern of droughts could be deduced for the observation period of 16 years. In this regard, we discussed multi-year atmospheric fluctuations and characteristics of ENSO variants as further influences on the interconnection between ENSO and droughts. By utilizing remote sensing-based drought indices focussed on agricultural zones and periods, this study attempts to contribute to a better understanding of spatio-temporal patterns of droughts affecting agriculture in Africa, which can be essential for implementing strategies of drought hazard mitigation.

AB  - This study evaluates the Black Sea anchovy population infected by parasitic Ascaridoid Nematode larva in the Southern Black Sea. It assesses the larva's effect on fish body condition, energy stored in the body, and anchovy growth. For this, anchovies sampled on July 10-31, 2018, from 30 different stations were examined, and 11.8% of the 825 anchovies were found infected. The observed infection rate was higher on the western side of the study area, suggesting that this rate may be used as a biomarker for the western stock. Age and size of the anchovies play a significant role in the prevalence. Both of the fish well-being indicators (condition and hepatosomatic index) were lower in the parasitized fish. It may support the view that the larva weakened its paratenic host against its predator to facilitate its transfer to a definite host. The observed low infection rate, which is not considered an economic threat to fisheries, is linked to the warm-affinity of the anchovy. Moreover, considering the trophic role of the anchovy in the ecosystem, it is very likely that the infestation rate at the upper trophic levels is higher than that of anchovy. Therefore, a better understanding of the life cycle of the Nematodes in the Black Sea, their hosts in their life cycle, and the consequences of climate change is essential.

AB  - Background: Studies carried out in the last decade identified an evident environmental disturbance of the Chicu river on the basis of demographic increase in the zone and activities as agriculture and livestock rearing that exert anthropic pressure over the water source through waste water discharges. Goals: Determine the water quality of the Chicu river with the help of biotic indexes (BMWP, ASPT and ABI) based on aquatic macroinvertebrates and analyze their relationship with physical and chemical parameters monitored in the same biological sampling sites. Methods: Sampling took place in four sites distributed along the river and in three intensity-based rainy seasons (low-rain season, middle-rain season, and high-rain season). Biotic indexes (BMWP-Col, ASPT and ABI), and diversity indexes were calculated, and physicochemical parameters in the water were analyzed. Canonical Correspondence Analysis were applied to determine the correlation between indexes, families and parameters. Results: Nine orders, 16 families and 7,094 individuals were identified in the sampling sites, it was found that the highest abundance of individuals belongs to the families Sphaeriidae (49,71%) and Physidae (21,83%). The values of the indexes BMWP and ABI showed that the water quality averaged from "moderately polluted" to "strongly polluted"; canonical correspondence analysis showed a specific grouping of dissolved oxygen and pH with some identified families. Conclusions: Water quality in the Chicu river had a decreasing trend from the high (site 1 of sampling) to the low zone (site 4 of sampling) of the basin. The parameters dissolved oxygen and pH are the ones that reflect a higher sensitivity to adaptability of some families of aquatic macroinvertebrates in the river.

AB  - The research presented here is focused on assessment of potential territorial risk in the East part of Ukraine, where the military conflict has been going on for five years. Such kind of risk can be classed as a complex risk level of hazardous facilities or territories. This study determines the boundaries of territorial risk distribution with defined levels of danger. The practical implementation is reflected in the web-based geographic information system (web-GIS) for displaying environmental information in Donetsk and Luhansk regions in real time. The research defines an opportunity for further practical application of this development considering the military conflict in the Donbas. The Donbas Environmental Information System (DEIS) is an interactive map of Donetsk and Luhansk Regions. It was developed within the framework of the Project "Environmental Assessment and Recovery Priorities for Eastern Ukraine" by the OSCE Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine upon the request of the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources of Ukraine. The supporting of the system is carried out by the State Ecological Academy of Postgraduate Education and Management (DEA) of the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources of Ukraine, in particular the Center for Environmental and Resource Restoration of the Donbas within the framework of the Project of the OSCE Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine "Assisting the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources of Ukraine in improving environmental monitoring mechanisms". The main task of this study is to implement the software for collecting, processing and visualization of the information about the environment and factors that may affect it. This will make it possible to increase the effectiveness of environmental management in order to meet the environmental safety requirements in Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

AB  - The fire danger (FD) defines the conditions less or more favourable for a fire ignition success and its propagation. FD indexes, that integrates environmental variables related to FD in more or less complex equations and systems, are widely used in wildfire prone countries for both scientific and operational purposes. Assessing the performance of FD indexes is challenging and this issue is quite debated within the fire community, which has been trying to apply several methodologies to evaluate FD indexes. The main aim of this work is to give a contribution to this effort. The analysis was conducted using data from a fire-prone Mediterranean area (Sardinia island, Italy), where 8 FD indexes were evaluated and compared using different statistical approaches. We calculated the daily FD values for the period 2000-2007 over the study area. A set of statistical tools (namely Spearman rank correlation, Index Value Distribution and Percentile Analysis, and Logistic Regression) were applied to evaluate the performance of each FD index by comparing FD values with fire occurrence indicators. The statistical tests revealed a large variability in FD indexes performance, depending also on fire activity conditions. Our results showed that two of the tested FD indexes reached a good overall performance. Findings from this study can help both the scientific community and local fire managers, supporting the evaluation of early warning systems and fire prevention strategies in the Mediterranean Basin.

AB  - In order to protect the environment, type II errors, e.g. a species is not listed as endangered (H0) when it is in fact endangered (H1), are avoided at the risk of making a type I error. However, it is almost impossible to determine if management efforts have been efficient or if many type II errors have occurred. Applying the precautionary principle to environmental protection without full scientific certainty requires a new academic code for scientists. If we manage ecosystems or bioresources under uncertainty, we need to incorporate new knowledge (accountability) and to change actions with ecosystem states (adaptability). This is called adaptive management. The extinction risk of exploited species under adaptive management is much lower than that under constant exploitation. The revised management procedure (RMP) in whaling and the deer management program in Hokkaido, Japan, share the merit of adaptive management. Under the RMP, the period allowed in considering the extinction risk of the southern hemisphere minke whale is far too long. Population management of over-abundant deer threatened endangered eagles, because of lead contamination from bullets. Although the effect of lead contamination on the extinction risk of eagles was uncertain, the Hokkaido Government prohibited the use of lead bullets in deer hunting. When designing management programs, it is also important to consider cost-benefit measures in the ecological risks. The value of biodiversity is often much higher than the economic benefit from exploiting the bioresource by agriculture, forestry or fisheries. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB  - We analyzed changes in land cover in the Sierra de San Javier and its surroundings, an area of ca. 70 000 ha near San Miguel de Tucuman, an urban center of ca. 1 million people in subtropical Argentina. The analysis covered two periods: 1949-1972 and 1972-2006 using remote sensing techniques. For the year 2001, we mapped the patterns of distribution of secondary forests dominated by the most abundant exotic tree species (Ligustrum lucidum). Based on land-cover maps, we estimated sediment yield as an index of watershed condition. Urban area was growing during the whole study period. Between 1949 and 2006, forest area increased approximately 1400 ha, mostly over abandoned agriculture and grasslands; this expansion was accelerated between 1972 and 2006. Increased forest cover resulted in a reduction in erosion and sediment yield that was disproportionately large, as most new forests are located in areas of steep slopes and high rainfall. By 2001, Ligustum-dominated forests had expanded to more than 500 ha, in the southern portion of the sierra only. Overall, the analysis quantifies a process of Neotropical peri-urban forest transition, likely associated with socioeconomic changes related to population urbanization, that promotes improvements of some environmental services, such as watershed and biodiversity conservation. However, natural communities are strongly affected by past land use and neighboring urban areas, which have promoted a growing importance of exotic species with mostly unknown ecological consequences.

AB  - Background Tuta absoluta Meyrick 1917 (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) is an invasive, pesticide resistant, and a major treat of tomato production in the world. It needs effective management options that naturally infect the insect without causing any identified side effects. Entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) are the most important options. However, geographic origin and climatic condition apparently creates genetic variation among EPF strains that influence on their pathogenicity. Thus, screening of effective EPF strains from the local source is vital to develop environmental friendly pest control tactic for T. absoluta. Results In this study, 27 indigenous Beauveria were isolated from the various types of soil and 12 of the isolates were screened based on their biological efficiency index (BEI). These isolates scored 65.7-95.7% and 68.3-95% of mortality against second and third instar larvae of T. absoluta at concentration of 1 x 10(7)spores center dot ml(-1) in 7 days post inoculation, respectively. Out of these, five (18.5%) isolates scored above 90% mortality on both instar larvae with LT50 value of 3.33 to 5.33 days at the lowest (10(4) spores center dot ml(-1)) and 1.93 to 3.17 days at highest (10(8) spores center dot ml(-1)) spore concentrations and has LC50 value of 1.5 x 10(3) to 1.1x 10(5) spores center dot ml(-1). Moreover, isolates exhibited the promising mortality better (1.5 x 10(6) to 3.5 x 10(7) spores center dot ml(-1)), sporulated over the larval cadavers, well grown at optimal temperature, and produced chitinolytic enzymes. Molecular analysis showed that isolates have nearly monophyletic characters and grouped under species of Beauveria bassiana. Conclusion Different types of soil in Ethiopia are an important source of B. bassiana, and these isolates showed promising pathogenicity against T. absoluta, which is crucial for ecofriendly biopesticide development. Although isolates were nearly monophyletic in phylogenetic study, five of them were highly effective in the laboratory bioassays against T. absoluta; however, further field evaluation is required for mass production.

AB  - AimsAcross tropical regions, large forest areas have been converted to different agricultural land uses. These uses impose ecological disturbances affecting forest regeneration potential after field abandonment. Finding ways to identify those agricultural land uses limiting forest regeneration is a critical issue for conserving biodiversity in human-modified landscapes. Here, we developed a fast and inexpensive index, useful for quantifying ecological disturbance regimes associated with agricultural land uses, and tested its power to predict forest regeneration potential.
   LocationMunicipality of Marques de Comillas, southeast Mexico.
   MethodsInterviews were conducted with local farmers to quantify disturbance components (size, duration and severity) associated with agricultural land uses. The scaled values of these disturbance components were added in a simple ecological disturbance index (EDI). In each one of nine recently abandoned fields representing a wide range of EDI values, two 10-m(2) plots, one close to and one far from nearby forest remnants, were established. On each plot, all woody plants of 10-100m in height were counted, identified and measured in four 1-m(2) subplots, at the time of field abandonment and 2yr later. In addition, at each plot, 18 site condition (microclimate and soil) attributes were quantified at the time of abandonment. Plant density, biomass, species richness and species diversity were used as regeneration variables, and EDI and site condition attributes as independent ones.
   ResultsTwo years after abandonment, most regeneration variables declined exponentially with EDI. Biomass was not explained by EDI but changed positively with light availability. EDI was strongly correlated to vapour pressure deficit, which also predicted regeneration potential (except biomass).
   ConclusionsEDI is a cheap and easy tool for quantifying the ecological disturbance produced by a wide range of agricultural land uses. The index predicted several regeneration variables as well as or better than direct measurements of the site condition at the time of abandonment. EDI can be used to identify biodiversity-friendly agricultural land uses in human-modified landscapes.

In the study carried out between April 2018 and March 2019, 276 sharpsnout seabream were sampled and the average length and weight were calculated as 30.0 cm and 463.9 g, respectively. Male and female ratio was determined as 1:1.32 (P>0.05). Age of fish varied between 0-9 years. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters were L-infinity=48.1 cm, k=0.2656 year(-1) and t(0)=-1.6587 year for all individuals. The LWR was found as W=0.0399 L-2.7212 for all individuals. Total mortality rate (Z=0.560), natural mortality rate (M=0.501) and fishing mortality rate (F=0.059), growth performance index (phi'=2.73) and condition factor value (K=1.55) were calculated. The maximum GSI value was 6.83 in September. Mean relative fecundity was calculated as 14695.4 eggs / 1g. The mean egg diameter was calculated as 486.83 1..tm. This study is very important in terms of being the first study on this species in the Black Sea and will provide a source for future studies.

AB  - The concept of ecosystem services has helped rationalize humanity's dependence on and benefits from nature, pushing the paradigm of environmental sustainability from a charity in the direction of a necessity. However, globally many ecosystem services are declining despite their eminent value for society. A prime cause of this decline is allocated to land use change. While the body of empirical research showing various consequences of land use is growing, and the ecosystem service concept has helped make trade-offs more graspable, a lucid approach that neatly summarizes the extent of land use trade-offs is still lacking.
   In this paper, we introduce a rapid assessment to analyze both the state and trends of selected ecosystem services associated with given land use categories. Theoretically, the assessment can be performed for any given spatial unit, but the regional to national level appears to be the most appropriate spatial resolution. Each land use-ecosystem service relationship is classified from a strong disservice to a strong service. The results are displayed in adapted flower diagrams, which legibly display information on the ecosystem services in each land use, thus clearly summarizing trade-offs associated with changing land use.
   We illustrate this rapid ecosystem service assessment method by applying it to three land use categories on the spatial extent of Switzerland. We found that the simple but systematic approach is more flexible than traditional mapping approaches, i.e. it allowed us to combine a variety of spatially non-explicit but highly detailed indicators with spatially explicit indicators. Also, we were able to proceed faster than with a mapping approach, where many known and unknown spatial inaccuracies may arise have allowed. This flexible incorporation of spatially explicit and non-explicit data provides high quality information on the state and trends of ecosystem services at regional to national extents. For that reason, we are convinced that the rapid assessment method has the potential to advance knowledge of ecosystem services and land use trade-offs, especially in areas with low data availability and monitoring activity.

AB  - The study was accomplished to identify the factors determining land conversion in Bangladesh and evaluate farmers' perception about the changing land use decision. Data were collected from Mymensingh, Rajshahi and Khulna districts of Bangladesh. A total of 300 sample farmers were interviewed following purposive and random sampling technique. For analyzing data, a combination of descriptive, mathematical and statistical techniques were used. Descriptive statistics showed that average household and farm size of the farmers were 5.0 and 0.47 hectare, respectively. Percentage perception index demonstrated that most of the respondents experienced climatic changes having negative impacts on agricultural activities. Agreement index depicted that natural calamities caused stern damage to respondents' cultivable land, assets, agricultural enterprises and basic livelihood necessities. From the result of Logit model it was found that farming experience, disaster loss, farmer's educational level, annual income, access to credit, farmer's age and saline water intrusion were the significant determinants of changing land use decision in the study areas. Farmers' livelihood assets namely, human, social, financial, natural and physical capitals were improved to a noticeable extent after their land shifting decision. The study recommended that training provision, motivational programmes and extension contact should be properly implemented by the government as well as non-government organizations to aware the farmers about pros and cons of land conversion and to choose the best land use decision for livelihood improvement.

AB  - Boat Harbour, located in Pictou County, Nova Scotia, Canada has been receiving industrial effluent wastewater from a nearby kraft pulp mill and chlor-alkali plant for over 50 years. Before receiving industrial effluent wastewater, the tidal estuary was culturally significant to the nearby Pictou Landing First Nation community. The tidal estuary was known for its medicinal, recreational, ceremonial, and subsistence functions. Formally a 140-ha natural tidal estuary, raw industrial wastewater was discharged into Boat Harbour beginning in 1967. Since inception, effluent treatment has undergone several upgrades in aeration capacity within the Boat Harbour Effluent Treatment Facility (BHETF) until the cessation of effluent discharge in 2020. Fifty years of industrial wastewater effluent discharge has resulted in widespread inorganic and organic contamination of unconsolidated sediments and surface water. Primary contaminants of concern include metals, dioxins and furans, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The province of Nova Scotia has committed to the remediation of the BHETF, estimated to cost over $292 million CAD. The goal of the remediation program is to return Boat Harbour to its natural state as a tidal estuary to restore the historical, traditional, and recreational uses of the land. Remediation components and alternatives were rated based on technical (26%), environmental (24%), economic (22%), social (14%), and regulatory (14%) weighted indicators. Criteria weighting for the five indicator categories was determined collaboratively with stakeholders. For each design component of remediation, a list of approaches was developed along with subsequent alternatives. Approaches and alternatives were screened to eliminate options that were not technically feasible or did not align with remediation goals. The remaining feasible concepts underwent detailed review and evaluation to select Qualified Remedial Options to be shared with stakeholders for input.

AB  - Critical transitions between alternate ecosystem states are often preceded by increased variance and autocorrelation in time series of ecosystem properties. Analogous changes may occur in spatial statistics as ecosystems approach thresholds for critical transitions. Changes in spatial statistics near thresholds have been described using models, laboratory experiments, and remotely sensed data, but there have been no tests using deliberate manipulations of whole ecosystems in the field. We previously documented a whole-lake manipulation resulting in a transition to predator dominance, a type of critical transition. The food web of an experimental lake was forced via cascading trophic interactions from a stable state characterized by abundant prey fish, small zooplankton, and high chlorophyll concentrations to an alternative state dominated by predatory fish, large zooplankton and low chlorophyll concentrations. Time series of zooplankton and chlorophyll concentrations provided early warning of the regime shift. Here we test if similar early warning signals were present in space by applying spatial variance and the discrete Fourier transform to spatially distributed prey fish catch data from this regime shift. Prey fish spatial distributions were monitored daily using minnow traps deployed around the lake perimeter. Added predators reduced prey fish populations and altered their spatial distributions. Increases in spatial variance and shifts to low frequency spatial variance were observed up to a year in advance of the shift. There was no response in an adjacent reference lake.

AB  - The remarkable swarming of black triggerfish Melichthys niger (Balistidae) on oceanic islands led us to undertake a comparative ecological study of high-density and low-density populations of this unusual circumtropical species. Abundance, distribution, and aggressive encounters were recorded in the field from the high-density Johnston Atoll (JA) population, the low-density Belize (BE) population, and a local high-density aggregation from Puerto Rico (PR). JA and PR populations of M. niger occurred at significantly higher densities and were more aggregated than in BE. Intraspecific aggression (chases/min/fish) was an order of magnitude higher in BE than in JA, while interspecific aggression was similar among sites. Size frequency, growth rate, diet composition, body condition (liver-somatic index LSI) were assessed from collected specimens. JA grew more slowly than BE as determined by back-calculations from dorsal spine rings, suggesting density-dependent growth limitation. Size frequency analysis reflected this difference with significantly more large fish in the BE sample. Maximum age of triggerfish in both populations was estimated at 11 years, and 35-40% of growth occurred in the first year. Diet composition was similar in all three locations and indicated broad omnivory. Percent organic composition of gut contents (food quality measure) and LSI (body condition assay) were both significantly higher in the PR population, but no difference was detected between JA and BE. An increase in consumption of algae on the degraded PR reef may explain this pattern.

AB  - We developed, tested, and applied an index of biological integrity (IBI) for fish and amphibian assemblages in coldwater streams of the Oregon and Washington Coast Range. A probability sample of 104 wadeable sites was quantitatively sampled for fish and amphibian assemblages as well as physical and chemical habitat from 1994 to 1996. Natural gradients and anthropogenic disturbances were assessed by examining digital data for catchment-scale road density and vegetation cover, along with site-scale physical and chemical habitat data. A set of 109 candidate metrics was evaluated for variance properties, redundancy, and responsiveness to multiple measures of disturbance, resulting in the selection of eight metrics for the index. The IBI itself was subsequently evaluated for variance and responsiveness to disturbance, then compared against an independently selected set of 101 reference sites that had minimal anthropogenic disturbance. Our IBI was fairly precise, with an among-stream variance-residual variance (sampling time, measurement error, and crew error) ratio of 4.0 (indicating a theoretical maximum correlation of 0.80 between the IBI and a predictor variable with a similar ratio). The IBI was significantly correlated with multiple estimates of anthropogenic disturbance, and reference sites had significantly higher IBI scores than the nonreference sites. Low IBI scores were associated with low bed stability, instream cover, and riparian cover and structural complexity but high percent fine substrate, road density, and human disturbances of riparian areas. Applying this IBI we assessed fish assemblage condition in the Coast Range, inferring our results to all mapped (1:100,000-scale) wadeable streams in this region. Using 2 SDs from the reference sites mean as a biological criterion, 45% of stream kilometers (10,646 km) were classified as impaired. High IBI scores clustered near national parks and wilderness areas. Our results indicate that minimally disturbed regional reference sites and probability survey designs, which produce statistically representative sites and inferences with known confidence bounds, offer considerable advantages over least disturbed reference sites and hand-picked survey sites for making regional ecological assessments.

AB  - Poverty at the national and sub-national level is commonly mapped on the basis of household surveys. Typical poverty metrics like the head count index are not able to identify its underlaying factors, particularly in rural economies based on subsistence agriculture. This paper relates agro-ecological marginality identified from regional and global datasets including remote sensing products like the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and rainfall to rural agricultural production and food consumption in Burkina Faso. The objective is to analyze poverty patterns and to generate a fine resolution poverty map at the national scale. We compose a new indicator from a range of welfare indicators quantified from Georeferenced household surveys, indicating a spatially varying set of welfare and poverty states of rural communities. Next, a local spatial regression is used to relate each welfare and poverty state to the agro-ecological marginality. Our results show strong spatial dependency of welfare and poverty states over agro-ecological marginality in heterogeneous regions, indicating that environmental factors affect living conditions in rural communities. The agro-ecological stress and related marginality vary locally between rural communities within each region. About 58% variance in the welfare indicator is explained by the factors of rural agricultural production and 42% is explained-by the factor of food-consumption. We found that the spatially explicit approach based on multi-temporal remote sensing products effectively summarizes information on poverty and facilitates further interpretation of the newly developed welfare indicator. The proposed method was validated with poverty incidence obtained from national surveys. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The adsorption of CH3F, CH3Cl and CH3Br halomethanes on pristine boron nitride (BNNS), aluminum-doped boron nitride (BN(Al)NS) and Gallium-doped boron nitride (BN(Ga)NS) nanosheets were investigated by two-dimensional periodic boundary condition density functional theory methods. All nanosheets were geometrically optimized at B3LYP/6-311 + G (d) level, and single point energy calculation at M06-2X, omega B97X-D3 and CAM-B3LYP/6-311 + G(d) levels of theory were also performed. NBO and QTAIM analyses were also performed, and values of the Wiberg bond index (WBI), partial natural charges and donor-acceptor interactions were further analyzed. The obtained adsorption energy values (E-ads) indicate that the tendency of nanosheets to adsorb CH3F and CH3Br to their surfaces are in the order of BN(Ga) NS > BN(Al)NS> BNNS. However, for CH3Cl, which adsorb with a significant lower E-ads compared to the other halomethanes, this trend is as follows: BN(Al)NS> BN(Ga)NS > BNNS. Moreover, it was found that, the affinity of halomethanes to adsorb onto the surface of nanosheets is in the order of CH3Br > CH3F >> CH3Cl. Generally, it seems that BN(Al)NS and BN(Ga)NS are promising candidates in designing a new type of solid state halomethane gas sensors. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - One of the well-known strategies for anion sensing is an indicator (dye) displacement assay. However, the disadvantage of the dye displacement assays is the low sensitivity due to the excess of the dye used. To overcome this setback, we have developed an "Intramolecular Indicator Displacement Assay (IIDA)". The IIDAs comprise a receptor and a spacer with an attached anionic chromophore in a single-molecule assembly. In the resting state, the environment-sensitive anionic chromophore is bound by the receptor, while the anionic substrate competes for binding into the receptor. The photophysical properties of the dye exhibit change in fluorescence when displaced by anions, which results in cross-reactive response. To illustrate the concept, we have prepared IID sensors 1 and 2. Here, the characterization of sensors and microtiter arrays comprising the IIDA are reported. The microtiter array including IID sensors 1 and 2 is capable of recognizing biological phosphates in water. The utility of the IIDA approach is demonstrated on sensing of a phosphonate herbicide glyphosate and other biologically important anions such as pyrophosphate in the presence of interferent sodium chloride.

AB  - We investigate a simplified model of the strange stars in the framework of Finslerian geometry, composed of charged fluid. It is considered that the fluid consisting of three flavor quarks including a small amount of non-interacting electrons to maintain the chemical equilibrium and assumed that the fluid is compressible by nature. To obtain the simplified form of the charged strange star we have considered constant flag curvature. Based on geometry, we have developed the field equations within the localized charge distribution. We consider that the strange quarks distributed within the stellar system are complied with the MIT bag model type of equation of state (EOS) and the charge distribution within the system follows a power law. We represent the exterior spacetime by the Finslerian Ressiner-Nordstrom space-time. The maximum anisotropic stress is obtained at the surface of the system. Whether the system is in equilibrium or not, has been examined with respect to the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation, Herrera cracking concept, different energy conditions and adiabatic index. We obtain that the total charge is of the order of 10(20) C and the corresponding electric field is of around 10(22) V/m. The central density and central pressure vary inversely with the charge. Varying the free parameter (charge constant) of the model, we find the generalized mass-radius variation of strange stars and determine the maximum limited mass with the corresponding radius. Furthermore, we also considered the variation of mass and radius against central density respectively.

AB  - There is a growing need for cyberinfrastructure to support science-based decision making in management of natural resources. In particular, our motivation was to aid the development of cyberinfrastructure for Integrated Ecosystem Assessments (IEAs) for marine ecosystems. The IEA process involves analysis of natural and socio-economic information based on diverse and disparate sources of data, requiring collaboration among scientists of many disciplines and communication with other stakeholders. Here we describe our bottom-up approach to developing cyberinfrastructure through a collaborative process engaging a small group of domain and computer scientists and software engineers. We report on a use case evaluated for an Ecosystem Status Report, a multi-disciplinary report inclusive of Earth, life, and social sciences, for the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem. Ultimately, we focused on sharing workflows as a component of the cyberinfrastructure to facilitate collaboration and reproducibility. We developed and deployed a software environment to generate a portion of the Report, retaining traceability of derived datasets including indicators of climate forcing, physical pressures, and ecosystem states. Our solution for sharing workflows and delivering reproducible documents includes IPython (now Jupyter) Notebooks. We describe technical and social challenges that we encountered in the use case and the importance of training to aid the adoption of best practices and new technologies by domain scientists. We consider the larger challenges for developing end-to-end cyberinfrastructure that engages other participants and stakeholders in the IEA process.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine if the accuracy and precision of wetland plant indices of biological integrity (IBIs) could be improved through the use of modeling techniques. To do this, we developed a modeled vegetation IBI (MVIBI) based on metrics previously used to develop vegetation indices of biological integrity (VIBIs) for Ohio wetlands (e.g. % invasive grass, % sensitive species, shrub richness). We selected 82 emergent, forested, and shrub-dominated reference sites distributed across the State of Ohio and built Random Forest models to predict plant metric scores at reference wetlands from naturally occurring environmental features related to climate, hydrology, geology, soils, and landscape position. The models explained between 14 and 52% of the variance in the scores of 21 metrics indicating that variation in wetland plant assemblages was significantly associated with naturally occurring environmental gradients. We used principal component analysis to identify ten groups of statistically independent metrics and selected one metric from each group that discriminated most strongly between reference and most degraded sites based on t-scores. Two axes did not contain discriminating metrics so we used eight metrics in the MVIBI. Analysis of variance of reference site MVIBI scores indicated that we could use one distribution of reference site scores to assess multiple wetland types, thus eliminating the need to separately designate wetland types. We used the MVIBI to assess 170 test sites and compared the accuracy, precision, responsiveness, and sensitivity of the MVIBI to those of the original VIBIs. The MVIBI was up to twice as accurate and precise as the original VIBIs, indicating that modeling can be used to improve the performance of vegetation-based IBIs. The use of model-based IBIs for wetland plants should reduce assessment errors associated with natural variation in plant metrics and should increase confidence in wetland assessments.

AB  - Abrupt transitions leading to algal blooms are quite well known in aquatic ecosystems and have important implications for the environment. These ecosystem shifts have been largely attributed to nutrient dynamics and food web interactions. Contamination with heavy metals such as copper can modulate such ecological interactions which in turn may impact ecosystem functioning. Motivated by this, we explored the effect of copper enrichment on such regime shifts in planktonic systems. We integrated copper contamination to a minimal phytoplankton-zooplankton model which is known to demonstrate abrupt transitions between ecosystem states. Our results suggest that both the toxic and deficient concentration of copper in water bodies can lead to regime shift to an algal-dominated alternative stable state. Further, interaction with fish density can also lead to collapse of population cycles thus leading to algal domination in the intermediate copper ranges. Environmental stochasticity may result in state transition much prior to the tipping point and there is a significant loss in the bimodality on increasing intensity and redness of noise. Finally, the impending state shifts due to contamination cannot be predicted by the generic early warning indicators unless the transition is close enough. Overall the study provides fresh impetus to explore regime shifts in ecosystems under the influence of anthropogenic changes like chemical contamination.

AB  - Two Ecopath mass-balance models are built to describe the structural and functional ecosystems of Laizhou Bay (LZB) for 2014-2015 and Haizhou Bay (HZB) for 2011-2012. This is the first comparative study to analyze the similarities and differences between these two bays using ecological indicators estimated from a food web model. A comparison between the two models highlights similar characteristics in trophic functioning: zooplankton and shrimps as the structuring groups are important organisms enabling the pelagic-benthic coupling in the two ecosystems; and top-down effects are the main mechanism of control within the two ecosystems. Analysis of differences between the two ecosystems indicates that: (1) the ecological size (total system throughput, TST), total exports/TST and ecosystem efficiencies are bigger in LZB; (2) the bottom-up controls from the benthos, shrimps and zooplankton are enhanced in LZB; and (3) the ecosystem state is less mature but more stable in LZB. These differences can be attributed, at least in part, to the effects of sea ranching of low trophic-level species, such as shellfish and the holothurian Stichopus japonicus, in LZB. Analysis of similarities and differences may benefit the ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management in different ecosystems.

AB  - Two different methods to predict biotic integrity were tested and compared in the present paper. The first one tries to predict the fish indices of biotic integrity (IBI) at the state or regional scale based on the most similar observations to a specific target site of interest using the simple to implement k-nearest neighbors (or kNN) method. Two different distance functions were considered to find the k-nearest neighbors: the Euclidean and the Mahalanobis. The second method was applied on the same datasets and consisted of a step-wise multiple regression. The two modeling approaches yielded similar results but kNN proved to be more time-efficient and very fast computationally for the given dataset sizes, which allowed applying a leave-one-out cross validation.
   In an attempt to reveal the importance of scale in the prediction of IBI, regression models were constructed at the state (or regional) scale and at the more refined cluster of sampling sites scale. Clusters of sites were extracted using Kohonen's self-organizing maps (SOM) followed by k-means clustering of the SOM neurons. Cluster-level regression models, constructed after site patterning, performed better in IBI prediction than global regression models constructed without any previous site patterning. The importance of identifying groups of sites with similar environmental characteristics affecting the IBI was revealed. The combined use of site patterning and regression modeling for IBI prediction also helped identifying important variables acting at the local scale which remain latent at the global scale.

AB  - Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are emerging contaminants that are coming under increasing scrutiny. Currently, there is a paucity of effects data for marine aquatic life, limiting the assessment of ecological risks and compliance with water quality policies. In the present study, the toxicity of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) to four standard marine laboratory toxicity testing species, encompassing five endpoints, were evaluated: 1) 96-h embryolarval normal development for the purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus); 2) 48-h embryolarval normal development and normal survival for the Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis); 3) 96-h survival of opossum shrimp (Americamysis bahia); and 4) 24-h light output for the bioluminescent dinoflagellate Pyrocystis lunula. All species were tested using standard United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and/or American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International protocols. For PFOS and PFOA, the order of species sensitivity, starting with the most sensitive, was M. galloprovincialis, S. purpuratus, P. lunula, and A. bahia. The range of median lethal or median effect concentrations for PFOS (1.1-5.1 mg L-1) and PFOA (10-24 mg L-1) are comparable to the relatively few toxicity effect values available for marine species. In addition to providing effects data for PFOA and PFOS, this study indicates these species and endpoints are sensitive to PFAS such that their use will be appropriate for deriving toxicity data with other PFAS in marine ecosystems.

AB  - By increasing the undesirable side effects of synthetic food pigments on human health, using safe natural food pigment become an urgent issue. Incorporate corn starch with oils conducted a high impact on red pigment production byMonascus purpureus.Fortification the medium with sesame oil raised the pigment production by 80% and the dry mass by 63% compared with free oil medium. Response surface methodology maximizes the production with 114.6% (12.8 A(500)) using medium constituents (g/l); Sesame oil 5; Corn starch 30; Yeast extract 1.5; KH(2)PO(4)2.5 and MgSO4.7H(2)O 0.1. After evaluating red pigment stability in three common food components, citric acid showed a great effect on residual stability percentage compared with ascorbic and salicylic acid which decrease slightly the residual stability percentage at light and dark conditions. The mitotic index of red pigment was lower than the negative control at all tested concentrations. Different types of mitotic chromosomal abnormalities e.g. lagging chromosome, chromosomal bridge, chromosome and chromatin fragments, outside chromosome, chromosomal stickiness and micro nuclei were recorded. Insignificant increase in total mitotic aberrations percentage in all tested root tips treated with all concentrations of red pigment (1.23, 1.58, 1.63, 2.32 and 2.40%) compared with negative control (0.91%). There was a significant increase in total aberrations percentage after treatment with all concentrations (10, 15, 20 and 25%) of positive control (2.93, 3.00, 3.55 and 6.53 respectively) except (5%) which was insignificant (2.71%). From the previous data, this red pigment can be used as an alternative safe pigment in the food industry.

AB  - The effect of the whole methanol extracts of five Chrysanthemum species on feeding and performance of Spodoptera littoralis (Boisduval) larvae has been investigated in vitro. The extracts exhibited an anti-feeding and phagostimulating activities against cotton leafworm larvae when applied either on leaf discs or incorporated into an artificial diet. Under chosen conditions, the antifeedant index calculated over 24 h for sixth instar larvae significantly varied from 78.55 for Chrysanthemum segetum L to -44.18 for Chrysanthemum fuscatum Desf. at the dose of 1000 ppm. Toxicity of the extracts was manifested by a high mortality, reduced growth rates, and low weight gain by larvae fed on diets containing 1000-10,000 ppm of the extract. Anyone of the larvae treated with Chrysanthemum macrotum (D.R.) Ball. leaves crude extract survived to pupation at the two higher concentrations. The time to pupation increased for Chrysanthemum grandiflorum flowers crude extract from 11.40 +/- 0.93 to 28.93 +/- 10.92 days as the extract concentration in the diet increased from 0 to 10,000 ppm. The ingestion of crude extract by the third instar larvae reduced significantly the consumption, growth and utilisation of the ingested and digested food, and reduced digestibility.
   The crude extract of the leaves of C. macro rum, dissolved in acetone and topically applied on sixth instar larvae, showed a quite high mortality (95%).
   These results suggest the presence in the extracts of anti-feeding and/or toxic substances, active by consumption and topical application. The identification of these compounds and their action mode will be object of further studies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tropical cyclone Nargis, generated over the Bay of Bengal in late April 2008, caused catastrophic destruction after making landfall in Myanmar. Here, the large-scale environment of cyclogenesis was investigated using re-analysis datasets and a cloud-system resolving model. The reanalysis datasets showed that a westerly wind axis over the Bay of Bengal shifted northward from mid-April to early May. This shift is attributed to a seasonal transition of the Asian summer monsoon and a boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation. The timing of this environmental modulation was consistent with the climatologically early tropical cyclogenesis over the Bay of Bengal. This period was also characterized by high genesis potential, which is an empirical index of the environmental field favorable for tropical cyclogenesis. An analysis of genesis potential showed that the genesis of Nargis was associated with reduced vertical shear and increased lower-tropospheric vorticity.
   A cloud-system-resolving model successfully reproduced the high probability of tropical cyclogenesis during the observed period of cyclogenesis in late April. The model also simulated the large-scale environment including the northward shift of the westerly wind axis, although the precise location of tropical cyclogenesis was sensitive to initial conditions in the model. The anomaly of sea surface temperature in 2008 had little influence on the simulated probability of tropical cyclogenesis. Therefore, a cloud-system-resolving atmospheric model even without ocean feedback is a promising tool for predicting the probability of tropical cyclogenesis over the Bay of Bengal around the onset of the Asian summer monsoon, which is a favorable environment for tropical cyclogenesis.

AB  - Condition-dependent mate choice is thought to affect the strength and direction of sexual selection. Although there is ample evidence of this from studies that experimentally manipulate female condition, few studies to date have examined condition dependence of natural mate choice wherein females interact with a pool of available males. We examined mate assessment by free-living Pavo cristatus peafowl, focusing on 3 measures of the choosing female's condition: mass condition (scaled mass index), ectoparasite load, and white blood cell (WBC) count. Females with greater mass condition were more active on peacock leks, approaching and visiting males more often, and spending more time near the males they visited. Condition did not affect the total number of males visited or the probability that a female would visit a male that she had already approached. Peacock mating success is strongly correlated with the iridescent colors of the eyespots on their train, suggesting that color signals are a major focus of female choice. Here, we show that females in better condition (higher mass condition and lower WBC count) allocate a greater proportion of their visit time to the most iridescent males displaying on leks. Our results provide evidence of strong condition-dependent effects on female mate assessment and choice in the absence of experimentally induced stress. We suggest that condition-dependent mate choice may help maintain variation in sexually selected male color traits.

AB  - In intertidal areas, oyster farming creates a crosshatching pattern between oyster tables and aisles. Tables provide a refuge from the current and solar irradiance and the oysters facilitate the accumulation of OM, thereby structuring the spatial organization of the associated macrozoobenthic community at mesoscale. The aim of this study was to describe the quality of the oyster table environment at small scale and the response of the macrozoobenthic community to OsHV-1 ?var oyster mortality. The species assemblage was dominated by Golfingia vulgaris, Tubificoides benedii, Capitella capitata and Scoloplos armiger. The table habitat appeared to be in a bad ecological state throughout the 2-month survey (May and June 2017), whereas in the aisle, eutrophication occurred lately and was clearly related to be due to the massive stranding of dead seaweed at the end of the survey (in early July). So, this disturbance of the species assemblage seemed to occur in two phases: 1) after oyster spat mortality and 2) after seaweed stranding resulted in a bad ecological status, as revealed by macrofaunal indicators. Large quantities of OsHV-1 DNA were also found in some species, including small crabs and amphipods, one week after the mortality crisis, but there is no apparent virus reservoir found in the benthic species.

AB  - Water environment carrying capacity (WECC) is an important foundation of sustainable socioeconomic development and may be affected by many factors such as water resources, water quality, economy, population and environmental protection. This article focuses on the temporal and spatial variability of WECC to explore a method of dynamic successive assessment. First, the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) framework is used to develop a systematic and causal indicator system representing the three aspects of water environment pressure carrying capacity (WEPCC), water environment state carrying capacity (WESCC) and water environment response carrying capacity (WERCC). The Variable Fuzzy Pattern Recognition (VFPR) model and an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model are combined to successively and dynamically assess WEPCC, WESCC and WERCC, and after that the weighting method is used to calculate WECC. Furthermore, WECC is divided into 27 classes on the basis of WEPCC, WESCC and WERCC contributions. The proposed method is applied to the dynamic successive assessment of WECCs in China, including inter-province comparisons. The results show that the dynamic successive WECC assessment method is reasonable, and it can be used not only to accurately understand the changes of WECC through time but also to distinguish qualitative differences masked by similar WECC values.

AB  - A primarily descriptive approach has been used to develop studies in Mexico that use indicators to incorporate information on the conservation state of ecosystems. Consequently, these studies are not well supported by ecological data, or they lack an analysis of socio-ecological integration, making it difficult to implement the strategies derived from these conservation plans. Structural equations models (SEM) help with the understanding of direct and indirect interactions between variables and, consequently, allow the detection of root causes of change. In this study, a method to integrate indicators in relation to a pressure-state-response model was developed and applied to a forest in Mexico City. We developed the model using 21 environmental units, 17 state indicators of biodiversity (evaluating three aspects of the ecosystem: structure, composition and function), 14 environmental indicators (abiotic variables) and 6 anthropogenic pressure indicators. Subsequently, based on multicollinearity tests, redundant indicators were eliminated. A canonical correspondence analysis was carried out to establish the relationship between different indicators and the possible ecological connections of the SEM. With the previous information, an a priori model of the influence of pressure and environmental indicators on the structure, composition and function of the ecosystem was developed.
   The SEM results enabled us to evaluate the direct and indirect causes of degradation. Some environmental factors, such as the global site factor, humidity, air temperature, organic matter in the soil, slope, and soil pH, had a greater effect on the structure, composition and function indicators registered in the environmental units of the basin than other factors. The pressure factors that most affected the three aspects of the ecosystem were visitors, rubbish, fire incidence, and human activities. Pressure factors affected composition and structure indicators, though the effect on the function indicators was weak. It is possible to conclude that although the ecosystem appears to be changed by some disturbance factors, these factors have not yet altered the functionality of the ecosystem. Finally, from the model, a set of proposals and strategies for management was developed. These strategies can be used to sustain the biodiversity of each environmental unit. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In compliance with the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive, monitoring of the ecological and chemical status of Catalan river basins (NE Spain) is carried out by the Catalan Water Agency.
   The large amount of data collected and the complex relationships among the environmental variables monitored often mislead data interpretation in terms of toxic impact, especially considering that even pollutants at very low concentrations might contribute to the total toxicity.
   The total dataset of chemical monitoring carried out between 2007 and 2008 (232 sampling stations and 60 pollutants) has been analyzed using sequential advanced modeling techniques. Data on concentrations of contaminants in water were pre-treated in order to calculate the bioavailable fraction, depending on substance properties and local environmental conditions.
   The resulting values were used to predict the potential impact of toxic substances in complex mixtures on aquatic biota and to identify hot spots. Exposure assessment with Species Sensitivity Distribution (SSD) and mixture toxicity rules were used to compute the multi-substances Potentially Affected Fraction (msPAF). The combined toxicity of the pollutants analyzed in the Catalan surface waters might potentially impact more than 50% of the species in 10% of the sites.
   In order to understand and visualize the spatial distribution of the toxic risk, Self Organising Map (SOM), based on the Kohonen's Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm, was applied on the output data of these models. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed on top of Neural Network results in order to identify main influential variables which account for the pollution trends. Finally, predicted toxic impacts on biota have been linked and correlated to field data on biological quality indexes using macroinvertebrate and diatom communities (IBMWP and IPS). The methodology presented could represent a suitable tool for water managers in environmental risk assessment and management. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article defines the land cover classes used in Meter-Scale Urban Land Cover (MULC), a unique, high resolution (one meter(2)per pixel) land cover dataset developed for 30 US communities for the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) EnviroAtlas. MULC data categorize the landscape into these land cover classes: impervious surface, tree, grass-herbaceous, shrub, soil-barren, water, wetland and agriculture. MULC data are used to calculate approximately 100 EnviroAtlas metrics that serve as indicators of nature's benefits (ecosystem goods and services). MULC, a dataset for which development is ongoing, is produced by multiple classification methods using aerial photo and LiDAR datasets. The mean overall fuzzy accuracy across the EnviroAtlas communities is 88% and mean Kappa coefficient is 0.84. MULC is available in EnviroAtlas via web browser, web map service (WMS) in the user's geographic information system (GIS), and as downloadable data at EPA Environmental Data Gateway. Fact sheets and metadata for each MULC community are available through EnviroAtlas. Some MULC applications include mapping green and grey infrastructure, connecting land cover with socioeconomic/demographic variables, street tree planting, urban heat island analysis, mosquito habitat risk mapping and bikeway planning. This article provides practical guidance for using MULC effectively and developing similar high resolution (HR) land cover data.

AB  - The ecological quality of the Tota River was evaluated during August 2007 and February 2008 and compared to the upper part from Bogota River between October 2013 and January 2014, by applying the BMWP/Col and ABI indexes. The sampling points corresponding to the high, medium and low part of the longitudinal gradient. In the Tota River, 27 families were determined corresponding to 11 orders, where the most abundant were Baetidae (25.43 %), Leptohyphidae (16.43 %), Naididae (13.76 %), Chironomidae (11.42%) and Hyalellidae (10.30 %). In the upper course of Bogota River, 32 families were determined to conform 13 orders, where the most abundant were Chironomidae (28.94 %), Leptoceridae (25.20 %), Naididae (18.34 %) and Simuliidae (8.63 %). In the river Tota, The BMWP/Col. The index showed a good status, while the ABI index exhibited an acceptable quality. On the other hand, in the upper part of the Bogota River, both the BMWP/Col. and ABI showed variations in quality between acceptable and very critical. The CCA for the Tota River exhibited correlations between temperature and conductivity with the families Hyalellidae and Leptohyphidae while the stream flow was linked with the family Sphaeriidae. On the other hand, in the upper part of Bogota River the stream flow, conductivity and temperature were correlated with the occurrence of the family Veliidae. Our results showed that the ABI index is more sensitive to impacts that the BMWP/Col index is showing its ability to evaluate the Andean mountain systems.

AB  - Strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) fruits are highly appreciated worldwide because of their flavour and their content on healthy-related compounds. Most of these compounds have antioxidant properties and photo-protective activities involved in plant response against environmental constrains, including light availability. Thus, fruit quality might be affected by variation in environmental factors such as light conditions. A field experiment, performed under conventional cropping conditions, was designed for assessing the effects of the light exposure level of fruits on fruit quality parameters in four strawberry cultivars ('Sabrina', 'Fortuna', 'Splendor' and 'Primoris') during a cropping season. To assess to what extent strawberry genotypes are able to modulate their fruit quality traits in response to light conditions, a plasticity index was calculated for a quantitative estimation of the amount of phenotypic change induced by the environment (i.e. light-exposure) on the different strawberry cultivars.
   Results showed that proportion of exposed fruits compared to non-exposed ones was similar in all cultivars despite their differences in canopy size. This was achieved by modulating peduncle length: the higher the canopy size, the higher the peduncle length. This work also demonstrates that light incidence influences strawberry fruit quality - flavour and antioxidant content- and that the responsiveness to light conditions, estimated by the plasticity index, of strawberry fruits is genotype dependent. These results are suggesting differences among cultivars in the ability of adapting to variable light environments, and their significance in a breeding context and from an applied point of view is discussed.

AB  - Due to the intensification of large-scale mining and of human activities, the ecological integrity of resource-based cities has been severely damaged. Studying its ecological vulnerability (EV) will help improve the environmental degradation and ecosystem imbalance in the region and provide a decision-making basis for its sustainable development. In this paper, genetic projection pursuit and ecological vulnerability index model were used to quantitatively evaluate the EV of Datong from 2000 to 2017. This study shows that it is feasible to apply genetic projection pursuit on ecological vulnerability evaluation. This method avoids artificial assumptions, and thus provides objective results that successfully execute multi indicator evaluation process and analysis under non-linear systems in ecological environment. From 2000 to 2017, under the dual influence of national development plans and coal mining activities, Datong City's EV showed a downward trend, and the highest and lowest EV occurred in 2010 and 2017 respectively; the differences in natural conditions in different regions made the spatial distribution of EV high in the west and low in the east, the spatial variation was relatively stable, and the regions with large changes were concentrated in the Urban District, Zuoyun County and Lingqiu County; due to rapid industrialization and urbanization, the centroid of EV shifted to the southwest. The maximum offset was 3.81 km, and the EV distribution was uneven. Local governments should take corresponding measures in different ecologically vulnerable areas. In the buffer and transition zone, the idea of attaching importance to ecology should continue to be maintained and the ecological asset management models and mechanisms based on ecological protection should be actively explored. In the key ecological restoration area, efforts should be made to return farmland to forests (grass), accelerate the process of vegetation restoration, and rationally develop coal resources. In the absolute ecological protection zone, establish a mine reclamation monitoring mechanism and promote the development of the tertiary industry represented by tourism.

AB  - Sustainable development in coastal areas requires mapping of geological and geomorphological features of the area and precise determination of coastal border line. Such a study was carried out in the city of Antalya, which is undergoing intense infrastructural development in order to accommodate touristic activities. In the field, high water level, which is determined from moist-dry sand border and current berm crest, was taken as the indicator for shoreline, while vegetation line and topographic rises were taken as indicators of coastal border line. The geographic coordinates of all of the features were determined using differential Global Positioning System with application of "real-time kinematic measurement" technique. Quickbird satellite images of 2002 and 2009 were used in order to observe natural state of the coastal area before the constructions, to complete geomorphological map, and to confirm the coastal border line determined in the field. In addition, the natural vegetation line before the infrastructural development was determined using normalized difference vegetation index approach. Using grain size parameters for identification of coastal border line, high and low water levels were tested. The results showed that from low water level to coastal border line, D-50 (median grain size) and coefficient of uniformity decrease while coefficient of curvature increases systematically. This study showed that use of only one approach to determine coastal border line is insufficient, and an integrated methodology is required.

AB  - Kejimkujik National Park and National Historic Site, Nova Scotia, Canada, is considered a biological mercury (Hg) hotspot because the tissues of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and common loons (Gavia immer) inhabiting the lakes frequently exceed so-called safe levels of Hg. In the present study, the relationships between Hg and overall health of males and females of 3 forage fish species (brown bullhead Ameirus nebulosus, banded killifish Fundulus diaphanus, and golden shiner Notemigonus crysoleucas; n = 6-18/sex/lake) in 6 lakes at the park were assessed using condition factor, liversomatic index (LSI), and macrophage aggregates (MAs; indicators of tissue damage). Mean muscle total Hg (THg) concentrations of brown bullhead, banded killifish, and golden shiner across lakes were 0.32 mu g/g, 0.27 mu g/g, and 0.34 mu g/g, respectively. Condition was negatively related to muscle THg in golden shiner and banded killifish, LSI was not related to THg in any species, and all species showed evidence of increasing MA prevalence (counts and area) with increasing THg concentrations. The MAs were most prevalent in spleen tissues of golden shiner, with mean percentage cover ranging from 0.36% to 5.59% across lakes. In addition, the area of MAs appeared to be better predicted by THg concentration than was the number of MAs in the same tissue. These findings suggest that Hg is affecting the health of wild fishes in Kejimkujik National Park and National Historic Site and that other populations with similar or higher concentrations of this metal may also be at risk.

AB  - We investigated the influence of temporal and spatial factors on the feeding habits of the armed snook Centropomus armatus (Centropomidae), the most abundant snook species in eastern Pacific mangrove ecosystems. The influence of the combination of semi-diurnal tides and diel cycles and salinity on the intertidal abundance, stomach fullness, diet composition and daily consumption of this species was investigated over 1 year in the macrotidal Colombian Pacific coast (Bahia Malaga). The abundance of juvenile C. armatus (5.6-23.6 cm total length) in the intertidal creeks was highest during neap tide-night conditions and lowest during spring-tide day conditions. Centropomus armatus fed predominantly on crustaceans (Alpheidae and Palaemonidae) and fishes. Stomach fullness index (I-SF), a proxy of feeding activity, was not influenced by salinity, but by tidal-diel conditions. Stomach fullness index was highest during neap tide nocturnal inundations, but lowest during diurnal neap tides. Nevertheless, the total daily consumption was higher at spring tide than at neap tides. Higher water temperatures in creeks during neap tides at night could explain not only high C. armatus abundance, but also greater accessibility to active prey. Comparison with the feeding patterns of fishes from other macrotidal mangrove ecosystems suggest that the habitat use and feeding patterns of intertidal fishes in mangroves are strongly influenced by the combination of spring-neap tide and diel cycles. However, the interaction between mangrove geomorphology and flooding regime of the specific mangrove forest might also play a role and deserves further investigation.

AB  - Many ecological indicators have been proposed to detect and describe the effects of fishing on marine ecosystems, but few have been evaluated formally. Here, simulation models of two marine systems off southeastern Australia (a large marine embayment, and an EEZ-scale regional marine ecosystem) are used to evaluate the performance of a suite of ecological indicators. The indicators cover species, assemblages, habitats, and ecosystems, including quantities derived from models such as Ecopath. The simulation models, based on the Atlantis framework, incorporate the effects of fishing from several fishing gears, and also the confounding impacts of other broad-scale pressures on the ecosystems (e.g. increased nutrient loads). These models are used to provide fishery-dependent and fishery-independent pseudo-data from which the indicators are calculated. Indicator performance is quantified by the ability to detect and/or predict trends in key variables of interest ("attributes"), the true values of which are known from the simulation models. The performance of each indicator is evaluated across a range of ecological and fishing scenarios. Results suggest that indicators at the community level of organization are the most reliable, and that it is necessary to use a variety of indicators simultaneously to detect the full range of impacts from fishing. Several key functional groups provide a good characterization of ecosystem state, or indicate the cause of broader ecosystem changes in most instances.

AB  - The goal of the Use Attainability Analysis (UAA) of the Lower Des Plaines River was to upgrade the designated "Secondary Contact Recreation and Indigenous Aquatic Life Use" to a higher use that would be commensurate with the goals of the Clean Water Act (CWA). In Illinois, the water body use in compliance with the goals of the CWA is named "General Use". The river has been extensively modified and receives most point-source and urban runoff discharges from the Chicago metropolitan area (9.5 million inhabitants). The study included an extensive assessment of the physical, chemical, biological, and bacteriological integrity status of the water body and sediments. the UAA found that the water quality situation of the river has improved significantly since the 1970s, when the Illinois Pollution Control Board defined and assigned the Secondary Contact Recreation and Indigenous Aquatic Life Use designation to the Lower Des Plaines River. The study defined and suggested a "Modified Impounded Use" for one highly modified reach, with adjusted standards for dissolved oxygen and recreation. The study also recommended adoption of the General Use standards, some of them in a modified form, for other water quality parameters. Standards for limited recreation were also developed. The UAA also outlines a suggested action plan that will bring UAA segments of the Lower Des Plaines River in compliance with UAA goals.

AB  - Although blue crabs, Callinectes sapidus Rathbun, 1896, are ecologically important predators and support the world's most valuable crab fishery, little is known about their spawning and hatching migrations beyond the estuary. We discovered unexpectedly high concentrations of female blue crabs actively spawning, hatching their eggs, and foraging in federal waters within our study area, the Ship, Trinity, Tiger Shoal Complex (STTSC) >= 20 km off the Louisiana coast. During a three-year investigation, blue crab abundances were significantly higher on Ship and Trinity Shoals than the surrounding, muddy and deeper seafloor. Crabs from the STTSC compared favorably with those from nationally recognized spawning grounds in terms of condition factor (an index of health), fecundity, and abundance. Ninety percent of females possessed a sponge, large ovary, or both. Eighty-seven percent of non-ovigerous females showed evidence of a previous hatching. An analysis of ovarian development suggests that STTSC crabs produce new sponges approximately every 21 d, and at least seven broods per spawning season (similar to April-October). Monthly declines in sponge weight and a companion study of benthic macrofauna suggest fecundity may be limited by food supply in areas of high crab abundance. Symbionts did not negatively impact condition factor. Carapace width including the lateral spines was a much poorer estimator of crab weight than carapace width excluding the lateral spines, height, length, or estimated volume. Given the increasing national importance of the Louisiana blue crab fishery and declines elsewhere, we recommend that management safeguard these previously unknown spawning, hatching, and foraging grounds.

AB  - To assess the relative sensitivity of assessments using community metrics for macroinvertebrates, periphyton, and fish assemblages, we compared the results of three parallel assessments using these assemblages at 86 stream reaches sampled in 1994 and 1995 by the Regional Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (R-EMAP) in the mineralized zone or historical mining region of the Southern Rockies Ecoregion in Colorado. We contrasted assessments using community metrics for each taxa group selected to be diagnostic of the two large-scale stressor gradients identified in this ecoregion: discharges from historical hardrock metal mines and agriculture, particularly pasturing of livestock. While principal components analysis (PCA) extracted axes from the metrics for all three assemblages correlated with increased metal concentrations, the axes differed in their sensitivity to different environmental gradients. Two axes extracted from the fish metrics were correlated with dissolved metals, suspended solids, and sediment embeddedness or with sediment metals. Two axes extracted from the macroinvertebrate metrics partially separated these two stressor gradients, while the single correlated axis extracted from the periphyton metrics did not. The second macroinvertebrate PCA axis was correlated with an environmental gradient correlated both with agricultural effects and with stream size, as were the second and third periphyton PCA axes. The third fish PCA axis was correlated with stream size and slope, but was not sensitive to agricultural effects. Fish, macroinvertebrates, and periphyton differ in their sensitivity to different stressors, and combining metrics for these assemblages into a mixed assemblage index of biotic integrity may increase the utility of the multimetric approach to diagnose environmental stressors at impaired reaches.

AB  - To provide a theoretical basis for sustainable land resource utilization and a reference for areas with similar natural conditions, an evaluation index for land-based ecological security was constructed based on the Driving force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model and the improved analytic hierarchy process (IAHP) and entropy methods, and the land-based ecological security status of Xingtai city from 2006 to 2017 was evaluated. Then, the obstacles to land-based ecological security were diagnosed. The results show that the values of the comprehensive evaluation index of land-based ecological security were 0.28-0.66 in the period from 2006 to 2017. The value of the index of land-based ecological security was low in the first seven years and gradually improved in the last five years of the study period. However, the overall situation was grave, and the ecological security conditions were poor. The main obstacles to land-based ecological security were the usage of pesticides, investment in environmental pollution treatments, the degree of machine cultivation, the rate of cultivation and the usage of fertilizer in Xingtai city. Based on the results of the land-based ecological security evaluation and the main obstacles identified in Xingtai city, this paper proposes management strategies and suggestions for improving land-based ecological security in Xingtai city. The specific proposals are as follows: vigorously develop green agriculture, increase investment in environmental pollution control, increase input in science and technology, and strengthen supervision and management of land use.

AB  - Ecological restoration is increasingly employed to restore degraded or destroyed ecosystems and evaluation of restoration success requires that natural community dynamics be understood. Wet prairies in the Southeast US have diverse plant communities subject to disturbances including fire, drought, flooding, tropical storms, and freezes. This habitat covers a fraction of its former range and reversing that trend requires ecological restoration; but, long-term data on the dynamics of this system are rare. We analyzed a 12-year plant community composition dataset from a fire-maintained Gulf of Mexico Coastal Plain wet prairie to characterize plant community dynamics and identify indicator species. The site was compared to a nearby wetland mitigation project attempting to restore a wet prairie that had been converted into slash pine (Pinus elliottii) plantation. The reference site had higher species richness, was dominated by Aristida spp., and was stable despite extreme climatic conditions. The restoration site transitioned from dense pine and understory canopy to an open, grassy community, but did not follow a trajectory toward the reference state. Restoration efforts were impeded by woody debris, accumulated duff, soil disturbance from logging, and storm surge from hurricanes. Continued application of prescribed fire and decomposition activity should remove the organic matter and promote establishment of wet prairie species, but on a longer time scale than expected. Although the pine plantation did not return to a typical wet prairie during the study period, the record of community dynamics of the reference wet prairie provides information on the resilience of the habitat type under prescribed fire management, and serves as a reference for restoration efforts and management of this threatened habitat.

AB  - Thirty-six sediment samples from twelve soil profiles have been collected from Karewa deposits of south Kashmir with an objective for evaluating weathering of the source area, palaeoclimate and environmental contamination. Chemical Index of Alteration (CIA), Plagioclase Index of Alteration (PIA) and Chemical Index of Weathering (CIW) values of the sediments averaged at 53.99, 68.6 and 72.53 indicating low to moderate degree of weathering. Higher values are observed in the samples collected at top surface. The samples taken at 15cm depth and 60cm depth showed almost similar but lesser values than top soil samples. A-CN-K and A-CNK-FM diagrams showed an almost similar contents for Al2O3, CaO, Na2O, K2O and MgO as those of upper crust, reflecting very poor to moderate weathering history. The ratio plots of SiO2 vs Al2O3+K2O+Na2O and CIA (molar) vs Al2O3 indicate semi-arid climatic conditions with a mean annual precipitation of 846mm per year and mean annual paleo-temperature of 10.91 degrees C. Metal concentration in sediment samples ranged from 331.1 to 571ppm (Ba), 146 to 292ppm (Zr), 82 to 587ppm (Sr), 70 to 130ppm (Cr), 58.9 to 120ppm (Rb), 37.6 to 112ppm (V) and 43 to 112ppm (Zn). The enrichment ratio of 6 for As, 3 for Cr and 2 for Ni, Sb and Tb indicate the enrichment of these metals in the sediment samples. The QoC plot of As, Ni, Co and Cr illustrated an anthropogenic source and Ba, Rb, Sr, Nb, and Ta were mainly derived from geogenic sources with no evidence of anthropogenic contamination.

AB  - The driving comfort, which is mainly determined by the pavement evenness, is one of the most important indexes for evaluating the pavement service condition. Current evaluation indexes for the pavement evenness, such as the international roughness index (IRI), are mainly determined by the vibration acceleration method. However, the driver is at the core in the human-vehicle-road-environment system. Few studies have focused on the physiological state as a response to accelerations induced by pavement unevenness and evaluate the driving comfort on this basis. In this study, the Root Mean Square of the Successive Differences (RMSSD) derived from the driver's heart rate variability (HRV) in the time domain and was selected as an index value for the driver's physiological state. Using an advanced indoor testing platform, the RMSSD values of five drivers were recorded by a KF2 electrocardiogram tester. The relationship between the RMSSD, the driving speed and the IRI underwent detailed analyses. The results of the tests show that the vertical vibration is identical when the drivers are driving on the simulated pavement with the same IRI value; however, the RMSSD values of different drivers were different, i.e., the perception of the same pavement evenness is subjective. Therefore, when evaluating the driving comfort based on the pavement evenness, it is necessary to consider the physiological index. The results obtained in this study have proven the feasibility of measurement of RMSSD value to evaluate the pavement evenness and driving comfort. They are therefore a powerful augmentation of existing evaluation methods and also provide a new reference for further optimization of the pavement surface performance.

AB  - Investment in agricultural conservation practices (CPs) to address Lake Erie's re-eutrophication may offer benefits that extend beyond the lake, such as improved habitat conditions for fish communities throughout the watershed. If such conditions are not explicitly considered in Lake Erie nutrient management strategies, however, this opportunity might be missed. Herein, we quantify the potential for common CPs that will be used to meet nutrient management goals for Lake Erie to simultaneously improve stream biological conditions throughout the western Lake Erie basin (WLEB) watershed. To do so, we linked a high-resolution watershed hydrology model to predictive biological models in a conservation scenario framework. Our modeling simulations showed that the implementation of CPs on farm acres in critical and moderate need of treatment, representing nearly half of the watershed, would be needed to reduce spring/early summer total phosphorus loads from the WLEB watershed to acceptable levels. This widespread CP implementation also would improve potential stream biological conditions in >11,000 km of streams and reduce the percentage of streams where water quality is limiting biological conditions, from 31% to 20%. Despite these improvements, we found that even with additional treatment of acres in low need of CPs, degraded water quality conditions would limit biological conditions in >3200 stream km. Thus, while we expect CPs to play an important role in mitigating eutrophication problems in the Lake Erie ecosystem, additional strategies and emerging technologies appear necessary to fully reduce water quality limitation throughout the watershed.

AB  - Les methodes actuelles pour l'evaluation de la sante ecologique des lacs aux Etats-Unis ne rencontrent pas les exigences du Clean Water Act (CWA) de 1972 pour l'evaluation de la condition des biotopes aquatiques. Typiquement, on a evalue et classifie l'etat d'alteration des lacs etat par etat, via les standards d'eutrophisation ou en utilisant les protocoles de charge quotidienne totale maximum (TMLD). Souvent ces mesures n'arrivent pas a prendre en compte les effets des perturbations anthropogenes sur les biotopes aquatiques qui ne se traduisent pas directement dans les indicateurs chimiques et physiques des conditions environnementales. L'index de l'Integrite Biologique (IBI) constitue une methode efficace potentielle pour evaluer la sante ecologique, destinee a integrer les aspects ecologiques, fonctionnels et structuraux des ecosystemes aquatiques. De plus, l'IBI arrive a rencontrer les exigences du CWA en examinant directement les composantes biologiques d'un ecosysteme. L'adaptation de l'IBI pour son utilisation dans le suivi des lacs a augmente au cours des recentes annees, a mesure que les amenagistes repondent au besoin d'examiner directement les biotopes des systemes aquatiques. Cette revue vise a examiner les recherches reliees au developpement de l'IBI pour les milieux lacustres. Les auteurs discutent les obstacles et imperfections frequemment rencontres dans le developpement de cet index. On accorde egalement beaucoup d'attention aux methodes robustes et aux lecons tirees des methodes inadequates. Ce travail devrait faciliter l'utilisation de l'IBI dans les efforts de suivi des lacs ayant comme objectif, l'amelioration de l'amenagement des ressources aquatiques.

AB  - Developmental noise-which level may vary within a certain backlash allowed by natural selection-is a reflection of the state of a developing system or developmental stability. Phenotypic variations inside the genetically determined norm observed in case of fluctuating asymmetry provide a unique opportunity for evaluating this form of ontogenetic variability. Low levels of developmental noise for the biologic system under study is observed under certain conditions, while its increase acts as a measure of stress. The concordance of changes in developmental stability with changes in other parameters of developmental homeostasis indicates the significance of fluctuating asymmetry estimates. All this determines the future prospects of the study of fluctuating asymmetry not only for developmental biology, but also for population biology. The study of developmental stability may act as the basis of an approach of population developmental biology to assess the nature of the phenotypic diversity and the state of natural populations under various impacts and during evolutionary transformations.

AB  - Procedures for assessing a marine coastal ecosystem health are presented in this paper. The assessment includes the following five steps: (1) review of human activities; (2) identification of human-induced stresses; (3) analysis of ecosystem responses to the stresses; (4) development of ecosystem health indicators; and (5) assessment of ecosystem health. A set of comprehensive indicators integrating classical indicators with thermodynamic indicators was proposed and applied to assess the Tolo Harbour marine coastal ecosystem health. The indicators encompass the stress indicators and the responses indicators including physical, chemical, biological, general ecosystem-level and ecosystem-service-function aspects. The assessment results of the Tolo Harbour ecosystem health show that a temporal order of ecosystem health state from good to bad is determined as follows: the 1970s > the 1990s > the 1980s; while, a spatial order of health state from good to bad is Channel Subzone > Buffer Subzone > Harbour Subzone. Some recommendations to improve further the marine coastal ecosystem health in the Tolo Harbour are finally discussed in the paper. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The environmental and geological condition of a current solid waste disposal site in the city of Tunceli, Turkey was investigated. Improper geological structure and soil properties of this unsanitary solid waste storage site as well as leachate from this site caused significant pollution in air, soil, and surface water. Natural soil characteristics and geology of the site are presented in this paper. Petrographic properties of vulcanized rubber rocks composed of tuff and volcanic sandstone at the bottom of storage sites and the mineralogical composition of the base composed of these rocks were examined. Permeability of the natural soil and index properties were determined using soil mechanics experiments (moisture content, specific gravity, Atterberg limit tests, sieve analysis, hydrometer analysis, falling-head permeability test, and standard proctor test) conducted on disturbed samples collected from excavated sites and the relationship between mineralogical composition and soil hydraulic behavior was investigated. Natural soil samples of six different parts of the site indicated that, the soil class in four samples is silty sands, sand-silt mixtures, one is clayey sands, sand-clay mixtures and one is clayey silts with slight plasticity. The values obtained using permeability tests for subsoil samples vary from 10(-5) to 10(-8) cm/s. Low permeability (10(-7) and 10(-8) cm/s) at the south part of the site increases to 10(-5) cm/s at the natural soil of the North side. Extensively faulted and fissured volcanic sandstone levels at the site give potential to waste leachate to reach deep levels. The soil composition, hydraulic conductivity, topographic conditions, and other location criteria in the current solid waste disposal site showed that the current disposal site is not suitable for this purpose.

AB  - The effect of water availability (water activity, a(w); 0.995-0.90) and temperature (18-30 degrees) on in vitro interactions between an ochratoxin producing strain of Aspergillus ochraceus and six other spoilage fungi was assessed in dual culture experiments on a maize meal-based agar medium. In primary resource capture of nutrient substrate, A. ochraceus was dominant against many of the interacting species, being able to overgrow and replace A. candidus, and sometimes A. flavus and the Eurotium spp. regardless of a(w) or temperature. However, with freely available water (0.995 a(w)) A. alternata and A. niger were dominant, with mutual antagonism between A. ochraceus and A. flavus at 25-30 degrees C. In the driest conditions tested (0.90 a(w)) there was also mutual antagonism between A. ochraceus and the two Eurotium spp. Overall, under all conditions tested the Index of Dominance for A. ochraceus was much higher than for other competing species combined suggesting that A. ochraceus was a good competitive colonist able to replace a number of other species. However, the growth rate of A. ochraceus was modified and decreased by the interaction with competitors. Interaction between A. ochraceus and species such as A. alternata (18 degrees C/0.995) and Eurotium spp. (0.995-0.95 and 25-30 degrees C) resulted in a significant stimulation of ochratoxin production. The results are discussed in relation to the effect that environmental factors have on the possible competitiveness of A. ochraceus in the maize grain ecosystem and the role of ochratoxin in niche exclusion of competitors.

AB  - The unplanned occupation of the Coastal Zone has promoted the replacement of the original natural environment by the anthropic environment. This transformation generates conditions that unbalance the Environmental Diversity (abiotic and biotic natures) and prejudice the anthropic environment. This problem tends to continue and worsen in small municipalities; as is the case of municipality of Jaguanma, Santa Catarina, Brazil. The present paper presents the method of structuring the first steps of a coastal strategic plan developed in Camacho Balneary/Jaguaruna through actions and scenarios of management based on conflict conditions mapping, the application of the Legal - Environmental Criticality Index (ICLA, in Portuguese), the paradigm of Geodiversity and the local sedimentary dynamics. In a Geographic Information System environment, the regionalization of the Environmental Diversity landscape was carried out by "map algebra" of abiotic and biotic information. After identifying and ranking the main conflict conditions by applying the ICLA, each conflict condition with an area over 1,000 m2 was evaluated. There were 71 conflict conditions, which cover 79.91% of the areas occupied with urban or agricultural activities. When comparing the results with the current management instruments, the main restrictions observed were: disrespect for legal and environmental constraints of occupation poor sanitation; territory and urban zoning incoherent with the socio-spatial dynamics of Jaguaruna; lack of financial investment; and insufficient technical staff. The management scenarios allowed the design of three different types of intervention (medium term), which reflect different development proposals, for deliberation and implementation by public managers. The methodological proposal, combined with the incorporation of pre-existing management initiatives and plans, provided: the identification and hierarchy of conflict conditions in a simple and intelligible way; the proposition of objective management actions; the spatialization of trend scenarios and the continuity of pre-existing management initiatives.

AB  - Assessment of watershed ecological status and trends is challenging for managers who lack randomly or consistently sampled data, or monitoring programs developed from a watershed perspective. This study investigated analytical approaches for assessment of status and trends using data collected by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency as part of state requirements for reporting stream quality and managing discharge permits. Fish and benthic macroinvertebrate metrics collected during three time periods (1979-1981, 1986-1989, 1990-1993) were analyzed for the mainstem of Big Darby Creek, a high-quality warm-water stream in central Ohio, USA. Analysis of variance of transformed metrics showed significant differences among time periods for six fish metrics. In addition, significant positive linear trends were observed for four metrics plus the index of biotic integrity score, and negative linear trends for two fish metrics. An analysis of a subset of sites paired by location and sampled over the three periods reflected findings using all available data for the mainstem. In particular, mean estimates were very similar between the reduced and full data sets, whereas standard error estimates were much greater in the reduced subset. Analysis of serial autocorrelation patterns among the fish metrics over the three time periods suggests changes in the nature of stressors over time. A comparison within the most recent time period showed significantly better condition for Big Darby Creek mainstem than for Hellbranch Run (the easternmost subwatershed), after adjusting for watershed size. The consistency of paired and nonrandomized results suggested that either type of data might be judiciously used for this watershed assessment. Results indicated that overall biological condition of the mainstem of the Big Darby Creek watershed has significantly improved since the early 1980s.

AB  - Ice-like gas hydrates under deep ocean bottom and permafrost have been attracting vigorous attention of geologists and energy industries world-wide in recent years. Such clathrate compounds are expected to become an environmentally sound, future source of energy. However, its research and development, if recklessly made, may cause such hazards as disturbance of marine environment, additional green house effect due to methane escape into the atmosphere and so on. After glimpses at the world and Japanese histories of natural gas utilization and at the Jevons' law on economy of fuel, this paper will investigate the current state of technology-environment interface of deep ocean drilling to gas-hydrate-containing sediments. A tentative map of gas hydrate evidences around Japan Archipelago is shown. Finally, needs for disclosure of empirical data and extensive environmental assessment will be discussed in the context of new drilling and related technologies.

AB  - P>1. Landscape management practices that alter energetic linkages between aquatic and terrestrial habitats can affect associated ecosystem processes, and ultimately the provision of ecosystem services of importance to humanity. Such effects cannot always be inferred from current biomonitoring schemes, which are typically based on assessment of community structural parameters rather than functional attributes related to important ecosystem-level processes.
   2. We investigated effects of forest clearcutting, a major landscape-level disturbance known to alter the energetic basis of aquatic food webs, on headwater streams in northern Sweden. The key ecosystem process of leaf decomposition was measured as an index of ecosystem functioning. The biomass of detritivorous shredders was also quantified, along with various community structural parameters associated with the diversity, composition and functional guild organisation of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages.
   3. No differences in macroinvertebrate abundance, diversity or assemblage composition were detected between forested and clearcut streams, and most functional guilds were similarly unaffected, though species density of scrapers was higher in forested than clearcut channels.
   4. In contrast, mass loss of two leaf species was elevated in all clearcut streams, with evidence for increases in the efficiency per degree-day of both the microbial and detritivore mediated fractions of decomposition.
   5. Increased rates of leaf mass loss in the clearcut streams were associated with greater phosphate concentrations and shredder biomass, and with an increased relative abundance of broadleaves in standing stocks of benthic litter. Together, these findings indicate a more rapid transfer of energy and nutrients through the detrital pathways of our clearcut streams.
   6. These results demonstrate the utility of litter decomposition assays for monitoring effects of forest management on stream ecosystem functioning, and have implications for nutrient cycles in landscapes extensively influenced by forest management. The markedly different responses of our functional and structural measures to clearcutting highlight the value of incorporating methods for the functional assessment of ecosystems into biomonitoring schemes.

AB  - The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) estimated that two thirds of ecosystem services on the earth have degraded or are in decline due to the unprecedented scale of human activities during recent decades. These changes will have tremendous consequences for human well-being, and offer both risks and opportunities for a wide range of stakeholders. Yet these risks and opportunities have not been well managed due in part to the lack of quantitative understanding of human dependence on ecosystem services. Here, we propose an index of dependence on ecosystem services (IDES) system to quantify human dependence on ecosystem services. We demonstrate the construction of the IDES system using household survey data. We show that the overall index and sub-indices can reflect the general pattern of households' dependences on ecosystem services, and their variations across time, space, and different forms of capital (i.e., natural, human, financial, manufactured, and social capitals). We support the proposition that the poor are more dependent on ecosystem services and further generalize this proposition by arguing that those disadvantaged groups who possess low levels of any form of capital except for natural capital are more dependent on ecosystem services than those with greater control of capital. The higher value of the overall IDES or sub-index represents the higher dependence on the corresponding ecosystem services, and thus the higher vulnerability to the degradation or decline of corresponding ecosystem services. The IDES system improves our understanding of human dependence on ecosystem services. It also provides insights into strategies for alleviating poverty, for targeting priority groups of conservation programs, and for managing risks and opportunities due to changes of ecosystem services at multiple scales.

AB  - The potential of Sentinel-2 (S2) data in mapping Leaf area index (LAI) of mangroves having heterogeneous species composition, variable canopy density, and complex backgrounds was studied. Out of the three available near-infrared bands in S2, band-8 of 10 m spatial resolution was found to be the most suitable one for deriving the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for mangroves. The LAI-NDVI relation did not accord apparently with the earlier reports and the underlying complex background effect was validated with Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) hyperspectral data. It simulated spectral and spatial conditions of S2 by linear mixing of canopy and background that confirmed the effect of background contributions to the canopy reflectance decorrelating the NDVI from LAI. The compensation for diverse backgrounds was accomplished with optimum-scaled NDVI (scNDVI(m)) obtained from the mean of scaled NDVIs derived with different backgrounds in the mangroves. LAI was well correlated with composite NDVI (NDVIcom), derived empirically from the most appropriate NDVI (NDVIS2) and scNDVI(m) where ground observation controlled the threshold arbitration in extracting the range of scNDVI(m). It was shown that an improved LAI estimate with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.69 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.02 could be obtained with NDVIcom. This method has the advantage of compensating the contaminations due to background reflectance. While the relation between LAI and NDVIcom was found to be consistent, the application of the same methodology in similar mangroves should be site-specific with ample ground observation. The fusion of NDVI and scNDVI obtained from S2 yields better LAI retrieval for mixed mangroves, such as that of Sundarban.

AB  - Recent literature reviews of bioassessment methods raise questions about use of least-impacted reference sites to characterize natural conditions that no longer exist within contemporary landscapes. We explore an alternate approach for bioassessment that uses species site occupancy data from museum archives as input for species distribution models (SDMs) stacked to predict species assemblages of freshwater fishes in Texas. When data for estimating reference conditions are lacking, deviation between richness of contemporary versus modeled species assemblages could provide a means to infer relative biological integrity at appropriate spatial scales. We constructed SDMs for 100 freshwater fish species to compare predicted species assemblages to data on contemporary assemblages acquired by four independent surveys that sampled 269 sites. We then compared site-specific observed/predicted ratios of the number of species at sites to scores from a multimetric index of biotic integrity (IBI). Predicted numbers of species were moderately to strongly correlated with the numbers observed by the four surveys. We found significant, though weak, relationships between observed/predicted ratios and IBI scores. SDM-based assessments identified patterns of local assemblage change that were congruent with IBI inferences; however, modeling artifacts that likely contributed to over-prediction of species presence may restrict the stand-alone use of SDM-derived patterns for bioassessment and therefore warrant examination. Our results suggest that when extensive standardized survey data that include reference sites are lacking, as is commonly the case, SDMs derived from generally much more readily available species site occupancy data could be used to provide a complementary tool for bioassessment.

AB  - The local knowledge of the wild species that goats consume in the areas surrounding the natural reserves contributes to the establishment of options for livestock production systems associated to the semiarid zones, with a focus on the preservation of the species, the economy of the farmers and the safeguarding of the environment. The objective was to develop a quantitative method to evaluate the forage importance index of these species (based on empirical knowledge), defined as the primary function played by a species of goat plant in the goat farmers culture in an area of buffering of the Sierra La Laguna Biosphere Reserve in Baja California Sur. Seventeen random surveys were carried out to develop the method and calculate the Forage Importance Index (FII) of the species, using eight indices (Abundance Perception Index, Frequency of Use Index, Consumed Organs Index, Consumption Season Index, Category Food and Index of Climatological Conditions) as well as the Salience Index and the Mention of Frequency. There were 37 species of plants associated with the area, the most abundant by family are 10 Fabaceaes, 4 Cactacea, 4 Euphorbiaceaes and 3 Asteraceaes. The most mentioned species include vinorama (Acacia farnesiana), palo zorrillo (Cassia emarginata), palo verde (Cercidium floridum) and ironwood (Pithecollobium confine).The five species with the highest value of FII include vinorama (Acacia farnesiana), palo zorrillo (Cassia emarginata), palo verde (Cercidium floridum), ironwood (Pithecollobium confine) and palo eva (Pithecellobium undulatum). This study collected the knowledge of the farmers about the value and the use of species and the species with the highest forage importance were determined.

AB  - The present study was carried out in Faxinal Reservoir, a warm monomictic, meso-eutrophic reservoir in subtropical southern Brazil, with a long-standing, well-stratified condition, low epilimnetic nutrient concentrations, and a relatively clear epilimnion. In this study, we analyzed the dynamics of the phytoplankton functional groups, recognizing their driving forces in Faxinal Reservoir. Samples were taken at monthly intervals from January 2004 to January 2005 in surface waters. According to the reservoir's mixing regime, three periods were identified during the study: stratification 1 (January-May 2004); mixing period (June-August 2004); and stratification 2 (September 2004-January 2005). The nutrient dynamics were driven by the mixing regime. The H1, F, and C phytoplankton functional groups were the most important in biomass, mainly represented by the N-fixing cyanobacterium Anabaena crassa, the colonial green alga with thick mucilaginous sheaths Nephrocytium sp., and the diatom Asterionella formosa, respectively. Tendencies pointed out by redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that the mixing regime was the main determining factor of the seasonal dynamics of the phytoplankton community. The dominant functional groups showed a close relationship with the relative water-column stability (RWCS), and also, as a consequence of the mixing regime, with nutrient availability. The study also revealed the important role of physical processes in the seasonal gradient, in selecting for phytoplankton functional groups and, consequently, in the assessment of ecological status. Q index (assemblage index) of water quality based on functional groups revealed ecological status varying from very poor to tolerable in the stratification 1 period and from tolerable to medium in the mixing and stratification 2 periods.

AB  - Statistical Process Control (SPC) methods are extensively used in manufacturing contexts to monitor production processes. This article illustrates their potential utility for monitoring the state of marine ecosystems, using survey indicators. We exemplify the use of one SPC tool, the cumulative sum (CUSUM) control chart, to detect persistent changes in the state of a system as new observations are collected, using simulated and real data. Practical guidelines are given on how the chart parameters can be tuned to achieve an acceptable compromise between the ability to detect anomalies quickly and keeping the risk of false alarms low. The common performance measures associated with control charts depend on some key assumptions being met, and the potential impact of their violation is indicated.

AB  - We report grating-coupled surface plasmon resonance measurements involving the use of dispersion images to interpret the optical response of a metal-coated grating. Optical transmission through a grating coated with a thin, gold film exhibits features characteristic of the excitation of surface plasmon resonance due to coupling with the nanostructured grating surface. Evidence of numerous surface plasmon modes associated with coupling at both front (gold/air) and back (gold/substrate) grating interfaces is observed. The influence of wavelength and angle of incidence on plasmon coupling can be readily characterized via dispersion images, and the associated image features can be indexed to matching conditions associated with several diffracted orders at both the front and back of the grating. These features collapse onto a set of global dispersion curves when plotted as peak energy versus the grating wavevector, with feature locations clustered according to the refractive index values of the neighboring dielectric material, either air or polycarbonate. Coating of the grating with multilayer arachidic acid films via Langmuir-Blodgett deposition results in red-shifting of some, but not all, of the plasmon features. The magnitude of the shift is a function of the film thickness, wavelength, and angle of incidence. Dispersion images clearly depict the red-shifting and also broadening of the front side features with increasing film thickness. In contrast, little change is observed in features associated with the back-side of the grating. The nature and magnitude of the interaction between the plasmon modes appearing at the front and back sides of the grating are discussed and analyzed in terms of the predicted interactions determined via optical modeling calculations.

AB  - An overview of both experimental and theoretical studies of cell electrophoresis mobility (EPM) over the past fifty years and the relevance of cell EPM measurement are presented and discussed from the viewpoint of exploring the potential use of cell EPM as an index of the biological condition of cells. Physical measurements of the optical and/or electrical properties of cells have been attracting considerable attention as noninvasive cell-evaluation methods that are essential for the future of cell-based application technologies such as cell-based drug screening and cell therapy. Cell EPM, which can be measured in a noninvasive manner by cell electrophoresis, reflects the electrical and mechanical properties of the cell surface. Although the importance of cell EPM has been underestimated for a long time, mostly owing to the technical difficulties associated with its measurement, recent improvements in measurement technology using microcapillary chips have been changing the situation: cell EPM measurement has become more reliable and faster. Recent studies using the automated microcapillary cell electrophoresis system have revealed the close correlation between cell EPM and important biological phenomena including cell cycle, apoptosis, enzymatic treatment, and immune reaction. In particular, the converged EPM distribution observed for synchronized cells has altered the conventional belief that cell EPMs vary considerably. Finding a new significance of cell EPM is likely to lead to noninvasive cell evaluation methods essential for the next-generation of cell engineering.

AB  - Two populations of catarina scallop, and their cross (F1), were evaluated for the age at first sexual maturity, and for their gonadal development in both populations' native environments. All experimental groups were hatchery produced. Differences in mean gonad index (MGI) were seen between the different environments. In Bahia Magdalena, a site characterized by high productivity and lower average water temperatures, the MGI was higher than for scallops grown in Bahia Concepcion, a bay with lower productivity and higher average water temperatures. Differences in age and size at first sexual maturity, defined as those when 50% of the scallops in any group were sexually mature, were seen between the populations when grown at Bahia Magdalena but not when grown at Bahia Concepcion. At Bahia Concepcion, none of the groups had reached their first sexual maturation after the experimental period of 7 mo. At Bahia Magdalena, the Magdalena population and the Fl reached sexual maturity at an early age of 4 mo, whereas the Concepcion population reached maturity when 5 mo old. Also for the Bahia Magdalena environment. the gonad index (GI) estimated at first sexual maturity for the Magdalena population and the Fl was significantly higher than that estimated for the Concepcion population at that same age. There were no significant differences in GI values when the groups were grown at Bahia Concepcion. The differences between populations in age at first sexual maturity suggest that a triggering mechanism exists in catarina scallop for the initiation of sexual maturation, whereas the differences between environments suggest that regardless of that mechanism, environmental conditions have a significant role in further maturation processes.

AB  - Environmental impacts of small scale projects are often assessed poorly, or not assessed at all. This paper examines the usability of the Rapid Impact Assessment Matrix (REAM) as a tool to prioritize project proposals for small scale water restoration projects in relation to proposals' potential to improve the environment. The REAM scoring system was used to assess and rank the proposals based on their environmental impacts, the costs of the projects to repair the harmful impacts, and the size of human population living around the sites. A four-member assessment group (The expert panel) gave the RIAM-scores to the proposals.
   The assumed impacts of the studied projects at the Eastern Finland water systems were divided into the ecological and social impacts. The more detailed assessment categories of the ecological impacts in this study were impacts on landscape, natural state, and limnology. The social impact categories were impacts to recreational use of the area, fishing, industry, population, and economy. These impacts were scored according to their geographical and social significance, their magnitude of change, their character, permanence, reversibility, and cumulativeness.
   The RIAM method proved to be an appropriate and recommendable method for the small-scale assessment and prioritizing of project proposals. If the assessments are well documented, the RIAM can be a method for easy assessing and comparison of the various kinds of projects. In the studied project proposals there were no big surprises in the results: the best ranks were received by the projects, which were assumed to return watersheds toward their original state.

AB  - Natural floodplains are spatially heterogeneous and dynamic ecosystems but at the same time, a highly endangered landscape feature due to climate change and human impacts such as water storage, flood control and hydropower production. Flow is considered a master variable that shapes channel morphology and the heterogeneity, distribution, and turnover of floodplain habitats. Despite their highly dynamic nature, the relative abundance of different habitat elements (islands, gravel bars) in natural floodplains seems to remain relatively constant over ecological periods and is referred to as the shifting mosaic steady state concept. In this conceptual context, we analysed spatiotemporal changes in relative habitat abundance and channel complexity of an alpine floodplain from its near natural state in 1940 before water abstraction and levee construction until 2007 using historical aerial images. Within the first decades of impairment, the relative abundance of floodplain habitats that depend on flood and flow pulses such as parafluvial channels and islands shifted toward a greater abundance of terrestrial forest and grassland habitats. After 1986, the duration and frequencies of high-precipitation events (>60?mm 24?h1) triggering major, channel-reworking floods increased substantially and caused a restructuring of the floodplain and decrease in the abundance of more terrestrial habitat types. These results are contrary to expectations of the shifting mosaic steady state concept yet suggest its potential application as an indicator of landscape transformation and human impacts on floodplain ecosystems. Last, the results raise the applied question as to whether an increased frequency of high flow events induced by climate change can contribute to floodplain restoration.

AB  - River Ganga covers around 26% of India's land area and sustains diverse ecosystems in this overly populated area. The globally accepted coherent approach of water quality indices (WQIs) and multivariate statistical models (principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA)) were applied on the dataset to evaluate the spatial-temporal variation and pollution source identification and apportionment. Twenty-two hydro-chemical parameters were analyzed by collecting the samples from 20 different vertically elevated monitoring locations for different seasons. The CA evaluation of data, grouped the monitoring locations into five clusters of varied water quality with human perturbations and geo-genic inputs. The PCA analysis of an extensive dataset indicated the seven significant principal components (PCs) explaining 93.0% of the total variance and finalized 8 water quality parameters out of preselected 22 to represent good aspects of the water quality. The seasonal variation in river water quality by the Canadian Council of Ministers for Environment Water Quality Index (CCMEWQI) showed the quality class at a marginal level in summer (62.16), monsoon (59.96), and post-monsoon (60.20) season, whereas in winters (71.18), water quality was in fair condition. The response of National Sanitation Foundation Water Quality Index (NSFWQI) classified the river water in medium quality class for summer, monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter season, respectively. The present observations contribute in the usefulness of these statistical methodologies to interpret and understand large dataset and also provide reliable information to reduce the tedious and cost of water quality monitoring and assessment programs.

AB  - Biological indicators can be used both to estimate ecological condition and to suggest plausible causes of ecosystem degradation across the U.S. Great Lakes coastal region. Here we use data on breeding bird, diatom, fish, invertebrate, and wetland plant communities to develop robust indicators of ecological condition of the U.S. Lake Superior coastal zone. Sites were selected as part of a larger, stratified random design for the entire U.S. Great Lakes coastal region, covering gradients of anthropogenic stress defined by over 200 stressor variables (e.g. agriculture, altered land cover, human populations, and point source pollution). A total of 89 locations in Lake Superior were sampled between 2001 and 2004 including 31 sites for stable isotope analysis of benthic macroinvertebrates, 62 sites for birds, 35 for diatoms, 32 for fish and macroinvertebrates, and 26 for wetland vegetation. A relationship between watershed disturbance metrics and N-15 levels in coastal macroinvertebrates confirmed that watershed-based stressor gradients are expressed across Lake Superior's coastal ecosystems, increasing confidence in ascribing causes of biological responses to some landscape activities. Several landscape metrics in particular-agriculture, urbanization, human population density, and road density-strongly influenced the responses of indicator species assemblages. Conditions were generally good in Lake Superior, but in some areas watershed stressors produced degraded conditions that were similar to those in the southern and eastern U.S. Great Lakes. The following indicators were developed based on biotic responses to stress in Lake Superior in the context of all the Great Lakes: (1) an index of ecological condition for breeding bird communities, (2) diatom-based nutrient and solids indicators, (3) fish and macroinvertebrate indicators for coastal wetlands, and (4) a non-metric multidimensional scaling for wetland plants corresponding to a cumulative stress index. These biotic measures serve as useful indicators of the ecological condition of the Lake Superior coast; collectively, they provide a baseline assessment of selected biological conditions for the U.S. Lake Superior coastal region and prescribe a means to detect change over time.

AB  - The concentrations of the sixteen United States Environmental Protection Agency polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were determined in dusts from different land-use types in Benin City by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results obtained were used to assess the ecological and human health risk and to determine the source apportionment. The -16 PAH concentrations in dusts from Benin City ranged from 230 to 2300 mu g kg(-1) for industrial areas, 211-1330 mu g kg(-1) for commercial areas, 153-1170 mu g kg(-1) for residential areas, and from 216 to 1970 mu g kg(-1) for school playgrounds/parks. The ecological risk assessment suggested that the levels of PAHs in dusts from these land-use types are of low-to-moderate risk to organisms. The benzo(a)pyrene carcinogenic potency [BaPTEQ] (70.5-131 mu g kg(-1)) and benzo(a)pyrene mutagenic potency [BaPMEQ] (62.9-122 mu g kg(-1)) concentrations were below the Canadian soil quality guideline value of 600 mu g kg(-1). The incremental lifetime carcinogenic risk (ILCR) arising from exposure of adults and children to PAHs in dusts from Benin City were in the magnitude of 10(-4)-10(-2), which exceeded the safe target levels of 10(-6), implying a considerable cancer risk for residents of this city. The PAH source apportionment derived from isomeric ratios and multivariate statistics indicated that burning of biomass, wood, and charcoal, and vehicular traffic were the predominant sources of PAHs in dusts from Benin City.

AB  - In Chennai city, India, the industrial outfalls, port activities and anthropogenic activities dump a significant amount of waste in the riverine belts of two major rivers, viz. Cooum and Adayar. Hence, this paper aims to study the occurrences and sources of 16 priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) enlisted in United States Environmental protection Agency. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed that total PAHs in surface riverine sediment ranged from 136 to 2063 ng/g (Average +/- SD, 654 +/- 801 ng/g dw) for Cooum and 105-1710 ng/g (Average +/- SD, 380 +/- 593 ng/g) for Adayar. Generally, high molecular weight PAHs were higher than low molecular weight PAHs. A prevalence of high molecular weight carcinogenic PAHs was suspected due to incomplete combustion. Principal component analysis and diagnostic ratios revealed that emission sources were from pyrogenic (vehicular emissions), as well as significant contribution was from petrogenic inputs. Principal component analysis also revealed that for both riverine sediments in PC1 65% of high molecular weight compounds were from informal e-waste recycling area and industrial corridor possibly associated with industrial effluents and recycling activities. The ecological risk assessment using probable effect level estimation suggested that PAHs are likely to cause no adverse effect or slightly adverse in all the sites of Cooum and Adayar excluding in residential sites (CR-03, AD-02) and e-waste site (CR-16) which were under heavy and moderate ecological impact. Further toxic equivalent factor also showed that residential site (AD-02) was affected by moderate level loading of benzo[a]pyrene.

AB  - his study reports a reduction of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in large-sized, older Atlantic tomcod (Mi-crogadus tomcod) collected in the St. Lawrence Estuary (Quebec, Canada) and investigates its relationship over a 4-year period to sex, gonadosomatic index (GSI), condition factor (CF) and cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) mRNA levels. In addition, the concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were measured in a subsample of fish. The reduction of EROD activity with age was observed each year in both sexes and was not related to the GSI. A high proportion of large-sized fish, with a body length greater or equal to 225 mm, were emaciated (CF < 0.55). A 6-16-fold reduction of EROD activity and a 2-4-fold reduction of CYP1A mRNA levels were observed in large-sized emaciated females compared to small-sized non-emaciated females. Concentrations of PCB s in liver increased from 1000 to 4000 ng/g lipid weight as the hepatic lipid content and the CF decreased. The inter-annual variation of EROD activity was associated with the variation in CF with lowest EROD activity and CF in 1999. When emaciated fish were excluded from the analyse, EROD activity was still lower (2-5-fold) in large compared to small fish and was no longer related to CF. For similar levels of CYP1A mRNA EROD activity was lower in large compared to small fish. Thus, there was post-transcriptional inhibition of CYP1A activity in large-sized tomcod, indicative of cellular dysfunction. This response may be related to aging, chronic exposure to toxic contaminants or to selective pressures favoring less resprasive individuals. This study demonstrates that fish age, size, and CF are important variables to consider in studies using EROD activity as an indicator of environmental contamination. The main finding was that a large part of the reduction of CYP1A with age in St. Lawrence Estuary tomcod was associated with severe emaciation of a large proportion of large-sized fish. Hepatic concentrations of contaminants covaried with the CF and the effects of these two variables on CYP1A could not be discriminated. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is no clear "life quality" concept in world legislation. The interdisciplinary nature of the term "life quality" is revealed, which stimulates scientists' research from different science branches. The history of the origin of the term and its transition from medicine to other areas is shown. It was held an overview of the main approaches to understanding the quality of life and indicators used in a broad and narrow sense. The differences in the perception of this among scientists and ordinary people are emphasized. Scientists are looking at the problem more broadly, given the projected impact of human activity on all environmental elements (water, air, land, biodiversity, human health, life expectancy). The population begins to associate the indicator of "health" with the environment, for the most part, only after having health problems and life-threatening. It is shown that the current legislation of Ukraine notes the direct dependence of the health of the Ukrainian people on the environmental security of the state, and the state assumes responsibilities for its provision. The author's scheme of factors of ecological influence on the quality of life of people is offered. The threat posed to human health because of goods and services of "demonstrative consumption" and its promotion by the media has been revealed. Proven the need for explanatory work among the population to understand the relationship between the state of the environment and human life quality, particularly health, life expectancy, reproductive capacity, has been proved. The importance of strengthening state and public control over the use of environmental resources was noted. Emphasis is placed on the need for further research to identify indicators that show the individual perception of the Ukraine population of environmental safety as a component of quality of life and their assessment of areas to improve environmental safety (ways, methods, and tasks). This study should be conducted, considering the indicators used in other countries and international scientific organizations.

AB  - Ecosystem-based fisheries management necessitates that we take a more holistic view of the many factors affecting ecosystems. All too often, perturbations to fisheries ecosystems are studied in isolation even though there may be important interactions among them that yield unexpected ecosystem states. The Northeast US continental shelf large marine ecosystem (NES LME) has undergone a number of changes in biophysical processes, trophic structure, and exploitation rates over the last fifty years. Changes in community assemblages, shifts in spatial distribution of many species, and the failure of fisheries to fully recover from overexploitation in the NES LME have been attributed to both the removal of large demersal fish predators and climate variability, as well as indirect effects cascading through the food web. As with many ecosystems, it is difficult to separate the effects of multiple perturbations that can affect marine ecosystems. However, recent advances in ecosystem modeling allow us to explore the relative and synergistic effects of these perturbations in silica that would otherwise be impossible in situ or experimentally. We examined the relative effects of warming and removal of large predators by modeling both of these effects separately and then in combination. Interactions amongst such changes tended to be additive, but the magnitude of synergistic effects was potentially very large in some cases. These results demonstrate the power of ecosystem models in evaluating management options. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To investigate the vertical changes of toxic elements in Jurassic sediments, sampling was performed in four sites. Samples were collected from sandstones and mudstones/marls and analyzed for some toxic elements (Cu, Pb, Zn, As, Ni and V). Results exhibited that the sediment grain size played a significant role in controlling the concentrations of the toxic elements in the sediments. The mean toxic element contents of mudstones/marls were higher than those of sandstones (except Cu). The contamination level of toxic elements was detected by enrichment factor (EF), geo-accumulation index (I-geo), potential ecological risk index (E-r(i)), pollution index (Pi) and united pollution index (PIn). The low EF, I-geo, E-r(i), Pi and PIn for Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, V in the sandstones and Cu, Zn, Ni in the mudstones/marls exhibited an absence of clear these elements pollution. The high EF, E-r(i), Pi and PIn for As (9.7, 73, 7 and 29, respectively, as mean values) in the sandstones and for As (49.3, 222, 22 and 75, respectively, as mean values) Pb (8.8, 24, 5 and 19, respectively, as mean values), V (8.3, 15, 7 and 39, respectively, as mean values) in the mudstones/marls indicated significant contamination. Additionally, according to the potential ecological risk (RI) values, the sandstones had low potential ecological risk for the toxic elements (RI<150) and the mudstones/marls had moderate potential ecological risk (150<less than or equal to>RI <= 300). The potential ecological risk As, Pb, V (especially As) were higher in urban areas than in agricultural activities. Therefore, the source of As, Pb, V could be gasoline combustion, burning coal and vehicle exhausts. The contents of these elements generally increased from bottom to top of the measured stratigraphic sections, which indicated transported by atmospheric conditions.

AB  - Several geographical areas where Salvator merianae is distributed in Argentina are included in regions with agricultural activity and exposed to pesticide formulations. Some pesticides could affect defense mechanisms being able alter structures of some components of immune and endocrine systems. To assess the potential effects of pesticides in this reptile under seminatural conditions, on the immune system and endocrine responses in S. merianae we analyzed several blood parameters. Total (TWBCC), differential (DWBCC) white blood cells count, heterophils/lymphocytes index (H/L), lobularity index (LI), natural antibodies (NAbs) titres, complement system (CS), and corticosterone concentration were analyzed in animals exposed to a mixture of cypermethrin (25%), glyphosate (66.2%) and chlorpyrifos (48%) formulations. In addition, body size was considered in these analyzes. TWBCC and NAbs revealed lower values in organisms exposed to pesticides respect to a control indicating a possible immunosuppression effect. Besides, the LI showed a greater number of lobes in organism exposed demonstrating symptoms of chronic infection. In addition, we observed a reduced growth in these animals possibly related to a less energy investment in body mass to maintain an active defense against pesticides. Finally, we found high levels of plasma corticosterone in animals exposed to mix formulation that could demonstrate neuroendocrine axis activation. Other parameters like DWBCC, H/L index and activity of CS showed no differences in treated animals respect to control group, which could indicate low sensibility of these parameters to the concentration of pesticides used. Our results provide evidence of the toxic effects of pesticides on different immune system parameters, but also a trade-off among these parameters, corticosterone levels and growth. In this way, we can conclude that the formulated pesticides applied widely and constantly in the areas occupied by S. merianae, would be affecting its immune and endocrine systems and therefore its ability to defend against external agents. This kind of studies is of great interest to know the possible responses of wild species to anthropogenic disturbances such as pesticide contamination.

AB  - During the last 15 years several authors studied the disinfection in waste stabilisation pond (WSP) and several empirical models were developed. There are huge differences between the models describing this process and there is really a need to improve the design of ponds for better disinfection. This paper addresses the Escherichia coli and enterococci disinfection in a laboratory pilot scale maturation pond (1.5 l) with light intensity (0, 12 and 25 W/m(2)) under controlled pH, temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions. The aim of this study is to improve modelling for a better design of disinfection in maturation ponds (MP) and to identify the key parameters influencing the process. It was found that kinetic coefficients K values for E. coli and enterococci are closely dependent on physicochemical parameters. K values increase with increasing pH, I, T and DO. E. coli disinfection depends closely on the pH and the DO and increases strongly when the pH is above 8.5. The enterococci disinfection depends essentially on DO. Two equations are suggested to calculate the kinetic coefficient K related to the environmental average state variables.

AB  - The flat oyster Ostrea edulis (Linnaeus, 1758) is a commercially valuable species in Europe. The production of O. edulis natural spat has decreased in the past, and it is insufficient to meet demand. Thus, the importance of hatcheries in the production of oyster spat is increasing. The conditioning of O. edulis broodstock may be improved by manipulating several external factors such as temperature, food supply, and photoperiod; however, few studies have reported the effect of these parameters on O. edulis gametogenesis and conditioning. In this report, the combined effects of temperature and photoperiod on broodstock conditioning of O. edulis in winter were studied to provide a protocol that improves flat oyster conditioning. After a resting period in autumn, in winter, oysters' gonads are restructured, and the natural process of gonadal maturation is initiated. Oyster gonads showed follicles in intermediate maturation stages, with the presence of both male and female germinal cells in the same follicles but at different stages of maturation. The combined effect of temperature (TG14-18) and photoperiod on oyster conditioning in winter was evaluated by using direct indexes. Oysters conditioned with a gradient of temperature and a gradient of daylight (PG8-16), a P16 regime or under natural environmental conditions began to spawn 4 wk after the beginning of conditioning. Oysters treated with a P8 regime needed a week more to start spawning. Spawning was a continuous process that lasted for 7 wk. When the total amount of released viable larva was compared, the positive influence of photoperiod was much more evident. Total larval production was two or three times higher in the oysters treated with a gradient of daylight (PG8-16). In summary, using the conditions of temperature and photoperiod described in this study (TG14-18 and PG8-16), it was possible to improve flat oyster conditioning in winter, producing an important amount of viable larvae over a period of 2 mo.

AB  - Over the last fifteen years, Environmental Assessment systems of transitional societies of Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia have undergone dramatic change from appraisals integrated into centrally planned economies to formal procedures aimed to ensure interdisciplinary analysis of environmental impacts and linked to publicly accountable decision-making. In most Central European nations, EA systems have been radically reformed to approximate the procedures used in developed countries, particularly in the European Union. In contrast, EA in most of the former Soviet republics has been reformed more gradually and is still based on the so-called State Environmental Review procedure inherited from the USSR and substantially different from 'Western' EA. About one-third of the transitional countries tin the Balkans, the Caucasus and Central Asia) have, so far, failed to establish functioning EA systems. Throughout the region, there has been a gap between EA legislation and practice, especially concerning interdisciplinary analysis of environmental impacts, public participation, and utilisation of EA findings in decision-making. A key driving force in the reform of EA systems has been the change in their societal context, the so-called 'process of transition '. Three main policy agendas - environmental protection, reforms of decision-making, and conforming to international requirements - along with the institutional context of EA regulations and practice have influenced both the change of EA systems over time and the regional variations in the patterns of their evolution. This study suggests that an effective reform of an EA system should be context-sensitive, or be 'in gear' with the political and economic transition. Future EA research should consider their changing societal contexts and focused on practical effects of applying EA procedures. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB  - Environmental evaluation plays a significant role in the development of the culture and economy in modern times. When the environmental condition becomes degraded, the complete evaluation of ecological analysis is highly necessary to evaluate the environment. Hence, the development of a scientific assessment system of environmental assessment is highly significant in the development of the culture and economy. In this research, the present state of environmental evaluation is discussed, and the evaluation system is integrated through a computational process. Secondly, an environmental evaluation system is presented to establish the model in the evaluation process. Further, in this research, Advanced Artificial Intelligence Framework (AIF) for environmental development and protection has been proposed to improve the culture and economy in modern times. Studies reports indicate clear connections between the criteria of environmental assessment, the protection and development of the environment. The practical application of study findings involves establishing specific proposals for reducing pollution and improving the protection of the environment in China.

AB  - Areas with minimal anthropogenic influences are frequently used as reference sites and represent the best ecological state available in a region. Streams in such conditions are necessary for evaluating the conservation status of aquatic ecosystems of a region and to monitor them, taking natural environmental variability into consideration. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to analyse whether hydrological units are reliable regional units for aggregating reference sites. To this end, reference sites were studied in three different landscape units of the same hydrological unit. The study tested the hypothesis that water quality, physical habitat structure and the composition and structure of macroinvertebrate assemblages will be more similar for sites in the same landscape unit than for sites located in different landscape units in the same hydrological unit. The study showed that taxonomic richness and composition of the macroinvertebrate assemblages were negatively affected by site slope and positively affected by the presence of leaf packs on the streambed. The three landscape units supported significantly different macroinvertebrate assemblages and indicator taxa. Therefore, a hydrological unit does not constitute a homogeneous entity in terms of environmental variables and biological composition if it incorporates high landscape heterogeneity. These results should improve and facilitate the selection of reference sites for biomonitoring programs and for managing tropical headwater streams.

AB  - The New Zealand fish fauna contains species that are affected not only by river system connectivity, but also by catchment and local-scale changes in landcover, water quality and habitat quality. Consequently, native fish have potential as multi-scale bioindicators of human pressure on stream ecosystems, yet no standardised, repeatable and scientifically defensible methods currently exist for effectively quantifying their abundance or diversity in New Zealand stream reaches. Here we report on the testing of a back-pack electrofishing method, modified from that used by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, on a wide variety of wadeable stream reaches throughout New Zealand. Seventy-three first- to third-order stream reaches were fished with a single pass over 150-345 m length. Time taken to sample a reach using single-pass electrofishing ranged from 1-8 h. Species accumulation curves indicated that, irrespective of location, continuous sampling of 150 stream metres is required to accurately describe reach-scale fish species richness using this approach. Additional species detection beyond 150 m was rare (10%) with a single additional species detected at only two out of the 17 reaches sampled beyond this distance. A positive relationship was also evident between species detection and area fished, although stream length rather than area appeared to be the better predictor. The method tested provides a standardised and repeatable approach for regional and/or national reporting on the state of New Zealand's freshwater fish communities and trends in richness and abundance over time.

AB  - Unprotected streams within the agricultural Midwest region of the United States are subject to sedimentation, nutrification, and agricultural chemicals. Grass riparian filter strips (GRFSs) have been implemented as a best management practice to minimize sedimentation and associated materials that are harmful to aquatic ecosystems; however, few studies have examined the benthic community response to CRFS installation. This study introduces a least-desired index (LDI) multimetric approach of evaluating benthic communities in response to GRFS installation. LDI was determined in a reciprocal fashion to that of a benthic macroinvertebrate index of biotic integrity (B-IRI). When reference conditions are not available for the use of B-IBI, anti-reference sites, representing least-desired conditions, can be used in constructing an LDI. A B-IBI and LDI were constructed in the Claypan Till Plains Subsection of Missouri and comparatively used to evaluate two test sites where tall fescue GRFS were installed. Five metrics were used to develop the B-IBI and six for the LDI. The LDI tended to be more conservative at evaluation in comparison to the B-IBI. Paired t-tests showed that LDI and B-IBI were significantly different at scoring test sites. The LDI assessed both test sites as showing no response to GRFS installation, whereas the B-IBI suggested moderate improvement. The LDI was considered to be a better index for evaluation because the streams used to develop the B-IRI were not suitable reference sites. An argument for the use of chironomid based rnetrics in low gradient agricultural streams is presented.

AB  - As the main grain production area in China, Jilin Province has a significant ecological function in Northeast China. Scientifically understanding the spatial and temporal characteristics of ecological vulnerability can aid in effectively managing environmental changes, guiding rational use of land resources and developing strategies for regional environmental protection. Applying the Sensitivity Resilience Pressure (SRP) conceptual model of ecological vulnerability, integrated with meteorological, remote sensing, and statistical data, a comprehensive evaluation index system for ecological vulnerability was established in Jilin Province. An entropy weight model constructed with analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to calculate weights of each indicator. Using a geographical information system, the geospatial and temporal features of ecological vulnerability were analyzed from 2000 to 2018 in the study area. Spatial autocorrelation analysis was utilized to probe the spatial relationship. The results indicate that the ecological vulnerability was categorized a potential and light within the study area and that variations among different regions increased gradually from east to west. High levels of ecological vulnerability were mainly distributed in the western area, displaying a significant global spatial autocorrelation with high-high (HH) aggregation. Over time, the proportion of high vulnerability areas decreased from 14% in 2000 to 9% in 2018, while low vulnerability areas increased from 26% in 2000 to 29% in 2018. The results reflect the condition of the regional ecological environment, which could have implications for ecological protection and sustainable development in the Jilin Province.

AB  - The ectoparasitic dagger nematode (Xiphinema index), vector of Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV), provokes gall formation and can cause severe damage to the root system of grapevines. Mycorrhiza formation by Glomus (syn. Rhizophagus) intraradices BEG141 reduced both gall formation on roots of the grapevine rootstock SO4 (Vitis berlandierixV. riparia) and nematode number in the surrounding soil. Suppressive effects increased with time and were greater when the nematode was post-inoculated rather than co-inoculated with the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus. Using a split-root system, decreased X. index development was shown in mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal parts of mycorrhizal root systems, indicating that both local and systemic induced bioprotection mechanisms were active against the ectoparasitic nematode. Expression analyses of ESTs (expressed sequence tags) generated in an SSH (subtractive suppressive hybridization) library, representing plant genes up-regulated during mycorrhiza-induced control of X. index, and of described grapevine defence genes showed activation of chitinase 1b, pathogenesis-related 10, glutathione S-transferase, stilbene synthase 1, 5-enolpyruvyl shikimate-3-phosphate synthase, and a heat shock proein 70-interacting protein in association with the observed local and/or systemic induced bioprotection against the nematode. Overall, the data suggest priming of grapevine defence responses by the AM fungus and transmission of a plant-mediated signal to non-mycorrhizal tissues. Grapevine gene responses during AM-induced local and systemic bioprotection against X. index point to biological processes that are related either to direct effects on the nematode or to protection against nematode-imposed stress to maintain root tissue integrity.

AB  - The benefits provided by a healthy ocean are receiving increasing attention in policy and management spheres. A fundamental challenge with assessing ocean health and ecosystem services is that we lack a scientific framework for expressing ecosystem conditions quantitatively in relation to management goals. Here we outline and operationalize a conceptual framework for identifying meaningful reference points and quantifying the current ecosystem state relative to them. The framework requires clear articulation of management goals and is built on a review of current scientific understanding and assessment of data availability. It develops a structured approach for choosing among three classes of reference points, including: (1) functional relationships that establish the ocean state that can be produced and sustained under different environmental conditions, (2) time series approaches that compare current to previous capacities to obtain a particular ocean state in a specific location, and (3) spatial reference points that compare current capacities to achieve a desired ocean state across regional (or, if necessary, global) scales. We illustrate this general framework through the lens of ocean health defined in terms of a coupled social-ecological system, with examples from fisheries, marine livelihoods, and water quality in the USA. Assessment of ocean health and ecosystem services can be significantly influenced by the choice of indicators used to track changes in a management goal, the type of reference point selected, and how one measures the distance of the current state from the reference point. This framework provides flexible, standardized methods for evaluating ocean health and ecosystem services that can advance important components of ecosystem-based management, including marine spatial planning, ecosystem service valuation, and integrated ecosystem assessments.

AB  - The present research work is based on an electrochemical technique in combination with powdered activated carbon (PAC) for the removal of micropollutants by adsorption as an advanced stage purification step from effluents of pilot plant wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). The effluents of sedimentation tank comprised of wastewater plus PAC (WWPAC). The pilot plant mainly consists of two parts: the first one consists of electrocoagulation (EC) reactor, and the second consists of electrophoretic deposition (EPD) discs and electroflotation (EF) setup. The electrocoagulation (EC) reactor consisted of the electrode material (Al and Fe). Both types of electrodes have been tested with the outflow of sedimentation tank. The outflow from the sedimentation tank has been entered into the EC reactor for the determination of EC reactor efficacy for the successful accomplishment of EC process at the designed pilot plant for WW treatment. The effect of different operational parameters, PAC dosage (20 mg), electrode nature (Fe and Al) and current density (0.34-2.02 A/m(2)), has been studied to find out the optimum conditions. Sludge volume index (SVI) of the sludge, thermogravimetric (TG), differential thermal analyses (DTA) and particle size distribution (PSD) of the flocs generated after the EC process has also been studied. The turbidity, pH and conductivity of effluents before and after EC treatment have also been carried out. The research work performed detailed analysis of the wastewater effluents at pilot plant scale and gave promising results for future work in advance wastewater treatment direction.

AB  - We are developing a spatial, multigear, multispecies population dynamics simulation model for tropical tunas in the Pacific Ocean. The model is age-structured to account for growth and gear selectivity. It includes a tuna movement model based on a diffusion-advection equation in which the advective term is proportional to the gradient of a habitat index. The monthly geographical distribution of recruitment is defined by assuming that spawning occurs in areas where sea surface temperature is above 25 degrees C. During the first 3 months of their life, simulated tunas are transported by oceanic currents, after which movement is conditioned by gradients in the habitat index. Independent estimates of natural mortality rates and population size from large-scale tagging experiments carried out by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community are used in the simulations. The habitat index consists of components due to forage density and sea surface temperature, both of which are suspected to play major roles in determining tuna distribution. Because direct observations of forage are not available on a basin scale, we developed a submodel to simulate the surface tuna forage production (Lehodey et al., 1998). At present, only skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis; a surface tuna species caught by purse seine and by pole-and-line) is considered, at a 1 degrees-square resolution and on a monthly climatological time series. Despite the simplicity of the model and the limitations of the data used, the simulation model is able to predict a distribution of skipjack catch rates, of the different fleets involved in the fishery, that is fairly consistent with observations.

AB  - This paper presents the formulation of dynamic stiffness matrix for the natural vibration analysis of porous power-law functionally graded Levy-type plate. In the process of formulating the dynamic stiffness matrix, Kirchhoff-Love plate theory in tandem with the notion of neutral surface has been taken on board. The developed dynamic stiffness matrix, a transcendental function of frequency, has been solved through the Wittrick-Williams algorithm. Hamilton's principle is used to obtain the equation of motion and associated natural boundary conditions of porous power-law functionally graded plate. The variation across the thickness of the functionally graded plate's material properties follows the power-law function. During the fabrication process, the microvoids and pores develop in functionally graded material plates. Three types of porosity distributions are considered in this article: even, uneven, and logarithmic. The eigenvalues computed by the dynamic stiffness matrix using Wittrick-Williams algorithm for isotropic, power-law functionally graded, and porous power-law functionally graded plate are juxtaposed with previously referred results, and good agreement is found. The significance of various parameters of plate vis-a-vis aspect ratio (L/b), boundary conditions, volume fraction index (p), porosity parameter (e), and porosity distribution on the eigenvalues of the porous power-law functionally graded plate is examined. The effect of material density ratio and Young's modulus ratio on the natural vibration of porous power-law functionally graded plate is also explained in this article. The results also prove that the method provided in the present work is highly accurate and computationally efficient and could be confidently used as a reference for further study of porous functionally graded material plate.

AB  - The changes in macrobenthos community depended on changes in stream discharge (from 0.001 m(3)/sec to 100 m(3)/sec) were studied on the basis of data from 254 stations of 180 streams located in the centre of European part of Russia. While discharge of stream increases community composition changes considerably. Species diversity increases from 12 to 47 species per station with the increase in stream size. Moreover, the diversity of almost all groups, discerned according habitat or trophic position and main taxonomic groups (with the exception of Plecoptera and Diptera) increases with the increase in stream discharge. The diversity of lithorheophilic species and species inhabiting soft substrates is higher in small streams, whereas phitophilic species are more diverse in large streams. With the increase in stream size the percent of algophagous and filter feeders increases, percent of carnivorous remains the same and the percent of detritophages decreases. The relative role of invertebrates macrotaxons change with the stream size: in the smallest streams the diversity is the highest among Diptera, Trichoptera and Plecoptera, in medium-size streams - among Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera and Diptera, in large streams - in Ephemeroptera, Gastropoda and Trichoptera. In some groups some species replace other (close-related) in parallel with change in stream discharge however in general this tendency is weak. The index of saprobic conditions increases with the increase in stream size from 1.6-1.7 to 2.3-2.4. In small streams the saprobic conditions are very different whereas large streams have tendency to be at beta-mesosaprobic level. Cluster analysis reveal four size classes of streams. Peculiarities of habitat and macrobenthos fauna of these classes are described.

AB  - MAO function into consideration, MAO is the enzyme included in the etiology and pathogenesis of various neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. The finding of the decreased platelet MAO activity in various psychiatric disorders has brought us to the assumption that this enzyme may be a constitutional/genetic indicator (trait marker) or an indicator of disease condition (state marker) in biologic psychiatry. There are only a few studies of alcohol addiction researching the connections of the MAO coding gene polymorphism and alcoholism; however, these studies are primarily related to the variable number of tandem repeats (VTNR) polymorphism in the regulatory gene region for MAO-A, considered to influence the transcription activity/functionality of the enzyme.

AB  - Sediment samples from the Gomti River basin were investigated to determine and evaluate trace metal concentrations, their biological effect, and potential ecological and human health risks for adults and children. The mean concentrations of trace metals were organized in the descending order of mercury (Hg) (0.08 mg/kg) > chromium (Cr) (0.06 mg/kg) > lead (Pb) (0.05 mg/kg) > arsenic (As) (0.02 mg/ kg) > cadmium (Cd) (0.01 mg/kg). The current study illustrated that metals were attributed to the area from natural sources and different anthropogenic sources especially from industries. However, the concentration levels were lower than the sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) based on the effect-range classifications of threshold effect concentration (TEC) and probable effect concentration (PEC). Therefore, the concentration of the elements showed no adverse biological effects on aquatic organisms. The evaluated potential ecological risk index also revealed the low toxicity to the aquatic environment. Moreover, the applied sediment quality indices, geo-accumulation index (I-geo), contamination factor (CF), and contamination severity index (CSI) suggested that the contamination levels of the elements were in the acceptable range, and the contamination had not notably impacted on the sediment quality. The risk index (HI) concerning age groups was significantly less than the threshold limit of 1 indicating that the contamination had no non-carcinogenic risk effect. The total carcinogenic risk (TCR) was less than a risk value of 1 x 10(-4). Hence, the current study suggests that immediate remediation is not required due to an absence of alarming conditions in the study area. Proper monitoring of the attribution of the metal elements should be done for the betterment of human and environmental health.

AB  - Planning for extensive cascading hydropower dam exploitation in the southwest of China has been the subject of debate and conflict in recent years. The middle reach of the Lancang-Mekong River, a typical region for cascading hydropower dam construction, was selected as a study area to explore the composition, biomass and biological integrity of phytoplankton assemblages before and after such construction. Sampling sites along the longitudinal gradient of this river were chosen to measure phytoplankton assemblages in 1988 (pristine state), 1997 (completion of the first dam), and 2011 (cascading dams). The results indicated that composition and abundance were greatly altered by the construction and operation of cascading dams. The phytoplankton assemblages were found to be sensitive indicators in the assessment of aquatic ecosystem health degradation associated with cascading dams. The phytoplankton index of biotic integrity (P-IBI) was developed as a comprehensive and quantitative index to assess the variation in biological integrity and aquatic ecosystem degradation before and after the construction of cascading dams. The effects of the cascading dams on the aquatic ecosystem were serious and more complex than the effects of a single dam. The ecological and longitudinal connectivity of the aquatic ecosystem and the natural diversity of aquatic habitats transitioned in several impoundment areas due to the influence of the cascading dams. Increasing abundance and biomass of phytoplankton assemblages in reservoir areas can lead to degradation of the aquatic ecosystem compared with natural riverine ecosystems. Cascading hydropower dams can cause cascades and accumulation effects on the riverine ecosystem. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) and bulk organic geochemical parameters were examined for a short core from the Bohai Sea, a Yellow River-dominated continental margin. A three end member mixing model using branched/isoprenoid tetraethers (BIT) index, delta C-13 and C/N shows that the average fractions of soil, marine and plant organic matter (OM) during the period of 1933-2011 are 67.7% (38-92%), 26.1% (0-58%) and 6.2% (0-23%), respectively. Abrupt changes of sedimentary OM compositions around 1953, 1976 and 1996 are synchronous with the Yellow River mouth relocations. The BIT index values (0.33-0.80) present a stronger correlation with crenarchaeol abundance (R-2 = 0.88) than branched GDGTs abundance (R-2 = 0.27), suggesting that variations of marine Thaumarchaeota abundance rather than soil OM inputs is the first order factor controlling the BIT index values, although this proxy has been widely used for soil OM. The comparison between the BIT index, nutrient status and historical Yellow River sediment load indicates that the high sensitivity of the BIT index to the Yellow River channel shifts cannot be explained by a nutrient stimulation mechanism, but instead is likely caused by the restriction of Thaumarchaeota growth in highly turbid water due to the enormous sediment inputs from Yellow River. Our study demonstrates that local conditions should be considered when applying the BIT index as an environmental proxy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Using archaeological data of two human intestinal parasites from seventeenth-to early twentieth-century contexts, we explore the intersection of biological and cultural variables that shaped the ecology of cities in northeastern North America during the modern period. These parasites are useful because they require a developmental period in the soil, thus providing a link between human activities and changing environments. Prior to the last decades of the eighteenth century, Trichuris eggs dominate the archaeoparasitological assemblage. Around 1800, there is a shift to increasing proportions of Ascaris eggs, which appears to be largely complete by 1850-a period of increasing urbanization in the northeast United States. Both environmental and behavioral factors play a role in this shift and include the relationship between parasite biology and changing microenvironments, attempts to deal with waste, and use of urban spaces. During this period, poorer households would likely have been at greater risk of parasites because of the ways they used yard spaces, their delayed access to sanitary technology, and the changing nature of urban vegetation in densely occupied neighborhoods.

AB  - The Convention on Biological Diversity uses six indicators to assess progress toward Aichi Biodiversity Target 14 (ecosystem services), leaving many elements of the target untracked. We identify 13 ecosystem services as directly essential for human well-being, and select a set of 21 datasets as indicators of the state of natural capital underpinning those services, the benefits derived from them, and distribution of access to those benefits. Analysis of these indicators supports previous conclusions that there is no overall progress toward Target 14. Sixty percent of our "benefit" indicators have positive trends, whereas 86% of our "state" indicators show a decline in natural capital. This suggests that well-being is increasing in the near-term despite environmental degradation, and that unsustainable use of natural capital may fuel human development. As regulating services such as "soil fertility" continue to decline, however, it seems unlikely that this trend can continue without future negative impacts on humanity.

AB  - Microbial biofilms are useful indicators for monitoring the ecological state of rivers. When assessing the effects of toxicants on microbial communities in natural ecosystems, special attention must be paid to the distinction between such effects and those resulting from other environmental variables. The pollution-induced community tolerance (PICT) approach offers the means to partially isolate effects of individual toxicants within a complex ecosystem by studying shifts in community sensitivity. To validate PICT for site-specific risk assessment, we investigated how closely diuron tolerance acquisition by photoautrophic biofilm communities could reflect their previous in situ exposure to this herbicide. To this end, a field survey was conducted for 9 months in a French river contaminated by diuron inputs from adjacent vineyards. Spatio-temporal variations in diuron tolerance capacities of photoautotrophic communities were estimated monthly using short-term photosynthetic bioassays. The biological survey was coupled with intensive physico-chemical monitoring to analyze the environmental factors influencing tolerance induction. We revealed a possible influence of three co-varying environmental variables (nitrates, conductivity and temperature), but statistical analysis clearly demonstrated that the main factor explaining variation in diuron sensitivity was the mean in situ diuron exposure level during biofilm colonization periods. A remarkable exponential correlation between EC50 values and in situ diuron concentrations (R-2=0.90, p < 0.0001) was recorded, confirming that PICT can be a powerful tool for the environmental monitoring of rivers.

AB  - Ecosystems have become a primary focus for conservation efforts seeking to maintain native freshwater biodiversity. Inherent in lotic ecosystem studies is consideration of the influences that multiscale environmental properties have on the state of biological communities and ecological processes, herein referred to more generally as stream integrity. The Watershed Habitat Evaluation and Biotic Integrity Protocol (WHEBIP) was developed to provide rapid assessment of stream integrity for stream segments throughout watersheds based on riparian and subbasin features interpreted principally from aerial imagery and topographic maps. Protocol calibration was based on relationships between WHEBIP scores and aquatic community and aquatic habitat field data collected in the French Creek watershed, Chautauqua County, NY, USA. A test of the protocol in the Cussewago Creek watershed, Crawford and Erie Counties, PA, USA, indicated that the WHEBIP can be used as a generalized-stream integrity rapid-assessment tool, especially related to fish communities. However, the protocol's ability to predict stream macroinvertebrate biological integrity measures was limited, emphasizing that it should be used primarily as a stratification tool to guide the classification of stream integrity within watersheds.

AB  - The essence of the basin-landscape approach to the protection of the lakes of the national parks as an actual direction of research, which is formed at the junction of nature protection landscaping, hydrology and geoecology has been substantiated. The research algorithm, peculiarities of analysis and assessment of the status of the lake-basin system (LBS) have been found out, the factors that worsen the geo-ecological state in the lake and basin subsystems have been revealed, optimization measures in the objects of the nature reserve fund located within the natural reserve have been substantiated.
   The purpose of the study is to determine the parameters of the structure of lake-basin landscapes (on the example of Zasvitske lake, Nobel National Natural Park, Ukraine), liminary and landscape-metric indicators of the geo-ecological status of the LBS and the factors influencing it as an information and analytical basis for ensuring the protection and management of the LBS located in nature conservation area.
   The materials of the study were the long-term field landscape-limnological and geo-ecological studies of the authors within the Polesia region of Ukraine and, in particular, the LBS of the Nobel National Nature Park.
   The results of geo-ecological (landscape-ecological) researches of the lake-basin system of Zasvitske lake have been presented, in particular, original profiles and bathymetric model of the reservoir, landscape maps of the aqual complex and the lake catchment, limno- and landscape characteristics of the LBS have been shown. Considering the level of anthropogenic transformations of the LBS and the presence of a high proportion of ecologically-stabilizing lands (forests, reservoirs of natural origin), the level of sustainability of the LBS is estimated as high. An assessment of the hydrological characteristics of the reservoir and hydrochemical characteristics allows to attribute this lake to an oligotrophic type. The results of a comprehensive analysis of the geo-ecological parameters of the state of Zasvitske lake and its landscape-limnological functioning indicate the expediency of recreational specialization of nature management in the Nobel National Park, that includes this lake.
   Scientific novelty. The application of proposed landscape-basin approach and the algorithm of the LBS study increase the possibilities of functional zoning of national parks with high index of lakes, as well as solving the problems of nature protection and optimization of nature management.
   Practical importance. The created electronic landscape maps and the base of limnometric parameters can be used as reference documents for the certification and cadastral evaluation of the transboundary protected areas of Ramsar type, geo-ecological monitoring and an integrated management of lakes by the basin approach in conditions of intense climate change.

AB  - The Bay of Biscay (North-East Atlantic) has long been subjected to intense direct and indirect human activities that lead to the excessive degradation and sometimes overexploitation of natural resources. Fisheries management is gradually moving away from single-species assessments to more holistic, multi-species approaches that better respond to the reality of ecosystem processes. Quantitative modelling methods such as Ecopath with Ecosim can be useful tools for planning, implementing and evaluating ecosystem-based fisheries management strategies. The aim of this study was therefore to model the energy fluxes within the food web of this highly pressured ecosystem and to extract practical information required in the diagnosis of ecosystem state/health. A well-described model comprising 30 living and two non-living compartments was successfully constructed with data of local origin, for the Bay of Biscay continental shelf. The same level of aggregation was applied to primary producers, mid-trophic-levels and top-predators boxes. The model was even more general as it encompassed the entire continuum of marine habitats, from benthic to pelagic domains. Output values for most ecosystem attributes indicated a relatively mature and stable ecosystem, with a large proportion of its energy flow originating from detritus. Ecological network analysis also provided evidence that bottom-up processes play a significant role in the population dynamics of upper-trophic-levels and in the global structuring of this marine ecosystem. Finally, a novel metric based on ecosystem production depicted an ecosystem not far from being overexploited. This finding being not entirely consistent over indicators, further analyses based on dynamic simulations are required. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Oxidative damage plays an important role in leading to major health-related events. The aim of this study was to assess the predictive value of a lipoprotein peroxidation marker, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) for incident mobility limitation (ML).
   Methods: Data are from 2985 well-functioning elders enrolled in the Health ABC study (median follow-up, 4.1 years). All oxLDL levels were measured at the baseline assessment. The oxLDL/LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) ratio (log value) was used as a measure of lipoprotein peroxidation. Mobility limitation was defined by 2 consecutive semiannual reports of any difficulty either walking 1/4 mile or climbing up 10 steps without resting. Severe ML was defined by 2 consecutive reports of great difficulty or inability to do the same tasks. Cox proportional hazards models were performed to assess hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
   Results: The mean (SD) age of the sample was 74.2 (2.9) years. After adjustment for potential confounders (Sociodemographic factors, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, clinical conditions, biological markers, and medications), the relationship between the oxLDL/LDL-C ratio and disability events was statistically significant (per log-unit difference in the oxLDL/LDL-C ratio) (for ML: HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.06-1.41; for severe ML: HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.15-1.79). Consistent results were found when interleukin 6 level was included as a covariate in the adjusted models (ML HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.98-1.31; severe ML: HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.05-1.64). No significant sex, race, interleukin 6 level, or clinical conditions interaction was found with the oxLDL/LDL-C ratio and mobility disability.
   Conclusions: Lipoprotein peroxidation predicts the onset of ML in older persons. The oxLDL predictive value for ML is partly explained by interleukin 6 levels.

AB  - Horizontal drilling with hydraulic fracturing (HDHF) relies on the use of anthropogenic organic chemicals in proximity to residential areas, raising concern for groundwater contamination. Here, we extensively characterized organic contaminants in 94 domestic groundwater sites in Northeastern Pennsylvania after ten years of activity in the region. All analyzed volatile and semi-volatile compounds were below recommended United States Environmental Protection Agency maximum contaminant levels, and integrated concentrations across two volatility ranges, gasoline range organic compounds (GRO) and diesel range organic compounds (DRO), were low (0.13 +/- 0.06 to 2.2 +/- 0.7 ppb and 5.2-101.6 ppb, respectively). Following dozens of correlation analyses with distance-to-well metrics and inter-chemical indicator correlations, no statistically significant correlations were found except: (1) GRO levels were higher within 2 km of violations and (2) correlation between DRO and a few inorganic species (e.g., Ba and Sr) and methane. The correlation of DRO with inorganic species suggests a potential high salinity source, whereas elevated GRO may result from nearby safety violations. Highest-concentration DRO samples contained bis-2-ethylhexyl phthalate and N,N-dimethyltetradecylamine. Nevertheless, the overall low rate of contamination for the analytes could be explained by a spatially-resolved hydrogeologic model, where estimated transport distances from gas wells over the relevant timeframes were short relative to the distance to the nearest groundwater wells. Together, the observations and modeled results suggest a low probability of systematic groundwater organic contamination in the region.

AB  - The EC Water Framework Directive (WFD) clearly states that undisturbed reference states of aquatic ecosystems should be used to set standards for restoration. Across Europe defining biological reference status and setting boundaries for ecological status classes continues to represent a major challenge. In the present study we investigate if a paradigm exists among experts that can guide the development of assessment systems based on the normative definitions of ecological status classes of the WED. Our main questions were: 1) Will experts from species abundance data and typology descriptors independently arrive at similar assessments of ecological status, and 2) Can the expert interpretation of ecological status be transferred into a statistical model allowing for a standardization of assessments from plant assemblages in lowland streams? We used a large dataset covering 1244 randomly distributed stream sites in Denmark and asked a group of experts to independently classify the sites using the WFD's normative definitions of ecological status. According to the combined expert group, no Danish stream sites belonged to the undisturbed reference state. For the remaining ecological status classes we found good concordance in the classification made by the five experts. From this we infer that a common paradigm does exist, which may guide the development of assessment methods for aquatic plants in lowland streams. We also found that the common view of the experts could be transferred into a supervised classification model that can serve as a classification tool for aquatic plant assemblages in lowland streams. We conclude that the combined use of experts and advanced multivariate statistics can provide a useful approach in the development of systems for assessment of ecological status in water types, where a reference network cannot be established.

AB  - The use of biological indicators is widespread in environmental monitoring, although it has long been recognised that each bioindicator is generally associated with a range of potential limitations and shortcomings. To circumvent this problem, this study adopted the complementary use of bioindicators representing different trophic levels and providing different type of information, in an innovative approach to integrate knowledge and to estimate the overall health state of ecosystems. The approach is illustrated using mercury contamination in primary producers (mosses), primary consumers (domestic pigeons and red-legged partridges) and top predators (Bonelli's eagles) in southern Portugal. Indicator kriging geostatistics was used to identify the areas where mercury concentration was higher than the median for each species, and to produce an index that combines mercury contamination across trophic levels. Spatial patterns of mercury contamination were consistent across species. The combined index provided a new level of information useful in incorporating measures of overall environmental contamination into pollution studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved

AB  - Climate change metrics have been used to quantify the exposure of geographic areas to different facets of change and relate these facets to different threats and opportunities for biodiversity at a global scale. In parallel, a suite of indicators have been developed to detect approaching transitions between alternative stable states in ecological systems at a local scale. Here, we explore whether particular geographic areas over the world display evidence for upcoming critical transitions in the temperature regime using five Early Warning Indicators (EWIs) commonly used in the literature. Although all EWIs revealed strong spatial variations regarding the likelihood of approaching transitions we found differences regarding the strength and the distribution of trends across the world, suggesting either that different mechanisms might be at play or that EWIs differ in their ability to detect approaching transitions. Nonetheless, a composite EWI, constructed from individual EWIs, showed congruent trends in several areas and highlighted variations across latitudes, between marine and terrestrial systems and among ecoregions within systems. Although the underlying mechanisms are unclear, our results suggest that some areas over the world might change toward an alternative temperature regime in the future with potential implications for the organisms inhabiting these areas.

AB  - A major problem in mental health clinical trials, such as depression, is low assay sensitivity in primary outcome measures. This has contributed to clinical trial failures, resulting in the exodus of the pharmaceutical industry from the Central Nervous System space. This reduced assay sensitivity in psychiatry outcome measures stems from inappropriately broad measures, recall bias, and poor interrater reliability. Limitations in the ability of traditional measures to differentiate between the trait versus state-like nature of individual depressive symptoms also contributes to measurement error in clinical trials. In this viewpoint, we argue that ecological momentary assessment (EMA)-frequent, real time, in-the-moment assessments of outcomes, delivered via smartphone-can both overcome these psychometric challenges and reduce clinical trial failures by increasing assay sensitivity and minimizing recall and rater bias. Used in this manner, EMA has the potential to further our understanding of treatment response by allowing for the assessment of dynamic interactions between treatment and distinct symptom response.

AB  - Aim. To assess the results of determination of glycation end-products (GEPs) by skin autofluorescence (AF) in patients on chronic hemodialysis (HD).
   Subjects and methods. A device made in Russia was used to estimate skin AF intensity in 40 apparently healthy individuals and in 76 patients treated with chronic HD. While analyzing the findings, comparisons were made in both groups; a relationship between skin AF intensity and clinical and laboratory parameters was also investigated in patients on HD.
   Results. The intensity of AF in the patients treated with chronic HD proved to be significantly higher than that in the control group. There was a direct correlation of the intensity of AF with age in both groups and that with the duration of dialysis treatment in patients on HD. In patients with coronary heart disease, the intensity of AF was significantly higher than in those without this condition. The intensity of AF directly correlated with the Charlson comorbidity index in the patients on HD. There were no correlations of skin AF intensity with main generally detected laboratory blood indicators, body mass index, and the nature of drug therapy in the patients on HD.
   Conclusion. Tissue GEP levels may serve as a cumulative index of metabolic stress in HD patients. The determination of GEP by measuring the intensity of skin AF may be used to assess prognosis in patients treated with chronic HD.

AB  - The knowledge on the biodiversity and coastal habitats specific for the macro-algae is extremely important both for their harvest and for monitoring the data on marine environment. The biodiversity and marine habitats along the Romanian Black Sea shore have been characterised through the values of the specific decisional indicators, which did not suffer important modifications compared to the year 2004. The knowledge on the biodiversity and coastal habitats specific for the macro-algae is extremely important both for their harvest and for monitoring the data on marine environment. The state of biodiversity, defined through the total number of identified species along the Romanian shore is of about 2926 (113 bacteria, 683 micro-algae, 138 macro-algae, 1.730 invertebrates, 108 fishes, 150 birds and 4 mammals) and 29 threatened species (EN and VU). Concerning the coastal habitats diversity, they have been classified in 4 types depending on the water column and 8 types depending on the substrate. The description of the marine habitats specific for the macro-algae evinces that the rocky substrates are the ones on which the richest macro-algal vegetation can be found.

AB  - The monitoring of the environmental components condition, exposed to the influence of the cement production enterprises, was the aim of the conducted research. One of the largest cement production factories in Russia, where the territory of negative impact has a total area of over 300 square kilometers, was the object of the study. The observations of the dust content in atmospheric air, as well as the determination of degradation degree of vegetation in the area of influence of the considered production facility were conducted. Chemical and granulometric composition of the cement dust, which is emitted in atmospheric air, were identified in the laboratory. Mapping model, which indicates the complex ecological welfare of the territory, exposed to the cement production industry, was compiled by the authors on the basis of the data, obtained in conducted research. The mapping model takes into account both the content of dust in near-ground atmosphere, and the extent of its deposition to soil, vegetation and surface water bodies.

AB  - The special geography and human environment of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has created the unique hydrochemical characteristics of the region's natural water, which has been preserved in a largely natural state. However, as the intensity of anthropogenic activities in the region has continued to increase, the water environment and hydrochemical characteristics of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau have altered. In this study, water samples from the western, southern, and northeastern border areas of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, where human activities are ongoing, were collected, analyzed, and measured. The regional differences and factors controlling them were also investigated. The key results were obtained as follows. (1) Differences in the physical properties and hydrochemical characteristics, and their controlling factors, occurred in the different boundary areas of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. These differences were mainly the consequence of the geographical environment and geological conditions. (2) The water quality was good and suitable for drinking, with most samples meeting GB (Chinese national) and WHO (World Health Organization) drinking water standards. (3) The chemical properties of water were mainly controlled by the weathering of carbonates and the dissolution of evaporative rocks, with the former the most influential. (4) The biological quality indicators of natural water in the border areas were far superior to GB and WHO drinking water standards.

AB  - Environmental monitoring aims to evaluate the state of nature, and to detect emerging threats (Lindenmayer and Likens 2009, Nie and Schultz 2012). Yet, the cautionary principle of science may hamper detection at the risk of reduced ecosystem health. Of particular concern are changes in the functioning of entire communities (Walther 2010), where potential consequences of change are devastating. Clear-cut indicators at the community-scale are, however, hard to derive. Here, we define an indicator of the community-wide scope and timing of pollen carrying capacity. We apply this measure to long-term monitoring data of High Arctic plants and pollinators to reveal that with current and future arctic warming, the timing of plant flowering and pollen transfer seems to be heading towards a functional disruption. By drafting this community-wide perspective on interaction phenology, we aim to direct attention to an impending functional disruption in the Arctic - and more broadly to stimulate functionally-oriented research into how ecosystems are responding to climate change.

AB  - Multiple fish-based indices of biotic integrity (FIBI) exist to estimate stream health using fish community structure. Yet, these metrics require different amounts of data and may result in different interpretations of stream health. We compared functionality of "low-metric" (5 metrics) and "metric-rich" (12 metrics) coldwater FIBIs for estimating stream health in 138 coldwater streams of northeastern Iowa, USA. Then, we investigated associations between FIBI scores and environmental factors at local and catchment scales using mixed effects linear regression. FIBI scores from both protocols were positively correlated (R-2 = 0.77); the majority of streams scored fair (n = 31, mean = 45; fair) using the metric-rich index but scored very poor using the low-metric index (n = 35, mean score = 25; poor). FIBI scores were higher (mean = good) when Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis were present with both indices. When Brook Trout were absent, scores were lower and less variable with the low-metric index (mean = 19.63; poor) compared to the metric-rich index (mean = 40.38; fair). Local habitat was more related to both FIBI scores than catchment-scale habitat: maximum daily stream temperature and bare bank severity index were negatively correlated with both FIBI scores whereas canopy coverage correlated positively with metric-rich FIBI scores. Brook Trout presence was indicative of coldwater stream health for both indices. Our results suggest the metric-rich FIBI index has improved ability to differentiate lower quality sites due to increased sensitivity. Our results can be used to improve stream health estimates and restoration prioritizations.

AB  - 1. The River Alaknanda is a tributary of the River Ganges, originating from the Garhwal Himalaya in India and sustaining about 39 fish species from 15 genera and five families.
   2. A diversity index has been calculated for the fish communities ranging from 0.407 to 0.593; no significant difference in diversity was noted at the three sampling sites which is attributed to the homogeneity of the ecological conditions. A similarity index was found to be high between the sampling sites and ranged from 93.47 to 100.
   3. The categories of threats to the fish and priority for species conservation have been determined. Fourteen species were assigned as Abundant, seven species as Vulnerable, 15 species at Lower Risk, one species as Data Deficient while two species were assigned as Endangered.
   4. The conservation of fish has been given little attention in India. The options for the conservation of the fish dwelling in the Alaknanda include ex situ and in situ conservation, habitat restoration, translocation and captive breeding.
   5. The creation of fish sanctuaries and public awareness of the importance of fish species and their conservation will be critical for the proper conservation and management of the Garhwal Himalayan fish. Significantly, there are some parts of the river where fish are preserved out of religious sentiments. Careful nurturing of such sentiments may prove to be highly beneficial.

AB  - Aim. To identify the degree of influence of the morphological heterogeneity of the territory on the ecological state of the agricultural landscape. Methods The study was conducted on an area of 608.5 hectares and a horizontal dissection factor of 8.36 km/km(2). For the observations, distributed test pads measuring 10 m(2) were used. On each type of facies, test sites were laid on arable land in triplicate. We used standard research methods using GIS. Existing thematic terrain maps were digitized and a digital elevation model based on a topographic survey of the terrain was created. Calculations and visualization of data are made using and based on the ArcGIS and Microsoft Excel software. Results. The degree of influence of the types of facies of the landscape area on individual criteria and indicators of arable land productivity (microclimatic indicators, water properties of the soil, elements of fertility) has been established. Spatial ecologically justified differentiation of types of tracts into facies types has been carried out. Main conclusions. The slopes of the northern exposure (I-IVn) have the highest ecological stability. They lead in the content of productive moisture, mobile phosphorus and potassium. The facies of the slopes of the southern exposure (I-IVs) lead by insolation, the content of humus and nitrate nitrogen. The content of heavy metals in the soils and wheat yield is higher on the southern slopes and second-order watersheds (IVn). The maximum productivity of 2.9 t/ha was obtained on the watershed type of facies (V). A close relationship was established (r = -0.72) between productivity and pH of soil, medium - with mobile forms of phosphorus (r = 0.59) and potassium (r = 0.84).

AB  - Assessing the ecological integrity of freshwater ecosystems has become a priority to protect the threatened biodiversity they hold and secure future accessibility to the services they provide. Some of the most widespread applications of biological indicators are fish-based indices. These have mostly mirrored the approach proposed by Karr 30years ago (Index of Biotic Integrity; IBI), based on the comparison of observed and expected composition and structure of local fish assemblages in the absence of major perturbations, using the so-called reference condition approach. Despite the notable success of the implementation of fish-based indices, most of them overlook non-native species as a source of ecosystem degradation, and evaluations are focused on the physico-chemical condition of freshwater ecosystems and their effects on freshwater biodiversity. Almost 90% of 83 reviewed IBIs did not consider non-native species when defining reference conditions. Most IBIs used non-native species in conjunction with native ones to construct the metrics that conform to the index. The response of the IBI to the effect of non-native species has hardly ever been tested. When developing and evaluating IBIs, attention was mostly directed to ensuring the correct response of the index to physico-chemical parameters, which could otherwise be characterized more effectively using alternative methods. Current application of IBIs entails a misuse of biological indicators by overlooking some types of degradation that cannot be otherwise evaluated by traditional methods. This constrains the capacity to adequately respond to one of the most challenging and common threats to the conservation of freshwater fish diversity.

AB  - The cloud-forests of the Western Ecuadorean Andes are highly diverse and underthreat from anthropogenic habitat disturbance. Reptiles are sensitive to habitat change and are therefore useful indicators of ecosystem state. Overall diversity has been shown to be highest in old-growth (primary) forest, although older secondary forests can recover to near pre-disturbance levels. We systematically surveyed leaf -litter lizard diversity along a gradient of disturbance in a montane cloud-forest fragment whilst controlling for the potentially confounding effect of elevation. We deployed 21 pitfall trap-lines equally between primary forest, secondary forest of mid-age (18-30 years), and agroforestry, between three altitudinal bands for ten days each over a period of three years. We investigated diversity patterns using Chao 1 and 2 indices (estimated richness), effective species number (ESN), relative abundance of individual species, relative abundance of pooled species, and observed species richness. We also conducted an opportunistic inventory of reptile species. We recorded 7 species of leaf -litter lizards and 15 other species of squamate, the majority of which are rare, recently described and/or of restricted distribution. Elevation was strongly negatively correlated with diversity. Richness and most indices of diversity were higher in primary forest but abundance was similar in primary forest and agroforestry. ESN followed a negative linear response to disturbance but for all other measures agroforestry supported diversity that was either higher than or equal to secondary forest. We conclude that, particularly at high elevations, mid-aged secondary forest is depauperate of leaf-litter lizards but agroforestry potentially supports relatively large populations of generalist species.

AB  - The length-weight relationship and condition factor have been broadly investigated in snails to obtain the index of physical condition Of Populations and evaluate habitat quality. Herein, our goal was to describe the best predictors that explain Achatina fulica biometrical parameters and well being in a recently introduced population. From November 2001 to November 2002, monthly snail samples were collected in Lauro de Freitas City, Bahia, Brazil. Shell length and total weight were measured in the laboratory and the potential curve and condition factor were calculated. Five environmental variables were considered: temperature range. mean temperature, humidity, precipitation and human density. Multiple regressions were used to generate models including multiple predictors, via model selection approach, and then ranked with AIC criteria. Partial regressions were used to obtain the separated coefficients of determination of climate and human density models. A total of 1.460 individuals were collected, presenting a shell length range between 4.8 to 102.5 mm (mean: 42.18 nm). The relationship between total length and total weight revealed that Achatina fulica presented a negative allometric growth. Simple regression indicated that humidity has a significant influence on A. fulica total length and weight. Temperature range was the main variable that influenced the condition factor. Multiple regressions showed that climatic and human variables explain a small proportion of the variance in shell length and total weight, but may explain LIP to 55.7% of the condition factor variance. Consequently, we believe that the well being and biometric parameters of A. fulica can be influenced by climatic and human density factors.

AB  - Aim. Assessment of natural landscapes of the North Caucasus in order to increase the efficiency of their use for agriculture on the basis of modern updated data.
   Material and Methods. Research on the assessment of the state of natural landscapes was carried out by modern methods, including remote sensing using systemic, analytical and comparative geographical analysis methodologies.
   Results. In agricultural terms, the use of semi-desert landscapes is limited because a lack of moisture. Accordingly, they are most suitable as pastures (especially in winter), haymaking, and also for the cultivation of melons. Agriculturally flat and hilly warm-temperate and moderate semi-arid landscapes are the most favorable landscapes for crop production: the main form of use of these landscapes is as arable land. Lowland temperate semi-humid landscapes, which are widespread in the North Caucasus foothills, are also quite favorable for agricultural production.
   Conclusion. We have established that in order to increase the efficiency of use of landscapes of the North Caucasus, high-quality zoning is necessary with the subsequent development of agro-reclamation measures.

AB  - This paper presents the results of the hydrochemical, hydrobiological, and paleolimnological studies of 17 Arctic lakes in the Pechora River delta. Water samples and surface sediments were collected during the 2020 summer expedition to the Nenets State Nature Reserve. Based on the chemical composition of their waters, the studied lakes belong to the chloride class, sodium group II. Overall, they are characterized by shallow depths typical of this region, low mineralization (below 200 mg/L) and water hardness, as well as high dissolved oxygen levels. To assess the ecological status of the lakes, cladocerans and their subfossil remains, which have been widely recognized as reliable indicators for tracking long-term changes in the development of freshwater ecosystems, were analyzed. A total of 23 cladoceran taxa were identified. The dominant species were Bosmina longispina (Leydig, 1860) and Chydorus cf. sphaericus (Muller, 1776) - either of these species, often displacing each other, prevailed in the lakes. Other cladoceran species were low-abundant and found sporadically: Sida crystallina (Muller, 1776), Pleuroxus uncinatus (Baird, 1850), Coronatella rectangula (Sars, 1862), and Bythotrephes longimanus (Leydig, 1860). The study also reports the first finding of Rhynchotalona latens (Sarmaja-Korjonen, Hakojarvi and Korhola, 2000), a rare glacial relict species with a narrow distribution range, in this region of Russia. The zoogeographical analysis of the data obtained on the identified taxa showed that species typical of the Palearctic and Holarctic zones prevail in the cladoceran communities under study.

AB  - We evaluated the ability of chip-based digitg PCR (dPCR) to quantify enterococci, the fecal indicator recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) for water-quality monitoring. dPCR uses Poisson statistics to estimate the number of DNA fragments in a sample with a specific sequence. Underestimation may occur when a gene is redundantly encoded in the genome and multiple copies of that gene are on one DNA fragment. When genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted using two commercial DNA extraction kits, we confirmed that dPCR could discern individual copies of the redundant 23s rRNA gene in the enterococcal genome. dPCR quantification was accurate when compared to the nominal concentration inferred from fluorometer measurements (linear regression slope = 0.98, intercept = 0.03, R-2 = 0.99, and p value <0.0001). dPCR quantification was also consistent with quantitative PCR (qPCR) measurements as well as cell counts for BioBall reference standard and 24 environmental water samples. qPCR and dPCR quantification of enterococci in the 24 environmental samples were significantly correlated (linear regression slope =1.08, R-2 of 0.96, and p value <0.0001); the group mean of the qPCR measurements was 0.19 log units higher than that of the dPCR measurements. At environmentally relevant concentrations, dPCR quantification was more precise (i.e., had narrower 95% confidence intervals than qPCR quantification). We observed that humic acid caused a similar level of inhibition in both dPCR and qPCR, but calcium inhibited dPCR to a lesser degree than qPCR. Inhibition of dPCR was partially relieved when the number of thermal cycles was increased. Based on these results, we conclude that dPCR is a viable option for enumerating enterococci in ambient water.

AB  - Aquatic insects are widely used as indicator taxa to assess the ecological state of streams and to evaluate the success of stream restoration projects. Information on intraspecific genetic diversity and population connectivity is often lacking for such indicator taxa. However, these parameters are of critical importance for restoration plans and conservation management because: 1) species sometimes consist of several cryptic species and 2) species can recolonize only those restored habitats within a reachable distance from their source populations. Gene flow generally cannot be observed directly, and molecular markers provide a reasonable alternative to assess the dispersal potential and evaluate species' genetic diversity. We investigated the genetic diversity and dispersal potential of the predatory stonefly Dinocras cephalotes using 323 specimens from 29 populations in the Sauerland, a low mountain range in Germany. We used a 658 base pair (bp) fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) and found 2 distinct and diverse haplotype groups, which were shared across most populations. The groups were separated by a minimum intraspecific p-distance of 4.3%, suggesting historic isolation and possible presence of cryptic species. However, complementing analyses of the nuclear Wingless gene and 3 newly developed microsatellite markers clearly showed that individuals from both COI haplotype groups are interbreeding, and therefore, D. cephalotes is considered a single valid species. Population comparisons indicated high connectivity among all populations, with only a few individual populations showing signatures of isolation. Based

AB  - In this study, coupled Pb concentration/Pb isotope data were used to evaluate the effect of a shooting range (operational for over 30 years) on Pb contamination of adjacent agricultural soils and the associated environmental risks. Lead was mainly concentrated in the arable layer of the contaminated agricultural soils at total concentrations ranging from 573 to 694 mg kg (-aEuro parts per thousand 1). Isotopic analyses (Pb-206/Pb-207) proved that Pb originated predominantly from the currently used pellets. Chemical fractionation analyses showed that Pb was mainly associated with the reducible fraction of the contaminated soil, which is in accordance with its predominant soil phases (PbO, PbCO3). The 0.05 M EDTA extraction showed that up to 62% of total Pb from the contaminated site is potentially mobilizable. Furthermore, Pb concentrations obtained from the synthetic precipitation leaching procedure extraction exceeded the regulatory limit set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for drinking water. Ion exchange resin bags showed to be inefficient for determining the vertical distribution of free Pb2 + throughout the soil profile. Increased Pb concentrations were found in the biomass of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) sampled at the studied site and two possible pathways of Pb uptake have been identified: (1) through passive diffusion-driven uptake by roots and (2) especially through atmospheric deposition, which was also proved by analyses of a bioindicator species (bryophyte Hypnum cupressiforme Hedw.). This study showed that shooting ranges can present an important source of Pb contamination of agricultural soils located in their close vicinity.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities such as agricultural practices can have large effects on the ecological components and overall health of stream ecosystems. Therefore, having a better understanding of those effects and relationships allows for better design of mitigating strategies. The objectives of this study were to identify influential stream variables that correlate with macroinvertebrate indices using biophysical and statistical models. The models developed were later used to evaluate the impact of three agricultural management practices on stream integrity. Our study began with the development of a high-resolution watershed model for the Saginaw River watershed in Michigan for generating in-stream water quality and quantity data at stream reaches with biological sampling data. These in-stream data were then used to explain macroinvertebrate measures of stream health including family index of biological integrity (FamilyIBI), Hilsenhoff biotic index (HBI), and the number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera taxa (EPTtaxa). Two methods (stepwise linear regression and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS)) were evaluated for developing predictive models for macroinvertebrate measures. The ANFIS method performed the best on average and the final models displayed the highest R-2 and lowest mean squared error (MSE) for FamilyIBI (R-2=0.50, MSE=29.80), HBI (R-2=0.57, MSE=0.20), and EPTtaxa (R-2=0.54, MSE=6.60). Results suggest that nutrient concentrations have the strongest influence on all three macroinvertebrate measures. Consistently, average annual organic nitrogen showed the most significant association with EPTtaxa and HBI. Meanwhile, the best model for FamilyIBI included average annual ammonium and average seasonal organic phosphorus. The ANFIS models were then used in conjunction with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool to forecast and assess the potential effects of different best management practices (no-till, residual management, and native grass) on stream integrity. Based on the model predictions, native grass resulted in the largest improvement for all macroinvertebrate measures. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Riverine ecosystems in their natural state are complex mosaics of habitats whose conditions vary across space and time as landscape features filter prevailing hydrologic forcing. Yet, through anthropogenic alteration many large river systems have become simplified through the construction of levees and dams that reduce lateral connectivity and flow variability. The extent to which shifts in habitat mosaics create conditions that support different trophic responses that manifest in differences in fish growth across the landscape remains largely untested. This is primarily due to limitations in linking habitat features, dynamic physical processes, and trophic transfer of energy to higher taxa at the landscape scale. Here, we conducted large-scale enclosure experiments across varying habitats on a fluvial floodplain as a model system to measure factors that influence habitat-specific growth rates in multiple Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) stocks important to fisheries and of conservation concern. Using an ecosystem approach, we reveal that landscape context, water residence time, and habitat type (agricultural, wetland, river channel) result in different hot-spots of primary and secondary food production. This variation in the aquatic foodscape resulted in significant variation in salmon growth rates and ultimate size and morphology across the landscape. Floodplain habitats generally exhibited higher water residence times as highlighted by higher specific conductance, salinity, and chlorophyll-a values. Pelagic invertebrate abundance was 10 to 100 times more abundant in the off-channel habitats compared to the river channels. The average daily growth rates of the juvenile Chinook Salmon ranged from 0.15 mm day(-1) and 0.01 g day(-1) in the riverine habitat to 0.55 mm day(-1) and 0.07 g day(-1) in the off-channel habitat. These data were used to build mixed effects models that showed the influence of chlorophyll-a concentration, water temperature and pelagic invertebrate composition on fish growth across locations throughout the experiment. As landscapes become increasingly simplified there is increased risk of losing the mosaic of habitats necessary to achieve enhanced fish growth and phenotypically diverse and sustainable salmon populations. This in-situ experimental and modeling approach can be applied to other systems to develop ecosystem indicators such as habitat-specific fish growth rates to manage landscapes and processes to support resilient fish populations.

AB  - This article is devoted to the search for optimal conditions for environmental and economic security of oil main pipelines using classical calculus of variations. The goal functions here are either stochastic reliability criteria for deterministic parametric criteria, or parametric criteria for specified reliability criteria. The functions of the optimization process are environmental and technological indicators of the system, taking into account the characteristics of oil pipelines or a set of measures to improve their reliability. The arguments are environmental and economic indicators that reflect the impact of control actions on the state of the environment and on the level of costs for the implementation of proposals. The formulation and study of the variational problem showed that only the introduction of environmental technologies and structures can minimize the cost of ensuring the safety of the impact of oil main pipelines on the host ecosystem.

AB  - Boosted regression tree (BRT) models were developed to quantify the nonlinear relationships between landscape variables and nutrient concentrations in a mesoscale mixed land cover watershed during base-flow conditions. Factors that affect instream biological components, based on the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI), were also analyzed. Seasonal BRT models at two spatial scales (watershed and riparian buffered area [RBA]) for nitrite-nitrate (No-2-NO3), total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and total phosphorus (TP) and annual models for the IBI score were developed. Two primary factors - location within the watershed (i.e., geographic position, stream order, and distance to a downstream confluence) and percentage of urban land cover (both scales) - emerged as important predictor variables. Latitude and longitude interacted with other factors to explain the variability in summer NO2-NO3 concentrations and IBI scores. BRT results also suggested that location might be associated with indicators of sources (e.g., land cover), runoff potential (e.g., soil and topographic factors), and processes not easily represented by spatial data indicators. Runoff indicators (e.g., Hydrological Soil Group D and Topographic Wetness Indices) explained a substantial portion of the variability in nutrient concentrations as did point sources for TP in the summer months. The results from our BRT approach can help prioritize areas for nutrient management in mixed-use and heavily impacted watersheds.

AB  - The present investigation was undertaken to evaluate yield criteria in narbon vetch (Vicia narbonensis L.), one of the most promising feed/forage crops for the arid and semi-arid regions, using correlation, path and principal component analyses (PCA) in true Mediterranean climate conditions. The trials were conducted under rainfed conditions in trial fields at Faculty of Agriculture, Akdeniz University in Antalya-Turkey (approximately 30 44' E, 36 degrees 52' N, 51 m above the sea level) for two growing seasons. The experiment design was a Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications. The correlation analysis results revealed that seed yield was positively and significantly correlated with biological yield, number of pods per plant, plant height, harvest index and number of seeds per plant. The PCA showed that first five components explained 79% of the existing variation in genotypes and demonstrated especially the roles of biological yield and number of main braches per plant as strong determining traits controlling the overall variation. Path analysis showed that biological yield, harvest index and number of seeds per plant had strong positive direct effects on the enhancement of seed yield of narbon vetch. The overall results in this study suggested that narbon vetch breeding studies should focus on biological yield, number of pods per plant, plant height, harvest index and number of seeds per plant, number of main branches per plant, 1000-seed weight and pod length for high seed yield.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess physico-chemical water parameters, granulometric sediment characteristics and concentrations of trace and macroelements in the water and sediments of the Ilova River. Samplings were conducted at three sampling sites (near villages Maslenjaca, Ilova and Trebez) along the Ilova River, differing in the source and intensity of the anthropogenic influence. This study indicated disturbed environmental conditions, most pronounced in the downstream part of the river (Trebez village) impacted by the activity of fertilizer factory. Water from the Ilova and Maslenjaca villages was of good quality, whereas COD, nitrates and phosphates exceeded the good quality levels in Trebez village. Trace and macroelement concentrations in water were mostly below thresholds set by environmental quality standards at all locations, but levels of Al, As, Cd and Ni were few times higher in Trebez village than at other locations. Metal contamination assessment of sediments (trace and macroelement concentrations, contamination and enrichment factor, pollution load index) confirmed deteriorated environmental quality in Trebez village. However, the overall assessment performed in this study revealed that anthropogenic impact was still not particularly strong in the Ilova River ecosystem. Nevertheless, the observed water and sediment characteristics serve as a warning and suggest that stricter protection measures should be initiated, including continuous monitoring and comprehensive quality assessment of the downstream part of the Ilova River, especially because it is a part of the protected area of the Lonjsko Polje Nature Park.

AB  - Heavy metal contamination risk in agricultural fields has attained considerable importance in recent years especially due to harmful effects on food safety and the ecosystem. The purpose of this present research is to assess the heavy metal contamination risk of some micro-catchments, where tea cultivation has been taken place of Rize province in the Eastern Black Sea Region, by taking into consideration three different approaches. For this aim, 96 soil samples were collected from 29 micro-catchments at a depth of 0-20 cm to evaluate heavy metal concentrations and risk levels of soils. After that, some analyzes were performed to find out the correlation between Cd, Cu, Co, Ni, Zn, Pb and Cr concentrations and physico-chemical properties of soils to determine the risk contamination indices of heavy metal contents and enrichment factor, geo-accumulation index and contamination factors due to natural or anthropogenic effects. According to the study results, the order of the mean heavy metals identified in the soils was determined as Zn > Cu > Cr > Ni > Pb > Co > Cd. On the other hand, according to all three contamination risk models, Cd was identified as the riskiest element in terms of contamination in the catchments, where tea cultivation has been carried out. Also, when the statistical relationship between some physico-chemical characteristic of soils and heavy metals examined, it was identified that a significant positive correlation between clay content of soils and pH, and Cd and Zn, respectively. However, the OM value was positively correlated with Pb and negatively correlated with Co.

AB  - Littoral habitat is a critical component of lake ecosystems. Expansion of residential development along lakeshores has led to habitat modification, which may alter lentic fish communities. Previous studies have linked lakeshore development to reductions in abundance of aquatic vegetation and coarse woody structure (CWS), and many have quantified the influence of the density of docks on aquatic habitat structure and individual fish species. However, few studies have quantified fish assemblages relative to the effect of density or pattern of development. Using docks as a proxy for development, we calculated dock density, cumulative dock area, and estimates of the proportion of shoreline that was developed, affected by development, or left in large undeveloped segments for 28 Minnesota lakes. We assessed nearshore structural habitat (aquatic vegetation, CWS, and riparian features), a lake-wide fish index of biotic integrity (IBI), and nearshore components of the fish IBI relative to the development measures derived from docks. The nearshore IBI metrics were community composition metrics based on the proportion of intolerant, small benthic-dwelling, and vegetation-dwelling species caught in nearshore sampling, which we also evaluated individually and summed as a nearshore IBI. All measures of development were correlated and performed similarly in our models. Emergent vegetation and CWS declined with increasing development. Nearshore fish IBI declined with increasing development, but the lake-wide IBI did not change significantly with development. The decline of the nearshore fish IBI appeared to have been driven by a decline in vegetation-dwelling species.

AB  - We examined effects of seasonality of climate and dominant life form (evergreen/deciduous, broadleaf/coniferous) together with energy condition on species diversity, forest structure, forest dynamics, and productivity of forest ecosystems by comparing the patterns of changes in these ecosystem attributes along altitudinal gradients in tropical regions without seasonality and along a latitudinal gradient from tropical to temperate regions in humid East Asia. We used warmth index (temperature sum during growing season, WI) as an index of energy condition common to both altitudinal and latitudinal gradients. There were apparent differences in patterns of changes in the ecosystem attributes in relation to WI among four forest formations that were classified according to dominant life form and climatic zone (tropical/temperate). Many of the ecosystem attributes-Fisher's alpha of species-diversity indices, maximum tree height and stem density, productivity [increment rate of aboveground biomass (AGB)], and population and biomass turnover rates-changed sharply with WI in tropical and temperate evergreen broad-leaved forests, but did not change linearly or changed only loosely with WI in temperate deciduous broad-leaved and evergreen coniferous forests. Values of these ecosystem attributes in temperate deciduous broad-leaved and evergreen coniferous forests were higher (stein density was lower) than those in tropical and temperate evergreen broad-leaved forests under colder conditions (WI below 100 degrees C). Present results indicate that seasonality of climate and resultant change in dominant life form work to buffer the effects of energy reduction on ecosystem attributes along latitudinal gradients.

AB  - The objectives of this work were to evaluate the richness and diversity of the Poduromorpha fauna in two biotopes in Restinga de Marica, RJ, Brazil, to identify the characteristic species of each biotope and to determine the relationships between the community structure and the abiotic environmental parameters. Representatives of the Poduromorpha (Collembola) order were studied under an ecological viewpoint in halophyte-psammophyte vegetation and foredune zone in preserved areas of Restinga de Marica, a sand dune environment in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The foredune zone showed the highest diversity, richness and equitability of springtail species. Differences in the fundamental, accessory and accidental species in each environment were encountered. Paraxenylla piloua was found to be an indicator species of the halophyte-psammophyte vegetation, while Friesea reducta, Pseudachorutes difficilis and Xenylla maritima were indicators of the foredune zone. The canonical correspondence analysis indicated pH, organic matter content and soil humidity as the most important factors influencing the spatiotemporal distribution of the species.

AB  - We conducted a statistical analysis to characterize the influence of large-scale and local environmental factors on presence-absence, concentration, and assemblage structure of larval fish within the northern California Current (NCC) ecosystem, based on samples collected at two nearshore stations along the Newport Hydrographic line off the central Oregon coast. Data from 1996 to 2005 were compared with historical data from the 1970s and 1980s to evaluate pseudo-decadal, annual, and seasonal variability. Our results indicate that the most abundant taxa from 1996 to 2005 differ from those of earlier decades. Concentrations of the dominant taxa and total larvae were generally greater in the winter/spring than summer/fall season. Using generalized additive modeling, variations in presence-absence and concentration of taxa were compared to climate indices such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Northern Oscillation Index, and the multivariate ENSO index and local environmental factors, such as upwelling, Ekman transport, and wind stress curl. Significant relationships were found for various combinations of environmental variables with lag periods ranging from 0 to 7 months. We found that the large-scale climate indices explained more of the variance in larval fish concentration and diversity than did the more local factors. Our results indicate that readily available oceanographic and climate indices can explain variations in the dominant ichthyoplankton taxa in the NCC. However, variation in response among taxa to the environmental metrics suggests additional unknown factors not included in the analysis likely contributed to the observed distribution patterns and larval fish community structure in the NCC.

AB  - It is asserted that reduction or elimination of hatchery stocking will increase natural-origin salmon Oncorhynchus spp. and steelhead O. mykiss production. We conducted an analysis of steelhead population census data (1958-2017) to determine whether elimination of summer steelhead stocking in the upper Clackamas River in 1998 increased the productivity of natural-origin winter steelhead. A Bayesian state-space stock-recruitment model was fitted to the adult steelhead data set, and productivity was estimated as a function of hatchery-origin spawner abundance as well as other environmental factors. When used as a predictive variable in our model, the abundance of hatchery summer steelhead spawners (1972-2001) did not have a negative effect on winter steelhead recruitment. However, spill at North Fork Dam (the gateway to the upper Clackamas River basin) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (an index of ocean conditions) were both negatively associated with winter steelhead recruitment. Moreover, winter steelhead abundance in the upper Clackamas River basin failed to rebound to abundances observed in years prior to the hatchery program, and fluctuations in winter steelhead abundance were correlated with those of other regional winter steelhead stocks. Our assessment underscores the need for studies that (1) directly quantify the effects of hatchery fish on the production of natural-origin salmon and steelhead, (2) empirically test published theories about mechanisms of hatchery fish impacts on natural-origin populations, and (3) document population responses to major changes in hatchery programs.

AB  - The paper presents a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methodology to analyze environmental performance indicators of an organization designed according to Eco-Management and Audit Scheme III - Regulation (EMAS III). The newly proposed indicators are intended to achieve Best Environmental Management Practice (BEMP) to facilitate and harmonize the way the environmental performance is reported and analyzed periodically within the Environmental Management System (EMS) of the organization. During each environmental management analysis, the state regarding the accomplishment of the proposed objectives stated in the organization environmental policy should be checked. This way, adequate and timely measures should be taken to meet the objectives and improve environmental performance. While referential documents ISO 14000 standards series and European legislation - EMAS III Regulation requirements are well explained within environmental management literature, the instruments for their implementation at organizational level need yet improvements. One such improvement endeavor is the release of BEMP sectoral documents which include new EMAS III indicators for environmental performance analysis. Instruments that should be used in order to analyze those environmental performance indicators can also be improved to help in managing the significant environmental impacts of organization and the associated environmental risk. Using results from operational research field and applying them to the environmental management can produce reliable scientifically based methodologies. General considerations about how to use the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology as a MCDA tool for environmental management analysis are presented.

AB  - Land use changes and channelization of streams in the deep loess region of western Iowa have led to stream channel incision, altered flow regimes, increased sediment inputs, decreased habitat diversity and reduced lateral connectivity of streams and floodplains. Grade control structures (GCSs) are built in streams to prevent further erosion, protect infrastructure and reduce sediment loads. However, GCS can have a detrimental impact on fisheries and biological communities. We review three complementary biological and hydraulic studies on the effects of GCS in these streams. GCS with steep (1:4 rise:run) downstream slopes severely limited fish passage, but GCS with gentle slopes (1:15) allowed greater passage. Fish assemblages were dominated by species tolerant of degradation, and Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) scores were indicative of fair or poor biotic integrity. More than 50% of fish species had truncated distributions. After modification of GCS to reduce slopes and permit increased passage, IBI scores increased and several species were detected further upstream than before modification. Total macroinvertebrate density, biomass and taxonomic diversity and abundance of ecologically sensitive taxa were greater at GCS than in reaches immediately upstream, downstream or 1km from GCS. A hydraulic study confirmed results from fish passage studies; minimum depths and maximum current velocities at GCS with gentle slopes (1:15) were more likely to meet minimum criteria for catfish passage than GCS with steeper slopes. Multidisciplinary approaches such as ours will increase understanding of GCS-associated factors influencing fish passage, biological assemblage structure and other ecological relationships in streams.

AB  - The basin of the Sinos River, located in the northeastern part of Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil, has been highly impacted by industrial and urban activities. Water quality is low because of domestic and industrial sewage discharges. Most of the tributaries have suffered drastic structural interventions like canalisations and the removal of riparian vegetation. The aims of this study were to: 1) assess the diversity of fish at 34 sampling sites in twenty-four tributaries of the Sinos River basin; 2) quantify impact level by the Shannon-Wiener diversity index and an adapted Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI); and 3) check the interference of environmental impacts, formerly quantified in a Stream Corridor Assessment Survey (SCAS), on the fish assembly and 4) compare the relationship between the IBI with stream order. Fish sampling was performed by electric fishing in the period from April 2004 to August 2006. A total of 4,869 individuals were sampled, representing 61 species, 14 families and six orders. Significant relationships of the Shannon-Wiener index and IBI with SCAS scores and stream orders were found. Of all impacts that make up the SCAS score, only channel modifications were significantly correlated with IBI. These results indicate that the adaptation of the IBI was effective and performed better than the Shannon-Wiener diversity index when related directly to specific impact categories. The application of the IBI with the SCAS and the other variables was efficient in the tributaries of the Sinos River basin because it showed the biotic degradation in accordance with changes in physical habitat.

AB  - Within Canada, hydro-electric power is the leading source of energy for households and industry. It is thus critical to understand and minimize its ecological impacts, by developing management guidelines for hydropower operations. Flow peaking is a common practice at hydroelectric facilities as hydropower generation often tracks the demand in electricity, and understanding its ecological impacts is key to developing sustainable river management guidelines. Based on standard macroinvertebrate biomonitoring data, the Canadian Ecological Flow Index (CEFI) is a tool to assess flow sensitivity based on Canadian rivers. Having already demonstrated its utility to detect changes in flow conditions, CEFI was applied in this study to investigate the ecological effects of altering a peaking hydropower scheme, specifically by changing the ramping rate, or the rate of change of flow from minimum to maximum and back in a peaking cycle. Data were collected in two proximate rivers in Ontario: one experiencing hydropower ramping and the other with a natural flow regime, allowing the detection of the effects unlimited ramping using a BACI (Before-After/Control-Impact) design. In the regulated river, the first two years of the study were subjected to restricted ramping rate practices while unlimited ramping was permitted thereafter. Hydrological data were collected at each station and used to compute a series of 33 Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) metrics to characterize the ecohydrological condition of the river systems. The benthic community responded to changes in ramping rate and CEFI was able to discriminate the alteration signal and to diagnose the impact. Hydrological descriptors of the effects of the ramping activities were clear drivers of the CEFI variation in the hydropower-ramping site. This study is the first to apply the CEFI approach to a BACI in situ experiment. The CEFI tool again proved to be a useful indicator of flow alteration, with great promise for its use in the development of hydroecological management guidelines. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Soil microbial diversity is one of the key factors affecting the structure and function of the belowground ecosystem; yet, little is known about the response of microbial diversity to multiple global change factors. Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis based on data collected from 237 published papers to explore the effect of multiple global change factors (elevated carbon dioxide (eCO(2)), warming, elevated nitrogen addition (eN), wetting-drying cycle, drought, decreased precipitation (precipitation(-)), and increased precipitation (precipitation(+))) on microbial diversity (Shannon index) across different ecosystems (cropland, grassland, forest, shrubland, desert, wetland, and tundra). Global change decreased soil bacterial and fungal diversity by an average of 2.9% and 3.5%, respectively. For each global change factor, the effect sizes of precipitation(-), eN, wetting-drying cycle, and drought on soil microbial diversity were negative, whereas the effect sizes of eCO(2), warming, and precipitation(+) were positive. This phenomenon was driven by changes in mean annual temperature (MAT) and edaphic factors (especially soil pH, bulk density and organic carbon content) rather than mean annual precipitation. Moreover, the effect size of soil microbial diversity linearly declined with increasing MAT, suggesting that microbial diversity was highly dependent on climate conditions at the global scale. In addition, two- and three-way interactions of global change factors aggravated the negative effects of individual effects. We suggest that it is essential to conduct long-term, multiple-factor experiments to assess the response of soil microbial diversity to global change because multiple global change factors often occur simultaneously.

AB  - We price the haze option with the PM(2.5)index under various conditions and discuss its characteristics with some numerical examples. The effect of air pollution in the environment is becoming a growing issue. In the areas of finance and tourism, there have been few studies on the effects of air pollution, such as the haze caused by PM2.5, which are tiny particles in the air that reduce visibility and cause the air to appear hazy when levels are elevated. In order to reduce financial losses and economic impacts, our main contribution is that we focus on the issue of the haze option and establish a feasible payment mechanism for the haze option against economic loss from air pollution. This idea of financial product can be applied easily to other issues, such as weather options in the area of tourism or traffic.
   In our observation data, the underlying PM(2.5)air pollution index changes according to specific seasons year by year in Taiwan, and the distribution of the air pollution PM(2.5)index doesn't follow a fixed stochastic probability model. We use the nonparametric block bootstrap simulation method to price the haze option under our research process. From our numerical results, we provide a good reference by which to satisfy the needs of consumers through the discussion of numerical examples. The results can also be applied in government medical policies to reduce the economic effects of air pollution that damages people's health and can be used to support the development of tourism.

AB  - Growing evidence shows that environmental estrogen can reach levels that are high enough to exert adverse reproductive effects on wild fish populations. The authors report different parameters of male reproductive behavior, brain, and gonadal aromatase expression, as well as sperm quality in an internally fertilizing fish species (Jenynsia multidentata, Jenyns) exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol (E2). Adult males were exposed to 0, 50, 100, and 250?ng/L E2 over 28?d. The authors' findings demonstrate that E2 exposure resulted in a very clear increase in brain aromatase transcript abundance at all assayed concentrations compared with control; however, no effects on gonadal aromatase expression were observed. Behavioral measures revealed increased sexual activity at 50?ng/L but not 100 or 250?ng/L E2. In contrast to the molecular and behavioral responses, the condition factor, gonadosomatic index, and sperm quality were unaltered by E2 exposure. The results from the present work suggest that E2 affects some aspects of the reproductive biology of J. multidentata. These modifications in the reproductive biology caused by exposure to E2 could potentially lead to long-term effects at population levels that may not always be immediately evident. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first report on the combined effect of E2 on aromatase expression, sexual behavior, and sperm parameters in fish. Environ. Toxicol.

AB  - Restoring ecosystems to some previous "natural" state is often impeded by the lack of information on what goal is to be attained. However a target for restoration of lake ecosystems can be established by developing a multimetric tool for the assessment of biological integrity. Our study identified a set of recurring responses to disturbance that indicate impaired biological integrity in lakes that include properties of species composition, taxonomic diversity, and functional organization of the lake communities. We then tested these hypothesized responses in 12 small, isolated Adirondack lakes impacted by nonnative fish species, from collections of fish, benthic invertebrates, zooplankton, and phytoplankton over a 3-yr period. We also tested the feasibility of restoring biological integrity through fish-community manipulation in three additional lakes utilizing these integrity indicators as a recovery target.
   Six indicators of biological integrity were sensitive to disturbance in Adirondack wilderness lakes including dominance of native fish, relative abundance of Daphnia, dominant phytoplankton taxa, number of zooplankton species, dominance of large-bodied zooplankton, and zooplankton biomass. Adirondack wilderness lakes with high biological integrity were characterized by native fish communities, by zooplankton communities with relatively greater species richness, biomass, and larger species, particularly Daphnia and other cladocerans, and by phytoplankton communities with few dinoflagellates. Additionally, a shift to indigenous fish fauna in lakes impacted by nonnatives had a top-down, cascading effect on the zooplankton and phytoplankton, shifting their communities from being similar to lakes with poor biological integrity to characteristics more consistent with high-integrity lakes. Overall, our research suggests that ecosystem-scale indicators of biological integrity in lakes are powerful tools for identifying disturbance, providing target conditions for ecosystem recovery, and identifying disturbed lakes that would increase biological integrity through fish-community manipulation.

AB  - The description of ecosystems' evolution is a challenge for many scientists. Several attempts have been made, mostly using compartments and flows, to describe the structure of ecosystems and holistic indicators or goal functions (GF) to describe the state and the trend of their evolution. Under a steady flow of energy from the environment, an ecosystem can increase the biomass by enlarging the number of individuals and/or their body weights until a certain steady state level. In this situation neither the structure (e.g. species composition) nor the pattern of flows linking its compartments vary and both biomass and flow reach an "optimal" level. Benefits compensate the costs of the ecosystem evolution.
   A question is open: when can an ecosystem be considered to be in an optimal state and how does it reach this state? The answer to this question is also useful to solve the problems related to the concept of reference state as posed in the Water Framework Directive (WFD, EU, 2000/60/EC).
   In order to answer this question the characteristics of a suitable indicator are discussed and two state indicators are proposed, based on the assumption that costs and benefits of the ecosystem growth have to be in balance. The first one, the benefit/cost indicator (BC), is a function of well known state indicators, that fully satisfies the properties required although is difficult to compute and complex to understand. Nevertheless, from the researcher point of view, this indicator gives interesting insights into system behavior. The second, the supply demand balance (SDB), is an indicator based on two main assumptions, the first one being that an ecosystem can be represented by a network of compartments and flows, the second that the metabolic rates scale across species approximately as the (3/4) power of mass. The SDB indicator summarizes the distance of an ecosystem from an optimal state in a single number. Under these assumptions the SDB indicator can be regarded as a measure of ecosystem state. It is easy to compute and simple to understand. SDB looks like a good indicator both for scientific and practical uses to understand where the ecosystem is going. Finally the applicability of SDB is investigated by computing its values for 33 trophic networks describing the food webs of different aquatic ecosystems. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires the definition of near-natural reference conditions to determine the extent of water bodies' deviation from "good ecological status" caused by stress gradients. However, the classification of ecological quality depends on the assessment method applied and the stressor concerned. While assessment methods that are generally applicable would be favourable, many European countries employ the locally developed water quality metrics that assess the impact of organic pollution (including eutrophication) and the associated decrease in dissolved oxygen. These indices do not specifically address stress from organic toxicants, such as pesticides. The aim of this study was to examine the performance of presently used assessment methods to identify reference conditions of non-contaminated streams in five selected European river basins, covering the geographical region from Spain to Finland, as a crucial prerequisite to indicate toxic gradients. The analysis comprised the Belgium biotic index (BBI), the biological monitoring working party (BMWP) scoring system and the revised German saprobic index. For comparison, we included an adaptation of the recently developed SPEAR index. In two previous field studies, this metric highly correlated with measured pesticide gradients. In this study, SPEAR was the only indicator that was generally applicable to all monitoring data and capable of determining "high ecological status" of reference conditions in all basins. Thus, based upon previous and own results, the authors suggest the species at risk (SPEAR) index to be potentially useful as a European-wide index to address deviations from "good ecological status" due to organic toxicants and recommend it for consideration in integrated water-resource evaluations under the WFD.

AB  - Estuarine and coastal ecosystems are productive and functionally diverse areas that provide a wide range of societal benefits. Along with human exploitative uses comes an array of anthropogenic disturbances that can affect ecological integrity, including changes to the composition and resilience of benthic macroinvertebrate communities. To understand the responses of ecological communities to anthropogenic disturbance and to manage and mitigate effects, indices for assessing the ecological integrity of estuarine and coastal waters have proliferated worldwide. Using data from 84 intertidal sites in Auckland, New Zealand, we evaluated the suitability of two widely used measures of ecological integrity that were developed in USA and Europe, respectively: the Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity (B-IBI) and the AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (AMBI). We then developed a local index based on macrofaunal traits and verified its utility using independent data from >100 additional sites. The local traits based index (TBI), constructed from the richness of macrofaunal taxa in seven functional groups, responded to changes in sediment mud percentage and heavy metal contaminant concentration gradients below international guidelines. The TBI performed better than the indices developed overseas, probably because they were designed to track organic enrichment and hypoxia, which are not the predominant stressors in New Zealand at present. The TBI successfully tracked the stressors that were the most relevant locally and indicated the relative levels of within-group taxonomic richness at various sites. As within-group richness is a component of functional redundancy and ecological resilience, the TBI offers a trifecta of simplicity, robustness and meaningfulness that will facilitate management.

AB  - We developed an index of biotic integrity (IBI) and a biotic index based on fish species richness (FSBI) to assess the ecological health of streams on the Savannah River Site, a 780-km(2) U.S. Department of Energy facility located in the Sand Hills ecoregion on the upper coastal plain of South Carolina. To maintain the responsiveness of the IBI to a variety of impacts yet incorporate sufficient ecoregion specificity to achieve acceptable accuracy, we included metrics from each of six metric categories proven useful in other ecoregions (species number, species composition, trophic composition, local indicator species, fish abundance, and fish condition) but selected specific metrics within each category based on their ability to discriminate between disturbed and undisturbed sites in the Sand Hills ecoregion. We also developed a procedure based on species-area curves to remove the potentially confounding effects of site-specific differences in sample unit size and sampling effort from species number metrics. With these changes, the modified IBI was minimally affected by sample unit size and sampling effort and accurately discriminated undisturbed sites from sites affected by physical habitat alterations, thermal effluents, and chemical pollution. The FSBI, based on four species richness metrics (adjusted for the effects of sample unit size and sampling effort), discriminated between disturbed and undisturbed streams approximately as well as the modified IBI. The precision of both indices was affected by sample reach length, with samples from 50-m reaches exhibiting relatively low precision and samples from 150-m reaches high precision.

AB  - With the rapid development of social and economic conditions in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) collaborative development region in China, the water-environmental problems gradually evolve into a regional problem. As an important tool of predicting and preventing these problems, water-environmental risk assessment (WERA) plays an increasingly important role in environment management. This study mainly targets the surface water environment and takes the BTH region as a study area in developing a water-environmental risk assessment index system based on the Driving force-Pressures-States-Impacts-Responses model. The weighting, risk, and zoning of each index are determined using multiple methods such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, and geographic information system technology. Further discussions are made to analyze the leading factors of high-risk units, the relationship between the risk level and social economy, and the uncertainty of WERA. Generally speaking, results show that the relative high-risk areas mainly distribute in Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, and Tangshan, and the relative low-risk areas mainly distribute in Chengde and Zhangjiakou. The remaining parts of the region are at the middle-risk level. The results also show a positive correlation between the risk level and the social economy. This study gathered lots of data and carried out a number of calculation work, and is expected to improve the WERA methods and help managers set the priorities for local water-environmental management and make more effective decisions in the context of BTH collaborative development.

AB  - Ecotourism is a nature-based type of tourism, especially represented within protected areas. No matter the fact, just like the other selective types of this sector, ecotourism might affect the environment. In a process of writing the Visitor Management Plan in the Gornje Podunavlje Special Nature Reserve (SNR) in 2019, one part of the study was related to general projection of the ecotourism development impact on eco- educational paths within this SNR. The research was conducted throughout November 2019, in the form of interviews. The sample obtained 12 experts for nature protection, who stated their attitudes on three important topics: tourism in protected areas in general, tourism in the Gornje Podunavlje SNR and ecotourism within three concrete sites: Karapandza, Strbac and Bestrement.

AB  - The evaluation of optical properties of biological samples is gaining increasing interests both in scientific and commercial fields concerning agriculture and food processing. The optical techniques can indeed be able to provide information on quality assessment in a fast and non-destructive way. This feature makes them suitable for automatic management of control processes. In this paper, we propose to use the Delayed Luminescence, a ultra-weak and photo-induced emission of optical photons, as a tool for a rapid evaluation of germination performance, the principal index reflecting seed quality. Two lots of 'Mirella' F-1 watermelon dried seeds, of 96 seeds each, were considered. The seeds were analyzed in the conditions as provided by seed/breeding company. Characteristics of Delayed Luminescence emission from each single seed were correlated to the different germination levels as assessed by International Seed Testing Procedures. Parametric differences in the two lots were determined, based on the relaxation kinetics of some spectral components. A control test, with the aim to construct a calibration model, was conceived and successfully tested. Time decays of Delayed Luminescence spectral components at central wavelengths 450 nm, 550 nm and 650 nm, corresponding to spectrum region where natural biomarkers as NADH, flavins and lipopigments, protoporphyrin and ROS respectively emit, have been evaluated. The results show that such time decays are strictly connected to the biological state of the system under analysis and allow also proposing Delayed Luminescence measurement as a quick, cheap and non-destructive test for seed viability analysis.

AB  - Primary production is the entry point of energy and carbon into ecosystems, but modeling responses of primary production to "environmental stress" (i.e., reductions of primary production from nonoptimal environmental conditions) remains a key challenge and source of uncertainty in our understanding of Earth's carbon cycle. Here we develop an approach for estimating annual "environmental stress" from tree rings based on the proportion of the optimal diameter growth rate (from species-specific allometric equations) that is realized in a given year. We assessed climatic, topographic, and soil drivers of environmental stress, as well as their interactions, using both empirical model experiments and linear mixed effect models. Climate gradients and interannual climate variability dominated spatial and temporal variability of environmental stress in much of the western United States, where the tree-ring environmental stress index was positively correlated with antecedent climatic water balance (precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration) and negatively correlated with temperature and vapor pressure deficit. Excluding topographic and soil information from empirical models reduced their ability to capture spatial gradients in environmental stress, particularly in the eastern United States, where growth was not as strongly limited by climate. Mean climate conditions and topographic characteristics had significant interaction effects with the climatic water balance, indicating an increasing importance of winter moisture for warmer and drier sites and as elevation and topographic wetness index increased. These results suggest that including effects of antecedent climate (particularly in dry regions) and site topographic and soil characteristics could improve parameterization of environmental stress effects in primary production models.
   Plain Language Summary Carbohydrates produced through photosynthesis form the building blocks of ecosystems and provide many goods and services to humanity, including basic needs like food and shelter. The amount of carbohydrates produced by plants depends on favorable climate conditions and adequate supply of key resources, but it has always been challenging to predict precisely where, when, and how much plant activity will be reduced when environmental conditions are not optimal. We used tree-ring widths from more than 1,000 sites across the United States to examine which environmental conditions were responsible for reduction of plant growth below optimal levels. Importantly, we found that temperature, rainfall, and humidity before plants even start growing act as important constraints on growth. Rainfall and snowfall from the previous autumn through spring are particularly important for growth in dry regions like the western United States. However, the effects of climate on plant growth differ depending on the conditions in which plants are growing, such as their elevation and soil quality. Predicting how plants respond to their environment therefore depends not just on the weather they experience while they are growing but also on the legacies of previous weather and on the soil and topography conditions where they are growing.
   Key Points
   We developed annual estimates of environmental stress (ratio of actual to optimal growth) from tree rings Lag effects of climate were important drivers of environmental stress in most ecoregions but especially in dry ecoregions Topography and soil quality affected both spatial gradients of environmental stress and relationships between climate and growth

TI  - Harrington's desirability function for natural water quality assessment
T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENERAL CHEMISTRY
LA  - English
AB  - The theoretical analysis of the possible application of Harrington's desirability function for the state of natural ecosystems assessment was made. It was shown that the desirability function with double limiting should be used for water quality objects assessment. The function makes it possible to eliminate arbitrary rule while the number of quality classes at different ways of optimization (typification, classification etc.) of information was determined. This resulted in mathematically valid limitation to the maximum 5 types of the first level. It was underlined that if even one particular response or a particular desirability function does not satisfy the requirements, the general estimation should be considered unsatisfactory, in spite of the fact that the other parameters (properties) of the studied system were satisfied. The tables were made which gave the possibility to assess the up-to-date state of the Rybinsk Reservoir ecosystem according to the content of nutrients and organic matters on the basis of future mesurments. The seasonal pattern of hydrophysical, hydrochemical and hydrobiological processes should be taken into account in order to make more accurate the water quality assessment at the concrete time in the definite site in the Rybinsk Reservoir area.

AB  - The results of ecological assessment of Kursk soils condition with the use of the resource approach are presented in the article. For calculating the conditional standards of heavy metals (HM) reserves in soils and a comprehensive assessment of the ecological state of the soil cover, it was proposed to take into account regional peculiarities of the physicochemical properties of the soil and apply the author's regional HM standard. The reserves of accomodation of heavy metals and the nature of their profile distribution in several types of soils (Urbanozems, Urban dark-gray soils, dark gray soils, alluvial plain soils, sandy podzols) with anthropogenic load of various levels and character are determined. It is revealed that the soil of the city has both superficial and deep-profile pollution. The most polluted soils with deeply concentrated reserves of HM turned out to be Urbanozems industrial zones. It is noted that Pb, Cd and Zn are the main pollutants among HM. Their reserves exceed the proposed regional conditional MPC 5.9, 29.0 and 1.1 times, respectively. The resource approach allowed us to estimate the potential and saturation of the geochemical barriers of Kursk soils. A high capacity of the humus geochemical barrier is noted, which allows depositing most of the HM in the humus-accumulative horizons of the Alluvial gleyic soils and Urban dark-gray soils.

AB  - Understanding the Mediterranean rangelands degradation trends is a key element of mitigating their vulnerability and enhancing their resilience. Climate change and its inherent effects on mean temperature and the precipitation variability can regulate the magnitude, frequency and duration of droughts and aridity with a profound effect on ecosystem productivity. Here we investigate the effects of climate change to project the development of vegetation in the Mediterranean rangelands by (i) estimating the relative Standardized Precipitation Index and a modification of the United Nations Environment Programme Aridity Index to classify climate variability, and (ii) modelling vegetation response to climate using the Food and Agriculture Organisation crop-water production function. Climate model data are obtained from nine general circulation models under Relative Concentration Pathways 2.6 and 8.5 of the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. After correcting climate model data for biases, results for two 40-year future study periods are compared with the baseline period 1961-2000 within a domain that includes the European Mediterranean. We show that a gradual but robust increase of aridity and drought frequency is estimated for most of the Mediterranean region, impacting rangeland vegetation yields. Projected drought and aridity disturbances may well represent permanent shifts to a warmer and more frequently dry status. This alternative stability of climatic pressure lies outside the limits of ecosystem resilience and may indicate that in some cases vegetation will either adapt to the new conditions or be succeeded by more water-stress tolerant species. Results raise concerns about the fate of the Mediterranean rangelands and the effectiveness of mitigation measures. Copyright (C) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Drought is an affliction for a region that primarily depends on agriculture as economic activity. Commonly monitoring and characterizing of drought is performed by only analyzing the meteorological aspect, assuming precipitation as the primary source of water. However, in riverine Bangladesh, this can lead to an erroneous conclusion, as there is a multitude of available water sources. Consequently, in this study, vegetation condition (Standard Vegetation Index), soil moisture (Soil Moisture Index), and precipitation (Standard Precipitation Index) are separately investigated from 2003 to 2019, in the Northwestern Teesta floodplain. Subsequently, statistical regression analysis is performed to determine the relationships between different aspects of drought. In addition, information obtained from field visits and expert opinions has also been assimilated. Analysis of vegetation and soil moisture condition presents a progressively improving scenario. However, SPI shows an incessant decline in meteorological drought conditions, especially after 2007. Evidently, regression analysis does not provide any indication of an interrelationship between the studied agricultural and meteorological parameters. Presumably, this absence is instigated because the study area is highly irrigated as the groundwater table is suitably near the surface and the existence of nearby Teesta river allows for the utilization of surface water. Moreover, the cropping pattern is shifting toward crops that require much less water and to places where soil moisture is scarce. Thus, this study addresses the gap in knowledge regarding the nature of agricultural drought and the dynamics of different aspects of drought which will be invaluable for the water management and agricultural policy in the study area as well as other regions with a similar backdrop.

AB  - A composting experiment was carried out to study changes in physical [color, odor, temperature, organic matter (OM) loss], chemical [C:N ratio, water-soluble organic carbon (C-w):organic N (N-org) ratio, NH4+-N and NO3--N, humic acid (HA): fulvic acid (FA) ratio, humification index (HI) and cation-exchange capacity (CEC):total organic carbon (TOC) ratio)] and biological [seed germination index (GI)] parameters to assess compost maturity and stability over a period of 150 days. Five composts were prepared using a mixture of different farm wastes with or without enrichment of N, rock phosphate (RP) and microorganism (MO) inoculation. All the composts appeared to change to a granular and dark grey color without foul odor, and attained a constant temperature with no measurable changes (ambient level) at 120 days of composting. Correlation analysis showed that the optimal values of the selected parameters for our experimental conditions are as follows: organic matter loss > 42%, C: N ratio < 15, HA: FA ratio > 1.9, HI > 30%, CEC: TOC ratio > 1.7 and C-w:N-org ratio < 0.55. Composts enriched with N + RP or N + RP + MO matured at 150 and 120 days, respectively, whereas composts without any enrichment or enrichment with N or RP + MO did not mature even at 150 days of composting.

AB  - Due to ecological importance of Anzali wetland (in south of the Caspian sea) and taking the toxicity of phthalates into consideration, which can finally find their way to human diet and pose a huge threat to human food security, the occurrence and concentration of phthalic acid esters in nine stations (27 sediment samples) in this wetland alongside their relationship with physical and chemical properties of the sediments were studied. The samples were extracted by using ultrasound assisted solvent extraction and analyzed for six major phthalates using a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer. Results of laboratory analyses showed that concentrations of six major phthalic acid esters in the Anzali sediments ranged from 4.18 to 20.71 mg kg(-1) with an average of 7.65 mg kg(-1). In addition, it was found that the site of Sorkhankol was heavily polluted by phthalic acid esters especially di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (20.71 mg/kg dw). The concentrations of dimethyl phthalate and diethyl phthalate) were lower than the limit of detection of the GC-MS instrument. Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and di-n-butyl phthalate were the dominant phthalic acid esters present in all examined sediments. Generally, the mean concentrations of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate was well above the United States Environmental Protection Agency sediment guideline value and environmental risk limits. Furthermore, investigation of sediment chemical properties revealed that the concentrations of di-n-butyl phthalate have significant linear positive correlations with sediments organic matters.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify, characterize, and assess data needs for ecological risk of household cleaning product polymers currently being used in the United States (US). Because of their range in properties and functions, polymers are used in a wide variety of household cleaning products, including fabric, dish, and hard surface cleaners. Understanding their potential environmental impact is essential for good ingredient and product stewardship. The household cleaning product polymers were first identified using several databases. Of the 185 polymers initially identified, 120 were eliminated from the list because they did not fit the definition of a polymer, were not well defined (e.g., no Chemical Abstracts Service [CAS] or trade name only), or were not in current use. Forty-seven of the remaining polymers had either adequate environmental fate and hazard data and/or sufficient data for conducting a comprehensive ecological risk assessment and were determined to be of low concern by either the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), and/or the Human and Environmental Risk Assessment (HERA) Project. The remaining 18 polymers were determined to need further review because of a lack of publicly available information for conducting ecological risk assessments. Additional data for these 18 polymers could be obtained by accessing privately held data, conducting laboratory tests on their fate and effects in aquatic environments, or by conducting read-across of similar structured polymers. These steps can be utilized by industry to determine where best to dedicate future environmental stewardship efforts. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2019;15:621-632. (c) 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Indigenous peoples' relationships with biodiversity are often poorly recognised in conservation decision-making, but are critical to Indigenous identity and lifeways. These relationships extend to introduced species that are rarely protected under legislation. Kiore (Rattus exulans, Pacific rat) is a species introduced to Aotearoa New Zealand (hereafter Aotearoa) by Maori (the Indigenous people of Aotcaroa) as a food source and bio-indicator of ecosystem state. Once common, kiore are now restricted in numbers and range, and widely considered an unwanted organism by conservation managers and some Maori. However, tribal group Ngatiwai wish to safeguard cultural access to remaining kiore on Mauitaha Island. Therefore, the goals of our study were to assess body condition and the reproductive and disease status of kiore on Mauitaha. Of 16 kiore caught, body condition based on body length to mass ratio was similar to that recorded on other islands in Aotearoa. Subcutaneous fat levels were moderate, but lower in individuals with disease inflammation. The results suggest satisfactory population health, but regular monitoring to identify temporal trends in kiore abundance and condition is important for cultural harvesting and long-term population survival. Planning for harvesting by future generations requires transforming conservation biology through Indigenous perspectives, through further assessment of methods, management and agency, examining how Indigenous knowledge and conventional science can be used to balance ecological and cultural trade-offs. Further consideration of ecological habitat and risk is also required for kiore, because the reserve is a single small island, and national conservation priorities focus on native species protection in ecosystems that exclude humans.

AB  - Some strains of lactobacilli can exert beneficial effects on a host when ingested in an adequate dose, such as immunoregulation and anti-inflammatory activities. In this study, the survival abilities under simulated gastrointestinal conditions, adhesion abilities on HT-29 cell monolayers, and hemolytic activities of fourLactobacillus plantarumstrains were assessed. Among the four strains,L. plantarum-12 showed the higher survival rate under simulated gastrointestinal conditions and adhesion index on the HT-29 cell monolayers, exhibited gamma-haemolytic activity and had no biological amine producing ability.L. plantarum-12 was administered to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis (UC) Balb/c mice by oral gavage for 10 days. It was observed that the UC Balb/c mice showed symptoms of colonic atrophy, intestinal histopathological change, gut microbial disturbance, and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression.L. plantarum-12 administration remarkably attenuated DSS-induced UC in mice. L. plantarum-12 administration could restore gut microbiota by increasing beneficial bacteria such asLactobacillusand decreasing intestinal pathogenic bacteria likeProteobacteria. L. plantarum-12 administration could improve immunityviaactivating the janus kinase-signal transducer and the activator of the transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway and up-regulating adenosine deaminase (ADA) and interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 protein (IFIT1), and enforce the intestinal barrier function by up-regulating mucin 2 (MUC2) protein expression. In conclusion,L. plantarum-12 could attenuate DSS-induced UC in Balb/c mice by ameliorating intestinal inflammation, and restoring the disturbed gut microbiota.L. plantarum-12 could be used as promising probiotics to ameliorate colitis.

AB  - The eddy covariance method is a powerful technique for quantification of CO2, H2O and energy fluxes in natural ecosystems. Leaf area index (LAI) and its changes are significant drivers of CO2 and H2O exchange in a forest ecosystem due to their role in photosynthesis. The present study reports the seasonal variation CO2 of and energy fluxes and their relationship with other meteorological parameters of a semi-evergreen primary forest of Kaziranga National Park, Assam, India during February 2016-January 2017. The diurnal pattern of half hourly average CO2 fluxes over the forest was found to be mostly dominated by the incident photosynthetically active radiation. During the period of study, diurnal variations of CO2 flux showed a maximum value of -9.97 mu mol m(-2)s(-1) in the month of June during summer which is also the beginning of the monsoon season. The monthly averaged diurnal CO2 flux and variation in LAI of the forest canopy closely followed each other. The annual net ecosystem exchange of the forest estimated from the flux data above the canopy is 84.21 g C m(-2)yr(-1) . Further studies are in progress to confirm these findings. The estimated average annual evapotranspiration of the semi-evergreen forest is 2.8 +/- 0.19 mm day(-1) . The study of partitioning of energy fluxes showed the dominance of latent heat fluxes over sensible heat fluxes. The energy balance closure was found to increase with an increase in instability and the highest closure of around 83% was noted under neutral conditions.

AB  - 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) is a common waste among the resulting chlorophenols generated in the production of common products classified as an extremely toxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic and highly persistent xenobiotic in the environment. To evaluate the impact of 2,4,6-TCP in aquatic systems, the catfish species Clarias batrachus has been selected to test its toxicity due to its high market value and consumption in India. Here is presented the impact of this compound on different physiological parameters of fish: haematological parameters (haemoglobin, total erythrocyte count, total leucocyte count and mean corpuscular haemoglobin), biochemical parameters (total serum protein and total serum glucose), growth and reproductive parameters (condition factor, hepatosomatic index, maturity index, specific growth rate, growth hormone, 17 beta-estradiol and testosterone), exposed to two concentrations of 2,4,6-TCP (0.5 mg/L and 1 mg/L - 1/10th and 1/20th of the LC50) for a period of 15, 30 and 45 days. The results showed that C. batrachus even when exposed to the lower concentration (0.5 mg/L) for the shortest time (15 days) negatively impacted the organism in all the assessed parameters. This was highlighted by the Integrated Biomarker Response index (IBR), showing worse scores for the treatments (up to 20 x worse than the control). This work highlights the importance of continued research on the impact of 2,4,6-TCP, on an important commercial, supported by the high environmental persistence of this compound that can reach the same range of tested concentrations.

AB  - Vegetation health assessment by using airborne multispectral images throughout crop production cycles, among other precision agriculture technologies, is an important tool for modern agriculture practices. However, to really take advantage of crop fields imagery, specialized analysis techniques are needed. In this paper we present a geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) approach to examine a set of very high resolution (VHR) multispectral images obtained by the use of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), to evaluate plant health states and to generate cropland maps for Capsicum annuum L. The scheme described here integrates machine learning methods with semi-automated training and validation, which allowed us to develop an algorithmic sequence for the evaluation of plant health conditions at individual sowing point clusters over an entire parcel. The features selected at the classification stages are based on phenotypic traits of plants with different health levels. Determination of areas without data dependencies for the algorithms employed allowed us to execute some of the calculations as parallel processes. Comparison with the standard normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and biological analyses were also performed. The classification obtained showed a precision level of about 95% in discerning between vegetation and non-vegetation objects, and clustering efficiency ranging from 79% to 89% for the evaluation of different vegetation health categories, which makes our approach suitable for being incorporated at C. annuum crop's production systems, as well as to other similar crops. This methodology can be reproduced and adjusted as an on-the-go solution to get a georeferenced plant health estimation.

AB  - Secular variations in stable carbon-isotope values of marine carbonates are used widely to correlate successions that lack high-resolution index fossils. Various environmental processes, however, commonly may affect and alter the primary marine carbon-isotope signal in shallow epicratonic basins. This study focuses on the marine carbon-isotope record from the carbonate-evaporite succession of the upper Katian (Upper Ordovician) Red River Formation of the shallow epicratonic Williston Basin, USA. It documents the carbon-isotope signal between the two major Ordovician positive shifts in C-13, the early Katian Guttenberg and the Hirnantian excursions. Eight C-13 stages are identified based on positive excursions, shifts from positive to negative values and relatively uniform C-13(carb) values. A correlation between carbon-isotope trends and the relative sea-level changes based on gross facies stacking patterns shows no clear relation. Based on the available biostratigraphy and C-13 trends, the studied Williston Basin curves are tied to the isotope curves from the North American Midcontinent, Quebec (Anticosti Island) and Estonia, which confirm the Late Katian age (Aphelognathus divergens Conodont Zone) of the upper Red River Formation. The differences in the C-13 overall trend and absolute values, coupled with the petrographic and cathodoluminescence evidence, suggest that the carbon-isotope record has been affected by the syndepositional environmental processes in the shallow and periodically isolated Williston Basin, and stabilized by later burial diagenesis under reducing conditions and the presence of isotopically more negative fluids.

AB  - Stream macroinvertebrate communities vary naturally among types of habitats where they are sampled, which affects the results of environmental assessment. We analyzed macroinvertebrates collected from riffle and snag habitats to evaluate influences of habitat-specific sampling on taxon occurrence, assemblage measures, and biotic indices. We found considerably more macroinvertebrate taxa unique to snags (143 taxa) than to riffles (75 taxa), and the numbers of taxa found in both riffles and snags (149 taxa) were similar to that found in snags. About 64% of the 47 macroinvertebrate measures we tested differed significantly between riffles and snags. Eighty percent intercepts of regressions between biotic indices and urban or agricultural land uses differed significantly between riffles and snags. The Hilsenhoff biotic index calculated from snag samples explained 69% of the variance of riffle samples and classified 66% of the sites into the same stream health group as the riffle samples. However, four multimetric indices for snag samples explained less than 50% of the variance of riffle samples and classified less than 50% of the sites into the same health group as the riffle samples. We concluded that macroinvertebrate indices developed for riffle/run habitat should not be used for snag samples to assess stream impairment. We recommend developing an index of biotic integrity specifically for snags and using snags as an alternate sampling substrate for streams that naturally lack riffles.

AB  - We investigated differences in delta N-15 of seston and icefishes from seven freshwater ecosystems with different trophic states in China. An increase of seston delta N-15 values was accompanied by an increase of total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. Significantly positive correlations were observed between delta N-15 of icefishes and delta N-15 of seston, total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. This study demonstrated that icefishes could be preferred indicators of anthropogenic contamination in test systems because they integrated waste inputs over long time periods and reflected the movement of waste through the pelagic food chain.

AB  - The region of Sierra de la Ventana is located in the southwest of Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. Traditionally, this area has been devoted to livestock and agriculture, but tourism has had a significant development in recent years. In the region, there are many rivers and streams that are used for swimming and bathing. A survey of the occurrence of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) in these waters was conducted, and the microbiological quality of rivers and streams was investigated. No E. coli O157 was recovered by immunomagnetic separation. Nevertheless, the Shiga toxin gene, exclusively stx2 genotype, was detected in four non-O157 E. coli strains. Two STEC strains carried eae factor, but none of them harbored the EHEC-hlyA gene. Three of the STEC isolates belonged to samples obtained in the warm months, and one to the winter sampling. In the sample sites where STEC strains were isolated the counts of E. coli/100 ml exceeded or were close to the limit recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for bathing water. The relationship observed between the rainy season and E. coli counts suggests that among the main causes for the hygienic indicator increase is the runoff of manure deposited on soils that may also induce the entrance of pathogens into the aquatic environment. This research, the first reporting STEC isolation from recreational waters in this area, revealed that streams and rivers from a beef-producing area of Argentina are a reservoir of STEC strains.

AB  - We focused on responses to grazing by individual species and functional groups in relation to ecological thresholds in Mongolian rangelands, with repeated measures from the same ecological sites to account for rainfall variability. At all sites, even under rainfall fluctuations, there were robust combinations of indicator species that could be used to forewarn managers to take action to minimize the probability of crossing ecological thresholds. Depending on the landscape condition of each site, the cover of functional groups, which shared traits of perennial life history, grass or forb growth form, linear leaf shape, and alternate leaf attachment, or the cover of functional groups of woody shrubs dramatically decreased before an ecological threshold was crossed. Thus, across all sites, the responses of certain functional groups to grazing appeared to predict the crossing of an ecological threshold. The ecological indicators derived in this study should help to improve land managers' ability to prevent adverse changes in states before ecological thresholds are reached.

AB  - A comprehensive study has not been carried out so far to determine the outcome and impact of chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence parameters and photosynthetic pigments in relation to qualitative and quantitative properties in fenugreek, especially in regions with limited water availability. Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) is one of the most important medicinal plants in the world. To determine the effects of water deficit stress, nitrogen fertilization and zeolite on Chl fluorescence, pigments, trigonelline concentration and seed yield of fenugreek, a split factorial experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications in a semiarid region of Iran in 2014 and 2015. Five irrigation regimes (unstress control, irrigation at 60% available soil water (ASW); mild stress, irrigation at 40% ASW during the vegetative and reproductive stages; severe stress, irrigation at 20% ASW during the vegetative and reproductive stages) were randomized to the main plots. Subplots consisted of a factorial combination of three nitrogen treatments (untreated plots, vermicompost @ 2.7 t ha(-1) and urea @ 11 kg ha(-1)) and two zeolite treatments (@ 0 and 9 t ha(-1)). The results demonstrated that water deficit stress decreased maximum CM fluorescence (F-m), variable Chl fluorescence (F-v), the photochemical efficiency of PSII (F-v/F-m), Chl (a, b and a + b), leaf area index (LAI), biological yield and seed yield but minimum fluorescence (F-0), carotenoids, Anthocyanin and trigonelline concentration increased under water deficit stress. There were negative and significant correlations between F-o and LAI, biological and seed yield and on the other side, positive and significant correlations between total Chl. and the above mentioned traits. Water deficit stress led to the photo inhibition of photosynthesis. In most treatments, both vermicompost and zeolite application increased LAI, biological yield, seed yield and trigonelline concentration in fenugreek. Greater concentration of trigonelline in fenugreek under mild water deficit stress conditions may not necessarily supply give economic benefits, as higher concentration is often compensated by lower seed yield.

AB  - The large fish indicator (LFI), or 'proportion of fish greater than 40 cm length in bottom trawl surveys,' is a frequently debated indicator of Good Environmental Status in European regional seas. How does the LFI respond to changes in fishing pressure? This question is addressed here through analysis of fine-scale spatial trends in the LFI within the North Sea, compared between two periods of contrasting fisheries management: 1983-1999 and 2000-2012, respectively, before and after the onset of the European Union's fleet reduction scheme. Over the entire period, the LFI has decreased in large parts of the North Sea. However, most of the decline was from 1983-1999; since 2000 the LFI has improved in much of the North Sea, especially in UK waters. Comparison with international effort data shows that those western areas where the LFI has improved correspond with regions where otter trawl effort has decreased since 2000 (and previously was highest in the 1990s), and also with decreases in beam trawl effort. This study provides strong support that recent European effort reduction schemes are now beginning to result in an improved ecosystem state as indicated by the regional-scale improvement in the LFI.

AB  - The European Union Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) uses indicators to track ecosystem state in relation to Good Environmental Status (GES). These indicators were initially expected to be "operational", i.e. to have well-understood relationships between state and specified anthropogenic pressure(s), and to have defined targets. Recent discussion on MSFD implementation has highlighted an additional class of "surveillance" indicators. Surveillance indicators monitor key aspects of the ecosystem for which there is: first, insufficient evidence to define targets and support formal state assessment; and/or second, where links to anthropogenic pressures are either weak or not sufficiently well understood to underpin specific management advice. Surveillance indicators are not only expected to directly track state in relation to GES, but also to provide complementary information (including warning signals) that presents a broader and more holistic picture of state, and inform and support science, policy, and management. In this study, we (i) present a framework for including surveillance indicators into the Activity-Pressure-State-Response process, (ii) consider a range of possible indicators that could perform this surveillance role, and (iii) suggest criteria for assessing the performance of candidate surveillance indicators, which might guide selection of the most effective indicators to perform this function.

AB  - Indices of biotic integrity (IBIs) are widely used to assess aquatic ecosystem health. However, there are few studies on their relationships. Based on fish, macroinvertebrate and plankton survey data collected in the Ganjiang River system from 2016 to 2017, redundancy analysis (RDA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were used to analyze how the community structures of these organisms respond to environmental variables. The fish IBI (F-IBI), benthic macroinvertebrate IBI (B-IBI), and phytoplankton IBI (P-IBI) were applied to evaluate the health status of the aquatic ecosystem. A Kruskal-Wallis test (p < 0.05) and Spearman's correlation coefficient analysis were performed to evaluate the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the results. Our results suggested that the F-IBI-, B-IBI-, and P-IBI-based assessments indicated good, fair, and healthy Ganjiang River system ecosystem health statuses, respectively, and significant differences existed among these indices (p < 0.05). The main environmental factors affecting F-IBI, B-IBI, and P-IBI were different. At the temporal scale, the F-IBI and B-IBI were stable, while the P-IBI fluctuated obviously. The consistency between the F-IBI and B-IBI results was better than that between each of these indices and the P-IBI results, and the consistency was better on a larger scale. These research results show that comprehensive assessments based on multiple groups rather than a single group can better characterize the impacts of environmental pressures on water ecosystems.

AB  - Less than 6% of the coterminous United States is in nature reserves. Assessment of the occurrence of nature reserves across ranges of elevation and soil productivity classes indicates that nature reserves are most frequently found at higher elevations and on less productive soils. The distribution of plants and animals suggests that the greatest number of species is found at lower elevations. A preliminary assessment of the occurrence of mapped land cover types indicates that similar to 60% of mapped cover types have < 10% of their area in nature reserves. Land ownership patterns show that areas of lower elevation and more productive soils are most often privately owned and already extensively converted to urban and agricultural uses. Thus any effort to establish a system of nature reserves that captures the full geographical and ecological range of cover types and species must fully engage the private sector.

AB  - This experiment was conducted to determine the effect of kaolin clay application and deficit irrigation on quantitative characteristics of pumpkin in a field located in Siahbaz village of Khoy, Iran. In order to investigate the effect of irrigation and kaolin clay on yield and yield components of (Cucurbita pepo L.), this experimental was considered. An experiment was performed with irrigation at four levels (complete irrigation, deficit irrigation from the shoot stage, deficit irrigation from flowering stage and deficit irrigation from seed filling stage) and three levels of kaolin foliar application (control, 3% kaolin and 6% kaolin) was considered. Analysis of variance showed that deficit irrigation and kaolin had significant effect on number of seeds per fruit, fruit yield, 1000 grain weight, grain and biological yield, harvest index, oil and protein percentage, oil yield and protein yield. Maximum grain weight (294.5 gr), grain yield (807 kg ha(-1)), oil percentage (46.2) and oil yield (373.3 kg ha(-1)) were related to complete irrigation treatment. The highest grain weight (257.07 gr), grain yield (733 kg ha(-1)) and fruit yield (23.8 kg ha(-1)) were observed in the 3% kaolin. Based on the results, deficit irrigation at seed filling stage was superior to other treatments. Kaolin had no effect on grain yield and could be interrupted once without irrigation. Kaolin used in this experiment under irrigation limitation conditions could partially offset the water-deficit yield due to control treatment. Due to lack of water, yield of untreated plants was lower than kaolin-treated ones.

AB  - The present work aimed at developing a novel water quality index based on fuzzy logic, that is, a comprehensive artificial intelligence (AI) approach to the development of environmental indices for routine assessment of surface water quality, particularly for human drinking purposes. Twenty parameters were included based on their critical importance for the overall water quality and their potential impact on human health. To assess the performance of the proposed index under actual conditions, a case study was conducted at Mambo dam, Iran, employing water quality data of four sampling stations in the water basin of the dam from 2006 to 2009. Results of this study indicated that the general quality of water in all the sampling stations over all the years of the study period is fairly low (yearly averages are usually in the range of 45-55). According to the results of ANOVA test, water quality did not significantly change over time in any of the sampling stations (P>0.05). In addition, comparison of the outputs of the fuzzy-based proposed index proposed with those of the NSF water quality index (the WQI) and Canadian Water Quality Index (CWQI) showed similar results and were sensitive to changes in the level of water quality parameters. However, the index proposed by the present study produced a more stringent outputs compared to the WQI and CWQI. Results of the sensitivity analysis suggested that the index is robust against the changes in the rules. In conclusion, the proposed index seems to produce accurate and reliable results and can therefore be used as a comprehensive tool for water quality assessment, especially for the analysis of human drinking water.

AB  - One source of anthropogenic noise in the oceans which has attracted much concern is naval sonar. As a result of possible impacts of such sonar, several environmental NGOs have pursued legal cases in the United States criticizing environmental assessments conducted prior to exercises and proposed mitigation measures. Cases have been brought using the US National Environmental Protection Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, Endangered Species Act, Coastal Zone Management Act and other statutes. This paper reviews the chronology and results of these various cases. During the G.W. Bush presidential administration, the legal battle went to the US Supreme Court in the case Winter vs. Natural Resources Defense Council. This case however, did not address the potential impacts of sonar on cetaceans or the effectiveness of mitigation measures. During the Obama administration, mitigation measures for naval exercises have been revised, and working groups planned, in an attempt to resolve conflict between parties. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Overall health of a stream is one of the powerful indicators for planning mitigation strategies. Currently, available methods to estimate stream health do not look at all the different components of stream health. Based on the statistical parameters obtained from daily streamflow data, water quality data, and index of biotic integrity (IBI), this study evaluated the impacts on all the elements of stream health, such as aquatic species, riparian vegetation, benthic macro-invertebrates, and channel degradation for the Plum Creek watershed in Texas, USA. The method involved the (1) collection of flow data at the watershed outlet; (2) identification of hydrologic change in the streamflow; (3) estimation of hydrologic indicators using NATional Hydrologic Assessment Tool (NATHAT) before alteration and after alteration periods; (4) identification of the most relevant indicators affecting stream health in the watershed based on stream type; (5) preliminary estimation of the existence of stream health using flow duration curves (FDCs); (6) the use of stream health-relevant hydrologic indices with the scoring system of the Dundee Hydrologic Regime Assessment Method (DHRAM). The FDCs plotted together for before and after the alteration periods indicated the likely presence of a stream health problem in the Plum Creek. The NATHAT-DHRAM method showed a likely moderate impact on the health of Plum Creek. The biological assessments carried out, the water quality data monitored, and the land cover during pre- and post-alteration periods documented in a publicly available federal document support the stream health results obtained from this study.

AB  - 1. In precocial birds, where the young feed themselves, the costs and benefits of brood size are still poorly understood. An experimental manipulation of brood size was employed to examine the effects of brood size on both parents and young in a wild population of barnacle geese [Branta leucopsis (Bechstein)] during brood-rearing on Svalbard.
   2. Social dominance of the family unit, the amount of vigilance behaviour of the parents, the growth of the goslings in the family unit and an index of body condition for female parents during moult were all positively correlated with brood size.
   3. When brood size changed as a result of natural events (i.e. predation or adoption) or experimental manipulation, rates of dominance, parental vigilance, gosling growth and female parent condition changed in a similar direction to the observed relation between the variable and brood size in unchanged broods.
   4. After fledging, the fast-growing goslings in large broods survived better during autumn migration, while there was no apparent net cost in survival or next-year breeding for the parents.
   5. Via a direct effect of brood size on dominance of the family unit, large broods were beneficial for both parent and young in a situation where there was strong intraspecific competition for the available food resources.
   6. This study provides a clear demonstration of a causal relationship between brood size and various components of both gosling and adult fitness and is of direct relevance to the phenomenon of adoption and the evolution of brood size in this species.

AB  - Ornamental trees bearing outstanding flowers bring notable ecosystem services to cities. Existing research often treated ornamental trees as a sub-category of urban trees. To investigate the contributions of ornamental trees, this study aimed to: (1) assess their provision of ecosystem services; and (2) examine their ecological composition and diversity. Comprehensive tree survey in 93 public housing estates in Hong Kong identified 12,516 ornamental trees. To characterise the ability to provide ecosystem services, an index termed serviceable tree volume was devised. This innovative quantity aided the evaluation of ornamental trees by visual amenities, olfactory trait and ecological benefits while considering the compromise due to structural defects. The comprehensive tree survey showed a significant tendency of planting exotics for ornamental purposes. Most ornamentals could potentially deliver high-quality ecosystem services which were unfortunately restrained by prevailing very poor health conditions particularly attributed to structural defects on major branches. By relative importance value, several species dominated the ornamental tree inventory, namely Bauhinia ?Blakeana?, Delonix regia and Bombax ceiba. By incorporating serviceable tree volume in calculating relative importance value, the importance ranking of ornamental species was re-ordered. Using tree stem as the unit of analysis, Shannon-Wiener Diversity, Reciprocal Simpson and Pielou?s Evenness of the ornamental tree stock stood at 3.08, 14.73 and 0.74 respectively, and they were reduced when the three indices incorporated serviceable tree volume. Diverse native ornamentals could be planted extensively in the urban forest in tandem with the preservation of important exotic species.

AB  - The nearshore waters and sediments along 500 km of the eastern Red Sea coast from Yanbu to Al-Lith were investigated in regard to environmental parameters (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and pH), sediment grain size, organic matters, carbonates, metal concentrations (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Cr, Pb, Ni and Co) and benthic foraminifera in order to document and give a broad view about the present environmental status of this shorline area. The results showed that the studied nearshore sediments were mainly composed of biogenic sandy sediments with very low metal concentrations indicating an existence in a natural state. However, in the nearshore sediments of Jeddah coast, these metals became frequent showing the highest concentrations indicating urbanization activities. In the other hand, the organic matter showed no relations with these metals indicating its typical marine sources. The benthic foraminifera of these nearshore sediments were low due to modification by taphonomic processes and were visually (and by the CCA) divided into three faunal assemblages. The Coscinospira hemprichii-Varidentella neostriatula assemblage increased northwards, following the subtle northward increase of salinity, and this could be used as a high salinity indicator in the Red Sea fossil sediments. Whereas, the Neorotalia calcar-Neoeponides bradyi assemblage increased southward, probably, as a result of a profusion of seagrasses and filamentous algae. The Quinqueloculina seminula assemblage showed no increase/decrease either towards the north or the south, indicating their tolerance for a wide range of environmental conditions and showing, however, their preferences to soft, muddy substrates.

AB  - The presence of heavy metals, excess nutrients, and microbial contaminants in aquatic systems of coastal Delaware has become a public concern as human population increases and land development continues. Delaware's coastal lagoons have been subjected to problems commonly shared by other coastal Mid-Atlantic states: turbidity, sedimentation, eutrophication, periodic hypoxic/anoxic conditions, toxic substances, and high bacterial levels. The cumulative impact of pollutants from run-off and point sources has degraded water quality, reduced the diversity and abundance of various fish species, invertebrates, and submerged aquatic vegetation. The effects are especially pronounced within the manmade dead end canal systems. In this article, we present selected case studies conducted in the Delaware Inland Bays. Due to the ecological services provided by bivalves, our studies in Delaware Inland Bays are geared toward oysters with special focus on the microbial loads followed by the water quality assessments of the bay. The relationships between oysters (Crassostrea virginica), microbial loads and nutrient levels in the water were investigated. The heavy metal levels monitored further away from the waste water treatment plant in the inland bays are marginally higher than the recommended EPA limits. Also, our studies confirmed that aerobic bacteria and Vibrionaceae levels are salinity dependent. Total bacteria in oysters increased when nitrate and total suspended solids increased in the waters. Studies such as these are important because every year millions of Americans consume raw oysters. Data collected over the last 10 years from our studies may be used to build a predictive index of conditions that are favorable for the proliferation of human pathogenic bacteria. Results from this study will benefit the local community by helping them understand the importance of oyster aquaculture and safe consumption of oysters while making them appreciate their ecological and commercial values. This will also be of tremendous help to the commercial shellfish aquaculture farms to predict poor conditions to prevent oysters' consumption when bacterial levels are high in water.

AB  - Present-day coral reef ecosystem monitoring techniques can be costly, labor-intensive point measurements that can potentially introduce intractable sampling bias and error. Here we report correlations between visually obtained ecological assessment metrics and concurrently recorded aspects of the underwater biological soundscape over coral reefs at 23 sites spanning the Hawaiian Islands archipelago. Sites from the 'cool tropics' oceanographic habitat grouped along a principal component defined by an acoustic sliding scale: from protected or more remote sites at which lower frequencies were more dominant, to degraded sites which produced soundscapes dominated by higher frequency sound. Positive correlations between ambient biological sounds below 2 kHz and the density of benthic invertebrates (Pearson's rho = 0.61-0.76), their predators (rho = 0.65-0.8), organism-scale bathymetric complexity (rho = 0.6-0.62) and the quantity of crustose coralline algae (rho = 0.6-0.62) suggest a connection between this part of the spectrum, habitat complexity and the density of benthic fauna. A positive correlation was also observed between the daytime soundscape in the 2 to 20 kHz band and the proportion of benthic fleshy macroalgal cover (rho = 0.63-0.7), an indicator of reef degradation. This study indicates the possibility of rapid, inexpensive and spatially integrative remote sensing of the ecological state of coral reefs. Such quantitative methods could be used to ecologically assess vast areas of reef habitat autonomously in near real-time and could be important for remote in situ detection and characterization of subtle but significant ecological changes brought about by climate change and other more localized anthropogenic impacts.

AB  - The paper provides data on spatial distribution of petroleum hydrocarbons, heterotrophic and hydrocarbon-oxidizing bacteria in water and bottom sediments as well as on heavy metals in bottom sediments at different sites in the zone of fresh and saline water mixing, with the salinity range 1-18 parts per thousand during spring low water and high water. Physical and chemical characteristics of the bottom sediments are given. The highest hydrocarbon-oxidizing bacteria percentage of the heterotrophic bacterioplankton count in the indicated areas was found in April, with the maximum of 55 % determined in the transition zone waters. The share of hydrocarbon-oxidizing bacteria in the heterotrophic bacteria abundance in the water was larger than that in the bottom sediments. The highest concentrations of chloroform-extractable substances and petroleum hydrocarbons were detected in the marine zone bottom sediments, and their lowest concentrations were found in the river zone. During the period under study, the petroleum hydrocarbon input (in almost equal volumes) was constant, which is indicated by the hydrocarbon percentage of chloroform-extractable substances, which on average was 31 % for the marine zone, 29 % for the transitional zone, and 32 % for the river zone. In contrast to the river and transition zones, the concentration of chloroform-extractable substances observed in the marine zone bottom sediments was constant.

AB  - We conducted a supplemental water quality monitoring study and quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) to complement the United States environmental protection agency's (U.S. EPA) National Epidemiological and Environmental Assessment of Recreational water study at Boqueron beach in Puerto Rico to estimate the gastrointestinal (GI) illness levels associated with recreational water exposures. The previously reported epidemiological study had sufficient statistical power to detect an average illness rate of approximately 17 swimming associated GI illnesses per 1000 recreation events or greater, and found no consistent relationships between water quality measured by fecal indicator organisms (FIO) and swimming-associated illnesses (U.S. EPA, 2010a). The QMRA incorporated monitoring data for pathogens and fecal indicators collected during the epidemiological study period and calculated average swimming-associated illness levels that were approximately two GI illnesses per 1000 recreation events. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a comprehensive water quality monitoring program and QMRA analysis has been conducted in parallel with a recreational water epidemiological study. The QMRA results were consistent with the low rate of reported illnesses during the 2009 epidemiological study (i.e. <17 GI illnesses per 1000 recreation events) and provide additional context for understanding the epidemiological results. The results illustrate that coupling QMRA with an epidemiological study at a single study site provides a unique ability to understand human health illnesses especially under conditions where water quality, as measured by traditional FIO is good and/or average illness rates are lower than can be quantified via epidemiological methods alone.

AB  - The study field covering an area of about 1000 km(2) is located in Sorgun town of the city of Yozgat. In the region Paleozoic, Campanian-Maastrichtian, Eocene, Miocene and Quaternary units are exposed. Among these units, the lower Eocene Celtek Formation hosts coal beds and oil shale. The Eocene epoch is important for organic matter deposition regarding oil and gas productivity and anoxic depositional conditions. In order to examine the paleo-sedimentary conditions of oil shales in the study area and their relation to Total Organic Carbon (TOC) contents and major-trace element contents, a total of 29 samples were collected from two boreholes and one Measured Stratigraphic Section (MSS). Samples have TOC contents varying from 1.97 to 16.17 wt% (average 6.30 wt%). The V/Cr, VI(V+Ni), U/Th, delta U and Authigenic Uranium (AU) values of the celtek Formation oil shales (CFOS) reveal that the oil shales have been deposited under variable paleo-environmental conditions. For paleo-salinity the Sr/Ba ratios indicate mostly deposition in a freshwater environment. Chemical Alteration Index (CIA) values and Sr/Cu ratios indicate that paleo-climate conditions of CFOS were dry, hot and occasionally humid. The Fe/Ti and (Fe+Mn)iTi ratios reveal hydrothermal activity during sedimentation of oil shales. Zr/Rb ratios of samples are indicative of very weak paleo-hydrodynamics during the deposition of oil shales. Such variable geochemical conditions in the basin resulted in variable paleo-environmental conditions.

AB  - To ameliorate soil oxygen deficiencies around subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) drippers, aerated irrigation (AI) was introduced to supply aerated water to the soil through venturi installed in the SDI pipeline. The objectives of this study were to assess the effects of AI on soil respiration (SR), air-filled porosity (AFP), soil temperature (ST), and oxygen concentrations (OCC). Total soil respiration (TSR), biological activity temperature index (BAT), and soil oxygen consumption (OCS) based on SR, ST, and OCC, respectively, were subsequently calculated to explore the relationships between TSR, BAT, OCS, OCC, and AFP. Greenhouse-based experiments included two treatments: AI and unaerated SDI (CK), during the tomato growing season in the fall of 2015. The results showed that compared with CK, AI treatment significantly increased OCC and AFP (by 16 and 7.4%, respectively), as well as TSR and OCS (by 24.21 and 22.91%, respectively) (P<0.05). Mean fruit yield with AI treatment was also 23% higher (P<0.05) than that with CK. When BAT was controlled, partial correlations between TSR, OCS, OCC, and AFP were all significant in the AI treatment but not in the CK treatment. TSR was more sensitive to the interaction effects of OCC, OCS, AFP, and BAT under the AI treatment. Thus, the significantly increased TSR with AI appeared to be due to the favorable soil aeration conditi ons (higher OCC and AFP). Furthermore, the improvements in soil aeration conditions and respiration with AI appeared to facilitate the improvement in fruit yields, which also suggests the economic benefits of AI.

AB  - Losses of working and long-term memory are hallmarks of human aging and may signal impending neurodegenerative disease. The maintenance of neural elements in brain systems that support memory, such as synapse formation in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, are critical for cognitive health in aging. This paper reviews the biological basis for androgens as neuroprotectants or neuromodulators in aging and the importance of androgens on the brain systems important for memory. We relate biological effects to cognitive outcomes in elderly men under a variety of androgen conditions. In brief, androgen deprivation causes significant loss of synapses in the hippocampus in rodent and nonhuman primates, increases amyloid deposition in human and rodent models and causes changes in neurotransmission in prefrontal cortex in rodent models. Recent work suggests that these changes modify age-related cognitive loss, particularly to memory in men. In addition, the conversion of testosterone to its androgen metabolites or to estradiol may play a special role in the preservation of memory in aging. This paper reviews discrepancies between studies using animal models and studies of human cognition, and suggests new directions that are likely to be fruitful in the future for understanding the role of androgens in brain aging. This review suggests that studies of low androgen levels in older men may not index the same biological mechanisms and behavioral effects as the studies of gonadectomy in animal models.

AB  - For the Onon-Borzinsky system of lakes, there are typical cycles of 27-35 years old, controlled by the course of atmospheric humidification, when relatively moist and very cold periods alternate with dry and relatively warm periods. As a result of filling and drying of reservoirs, the main hydrochemical characteristics change, leading to the transformation of the biological parameters of hydrobionts and the restructuring of lake ecosystems as a whole. The aim of the work is to assess the ecological state of aquatic communities (phytoplankton, zooplankton, macroalgal, macrophytes, zoobenthos, fish) of some lakes of the Onon-Torey plain in different hydrological periods. The results of the works are based on long-term collections (years with high water levels - 1999, 2003 and low - 2007, 2011, 2014, 2016) hydrobionts in the mineral lakes Zun-Torey, Barun-Torey, Bain-Bulak, Tsagan-Nor, Bain-Tsagan - relating to the South Tsasuchchey and Torey group. Sampling of water for the study of hydrophysical, hydrochemical and hydrobiological indicators was carried out according to standard methods. It is established that the water and physico-chemical regime of lakes is unstable. Hydrological and hydrochemical changes due to climatic fluctuations determined the change in the hydrobiological regime. In the plankton with a decrease in the water level, an increase in mineralization, pH, and water temperature, there was a decrease in species richness, a restructuring of the dominant complex toward the prevalence of salt-tolerant and alkaliphil species (taxa), and a simplification of the trophic structure. For higher aquatic vegetation and fish, there is a decline in the qualitative composition and numerical characteristics.

AB  - As a large developing country experiencing rapid economic growth, China is facing the dual pressures and challenges of insufficient resources and protecting the ecological environment. However, China is a vast territory, and the spread of regional economic development is extremely uneven. Therefore, the responsibility for emission reductions undertaken by each region cannot be allocated equally. In response to this problem, this study proposes an emission permit allocation model that is built from the perspective of efficiency and energy conservation and emission reduction (ECER) technology. Compared with other models, the model proposed in this study has two innovations. First, the model allows central decision makers to adjust the emission reduction index under various conditions and for various reasons. This further allows the total emissions reduction amounts to be adjusted. Second, the proposed model could also allocate emission permits from the perspective of ECER technology. An empirical study on the allocation of SO2 emission permits at provincial level in China shows the following: (a) The overall ECER level in China is low, and there are significant differences in ECER efficiency in different regions. (b) Significant differences in ECER technologies exist in different regions of China. In particular, the ECER technology standards in China's northeast region are far below the national average. (c) Each province's emission reduction targets should be reasonably set, based on actual production conditions. If excessive emission reduction targets are set, it becomes unreasonably difficult to complete the emission reduction task.

AB  - Forest microclimate plays an integral role in ecosystem processes, yet a predictive understanding of its spatial and temporal variability in heterogeneous landscapes is largely lacking. In this study, we used regression kriging (RK) to analyze the degree to which physiographic versus ecological variables influence spatio-temporal variation in understory microclimate conditions. We monitored understory temperature in 200 forest plots within a 274 km(2) environmentally heterogeneous region in northern California (0.55 obs/km(2)). For each plot location, we measured four physiographic influences (elevation, coastal proximity, potential solar radiation, topographic wetness index) and three ecological drivers (forest patch size, proximity to forest edge, tree abundance). Temperature observations were aggregated to three time scales (hourly, daily, and monthly) to examine temporal variability in microclimate dynamics and its effect on spatial prediction. The obtained prediction models included both physiographic and vegetative effects, although the relative importance of individual effects varied greatly between the different models. Across time scales, elevation and coastal proximity had the most consistent physiographic effects on temperature, followed by the vegetative effects of forest patch size and distance to forest edge. RK captured significantly more landscape-scale variability in understory temperature than a regression-only approach with considerably better model performance at hourly and daily time scales than at a monthly scale. Using varied sampling density scenarios our results also suggest that predictive accuracy drops considerably at densities less than 0.34 obs/km(2). This research illustrates how geospatial and statistical modeling can be used to distinguish physiographic versus ecological effects on microclimate dynamics and elucidates the spatial and temporal scales that these processes operate.

AB  - We investigated the resident bacterial communities within the biofilm of 252 streams in New Zealand with the aim of assessing the community variation associated with natural and anthropogenic-influenced environmental characteristics. This work is part of a larger project investigating the use of bacterial communities as biological indicators, and here we assess how predictable the variation in bacterial community is in response to environmental influences. Samples of epilithic biofilm were collected in the Austral Summer of 2010, and bacterial communities were characterised using the DNA-fingerprinting technique automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA). Multivariate analysis of the ARISA data revealed that geographical location (region) was a better predictor of bacterial community structure than land use. Our finding that taxon richness varied with geographical location, decreasing along a north to south (increasing latitude) gradient, and that land use had no significant effect on taxon richness suggests that bacterial communities have great potential to act as biological indicators of stream health. In particular, the maintenance of taxon richness at impacted sites is a key advantage since the local extinction of many traditional indicator organisms, such as fish or macroinvertebrates, often precludes their further use. Our conceptual model of bacterial community structure proposes that stream biofilm communities are comprised of four broad groups of bacteria: ubiquitous bacteria (found at all sites), region-specific bacteria (those representative of geographical areas), natural-state bacteria (those associated with unmodified systems) and impact-related bacteria (those associated with human activities). The proportion of these four groups at a particular sample site would provide the basis of a novel bacterial community index of stream health.

AB  - Hydrographic basins are the fundamental unit for the effective territorial planning. However, areas of higher and lesser susceptibility to degrading processes can occur in the same region, where different actions are required to preserve natural resources, as soil and water. In this context, this study aimed to propose a prioritization model to guide the territorial management in hydrographic basins. The study was conducted in the Taruma River basin, embedded in the southwest region of the Sao Paulo State, Brazil. First, the basin was compartmentalized into planning units, based on the delimitation and grouping of small watersheds. In each unit, seven morphometric parameters were calculated. The relationships among the parameters were evaluated by principal component analysis, from which the parameters were weighted. It resulted in an index expressing the environmental fragility of the planning units. Among the planning units, 20% present very-high priority, only 5% very-low priority, and 75% low, moderate, and high priority. Units of higher priority are commonly at the basins' headwaters, where linear channels and steeper slopes are concentrated. Lower priority units present low relief and hydrography conditions that do not favor high-intensity erosive processes. The proposed method is effective in identifying regions of high susceptibility to degradation according to morphometric parameters, which should be prioritized on the basins' territorial management. Since these parameters can be easily calculated, it can be presumed that the results could assist the environmental planning and the optimization of natural resources management within different hydrographic basins.

AB  - The alpine meadow ecosystem on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is characterized by low temperatures because of its high elevation. The low-temperature environment may limit both ecosystem photosynthetic CO2 uptake and ecosystem respiration, and thus affect the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE). We clarified the low-temperature constraint on photosynthesis and respiration in an alpine meadow ecosystem on the northern edge of the plateau using flux measurements obtained by the eddy covariance technique in two growing seasons. When we compared NEE during the two periods, during which the leaf area index and other environmental parameters were similar but the mean temperature differed, we found that NEE from 9 August to 10 September 2001, when the average temperature was low, was greater than that during the same period in 2002, when the average temperature was high, but the ecosystem gross primary production was similar during the two periods. Further analysis showed that ecosystem respiration was significantly higher in 2002 than in 2001 during the study period, as estimated from the relationship between temperature and nighttime ecosystem respiration. The results suggest that low temperature controlled the NEE mainly through its influence on ecosystem respiration. The annual NEE, estimated from 15 January 2002 to 14 January 2003, was about 290 g CO2 m(-2) year(-1). The optimum temperature for ecosystem NEE under light-saturated conditions was estimated to be around 15 degrees C.

AB  - Among various supercritical carbon dioxide cycles, the supercritical recompression carbon dioxide cycle can well adapt to the high temperature of the exhaust gas of the solid oxide fuel cell-gas turbine system to augment power generation. Nevertheless, even after the recovery by the supercritical recompression carbon dioxide cycle, the exhaust gas still contains a large amount of unutilized waste energy. Few studies introduce low-temperature cycles to build cascade cycle systems, which are very likely to address this issue effectively. From the perspectives of energy, exergy, environmental and economic indexes, this article analyzes and compares the improvement potential of integrating four common low-temperature cycles, including organic Rankine cycle, transcritical carbon dioxide cycle, Kalina cycle, and organic flash cycle. Different key operating parameters are considered indepth and optimized by a genetic algorithm. The results illustrate that in terms of efficiency, the introduction of the organic Rankine cycle is the most outstanding since it can reach the highest energy efficiency of 72.74-73.55% (exergy efficiency of 70.22-71.01%) across wide operation conditions. In terms of cost, the coupling of Kalina cycle is suggested due to the lowest capital cost of 19.94 $/h. The environmental penalty of the four systems all accounts for 14.73% of the total cost. As a consequence, the pros and cons of four common low-temperature cycles are fully demonstrated, which can provide references for the power plant planning.

AB  - The estuary and the Gulf of St. Lawrence (EGSL), eastern Canada form a vast inland sea that is subjected to numerous anthropogenic pressures. Management tools are needed to detect and quantify their effect on benthic communities. The aims of this study are to analyze the spatial distribution of epibenthic communities in the EGSL and quantify the impact of important pressures on them to identify indicator taxa. Epibenthic communities were sampled at 1314 EGSL sites between 2011 and 2018 by bottom trawling. Cluster analyses revealed the presence of six distinct epibenthic communities that seem to be strongly influenced by oxygen concentration. Threshold analyses confirm that oxygen is an important predictor of epibenthic community composition and distribution. A major oxygen threshold is observed around 50-100 mu mol O-2 L-1, resulting in a shift of community type. At these concentrations and below, opportunistic taxa dominate the community while sensitive taxa are absent or present at very low abundance. Biomass of the latter only starts to increase when oxygen concentrations reach 150 mu mol O-2 L-1. The species Actinostola callosa, Actinauge cristata, Ctenodiscus crispatus, and Brisaster fragilis were identified as good indicators for detecting this impact threshold forepibenthic communities. This study provides threshold-based indicator species that help to establish and monitor the ecological state of epibenthic communities in a marine ecosystem exposed to multiple pressures.

AB  - Machine learning techniques for ecological applications or "eco-informatics" are becoming increasingly useful and accessible as software for these techniques becomes more readily available. Complex ecological data sets with a multitude of variables are also increasingly available. Ecologists, who do not necessarily have extensive backgrounds in machine-learning techniques, are facing decisions on new methods of data analysis. We evaluated the predictive ability of three commercially available (i.e. user-friendly) software packages for artificial neural networks (ANNs), evolutionary algorithms (EAs), and classificatiordregression trees (CART). To demonstrate their usage, we analyzed fish and habitat data from the mid-Atlantic region of the US, which was collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These data, including over 200 environmental descriptors summarizing watershed, stream, and water chemistry, and physical habitat characteristics in addition to fish community metrics (i.e. richness, Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) scores, % exotics), were collected as part of the EPA's Environmental Monitoring and Protection program. We predicted fish IBI scores as a function of these local and regional scale habitat variables. Predictive ability is evaluated with independent validation data. These approaches could prove especially useful for conservation or management applications where ecologists seek to utilize the most comprehensive data to make predictions at various scales. By employing "user-friendly" software we hope to show that ecologists, without extensive knowledge of computational science, can benefit from these techniques by extracting more information about complex ecosystems. We found that all models predicted better than chance (p < 0.05). Relative strengths and weaknesses of these three approaches are compared and recommendations for their use in ecological applications are presented. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The spatial and seasonal variation of total and subcellular distribution of Cd, Cu, and Zn was followed in different tissues (gills, digestive gland, and remaining tissues) of the clam Ruditapes decussatus collected along a metal contamination gradient in the Ria Formosa lagoon (southern Portugal) and compared with metallothionein (MT) concentrations. Total metal concentrations decreased according to the sequence digestive gland > gills > remaining tissues for Cd, digestive gland approximate to gills > remaining tissues for Cu and gills > digestive gland > remaining tissues for Zn. MT concentrations in these tissues decreased according to the same sequence observed for Cd. In all the tissues, the highest subcellular concentration was in the cytosol for Cd and Cu and in the pellet for Zn. Among the three metals, Cd concentrations showed the most evident spatial variation. In all tissues, total and subcellular Cd concentrations decreased from the inner parts of the lagoon toward the ocean. However, no significant spatial or seasonal variation occurred in clam tissues for the other two metals, though marginal elevated Cu concentrations were observed in the inner parts of the lagoon. Therefore, Cu subcellular distribution in clam tissues was not significantly altered by Cu changes in the lagoon and are the baseline levels for normal metabolism of this clam population. The fact that total Zn concentrations remained unchanged both spatial and seasonal suggested that these clams regulate Zn in their tissues. In the three tissues, MT bind most significantly to Cd and Cu, while Zn, although binding to MT, is preferably bound to other ligands. MT concentrations showed the same spatial and seasonal variation of Cd and were significantly related with total and heat-treated cytosolic Cd in all tissues. For Cu a significant relationship between MT and total or cytosolic Cu was only observed in the remaining tissues. No relationship was observed between MT and total or cytosolic Zn concentrations. Metals and MT concentrations increased with the increase in the condition index for the gills and the digestive gland and decreased from the remaining tissues. Cd concentrations in the gills increased only in the heat-treated cytosolic fraction while Zn in this fraction decreased. Thus Cd concentrations in this tissue displaced Zn from the MT-fraction, leading to a modification of the soluble/insoluble Zn ratio once total Zn concentrations remained unchanged. This modification reflects a perturbation in the normal metabolism in this tissue due to the excess of Cd present. With the exception of the gills, Zn subcellular distribution in the other two tissues was similar among sites and season. The model that describes the relationship between MT, metals, and weight in the gills, digestive gland and remaining tissues also indicates that Cd was the only metal that influence MT synthesis significantly in all the tissues. The induced and/or existent MT was sufficient to bind free Cd ions present in the cells, preventing any damage to cellular metabolism in this clam population. Therefore, MT in the gills and digestive gland of R. decussatus can be used as an early warning signal for Cd exposure and are a useful biomarker to assess the toxicological status of this population in the Ria Formosa lagoon.

AB  - Phosphorus transferred from land to water is a major problem across the world. Identifying the source of phosphorus in water is an important prerequisite to the development of remedial strategies. In this paper, key aspects of phosphorus transfer from grazing land to water are reviewed along with the techniques that may be used to trace its origin.
   Dissolution and erosion are the two processes that can mobilise phosphorus. Erosion is the physical transport of sediment, arbitrarily defined as materials that do not pass through a 0.45 mu m filter, while dissolution is the transport of phosphorus either chemically dissolved in water or attached to colloidal material capable of passing through a 0.45 pm filter.
   Most phosphorus is transported from well managed pastures of southern Australia in a dissolved form (<0.45 mu m) and the highest loads typically occur in surface runoff.
   Being monoisotopic in its natural state, phosphorus cannot be directly traced. However, a range of techniques have been used to identify the source of sediment, and by implication, the attached phosphorus mobilised by erosion processes. With minor exceptions no such techniques are available for tracing phosphorus mobilised by dissolution processes.
   Organic marker compounds (biomarkers) may have useful attributes for phosphorus tracing. There are a vast range of biomarker compounds including sterols, phospholipids and alkanes, that are specific to potential phosphorus sources at a farm scale, and specific to particular land uses at a catchment scale (e.g. faeces and both live and decaying vegetation). This paper investigates the use of biomarkers to augment the current suite of phosphorus tracing techniques at both farm and catchment scales. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The biological health of lotic communities is negatively correlated with the amount of urban land use in the surrounding watershed. This association is due, in part, to a historic lack of regard for the ecological consequences of development. Environmental considerations are increasingly being brought to the fore in land use planning, and to bear on development in the form of stormwater regulations and best management practices. The effectiveness of these practices in maintaining the biological integrity of receiving waters is assumed, though largely untested. We examined the relationship between urban land use and the biological health of streams in historically urbanized areas of Ohio, USA, and tracked the health of three streams over a decade in the rapidly suburbanizing Columbus, Ohio metropolitan area. The health of streams, as measured by the Index of Biotic Integrity, declined significantly when the amount of urban land use measured as impervious cover exceeded 13.8%, and fell below expectations consistent with Clean Water Act goals when impervious cover exceeded 27.1%. Declining biological integrity was noted in two of the three streams with suburbanizing watersheds at levels of total urban land use as low as 4%, demonstrating that poorly regulated construction practices are the first step toward declining stream health in urbanizing landscapes, and also demonstrate that the current regulatory structure is wanting. The few sites in our data set where biological integrity was maintained despite high levels of urban land use occurred in streams where the floodplain and riparian buffer was relatively undeveloped. An aggressive stream protection policy that prescribes mandatory riparian buffer widths, preserves sensitive areas and minimizes hydrologic alteration needs to be part of the larger planning and regulatory framework.

AB  - Quantitative analysis of the response of ecosystem health to rural land use change is required to comprehend the human-nature coupling mechanism and to explore the process of global environmental change, which can interpret the ecological effects of regional land use and land cover change comprehensively. However, the existing regional ecosystem health assessment largely ignored either the internal connection of ecosystem health to land use patterns or the internal representation of ecosystem services to ecosystem health. Using Lijiang City of China as a study area, the average normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), landscape metrics, and ecosystem elasticity coefficient based on different land use types were used as quantitative indicators. Then the coefficient of spatial neighboring effect was introduced to characterize the adjacency effect on ecosystem services, and to generate the index of integrated ecosystem health. The results showed the change of land use was close to 30% at county level from 1986 to 2006, and forest land was the primary land use type. With respect to the declining physical health of ecosystems in all the four counties, the integrated health experienced a slight increase in Lijiang County. The vast majority of towns' ecosystem physical health and integrated health declined, while more than 70% of towns did not change distinctly. Ecosystem physical health had distinct influence on the integrated ecosystem health, and ecosystem vitality was the main factor affecting the condition of physical health. Emphasized in the interconnection of pattern and process, this study provided an ecosystem health approach to assessing the integrated ecological effects of regional land use change.

AB  - Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs, including DDT, HCH and HCB) and six indicator polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB 28, 52, 101, 138, 153, and 180) were measured in water, sediment, zooplankton, fish and Chinese softshell turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis) from Gaobeidian Lake, which is located in the effluent of Gaobeidian wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Beijing, China. DDTs were dominant except for in water. In water, the concentrations of DDTs (6.22 ng l(-1)) and HCHs (18.0 ng I`) were less than the limits (1000 ng 1-1 for DDTs and 5000 ng l(-1) for HCHs). However, PCBs concentration (20.8 ng l(-1)) exceeded the limit (14 ng l(-1)) suggested by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). The high ratio of p,p'-DDT/DDTs (0.80) in water suggested that DDTs had recently been discharged into the ambient environment despite a longtime ban in China. For fish and Pelodiscus sinensis, the accumulation patterns of OCPs and PCBs were different in muscle and liver. And HCB and PCB 153 were significant different in different species (p < 0.05). PCBs were dominated by PCB 52 in zooplankton, but by PCB 138 and 153 in Pelodiscus sinensis. The highest food web magnification factor (FWMF) was 4.83 for pp'-DDT and the second highest was 4.36 for PCB 101 in Gaobeidian Lake. As compared with the other studies, biomagnification in the present study was not obvious. Trophic levels and age were two important factors that might contribute to the bioaccumulation in the present study. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Geochemical analysis of the varved (annually laminated) sediments of a small, deep urban lake in east-central Minnesota shows that some water-quality and watershed indicators are approaching prehistoric (pre-1850s) values after an excursion to anomalous levels during the 1920s through 1950s. This high-resolution paleolimnological information (annually resolved for most of the 20th century), including varve thickness measurements on a digital image, carbon stable isotopic composition of organic matter, and sedimentary component quantification, provides historical perspective to lake managers planning remedial measures with reference to the "natural" state of the lake, especially in regard to the perception that water quality has declined only in recent decades (i.e., in the late 20th century). The lake is at present eutrophic and oligomictic, with oxygen-depleted bottom waters enriched in dissolved solids relative to surface waters; an alum treatment has contributed to the problem of persistent stratification at the same time as it has reduced phosphorus and increased transparency in lake surface waters. The sedimentary record shows the lake's strong response to agricultural, recreational, and urban development in the watershed, gradual improvement beginning at the time of sanitary sewer installation in the 1960s, and only a minor additional response to a concerted remediation effort in the mid-1980s to 1990s. Indices of terrestrial inputs and algal productivity show evidence of a lake that was at its most heavily impacted during the mid-20th century, and which has improved in some respects since the 1960s.

AB  - Colorimetric sensors based on localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) have attracted much attention for biosensor and chemical sensor applications. The unique optical effect of LSPR is based on the nanostructure of noble metals (e.g., Au, Ag, and Al) and the refractive index of the environment surrounding these metal nanomaterials. When either the structure or the environment of these nanomaterials is changed, their optical properties change and can be observed by spectroscopic techniques or the naked eye. Colorimetric-probe-based LSPR provides a simple, rapid, real-time, nonlabelled, sensitive biochemical detection and can be used for point-of-care testing as well as rapid screening for the diagnosis of various diseases. Gold and silver nanoparticles, which are the two most widely used plasmonic nanomaterials, demonstrate strong and sensitive LSPR signals that can be used for the selective detection of several chemicals in biochemical compounds provided by the human body (e.g., urine and blood). This information can be used for the diagnosis of several human health conditions. This paper provides information regarding colorimetric probes based on LSPR for the detection of three major chemicals in human urine: creatinine, albumin, and glucose. In addition, the mechanisms of selective detection and quantitative analysis of these chemicals using metal nanoparticles are discussed along with colorimetric-detection-based LSPR for many other specific chemicals that can be detected in urine, such as catecholamine neurotransmitters, thymine, and various medicines. Furthermore, issues regarding the use of portable platforms for health monitoring with colorimetric detection based on LSPR are discussed.

AB  - Juvenile Penaeus monodon prawns were exposed to a variety of putative stressors and blood glucose concentrations monitored as an index of metabolic stress. Prawns were held under controlled conditions and food deprived for 12-18 h before blood sampling. Juvenile prawns maintained in tanks at densities of 9, 23, 36 and 50 prawns/m(2) for 4 wk did not have significantly different baseline levels of blood glucose, with mean concentrations varying from 1.1 to 1.3 mmol/L. In contrast, as an index of overall condition, antennal length and rostral spine length were significantly degraded in the 36 and 50 pramns/m(2) groups compared to the 9 and 23 prawns/m2 groups (P < 0.05). Blood glucose levels were significantly elevated after prawns were exposed to air for 10 min and also increased significantly when dissolved oxygen was decreased from 6.5 mg/L to 2.1 mg/L. (P < 0.05), Gassing of water from pH 8.5 to 5.9 with carbon dioxide, with a corresponding decrease of dissolved oxygen from 6.6 to 5.9 md L, induced a rapid and significant rise in blood glucose levels from 1.1 to 2.3 mmol/L. In contrast, a decrease of mater pH from 8.3 to 5.9 with sulfuric acid, did not result in a significant change in blood glucose concentrations. These findings are discussed in relation to pond management for maintaining prawns in a low stress environment.

AB  - Quantification of the drought tolerance of wheat (Triticum spp.) genotypes is of interest to physiologists investigating traits associated with adaptation to dry conditions and to breeders developing cultivars for dry areas. The objective of this research was to assess drought tolerance in terms of minimal depression of yield in dry compared with favorable environments (drought susceptibility index, S) with a superiority measure (P) based on the sum across environments of the mean-squared differences between genotype yield and the maximum yield in each environment. Twenty-five hexaploid (T. aestivum L.) and 16 tetraploid (T. turgidum L. var. durum) wheat genotypes were grown in separate experiments under dry and irrigated conditions on a Swinton loam (Aridic Haploboroll) soil. There was year-to-year variation in S within genotypes and changes in genotype ranking within years. No single cause for this variability was identified. The S index did not differentiate between potentially drought-tolerant genotypes and those that had low yield potential from other causes. P was correlated with mean yield in both the hexaploid (- 0.96**) and tetraploid (- 0.94**) groups (both significant at P = 0.01). However, P was strongly influenced by high yield environments; this was alleviated by standardization of the yield data. Although P appears to be a possible method to quantify average superiority of genotypes across locations, its suitability requires further assessment. There seems to be no simple technique to quantify drought tolerance that would assist physiologists in choosing genotypes in which to evaluate putative drought tolerance mechanisms.

AB  - Aquatic monitoring programs vary widely in objectives and design. However, each program faces the unifying challenge of assessing conditions and quantifying reasonable expectations for measured indicators. A common approach for setting resource expectations is to define reference conditions that represent areas of least human disturbance or most natural state of a resource characterized by the range of natural variability across a region of interest. Identification of reference sites often relies heavily on professional judgment, resulting in varying and unrepeatable methods. Standardized methods for data collection, site characterization, and reference site selection facilitate greater cooperation among assessment programs and development of assessment tools that are readily shareable and comparable. We illustrate an example that can serve the broader global monitoring community on how to create a consistent and transparent reference network for multiple stream resource agencies. We provide a case study that offers a simple example of how reference sites can be used, at the landscape level, to link upslope management practices to a specific in-channel response. We found management practices, particularly areas with high road densities, have more fine sediments than areas with fewer roads. While this example uses data from only one of the partner agencies, if data were collected in a similar manner they can be combined and create a larger, more robust dataset. We hope that this starts a dialog regarding more standardized ways through inter-agency collaborations to evaluate data. Creating more consistency in physical and biological field protocols will increase the ability to share data.

AB  - The multivariate AMBI (M-AMBI) is an extension of the AZTI Marine Biotic Index (AMBI) that has been used extensively in Europe, but not in the United States. In a previous study, we adapted AMBI for use in US coastal waters (US AMBI), but saw biases in salinity and score distribution when compared to locally calibrated indices. In this study we modified M-AMBI for US waters and compared its performance to that of US AMBI. Index performance was evaluated in three ways: 1) concordance with local indices presently being used as management tools in three geographic regions of US coastal waters, 2) classification accuracy for sites defined a priori as good or bad and 3) insensitivity to natural environmental gradients. US M-AMBI was highly correlated with all three local indices and removed the compression in response seen in moderately disturbed sites with US AMBI. US M-AMBI and US AMBI did a similar job correctly classifying sites as good or bad in local validation datasets (83-100% accuracy vs. 84-95%, respectively). US M-AMBI also removed the salinity bias of US AMBI so that lower salinity sites were not more likely to be incorrectly classified as impaired. The US M-AMBI appears to be an acceptable index for comparing condition across broad-scales such as estuarine and coastal waters surveyed by the US EPA's National Coastal Condition Assessment, and may be applicable to areas of the US coast that do not have a locally derived benthic index.

AB  - The regional-scale importance of an aquatic stressor depends both on its regional extent (i.e., how widespread it is) and on the severity of its effects in ecosystems where it is found. Sample surveys, such as those developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP), are designed to estimate and compare the extents, throughout a large region, of elevated conditions for various aquatic stressors. In this article, we propose relative risk as a complementary measure of the severity of each stressor's effect on a response variable that characterizes aquatic ecological condition. Specifically, relative risk measures the strength of association between stressor and response variables that can be classified as either "good" (i.e., reference) or "poor" (i.e., different from reference). We present formulae for estimating relative risk and its confidence interval, adapted for the unequal sample inclusion probabilities employed in EMAP surveys. For a recent EMAP survey of streams in five Mid-Atlantic states, we estimated the relative extents of eight stressors as well as their relative risks to aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages, with assemblage condition measured by an index of biotic integrity (IBI). For example, a measure of excess sedimentation had a relative risk of 1.60 for macroinvertebrate IBI, with the meaning that poor IBI conditions were 1.6 times more likely to be found in streams having poor conditions of sedimentation than in streams having good sedimentation conditions. We show how stressor extent and relative risk estimates, viewed together, offer a compact and comprehensive assessment of the relative importances of multiple stressors.

AB  - Policy makers are confronted with the question of how to combine sustainable flood protection and floodplain rehabilitation in the best possible way. Both topics deal with spatial planning aspects in a range of scales. This question was the starting point for the development of an evaluation method within the IRMA/SPONGE project INTERMEUSE, illustrated on the basis of assumed flood protection strategies in the Meuse river basin (the 'sponge' strategy, the 'retention' strategy, and the 'floodplain lowering' or 'winter bed' strategy). The integration of flood protection and floodplain rehabilitation can be performed on two scale levels that are interrelated: on the regional level the focus is on (large parts of) an entire stream basin; on the local level specific site conditions are taken as starting point. Ecological aspects under study are spatial cohesion of habitats as identified by species population persistence modelling (regional, longitudinal level) and required habitat quality for carabid beetles and for meadow vegetation gradients as assessed by correspondence analysis (local, transversal level). The carabid beetles are taken as indicative for the ecological integrity of the river bed, the meadow vegetation for that of the floodplain.
   A unifying concept in the evaluation of ecological integrity is the ecological minimum: the critical boundary or minimum level of habitat conditions for a potentially good ecological functioning. It is the least acceptable state for a river ecosystem that is still functional to some extent, compared to a natural river ecosystem. The results of this study show clearly that there is a good chance to combine floodplain rehabilitation aims with flood protection activities, both on a local and on an international scale. Although ecological effect assessment and ecological optimizing (referring to a natural reference state) remain basic, additionally the assessment of the ecological minimum helps to define design strategies for integrated flood protection, especially in situations where there is an opportunity for river rehabilitation.

AB  - Many types of indices have been developed to assess benthic invertebrate community condition, but there have been few studies evaluating the relative performance of different index approaches. Here we calibrate and compare the performance of five indices: the Benthic Response Index (BRI), Benthic Quality Index (BQI), Relative Benthic Index (RBI), River Invertebrate Prediction and Classification System (RIVPACS), and the Index of Biotic Integrity (1131). We also examine whether index performance improves when the different indices, which rely on measurement of different properties, are used in combination. The five indices were calibrated for two geographies using 238 samples from southern California marine bays and 125 samples from polyhaline San Francisco Bay. Index performance was evaluated by comparing index assessments of 35 sites to the best professional judgment of nine benthic experts. None of the individual indices performed as well as the average expert in ranking sample condition or evaluating whether benthic assemblages exhibited evidence of disturbance. However, several index combinations outperformed the average expert. When results from both habitats were combined, two four-index combinations and a three-index combination performed best. However, performance differences among several combinations were small enough that factors such as logistics can also become a consideration in index selection. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Forty-nine states are developing phosphorus (P) site indices to assess vulnerability of agricultural fields to P loss. When a P index has multiple variables and mathematical operations, it is often difficult to predict the sensitivity of the final site rating to individual input variables. Sensitivity analysis is a powerful diagnostic technique for assessing the behavior of a P index, prioritizing data collection and research efforts to improve its predictive capabilities, and for focusing management efforts. In this study, nominal range sensitivity analysis was used to determine the effect of input factor perturbations on the final P index score for agricultural biosolids recycling. Baseline conditions (P index score = 116) for the sensitivity analysis were established from a detailed evaluation of representative Pennsylvania sites targeted for biosolids application in 2003. The base condition was evaluated for Sensitivity Coefficient and Swing to identify the importance of individual input factors on final P index rating. For biosolids sites, P loss vulnerability forecast by the Pennsylvania P index was found to be relatively insensitive to subsurface drainage and mineral fertilizer application rate and method (with Swing values of 23, 18, and 4 respectively). Accordingly, uncertainty in these Low Impact P index variables will have little adverse effect on the reliability of index scores for biosolids land application. For sites receiving biosolids, the Pennsylvania P index is most sensitive to the biosotids application rate and method, organic P source coefficient, and nature of the site buffer strip. Remarkably, varying the P source coefficient (alone) over its full range of plausible input values resulted in a P index rating Swing of 167 points. Thus, beyond changing biosolids application rates and methods, the greatest potential to reduce the P index score is in establishing riparian buffer zones and reducing biosotids P source coefficients. It is important to note that the differential sensitivities of fertilizer P source rate and organic P source rate in the Pennsylvania index do not imply that organic P sources are inherently more susceptible to offsite P export than chemical fertilizers. Research efforts should focus on High-impact factors for improving the predictive capability of the P index.

AB  - Drought is a major abiotic stress limiting rice production and yield stability in rainfed ecosystems. Identifying quantitative trait loci (QTL) for rice yield and yield components under water limited environments will help to develop drought resilient cultivars using marker assisted breeding (MAB) strategy. A total of 232 recombinant inbred lines of IR62266/Norungan were used to map QTLs for plant phenology and production traits under rainfed condition in target population of environments. A total of 79 QTLs for plant phenology and production traits with phenotypic variation ranging from 4.4 to 72.8% were detected under non-stress and drought stress conditions across two locations. Consistent QTLs for phenology and production traits were detected across experiments and water regimes. The QTL region, RM204-RM197-RM217 on chromosome 6 was linked to days to 50% flowering and grain yield per plant under both rainfed and irrigated conditions. The same genomic region, RM585-RM204-RM197 was also linked to harvest index under rainfed condition with positive alleles from Norungan, a local landrace. QTLs for plant production and drought resistance traits co-located near RM585-RM204-RM197-RM217 region on chromosome 6 in several rice genotypes. Thus with further fine mapping, this region may be useful as a candidate QTL for MAB, map-based cloning of genes and functional genomics studies for rainfed rice improvement.

AB  - Wide-ranging, indicator-based assessments of large, complex ecosystems are playing an increasing role in guiding environmental policy and management. An example is the Eli's Marine Strategy Framework Directive, which requires Member States to take measures to reach "good environmental status" (GES) in European marine waters. However, formulation of indicator targets consistent with the Directive's high-level policy goal of sustainable use has proven challenging. We develop a specific, quantitative interpretation of the concepts of GES and sustainable use in terms of indicators and associated targets, by sharply distinguishing between current uses to satisfy current societal needs and preferences, and unknown future uses. We argue that consistent targets to safeguard future uses derive from a requirement that any environmental state indicator should recover within a defined time (e.g. 30 years) to its pressure-free range of variation when all pressures are hypothetically removed. Within these constraints, specific targets for current uses should be set. Routes to implementation of this proposal for indicators of fish-community size structure, population size of selected species, eutrophication, impacts of non-indigenous species, and genetic diversity are discussed. Important policy implications are that (a) indicator target ranges, which may be wider than natural ranges, systematically and rationally derive from our proposal; (b) because relevant state indicators tend to respond slowly, corresponding pressures should also be monitored and assessed; (c) support of current uses and safeguarding of future uses are distinct management goals, they require different types of targets, decision processes, and management philosophies.

AB  - An Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a Machine Learning (ML) modeling approach is proposed to predict the ecological state of the North Lagoon of Tunis, a shallow restored Mediterranean coastal ecosystem. A Nonlinear Auto Regressive with exogenous input (NARX) neural network model was fitted to predict Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations in the North Lagoon of Tunis as an eutrophication indicator. The modeling is based on approximately three decades of monitoring water quality data (from January 1989 to April 2018) to train, validate and test the NARX model. The most relevant predictor variables used in this model were those having a high permutation importance ranking with Random Forest (RF) model, which simplified the structure of the network, resulting in a more accurate and efficient procedure. Those predictor variables are secchi depth, and dissolved oxygen. Various model scenarios with different NARX architectures were tested for Chl-a prediction. To verify the model performances, the trained models were applied to field monitoring data. Results indicated that the developed NARX model can predict Chl-a concentrations in the North Lagoon of Tunis with high accuracy (R = 0.79; MSE = 0.31). In addition, results showed that the NARX model generally performed better than multivariate linear regression (MVLR). This approach could provide a quick assessment of Chl-a variations for lagoon management and eco-restoration.

AB  - Biomonitoring programs for persistent, bioaccumulative, and/or toxic chemicals of concern in fish tissues have been operated by the governments of Canada and the United States in the Great Lakes since the 1970's. The objectives of these programs are to assess concentrations of harmful chemicals in whole body top predator fish as an indicator of ecosystem health and to infer potential harm to fish and fish consuming wildlife in the Great Lakes Basin. Chemicals of interest are selected based upon national and binational commitments, risk assessment, and regulation, and include a wide range of compounds. This review summarizes all available data generated by Environment Canada and the United States Environmental Protection Agency for chemicals measured in whole body homogenates of Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush) and Walleye (Sander vitreus) for the time period spanning 2008 to 2012 from each of the five Great Lakes. The summary shows that concentrations of legacy compounds, such as, POPs listed in the Stockholm Convention and mercury continue to dominate the chemical burden of Great Lakes fish. This assessment, and others like it, can guide the creation of environmental quality targets where they are lacking, optimize chemical lists for monitoring, and prioritize chemicals of concern under agreements such as the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement and the Stockholm Convention.

AB  - The EU Water Framework Directive includes phytoplankton as one of the four biological elements to be used in the assessment of the ecological status of surface waters. In this work we establish the ecological status of four shallow lakes in the Polesie Region of Eastern Poland on the basis of phytoplankton and physicochemical data from the lake water. A number of recently developed phytoplankton indices, including the Carlson Index, Q index and German PSI were compared. Cyanoprokaryota, chlorophytes and dinophytes dominated in Lakes Glebokie and Sumin, while in the Lakes Rotcze and Masluchowskie the biggest share belonged to Chlorophyta. On the basis of the Carlson Index, Lake Glebokie had the highest trophic score, while the lowest score was for Lake Rotcze. A similar result was also found with the Q index which indicated a good ecological state for Lake Rotcze (Q = 3.5), a bad state for Lake Glebokie (Q = 0.9), a poor status for Lake Sumin (Q = 1.2) and a moderate status for Lake Masluchowskie (Q = 2.9). Similar results were obtained with the use of the German PSI which classified Lake Glebokie as bad status (PSI = 4.7) and Lake Rotcze as good (PSI = 2), although differences between the 2 indices appeared between the moderate and poor status lakes (respectively in the case of Lake Sumin - PSI = 2.6 and Lake Masluchowskie - PSI = 4.4).

AB  - Our approach to blind image quality assessment (IQA) is based on the hypothesis that natural scenes possess certain statistical properties which are altered in the presence of distortion, rendering them un-natural; and that by characterizing this un-naturalness using scene statistics, one can identify the distortion afflicting the image and perform no-reference (NR) IQA. Based on this theory, we propose an (NR)/blind algorithm-the Distortion Identification-based Image Verity and INtegrity Evaluation (DIIVINE) index-that assesses the quality of a distorted image without need for a reference image. DIIVINE is based on a 2-stage framework involving distortion identification followed by distortion-specific quality assessment. DIIVINE is capable of assessing the quality of a distorted image across multiple distortion categories, as against most NR IQA algorithms that are distortion-specific in nature. DIIVINE is based on natural scene statistics which govern the behavior of natural images. In this paper, we detail the principles underlying DIIVINE, the statistical features extracted and their relevance to perception and thoroughly evaluate the algorithm on the popular LIVE IQA database. Further, we compare the performance of DIIVINE against leading full-reference (FR) IQA algorithms and demonstrate that DIIVINE is statistically superior to the often used measure of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and statistically equivalent to the popular structural similarity index (SSIM). A software release of DIIVINE has been made available online: http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/quality/DIIVINE_release.zip for public use and evaluation.

AB  - Like most streams located in the Ozark Plateaus, the Buffalo River in Arkansas generally has excellent water quality. Water-quality conditions in Big Creek, however, a major tributary of the middle Buffalo River, have been less favorable than that of other Buffalo River tributaries. Concerns regarding the influence of water quality in Big Creek on the Buffalo River magnified in 2013 when a large confined animal feeding operation (CAFO) began operating in the watershed. In response to these concerns, the U.S. Geological Survey compared monthly nutrient concentrations and seasonal periphyton assemblage metrics of a site on Big Creek downstream of the CAFO, two Buffalo River control sites upstream of the confluence with Big Creek, and three Buffalo River test sites downstream of the confluence with Big Creek. In addition to identifying potential nutrient patterns and periphyton responses along a low-level nutrient exposure gradient, the study determined how nutrient contributions from Big Creek (and the CAFO) are affecting ecological conditions and consequent ecosystem services in the Buffalo River. Nutrient and periphyton data exhibited more temporal than spatial variability. Nutrient concentrations were generally highest of all sites at the Big Creek site. Concentrations at the five sites on the Buffalo River were typically low (near laboratory reporting limits), and concentrations at the three test sites rarely exceeded those of the two control sites. An index developed with three ecologically relevant periphyton metrics (oligotrophic taxa and Homoeothrix percent relative abundance and mesotrophic diatoms percent taxa richness) suggested that nutrient uptake at sites downstream of the Big Creek-Buffalo River confluence resulted in subtle shifts in downstream periphyton assemblages. The periphyton index of biological integrity at control sites was slightly and generally more favorable compared to test sites. Even so, when periphyton data were considered in conjunction with both hydrology and water-quality data, the negative consequences of antecedent high flows and associated scouring exceeded the potential positive effects that low-level nutrients had on algal productivity. These findings emphasize the importance of comparing biological and chemical data across extended temporal scales, particularly when working with low-level nutrient gradients.

AB  - Investigation of past tropical cyclone (TC) activity in the Western North Pacific (WNP) is potentially helpful to enable better understanding of future TC behaviors. In this study, we examine variations in large-scale environmental factors important to TC genesis in the last millennium simulations from the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (PMIP3). The results show that potential intensity, a theoretical prediction of the maximum TC intensity, is increased relative to the last millennium in the north part of the WNP in the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; 950-1200 AD) while it is decreased in the Little Ice Age (LIA; 1600-1850 AD). Vertical wind shear that generally inhibits TC genesis is enhanced (reduced) to the south of 20A degrees N and is reduced (enhanced) to the north in the MCA (LIA). Relative humidity (at 600 hPa) that measures the mid-tropospheric moisture content broadly shows an increase (decrease) in the MCA (LIA). A genesis potential index indicates that conditions are generally favorable (unfavorable) for TC formation in the WNP in the MCA (LIA), especially in the northern part. Taking changes in steering flows into account, there may be an increasing (decreasing) favorability for storm strikes in East Asia in the MCA (LIA). The estimated TC activity is consistent with the geological proxies in Japan, but contradicts with the typhoon records in southern China and Taiwan. This model-data discrepancy is attributed to the limitations in both simulations and reconstructions.

AB  - Probability-based survey designs are now being investigated to allow condition to be assessed for a discrete population of watershed management units and to infer probability of impairment to other unsampled watersheds. Results can be used to focus further monitoring and restoration efforts. Fish community data and index of biotic integrity (IBI) development were compared between the 1993 and 1998 Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program Mid-Atlantic Integrated Assessment (EMAP-MAIA) survey and a West Virginia Regional EMAP (WV REMAP) survey conducted in 2001-2002. Both designs were based on probability surveys, but the EMAP design treated streams as a continuous linear network comprising an infinite population of points, while the REMAP design used a discrete set of watershed outlets as defined by 12-digit Hydrologic Cataloging Units (HUC12) as the sample population. The comparability of the watershed-based WV REMAP survey design results with the linear network-based EMAP-MAIA survey results for West Virginia was affected by the different size range of watershed areas included in each target population. Once similar watershed area ranges were considered by narrowing the size range included in the West Virginia EMAP-MAIA data set, virtually identical cumulative distribution functions for fish IBI scores were obtained. The reduced variability in reference conditions obtained by applying a restricted range of watershed areas allowed us to detect and correct for ecoregional differences in fish IBI metrics and scores, after excluding the biogeographically distinct Potomac River drainage basin located in the Central Appalachian Ridge and Valley Ecoregion.

AB  - The benthic fluxes of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), chromophoric and fluorescent dissolved organic matter (CDOM and FDOM) were studied for the sediment from an artificial lake, based on laboratory benthic chamber experiments. Conservative estimates for the benthic flux of DOG were 71 +/- 142 and 51 +/- 101 mg m(-2) day(-1) at hypoxic and oxic conditions, respectively. Two humic-like (Cl and C2), one tryptophan-like (C3), and one microbial humic-like (C4) components were identified from the samples using fluorescence excitation emission matrices and parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC). During the incubation period, C3 was removed while C4 was accumulated in the overlying water with no significant difference in the trends between the redox conditions. The humification index (HIX) increased with time. The combined results for C3, C4 and HIX suggested that microbial transformation may be an important process affecting the flux behaviors of DOM. In contrast, the overall accumulations of CDOM, C1, and C2 in the overlying water occurred only for the hypoxic condition, which was possibly explained by their enhanced photodegradation and sorption to redox-sensitive minerals under the oxic condition. Our study demonstrated significant benthic flux of DOM in lake sediment and also the possible involvement of biogeochemical transformation in the processes, providing insight into carbon cycling in inland waters.

AB  - We present a parametric model for estimating the areas within watersheds whose land use best predicts indicators of stream ecological condition. We regress a stream response variable on the distance-weighted proportion of watershed area that has a specific land use, such as agriculture. Distance weighting functions model the declining influence of landscape elements as a function of their flowpath distances, first to the stream channel (to-stream distance), and then down the channel to the location at which stream condition was sampled (in-stream distance). Model parameters specify different distance scales over which to-stream and in-stream influences decline. As an example, we predict an index of biotic integrity (IBI) for the fish communities in 50 small streams of the Willamette Basin of Oregon, USA, from distance-weighted proportions of agricultural or urban land use in their watersheds. The weighting functions of best-fitting models (R-2 = 0.57) represent landscape influence on IBI as extending upstream tens of kilometers along the stream channel network, while declining nearly to zero beyond a distance of 30 m from the channel. Our example shows how parametric distance weighting can identify the distance scales, and hence the approximate areas within watersheds, for which land use is most strongly associated with a stream response variable. In addition, distance-weighting parameters offer a simple and direct language for comparing the scales of landscape influence on streams across different land uses and stream ecosystem components.

AB  - Links between positive affect (PA) and health have predominantly been investigated by using measures of recollected emotional states. Ecological momentary assessment is regarded as a more precise measure of experienced well-being. We analyzed data from the English Longitudinal Study of Aging, a representative cohort of older men and women living in England. PA was assessed by aggregating momentary assessments over a single day in 3,853 individuals aged 52 to 79 y who were followed up for an average of 5 y. Respondents in the lowest third of PA had a death rate of 7.3%, compared with 4.6% in the medium-PA group and 3.6% in the high-PA group. Cox proportional-hazards regression showed a hazard ratio of 0.498 (95% confidence interval, 0.345-0.721) in the high-PA compared with the low-PA group, adjusted for age and sex. This was attenuated to 0.646 (95% confidence interval, 0.436-0.958) after controlling for demographic factors, negative affect, depressed mood, health indicators, and health behaviors. Negative affect and depressed mood were not related to survival after adjustment for covariates. These findings indicate that experienced PA, even over a single day, has a graded relationship with survival that is not caused by baseline health status or other covariates. Momentary PA may be causally related to survival, or may be a marker of underlying biological, behavioral, or temperamental factors, although reverse causality cannot be conclusively ruled out. The results endorse the value of assessing experienced affect, and the importance of evaluating interventions that promote happiness in older populations.

AB  - Analyses for the presence of indicator organisms provide information on the microbiological quality of water. Indicator organisms recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for monitoring the microbiological quality of water include Escherichia coli, a thermotolerant coliform found in the feces of warm-blooded animals. These bacteria can also be isolated from environmental sources such as the recreational and pristine waters of tropical rain forests in the absence of fecal contamination. In the present study, E. coli isolates were compared to E. coli K12 (ATCC 29425) by restriction fragment length polymorphism using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Theoretically, genomic DNA patterns generated by PFGE are highly specific for the different isolates of an organism and can be used to identify variability between environmental and fecal isolates. Our results indicate a different band pattern for almost every one of the E. coli isolates analyzed. Cluster analysis did not show any relations between isolates and their source of origin. Only the discriminant function analysis grouped the samples with the source of origin. The discrepancy observed between the cluster analysis and discriminant function analysis relies on their mathematical basis. Our validation analyses indicate the presence of an artifact (i.e., grouping of environmental versus fecal samples as a product of the statistical analyses used and not as a result of separation in terms of source of origin) in the classification results; therefore, the large genetic heterogeneity observed in these E. coli populations makes the grouping of isolates by source rather difficult, if not impossible.

AB  - Coking is one of the most important emission sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in China. Investigation of the contamination, distribution, and sources of PAHs in agricultural soils around Rong Xin coking plant, China, was conducted, and the potential human health risks were addressed. The total concentration of the 16 PAHs (Sigma(16)PAHs) on the United States Environmental Protection Agency priority list had a range from 1774 to 4621 mu g/kg (mean 3016 mu g/kg). Meanwhile, seven carcinogenic PAHs (Sigma PAH(7c)) owned the total concentrations of 684-2105 mu g/kg, and they had the benzo[a]pyrene equivalent (BaPeq) concentrations at 139.616-1672.850 mu g/kg. All soil samples were dominated by PAHs with two to four rings. Data analyses for the potential sources of PAHs showed that the PAHs in soils were principally from pyrogenic sources. Ecological risk assessment of soil PAHs showed that the BaPeq concentrations of Sigma PAH(7c) accounted for 99% of the total Sigma(16)PAHs, being a major carcinogenic contributors of Sigma(16)PAHs. Higher levels of PAHs and higher total BaPeq concentrations in this study indicate a potential carcinogenic risk for humans. Therefore, long-term exposure to coking plants may increase the PAH concentrations in the environment and further raise a potential risk to human health.

AB  - This study assesses for the first time the relationship between annual cycles of different biological indices with growth patterns of a marine pejerrey Odontesthes argentinensis population near its southern-distribution boundary in North Patagonia. The reproductive period is between September and November evidenced by an increase in the gonado-somatic index with a peak in October corresponding to spawning. The reproductive cycle was also coupled with metabolic processes related to energy allocation as shown by changes in the hepato-somatic index and body condition. Total length (LT) at maturity was 270 for females and 282 mm for males, whereas fecundity was estimated at mean +/- s.d. = 9380 +/- 1797 mature oocytes. Based on the marginal increment analysis, most of the scales showed a maximum value during summer, with a sharp decline thereafter during autumn and winter, indicating that scale rings are formed during the latter period and only once a year. Growth fitted by the von Bertalanffy model for both males and females did not show significant differences and showed a rapid growth during the first 2 years. The shorter reproductive period compared with that of the northern O. argentinensis populations inhabiting tropical and subtropical areas was interpreted as an adjustment to temperate environmental conditions. The larger maximum LT and LT at first maturity are in agreement with the counter-gradient hypothesis and could be related to the selective effects of low temperature and a shorter growing season. This latitude dependency argues strongly against the application of the same fishing regulations for different O. argentinensis populations as a whole and reinforces the need to assess basic biological features at a population scale to promote local sustainable fisheries management.

AB  - Varieties and hybrids which are stable in yield and suitable for cultivation in various soil and climatic zones have a particular value within the conditions of industrial production. New varieties created by breeders should be characterized by the highest yield in favorable conditions, and, at the same time, by the stable yield in other conditions, i.e. be highly accommodative. The aim of the research was to assess environmental stability and plasticity parameters of tomato hybrids according to the main characteristics of yield and then to select the hybrids Fl with high productivity and stability in soil greenhouses. The calculation of adaptive ability and ecological stability indexes was carried out according to the method of A. V. Kilchevsky and L. V. Khotyleva using the ADIS program. As a result, some hybrids were identified as heavy yielding and with high general adaptive ability according to the following parameters: early fruit yield - Nikola x Line-2, Line-4 x Line-2, Nikola x Line 19/3, Nikola x Line-9, Line TX-144 x Irishka, Line B-3-1-8 x Line 19/0, Line C-9464 x Line 19/0; on the basis of "commercial fruit yield" - Nikola x Line-2, TX-144 x Line-2, Line TX-144 x Irishka, TX-140 x Line-2, Line TX-140 x Line 19/3, Line B-3-1-8 x Line 19/0, Line C-9464 x Line 19/0; by the weight of commercial fruit - Nikola x Line 19/3, Line TX-144 x Line 19/3, Line B-3-1-8 x Line 19/0. Greater part of yield parameters was stable for hybrids Nikola x Line-2, Line-4 x Line-2, TX-140 x Line-2, Line B-3-1-8 x Line 19/0, Line TX-144 x Irishka. Hybrids combinations Azart and Vityaz have successfully passed the test and were recommended for planting on the territory of the Republic of Be-tarns. Thus, feasibility of ecological stability and plasticity assessment at the final stage of breeding process has been proven. It reduces possibility of errors in choosing hybrids for State testing procedures.

AB  - In the United States, there is an absence of federal guidance related to deriving and applying background concentrations at contaminated sediment sites. This absence has resulted in significant variability, uncertainty, and disagreement regarding how representative background concentrations of chemicals of concern should be derived for these sites. The present article discusses important considerations in the derivation of representative background concentrations to be used in the evaluation of contaminated sediment sites. Specifically, a thorough understanding of a site is critical to selecting the background reference areas from which representative background concentrations can be derived, representative background concentrations should account for contributions from those background chemical inputs (natural and anthropogenic sources) that will continue affecting the site even after remediation, perceived outliers should not be eliminated from the background data set just because they are the highest or lowest values, and geochemical evaluation of trace metals is a useful tool for deriving representative background concentrations. On a site-specific level, representative background concentrations are critical for putting site-related risk into context, developing a cost-effective and technically feasible remedial approach, understanding the potential for recontamination, and ensuring long-term remedy success. In a broader context, clear guidance from the United State Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) for deriving and applying background concentrations for contaminated sediment sites would help promote national consistency in site assessment and remedy decision making.

AB  - The egg, three larval instars and pupa of Acylophorus wagenschieberi Kiesenwetter are described for the first time, with the illustrations of structural features provided. Adult habitus and figures for penis are given. Differences in the morphological structure of its larval instars (L1-3) cover: the number and structure of setae on protibia, the number of setae on tarsungulus, the number of setae on pygopod, the structure of urogomphi, the body color and the measurements of size. Diagnostic characters of immature stages are listed. Modifications of the keys to known eggs, larvae and pupae of the European Staphylininae species are proposed. Some data on its distribution, environmental requirements and biology with the schema of life cycle in the field are also provided. It is stenotopic and one of the rarest-occurring Staphylininae species in its whole distribution range, in Poland known from 13 localities (11 recorded by the author). It occurs exclusively on high- and transitional moors, preferring the ecotone zones between water bodies and the surrounding peatbogs. One of the main factors limiting its occurrences and abundance is the high and stable water level. A. wagenschieberi is a monovoltine species with the summer larvae and wintering imago. Considering its environmental preferences and biology this rove beetle may be of essential importance as a good environmental state indicator. Trimorus fulvimanus Kiefer (Scelionidae, Proctotrupoidea, Hymenoptera) has been recorded as an egg parasite of A. wagenschieberi. (C) 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

AB  - Savannas are among the most productive biomes of Africa, where they comprise half of its surface. They support wildlife, livestock, rangelands, crops, and livelihoods, playing an important socioeconomic role in rural areas. These water-limited ecosystems with seasonal water availability are highly sensitive to changes in both climate conditions, and in land-use/management practices. Although monitoring programs for African savanna water use have been established in certain areas, most of them are largely restricted to point based measurements or coarse scales, and are not fully capable to provide distributed timely information for planning purposes. In this study we develop a mechanism for monitoring the water used by African savanna from fine scale (meters) to watershed scale, integrating the effects of the water stress. Our hypothesis is that the Ecosystem Stress Index (ESI) is a valuable tool to downscale estimates of actual evapotranspiration at coarse scale, to high resolutions. To monitor savanna water fluxes in a semi-continuous way this study integrates two different ET-estimation approaches: K-C-FAO56 model, integrating reflectance-based "crop" coefficients (SPOT 4 & 5 satellites), is used to derive unstressed savanna evapotranspiration (with high spatial resolution), and the two-source surface energy balance model -TSEB, integrating radiometric surface temperature (AATSR satellites) allows the determination of water stress across savannas (ESI, with low spatial resolution). The difference between estimated and observed surface fluxes derived from TSEB (RMSDLE = 53 Wm(-2), RMSDH = 50 Wm(-2), RMSDRn = 60 Wm(-2), RMSDG = 21 Wm(-2)) were of the same magnitude as the uncertainties derived from the flux measurement system, being sufficiently accurate to be employed in a distributed way and on a more regular basis. The approach of ESI to downscale ET proved to be useful, and errors between estimated and observed daily ET (RMSD 0.6 mmday(-1)) were consistent with the results of other studies in savanna ecosystems. The modelling framework proposed provided an accurate representation of the natural landscape heterogeneity and local conditions, with the potential of providing information suitable from local to broader scales.

AB  - Understanding and improving the quality of data generated from low-cost sensors represent a crucial step in using these sensors to fill gaps in air quality measurement and understanding. This paper shows results from a 10-month-long campaign that included side-by-side measurements and comparison between reference instruments approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and low-cost particulate matter sensors in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. At this rural site in the Midwestern United States the instruments typically encountered only low (under 20 mu gm(-3)) concentrations of particulate matter; however, higher concentrations (50-400 mu gm(-3)) were observed on 3 different days during what were likely agricultural burning events. This study focused on methods for understanding and improving data quality for low-cost particulate matter sensors. The data offered insights on how averaging time, choice of reference instrument, and the observation of higher pollutant concentrations can all impact performance indicators (R-2 and root mean square error) for an evaluation. The influence of these factors should be considered when comparing one sensor to another or when determining whether a sensor can produce data that fit a specific need. Though R-2 and root mean square error remain the dominant metrics in sensor evaluations, an alternative approach using a prediction interval may offer more consistency between evaluations and a more direct interpretation of sensor data following an evaluation. Ongoing quality assurance for sensor data is needed to ensure that data continue to meet expectations. Observations of trends in linear regression parameters and sensor bias were used to analyze calibration and other quality assurance techniques.

AB  - Microplastic particles (MPs) contamination of aquatic environments has raised a growing concern in recent decades because of their numerous potential toxicological effects. Although fish are among the most studied aquatic organisms, reports on MPs ingestion in freshwater environments are still scarce. Thus, there is still much to study to understand the uptake mechanisms, their potential accumulation among the food webs and their ecotoxicological effects. Here, MPs presence in the digestive system of one of the most widespread and commercially exploited freshwater fish, the perch (Perca fluviatilis, Linnaeus 1758), was investigated in four different south-alpine lakes, to assess the extent of ingestion and evaluate its relation to the body health condition. A total of 80 perch specimen have been sampled from the Italian lakes Como, Garda, Maggiore and Orta. Microplastic particles occurred in 86% of the analysed specimens, with average values ranging from 1.24 +/- 1.04 MPs fish-1 in L. Como to 5.59 +/- 2.61 MPs fish-1 in L. Garda. The isolated particles were mainly fragments, except in L. Como where films were more abundant. The most common polymers were polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polyamide, and polycarbonate, although a high degree of degradation was found in 43% of synthetic particles, not allowing their recognition up to a single polymer. Despite the high number of ingested MPs, fish health (evaluated by means of Fulton's body condition and hepatosomatic index) was not affected. Instead, fullness index showed an inverse linear relationship with the number of ingested particles, which suggests that also in perch MPs presence could interfere with feeding activity, as already described for other taxa.

AB  - There is limited information about the critical period for weed control (CPWC) in oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus L. var. oleiformis Pers.) This significantly limits the effectiveness of the applied technologies in its cultivation. The article focuses on the results of a long-term study (2013 to 2018) of the peculiarities of weed formation in oilseed radish agrophytocoenosis using different sowing technological models according to seeding rate and row spacing parameters. The study included the peculiarities of the species and generic composition of weeds and the basic attributes of the formation of species-specific amounts. The summed dominance ratio (SDR) was heterogeneous and co-oscillatory in the weed structure for both the formation of the number of individual species and their height dominance, which depended on the phenological stage of growth and crop development. In the general spectrum, the prevailing weed forms were identified with the highest potential for oilseed radish plants with an SDR greater than 1.0, which belong to groups I and VI according to environmental plasticity and stability, given the different conditions of the study period for both hydrothermal conditions and year index. In conclusion, a critical period for weed control (CPWC) in oilseed radish agrocoenosis was defined as a 5% reduction in crops ranging from 5 to 45 d after sprouting (DAS) for row sowing and a seeding rate of 4.0 million similar seeds he and 6 to 60 DAS for a variant of wide row sowing at a seeding rate of 0.5 million similar seeds ha(-1).

AB  - Knowledge of the structure and morphology of common urban trees is scarce, particularly of the full life cycle of a tree. The present and future structural dimensions of urban tree species are of an increasing interest because tree growth is associated with its ecosystem services. The purpose of this study was to characterize the dimensions of two urban tree species (small-leaved lime, Tilia cordata Mill. and black locust, Robinia pseudoacacia L.) and to predict future structural dimensions based on the diameter at breast height and tree age. Regression equations were developed for tree height, crown diameter, crown height, crown volume, crown projection area, and open surface area of the tree pit. The data revealed strong relationships (r(2) > 0.7) between crown diameter, crown volume, crown projection area, crown height, tree pit for both species, and tree height of T. cordata. Based on tree dimensions and the leaf area index (LAI), three ecosystem services (carbon storage, shading, and cooling effects) were estimated for the analyzed trees. The results indicated that urban trees considerably improved the climate in cities, with carbon storage, shading, and cooling of single trees showing a direct relationship with LAI and age. The associations of tree growth patterns identified in this study can be used as guidelines for tree planting in cities and their ecosystem services; they may improve the management and planning of urban green areas.

AB  - The Clean Water Act presents a daunting task for states by requiring them to assess and restore all their waters. Traditional monitoring has led to two beliefs: (1) ad hoc sampling (i.e., non-random) is adequate if enough sites are sampled and (2) more intensive sampling (e. g., collecting more organisms) at each site is always better. We analyzed the 1,500 Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) random sites sampled in 2000-2004 to describe the variability of Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) scores at the site, reach, and watershed scales. Average variability for fish and benthic IBI scores increased with increasing spatial scale, demonstrating that single site IBI scores are not representative at watershed scales and therefore at best 25% of a state's stream length can be representatively sampled with non-random designs. We evaluated the effects on total taxa captured and IBI precision of sampling for twice as many benthic macroinvertebrates at 73 MBSS sites with replicate samples. When sampling costs were fixed, the precision of the IBI decreased as the number of sites had to be reduced by 15%. Only 1% more taxa were found overall when the 73 sites where combined. We concluded that (1) comprehensive assessment of a state's waters should be done using probability-based sampling that allows the condition across all reaches to be inferred statistically and (2) additional site sampling effort should not be incorporated into state biomonitoring when it will reduce the number of sites sampled to the point where overall assessment precision is lower.

AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is a direct indicator used to evaluate the ecological state of a waterbody, such as algal blooms that degrade the water quality in lakes, reservoirs and estuaries. In this study, artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) were used to predict Chl-a concentration for the early warning in the Juam Reservoir and Yeongsan Reservoir, which are located in an upstream region (freshwater reservoir) and downstream region (estuarine reservoir), respectively. Weekly water quality data and meteorological data for a 7-year period were used to train and validate both the ANN and SVM models. The Latin-hypercube onefactor-at-a-time (LH-OAT) method and a pattern search algorithm were applied to perform sensitivity analyses for the input variables and to optimize the parameters of the two models, respectively. Results revealed that the two models well-reproduced the temporal variation of Chl-a based on the weekly input variables. In particular, the SVM model showed better performance than the ANN model, displaying a higher prediction accuracy in the validation step. The Williams-Kloot test and sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the SVM model was superior for predicting Chl-a in terms of prediction accuracy and description of the cause-and-effect relationship between Oil-a concentration and environmental variables in both the Juam Reservoir and Yeongsan Reservoir. Furthermore, a 7-day interval was determined as an efficient early warning interval in the two reservoirs. As such, this study suggested an effective early-warning prediction method for Chl-a concentration and improved the eutrophication management scheme for reservoirs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A total of 72 groundwater samples were collected from open wells and boreholes during pre- and post-monsoon periods in Tuticorin. Samples were analyzed for physicochemical properties, major cations, and anions in the laboratory using the standard methods given by the American Public Health Association. The fluoride concentration was analyzed in the laboratory using Metrohm 861 advanced compact ion chromatography. The geographic information system-based spatial distribution map of different major elements has been prepared using ArcGIS 9.3. The fluoride concentration ranges between 0.16 mg/l and 4.8 mg/l during pre-monsoon and 0.2-3.2 mg/l during post-monsoon. Alkaline pH, low calcium concentrations, high groundwater temperatures, and semiarid climatic conditions of the study area may cause elevated fluoride concentrations in groundwater, by increasing the solubility of fluoride-bearing formations (fluoride). Linear trend analysis on seasonal and annual basis clearly depicted that fluoride pollution in the study area is increasing significantly. Fluoride concentrations showed positive correlations with those of Na+ and HCO3- and negative correlations with Ca2+ and Mg2+. The alkaline waters were saturated with calcite in spite of the low Ca2+ concentrations. Northwestern parts of the study area are inherently enriched with fluorides threatening several ecosystems. The saturation index indicates that dissolution and precipitation contribute fluoride dissolution along with mixing apart from anthropogenic activities.

AB  - Observations from the US Environmental Protection Agency's Episodic Response Project (ERP) in the Northeastern United States are used to develop an empirical/mechanistic scheme for prediction of the minimum values of acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) during episodes. An acidification episode is defined as a hydrological event during which ANC decreases. The pre-episode ANC is used to index the antecedent condition, and the stream flow increase reflects how much the relative contributions of sources of waters change during the episode. As much as 92% of the total variation in the minimum ANC in individual catchments can be explained (with levels of explanation >70% far nine of the 13 streams) by a multiple linear regression model that includes pre-episode ANC and change in discharge as independent variables. The predictive scheme is demonstrated to be regionally robust, with the regional variance explained ranging from 77 to 83%. The scheme is not successful for each ERP stream, and reasons are suggested for the individual failures. The potential for applying the predictive scheme to other watersheds is demonstrated by testing the model with data from the Panola Mountain Research Watershed in the South-eastern United States, where the variance explained by the model was 74%. The model can also be utilized to assess 'chemically new' and 'chemically old' water sources during acidification episodes. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Per and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been recognized as contaminants of emerging concerns by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) due to their environmental impact. Several advisory guidelines were proposed worldwide aimed at limiting their occurrences in the aquatic environments, especially for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). This review paper aims to provide a holistic review in the emerging area of PFAS research by summarizing the spatiotemporal variations in PFAS concentrations in surface water systems globally, highlighting the possible trends of occurrences of PFAS, and presenting potential human health impacts as a result of PFAS exposure through surface water matrices. From the data analysis in this study, occurrences of PFOA and PFOS in many surface water matrices were observed to be several folds higher than the US EPA health advisory level of 70 ng/L for lifetime exposure from drinking water. Direct discharge and atmospheric deposition were identified as primary sources of PFAS in surface water and cryosphere, respectively. While global efforts focused on limiting usages of long-chain PFAS such as PFOS and PFOA, the practices of using short-chain PFAS such as perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) and PFAS alternatives increased substantially. These compounds are also potentially associated with adverse impacts on human health, animals and biota.

AB  - Large-scale, mass-balance trophic models have been developed for northern and southern regions of both the Benguela and Humboldt upwelling ecosystems. Four of these Ecopath models were compared and calibrated against one another. A common model structure was established, and a common basis was used to derive poorly known parameter values. The four resulting models represent ecosystems in which the main commercial fish species have been moderately to heavily fished: central-southern Chile (1992), northern-central Peru (1973-1981), South Africa (1980-1989), and Namibia (1995-2000). Quantitative ecosystem indicators derived from these models were compared. Indicators based on large flows (involving low trophic levels) or top predators were not well estimated, because of aggregation problems. Many of the indicators could be contrasted on the basis of differences between the Benguela and Humboldt systems, rather than on the basis of fishing impact. These include integrated values relating to total catches, and trophic levels of key species groups. Indicators based on integrated biomass, total production, and total consumption tended to capture differences between the model for Namibia (where fish populations were severely reduced) and the other models. We conclude that a suite of indicators is required to represent ecosystem state, and that interpretation requires relatively detailed understanding of the different ecosystems.

AB  - Recent studies from India reported polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) associated with incomplete combustion processes. In this study we have monitored atmospheric PCBs in Agra, a non-metropolitan city of northern India. During first month of summer and winter of 2017, polyurethane foam based passive air sampler (PUF-PAS) was deployed at each of 14 locations across urban, suburban and rural transects and one background site. Range of Sigma(25)PCBs varied between 25 and 1433 pg/m(3) (Avg +/- Stdev: 460 +/- 461) in summer and 26-205 pg/m(3) (Avg +/- Stdev: 106 +/- 59) in winter. Mean Sigma(25)PCBs concentration, showed an urban > suburban > rural trend in summer while, in winter a rural > urban > suburban trend was observed. PCB-52 was the dominant congener and after excluding this congener no significant difference was observed between summer and winter PCB concentrations. Using a combination of K-means cluster and principal component analysis (PCA) four major source types were identified. Open burning source accorded 80% of atmospheric PCBs, majorly indicator PCBs while the remaining 20% was contributed by atmospheric transport, petrogenic combustion and biomass burning. From the ten days back trajectory of the air mass it can be suggested that atmospheric transport from the hotspots resulted in a minor percentage of dioxin like PCBs in Agra. Maximum TEQs was accorded by PCB-77 (30%) and it is consistent with previous observations from Agra. Levels observed in the current study are well within the public health guideline based on inhalation unit risk (10 ng/m(3)) and United States Environmental Protection Agency's regional screening level high risk tier (4.9 ng/m(3)) for ambient air.

   The aim of the study was to assess the degree of heavy metal pollution in bottom sediments of lakes on the basis of geochemical and ecotoxicological indicators.
   Material and methods
   The analysis was conducted for 16 lakes located in the Gniezno Lakeland in central-western Poland. The studied lakes were included in the research program obtained from the Inspector of Environmental Protection within the framework of the State Environmental Monitoring. The Contamination Factor (CF), Pollution Load Index (PLI) and Metal Pollution Index (MPI) were calculated to assess the level of sediment contamination. Assessment of the potential toxic effects of heavy metals accumulated in bottom sediments were made on the basis of TEC, MEC and PEC values. Cluster analysis (CA) was used to show similarities between lakes in terms of heavy metal concentration in bottom sediments. To identify factors affecting metal content in bottom sediments and potential sources of pollution, the PCA analysis was applied.
   Results and conclusions
   The analyses showed a large variation of heavy metals concentration in bottom sediments. The bottom sediments of lakes were polluted mostly with lead. High concentrations of lead in individual lakes may cause harm to living organisms. The lowest concentrations of heavy metals were found in the bottom sediments of Kamienieckie Lake and the highest in Ostrowieckie Lake. Cluster analysis allowed to divide the lakes into two groups with similar concentration of heavy metal in bottom sediments. The studies did not allow to clearly expose the factors responsible for determining the heavy metal content in bottom sediments of lakes.

AB  - Risk assessments and risk management efforts to protect human health and the environment can benefit from early, coordinated research planning by researchers, risk assessors, and risk managers. However, approaches for engaging these and other stakeholders in research planning have not received much attention in the environmental scientific literature. The Comprehensive Environmental Assessment (CEA) approach under development by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is a means to manage complex information and input from diverse stakeholder perspectives on research planning that will ultimately support environmental and human health decision making. The objectives of this article are to 1) describe the outcomes of applying lessons learned from previous CEA applications to planning research on engineered nanomaterial, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and 2) discuss new insights and refinements for future efforts to engage stakeholders in research planning for risk assessment and risk management of environmental issues. Although framed in terms of MWCNTs, this discussion is intended to enhance research planning to support assessments for other environmental issues as well. Key insights for research planning include the potential benefits of 1) ensuring that participants have research, risk assessment, and risk management expertise in addition to diverse disciplinary backgrounds; 2) including an early scoping step before rounds of formal ratings; 3) using a familiar numeric scale (e. g., US dollars) versus ordinal rating scales of "importance"; 4) applying virtual communication tools to supplement face-to-face interaction between participants; and 5) refining criteria to guide development of specific, actionable research questions.

AB  - Managing the efficient use of land is a key aspect, especially for a sustainable biomass-based economy. Due to the complexity in accounting all inputs for biomass production, land use efficiency analysis is usually performed without completeness, for instance, considering only fossil fuels. The objective of this paper is to introduce a new indicator, called Overall Net Annual Exergy Production (Delta EP), which considers the total biomass production from a land, the cumulative consumption of non-local resources (e.g. fossil fuels), and the natural primary biotic resource production that is deprived due to the land use, through exergy (which is the amount of useful work that can be obtained from a resource). We applied this indicator to seven agricultural case studies, composed by one or more crops, and located at different areas of the World. The case study composed by potato and wheat was the only one to generate negative Delta EP (-27.4 GJ(ex)/ha year), while the case studies that were composed by at least one C4 plant (maize or sugarcane) in the rotation or permanent crops (palm fruit) produced positive Delta EP. The latter had the highest Delta EP (+329.7 GJ(ex)/ha year). This indicator was able to give a more holistic overview of the natural resource balance of biomass production systems in comparison to the indicators commonly used in literature (e.g., net energy value), contrasting with the land's natural state, through a simple equation, and making use of data already available in literature.

AB  - In semi-arid Mediterranean areas, studies of the performance of conservation tillage systems have largely demonstrated advantages in crop yield, soil water storage and soil protection against wind and water erosion. However, little attention has been given to interactions between soil biochemical properties under different tillage practices. Biochemical properties are useful tools to assess changes caused by different soil tillage systems in long-term field experiments. This study deals with the effect of long-term tillage practices (reduced tillage and no-tillage vs. traditional tillage) on soil chemical properties and microbial functions in three different sites of Spain (two of them located in the Northeast and one in the Southwest) under semi-arid Mediterranean conditions. Soil biological status, as index of soil quality, was evaluated by measuring microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and dehydrogenase (an oxidoreductase) and protease (a hydrolase) activities at three soil depths (0-5, 5-10 and 10-25 cm). In the three experimental areas, increases in soil organic matter content, MBC and enzymatic activities were found at the superficial layers of soil under conservation tillage (reduced tillage and no-tillage) in comparison with traditional tillage. Values of the stratification ratio of some biochemical properties were significantly correlated with yield production in Northeast sites.
   Conservation tillage has proven to be an effective strategy to improve soil quality and fertility in Mediterranean areas of Spain. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mussels are widely used in toxicological experimentation; however, experimental setups are not standardized yet. Although there is evidence of changes in biomarker values during food digestion and depending on the mussel nutritive status, the mode of feeding differs among toxicological experiments. Typically, mussels are fed with different diets in different long-term experiments, while fasting is the most common approach for short-term studies. Consequently, comparisons among experiments and reliable interpretations of biomarker results are often unfeasible. The present investigation aimed at determining the influence of fasting (against feeding with Isochrysis galbana) on biomarkers and their responsiveness in mussels exposed for 96 h to the water accommodated fraction (WAF) of a heavy fuel oil (0%, 6.25%, 12.5% and 25% WAF in sea water). PAH tissue levels in digestive gland and a battery of biomarkers were compared. WAF exposure led to decrease of cytochrome-C-oxidase activity, modulated glutathione-S-transferase activity, augmented lipid peroxidation, inhibited acetyl cholinesterase (AChE) activity, and led to lysosomal enlargement (Vv(LYS) and S/V-LYS) and membrane destabilisation, lipofuscin accumulation, and histopathological alterations (Vv(BAS), MLR/MET and CTD ratio) in the digestive gland epithelium; and were integrated as IBR/n (biological response index). Overall, no significant changes were recorded in AChE activity, S/V-LYS and CTD ratio in any experimental treatment, while all the other biomarkers showed significant changes depending on the fasting/feeding condition, the exposure to WAF and/or their interaction. As a result, the integrated biomarker index IBR/n was higher at increasing WAF exposure levels both in fasted and fed mussels albeit the response was more marked in the latter. The response profiles were qualitatively similar between fasted and fed mussels but quantitatively more pronounced in fed mussels, especially upon exposure to the highest concentration (25% WAF). Therefore, it is highly recommended that mussels are also supplied with food during short-term, like during long-term toxicological experiments. This practice would avoid the interference of fasting with biological responses elicited by the tested chemicals and allow for reliable comparison with data obtained in long-term experiments and monitoring programmes.

AB  - Metabolic activity (= oxygen consumption), chemical composition (water, ash, carbon [C], hydrogen [H], nitrogen [M]), and caloric content were determined for various developmental stages of the mesopelagic fish Maurolicus muelleri from the Sea of Japan. Oxygen consumption rates were estimated from enzyme activity involved in the respiratory electron transport system (ETS). Body composition varied with development of the fish, ranging from 68.3 to 78.3% of wet weight (WW) for water, 10.7 to 25.7% of dry weight (DW) for ash, 34.1 to 54.4% of DW for C, 5.1 to 8.4% of DW for H, 7.2 to 12.2% of DW for N, and 1.02 to 1.98 Kcal/g WW or 3.51 to 6.33 Kcal/g DW for caloric content. Condition factor index (CFI) ranged from 5.2 to 9.5 (mg WW x 10(3)/(mm TL)(3)). Caloric content, C, H, and CFI increased with development, but the reverse was the case for water, ash, and N. Age-to-age and lifetime energy budgets were established, i.e. metabolic data from ETS assay and caloric data from body composition analyses, combined with natural growth data. The results indicated that higher age-specific net growth efficiency was associated with younger ages, decreasing toward the end of life, with a lifetime average of 17%. Estimated age-specific daily ration followed the same pattern, with a lifetime average of 2.9%/day. From the gonad index and caloric contents of gonads, energy invested in reproduction was calculated as 1.3% of the lifetime sum of assimilated energy for females and as 0.6% for males. Because the number of iterative spawnings during the lifetime of M. muelleri is unknown, this energy partition to reproduction is a conservative estimate. From the comparison of the present results with those for other mesopelagic fishes off southern California, it is suggested that M. muelleri is a more efficient mediator of energy flow and matter cycling in the pelagic ecosystem because of its smaller size and shorter life span.

AB  - Animal welfare assessment can't be irrespective of measures taken on animals. Indeed, housing parameters related to structures, design and micro-environment, even if reliable and easier to take, can only identify conditions which could be detrimental to animal welfare, but can't predict poor welfare in animals per se. Welfare assessment through animal-based measures is almost complex, given that animals' responses to stressful conditions largely depend on the nature, length and intensity of challenges and on physiological status, age, genetic susceptibility and previous experience of animals. Welfare assessment requires a multi-disciplinary approach and the monitoring of productive, ethological, endocrine, immunological and pathological parameters to be exhaustive and reliable. So many measures are needed, because stresses can act only on some of the mentioned parameters or on all of them but at different times and degree. Under this point of view, the main aim of research is to find feasible and most responsive indicators of poor animal welfare. In last decades, studies focused on the following parameters for animal welfare assessment: indexes of biological efficiency, responses to behavioral tests, cortisol secretion, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte proliferation, production of antigen specific IgG and cytokine release, somatic cell count and acute phase proteins. Recently, a lot of studies have been addressed to reduce handling and constraint of animals for taking measures to be used in welfare assessment, since such procedures can induce stress in animals and undermined the reliability of measures taken for welfare assessment. Range of animal-based measures for welfare assessment is much wider under experimental condition than at on-farm level. In welfare monitoring on-farm the main aim is to find feasible measures of proved validity and reliability to be taken on a large number of animals in a reasonable time. Human-animal interaction, body condition score, skin and hair conditions, lameness and injuries, cleanliness, and abnormal behaviors are regarded as the most reliable animal-based indicators for welfare assessment on-farm.

AB  - Sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] crop in the semiarid tropics often suffers from post-flowering drought stress, which causes substantial losses in grain yield and stover quality. This research was aimed at studying the yield response of sorghum mini core accessions to post-flowering drought stress to identify drought-tolerant sources for sorghum improvement. Mini core accessions were grouped based on days to 50% flowering (extra early, early, medium, late, and extra late) and evaluated in two post-rainy seasons under managed drought stress and optimally irrigated conditions. Drought tolerance index (DTI), as a standard residual after removing the known contributory effects of flowering time and grain yield under optimum irrigation (yield potential) from the grain yield under drought, was used to segregate the genotypic responses to drought stress. The residual (or restricted) maximum likelihood analysis of data revealed significant genotypic variance (sigma(2)(g)) for days to 50% flowering, grain yield, and DTI (except in the extra late flowering group), in both the seasons and significant genotype x environment interactions for DTI in extra early to late flowering groups. On the basis of DTI, seven accessions, i.e., 'IS 14779', 'IS 23891', 'IS 31714', 'IS 4515', 'IS 5094', 'IS 9108', and 'IS 15466', were identified as drought tolerant and five accessions were sensitive to drought in both of the post-rainy seasons. The tolerant accessions belonging to durra, caudatum, or durra-caudatum races were of diverse geographical origins, and most yielded at par with or greater than the extensively grown cultivar 'IS 33844'. These accessions can be employed to investigate the physiological and molecular basis of drought adaptation and to breed for drought tolerance in sorghum.

AB  - The majority of studies on the toxicity of glyphosate-based herbicides to amphibians have focused on larval life stages exposed in aqueous media. However, adult and juvenile amphibians may also be exposed directly or indirectly to herbicides. The potential for such exposures is of particular interest in the littoral zone surrounding wetlands as this is preferred habitat for many amphibian species. Moreover, it may be argued that potential herbicide effects on juvenile or adult amphibians could have comparatively greater influence on overall recruitment, reproductive potential and thus stability of local populations than effects on larvae. In this experiment, juvenile green frogs (Lithobates clamitans) were exposed to two concentrations (2.16 and 4.27 kg a.e./ha) of a glyphosate-based herbicide formulation (VisionMax (R)), which were based on typical application scenarios in Canadian forestry. The experimental design employed frogs inhabiting in situ enclosures established at the edge of small naturalized wetlands that were split in half using an impermeable plastic barrier. When analyzed using nominal target application rates, exposure to the glyphosate-based herbicide had no significant effect on survival, body condition, liver somatic index or the observed rate of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis infection. However, there were marginal trends in both ANOVA analysis and post-hoc regressions regarding B. dendrobatidis infection rates and liver somatic index in relation to measured exposure estimates. Results from this study highlight the importance of field research and the need to include multiple endpoints when examining potential effects of a contaminant on non-target organisms.

AB  - Background: Successful defence of tobacco plants against attack from the oomycete Phytophthora nicotianae includes a type of local programmed cell death called the hypersensitive response. Complex and not completely understood signaling processes are required to mediate the development of this defence in the infected tissue. Here, we demonstrate that different families of metabolites can be monitored in small pieces of infected, mechanically-stressed, and healthy tobacco leaves using direct infrared laser desorption ionization orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The defence response was monitored for 1 - 9 hours post infection.
   Results: Infrared laser desorption ionization orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometry allows rapid and simultaneous detection in both negative and positive ion mode of a wide range of naturally occurring primary and secondary metabolites. An unsupervised principal component analysis was employed to identify correlations between changes in metabolite expression (obtained at different times and sample treatment conditions) and the overall defence response.
   A one-dimensional projection of the principal components 1 and 2 obtained from positive ion mode spectra was used to generate a Biological Response Index (BRI). The BRI obtained for each sample treatment was compared with the number of dead cells found in the respective tissue. The high correlation between these two values suggested that the BRI provides a rapid assessment of the plant response against the pathogen infection. Evaluation of the loading plots of the principal components (1 and 2) reveals a correlation among three metabolic cascades and the defence response generated in infected leaves. Analysis of selected phytohormones by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry verified our findings.
   Conclusion: The described methodology allows for rapid assessment of infection-specific changes in the plant metabolism, in particular of phenolics, alkaloids, oxylipins, and carbohydrates. Moreover, potential novel biomarkers can be detected and used to predict the quality of plant infections.

AB  - Sizing a new reservoir is a challenging task, which normally requires simultaneously a cost-effective, risk-informed, and forward-looking decision analysis with respect to basin-wide hydrological features, environmental quality, and biological integrity. Such a sustainable planning approach takes into account the global trend to balance the needs of economic growth, ecological conservation, and environmental protection. To achieve the goal of sustainability, emphasis in this paper was placed upon the correlation of three physical, chemical, and biological indices, including the dissolved oxygen (DO), the 5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD(5)), and the index of biotic integrity (IBI), for the optimal planning of a reservoir in a river basin. This new methodological paradigm has been employed for sizing an off-stream reservoir in the Hou-Lung River Basin, central Taiwan. The internal linkage between the water quality parameters (DO and BOD(5)) and the IBI levels further enables us to formulate a special biotic integrity constraint which reflects fish community attributes to suit a relatively low-density and unspecialized freshwater fish fauna in response to the changing water quality conditions in the river basin. The tradeoffs among economic, environmental, and ecological aspects for reservoir sizing can then be based on the river flow patterns, the water demand, the water quality standards, and the anticipated biological integrity in some critical river reaches. Findings in a preliminary case study suggest that an optimal pumping scheme may be smoothly maintained on a yearly basis within a combined multicriteria and multiobjective decision-making process.

AB  - Self-organizing activity of ecosystems can be investigated by means of different so-called goal functions. Emergy (Odum, 1988) and exergy (Jorgensen, 1992) have been proposed to account for embodied quality and organization of systems. The meaning of emergy and exergy as work potential indicators is stressed: they appear to be suitable measures of work potential until the resource is used up, while they seem to be incomplete indicators when the process is considered in the larger perspective of the surrounding environment. If the biosphere viewpoint is considered, i.e. the maintenance of the equilibria developed over millennia of self-organization, adiabatic correction terms have to be taken into account, in order to evaluate the shift of the system far from the sustainable steady state.

AB  - Background: Chemical signals are widely used in the animal kingdom, enabling communication in various social contexts, including mate selection and the establishment of dominance. Femoral glands, which produce and release waxy secretions into the environment, are organs of central importance in lizard chemical communication. The Galapagos marine iguana (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) is a squamate reptile with a lek-mating system. Although the lekking behaviour of marine iguanas has been well-studied, their potential for sexual communication via chemical cues has not yet been investigated. Here we describe the diversity of the lipophilic fraction of males' femoral gland secretions among 11 island populations of marine iguanas, and compare it with the composition of its sister species, the Galapagos land iguana (Conolophus subcristatus). We also conducted behavioural observations in marine iguana territorial males in order to explore the possible function of these substances in the context of male dominance in leks.
   Methods: Femoral secretions were analysed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and chromatography with a flame ionisation detector (GC-FID) in order to characterise the lipophilic composition. To understand the potential role of femoral secretions in marine iguana intraspecific communication, territorial males were sampled for their femoral glands and monitored to record their head bob rate-a territorial display behaviour in males-as well as the number of females present in their leks.
   Results: We found that the gland secretions were composed of ten saturated and unsaturated carboxylic acids ranging in chain length between C-16 and C-24, as well as three sterols. Cholesterol was the main compound found. Intriguingly, land iguanas have a higher diversity of lipophilic compounds, with structural group of lipids (i.e. aldehydes) entirely absent in marine iguanas; overall the chemical signals of both species were strongly differentiated. Lipid profiles also differed among populations of marine iguanas from different islands, with some islands demonstrating a high diversity of lipophilic compounds (i.e. full spectra of compounds), and others lacking one or more compounds. Among the compounds most frequently found missing were 11- and 13-eicosenoic acids. Gland secretions of males with a better body condition and with a higher dominance status (i.e. those accompanied by females and with higher head bob display) were proportionately richer in C-20-unsaturated fatty acids (11-eicosenoic acid).
   Discussion: Land and marine iguanas strongly diverged in their chemical composition of the femoral glands likely due to ecological differences between both species. Despite that marine iguana populations varied in their femoral gland composition that was not related to their genetic structure. Our results indicated that 11-eicosenoic acid may play an important role in intraspecific chemical communication in marine iguanas.

AB  - Bioreactor landfills using leachate recirculation in municipal solid waste (MSW) undergo complex interrelated hydraulic, mechanical, and biochemical processes. In this study, the authors present a mathematical framework that combines and solves together a hydraulic model, a biodegradation model, and a mechanical model to simulate and predict the coupled hydro-bio-mechanical behavior of MSW in bioreactor landfills. The mathematical framework was implemented in Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua (FLAC), a finite difference code. The hydraulic model was a two-phase flow model where the fluid flow was governed by Darcy's law while the saturated-unsaturated hydraulic behavior was governed by a soil-water retention model. The mechanical behavior of the MSW was evaluated by a plane-strain explicit formulation of the Mohr-Coulomb constitutive model, which accounted for concurrent changes in the MSW properties as a result of the MSW degradation. The MSW decomposition was modeled as a first-order decay kinetics biodegradation model similar to the LandGEM model used by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The coupled mathematical framework was validated with a published large-scale laboratory experiment and a field-scale experiment. It was applied to simulate the coupled behavior of a typical bioreactor landfill cell undergoing hydro-bio-mechanical interactions. Overall, the study shows that the proposed mathematical framework accounted for both the spatial and temporal changes in the geotechnical properties of the MSW, including the extent of degradation, and predicted the landfill settlement and MSW stabilization time for a typical bioreactor landfill configuration subjected to coupled hydro-bio-mechanical processes. In addition, some of the limitations and key challenges associated with the numerical model are highlighted.

AB  - Infants breastfeeding from mothers consuming aflatoxin contaminated foods may be exposed to aflatoxin M-1 (AFM(1)), a metabolite of aflatoxin B-1. This study estimated the association between AFM(1) exposure levels and growth indicators, for infants under six months of age in the Rombo district in Northern Tanzania. A total of 143 infants and their mothers were involved. Breast-milk samples, infants' anthropometric data and 24 h dietary recall for mothers were taken at the 1st, 3rd and 5th months of children age. AFM(1) contaminations in the samples were determined using HPLC. Aflatoxin M-1 exposure by an infant was estimated by multiplying contamination in the breast milk consumed by him/her with the breast milk intake recorded by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for infants of his/her age divided by the infant's body weight. All the breast-milk samples were contaminated by AFM(1) at levels ranging from 0.01 to 0.55 ng/ml. Above 90% of samples exceeded the EU limit of 0.025 ng/ml for infants' foods while over 76% exceeded the EU limit of 0.05 ng/ml for dairy milk and milk products. Only 1% of the samples exceeded the limit of 0.5 ng/ml set for dairy milk in the United States and several countries in Asia. AFM(1) Exposures ranged from 1.13-66.79 ng/kg body weight per day. A small but significant (P<0.05) inverse association was observed between AFM(1) exposure levels and weight for age Z-score or height for age Z-score. Appropriate strategies should be applied to minimise aflatoxin B-1 exposure in lactating mothers in order to protect infants from AFM(1) exposure.

AB  - Mining activities have caused heavy metal pollution in Xikuangshan (XKS), China. This work aims to assess heavy metal ecological risk in XKS using a potential ecological risk (PER) index and detect the responses of the soil bacterial community under heavy metal stress at different pH levels. The PER index indicated that antimony (Sb), cadmium (Cd), and arsenic (As) posed the most serious ecological risk at the sampling sites. We compared the effects of heavy metals on the structure of the microbial community under acidic and neutral conditions. Our results suggested significant differences between microbial community responses to heavy metals in acidic and neutral soils. Zinc (Zn) and lead (Pb) were the main heavy metal factors affecting the bacterial community under acidic conditions, whereas the effect of Sb, As, and chromium (Cr) exceeded them in neutral soils. This was possibly due to the different characteristics of heavy metals and their interactions with soil properties. The main genus were positively correlated with Sb, As, Zn, Pb, and Cd in both acidic and neutral soils, which may due to increasing resistance under conditions of long-time pollution. The results of our structural equation modeling indicated that the variations in the bacterial community structure were mainly explained by heavy metals in acidic and neutral soils. The soil nutrients and pH also had significant direct influences on the bacterial community under neutral conditions, as well as indirect effects due to their impact on heavy metals in neutral and acidic soils. Several heavy metal-resistant bacteria can be used for remediation under acid and neutral conditions.

AB  - Oxygen concentration is both an indicator and driver of water quality in lakes. Decreases in oxygen concentration leads to altered ecosystem function as well as harmful consequences for aquatic biota, such as fishes. The responses of oxygen dynamics in lakes to climate-related drivers, such as temperature and wind speed, are well documented for lake surface waters. However, much less is known about how the oxic environment of bottom waters, especially the timing and magnitude of anoxia in eutrophic lakes, responds to changes in climate drivers. Understanding how important ecosystem states, such as hypolimnetic anoxia, may respond to differing climate scenarios requires a model that couples physical-biological conditions and sufficiently captures the density stratification that leads to strong oxygen gradients. Here, we analyzed the effects of changes in three important meteorological drivers (air temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity) on hypolimnetic anoxia in a eutrophic, north temperate lake using the anoxic factor as an index that captures both the temporal and spatial extent of anoxia. Air temperature and relative humidity were found to have a positive correlation with anoxic factor, while wind speed had a negative correlation. Air temperature was found to have the greatest potential impact of the three drivers on the anoxic factor, followed by wind speed and then relative humidity. Across the scenarios of climate variability, variation in the simulated anoxic factor was primarily due to changes in the timing of onset and decay of stratification. Given the potential for future changes in climate, especially increases in air temperature, this study provides important insight into how these changes will alter lake water quality.

AB  - Sediment has long been recognized as a leading cause of impairment of biological condition in rivers and streams of the United States. Recently, federal and state agencies have shown increased interest in developing sediment criteria to maintain or improve habitat quality for the protection of aquatic species. To develop biologically based sediment criteria. sediment amounts must be linked with aquatic vertebrate response. For our analysis, we related an aquatic vertebrate index of biotic integrity (IBI) with a measure of the areal percentage of streambed surficial fines (<= 0.06 mm). The association suggested that fine sediment limits the biological potential of mountain streams. We used quantile regression to model the tipper limit of IBI response; the regression equation predicted a 4.7% decline in IBI for each 10% increase in areal surficial fines. However. the limiting relationship itself did not suggest a specific sediment level above which impairment was evident. To develop more specific evidence regarding sediment impairment and to describe possible impairment thresholds along the continuous relationship, we sought additional information from (1) the range of areal percent fines at the 169 least disturbed reference sites in our sample, (2) sediment tolerance values calculated for sediment-sensitive salmonids in the Mountains ecoregion, (3) a review of studies that describe IBI scores representing very good to excellent condition in coldwater (trout) streams of the United States, and (4) a second literature review of laboratory and field research relating the effects of sediment on the survival of salmonid eggs. Placing our initial results in the context of this additional information, we concluded that streambed areal surficial fine sediment (particle size <= 0.06 mm) levels of 5% or less retain habitat potential for sediment-sensitive aquatic vertebrates in mountain streams. We offer these results as scientific guidance for the process of establishing sediment criteria.

AB  - The combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin (Cis) has been used for the treatment of many cancers. The combination demonstrates synergy and improved clinical outcomes encouraging developing a formulation with both drugs. An analytical procedure is essential for formulation studies; however, no method has been reported for the concurrent determination and quantification of both 5-FU and Cis to date. A novel, simple, accurate, and precise HPLC method was developed using a C18 column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 mu m) and mobile phase composed of 0.5 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate: methanol (98:2, v/v), adjusted to pH 2.5 with phosphoric acid. A flow rate of 0.5 mL/min was applied and a photodiode array was utilized for detection and the retention times were 9.89 min (265 nm) for 5-FU and 5.36 min (210 nm) for Cis. Validation procedures were performed, and the method was found to be linear at ranges of 0.9-60.0 mu g/mL for 5-FU and 6.0-60.0 mu g/mL for Cis. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) were 0.10 and 0.25 mu g/mL for 5-FU and 2.00 and 4.00 mu g/mL for Cis, respectively. Other parameters such as precision, selectivity, robustness, and stability results were within acceptable limits. The method was applied to a model co-eluting film and its release profile was studied. Additionally, the method's greenness was evaluated by four assessment tools namely the national environmental method index (NEMI), analytical eco scale assessment (ESA), green analytical procedure index (GAPI), and Analytical GREEnness Metric Approach and Software (AGREE). The results demonstrated compliance with green analytical chemistry (GAC) practices. This research acts as a step towards further investigation of drug stability under different stress conditions and quantification of the intact drugs in presence of their degradation products.

AB  - The solubility of P in biosolids and manures has been shown to influence the potential for dissolved P losses in runoff and leachate when these materials are land applied. As a result, some Mid-Atlantic US states have developed P source coefficients (PSCs) to account for differences in P solubility between fertilizers, manures, and biosolids in P risk assessment tools. The reliability of these PSCs has not been evaluated under anoxic conditions, where environmental changes may affect the P solubility of biosolids or manures. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of anoxic conditions on the release of P from a range of Mid-Atlantic soils amended with manures and biosolids. The concentration of dissolved P released into Solution (0.01 mol L-1 NaCl) from the Pamunkey, Berks, and Manor soils was significantly lower under reducing conditions than tinder oxidized conditions (median Delta P = -0.70, -0.49, and -0.07 mg L-1, respectively; all significant at the 0.001 probability level). There was no significant P Source effect on dissolved P released into solution after anoxic incubation of soils. Calculated solubility diagrams and increases in oxalate-extractable Fe and P sorption index under reducing conditions for all soils suggest the precipitation of (i) an Fe(II)-oxide that increased the P sorption capacity of the soils or (ii) an Fe(II)-phosphate that decreased the solubility of P. We propose that current PSCs do not need alteration to account for differences in P solubility of organic Sources under reducing conditions under relatively static conditions (e.g., seasonable high water table, periodically Submerged soils, stagnant drainage ditches).

AB  - Trout density and biotic integrity scores are central metrics used to guide trout stream management actions. However, it is unclear whether reach-scale habitat characteristics affect trout density and biotic integrity in a similar fashion. To determine the relative strength of relationships between reach-scale habitat characteristics and important biological metrics, we used artificial neural network models to examine the relationships between 11 reach-scale habitat variables and (1) catch per effort (CPE) for brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis, (2) CPE for brown trout Salmo trutta, and (3) coldwater fish index of biotic integrity (IBI) scores. The trout CPE models generally included habitat features related to physical characteristics; the IBI model generally included physical characteristics as well as those related to water quality. The brook trout CPE model included sinuosity and percent pool area. The brown trout CPE model included gradient and cover. The coldwater IBI model included gradient, percent fine sediments, buffer width, and width: depth ratio. Habitat restoration efforts that seek to maximize brook trout CPE, brown trout CPE, or IBI may benefit from consideration of habitat variables associated with each metric. We also performed quantile regression to evaluate whether any one of the three response metrics or interest was limiting to,my of the other variables. Conditions that control IBI scores may also limit brook trout and brown trout densities 90th-percentile regressions between brook trout or brown trout CPE and IBI score were significant. Although our findings suggest that IBI scores and trout densities can often be increased simultaneously, the fact that different habitat variables were included in each model suggests that the most appropriate habitat restoration efforts may also differ depending oil the management goal.

AB  - We report results from the first statewide assessment of biological health in perennial streams in Washington State. Using a probabilistic sampling survey design, we were able to make unbiased estimates of biological condition of macroinvertebrate communities throughout the state based on 346 sites sampled from 2009 to 2012. Results from randomly sampled sites were classified as either good, fair, poor in comparison with 75 regional reference sites that were sampled concurrently. We determined that approximately 34 percent of stream kilometers assessed were in poor biological condition as measured with a multi-metric index, the Benthic Index of Biotic Integrity. Additionally, we evaluated a variety of chemical and physical habitat stressors known to negatively influence macroinvertebrate communities and determined that poor substrate conditions were the most prevalent and important stressors impacting stream macroinvertebrates, with relative bed stability and percent sand/fines being the most prevalent. A relative risk/attributable risk analysis suggests that improving physical habitat conditions in streams, most notably a reduction in percent sand/fines, will have the greatest impact for improving biological condition for macroinvertebrate communities. It is estimated that approximately 60% of stream kilometers now classified as in poor biological condition in Washington could be improved by reducing the amount of percent sand/fines in the substrate. These results are consistent with those obtained from EPA's national stream surveys and suggest that poor habitat conditions are the most prevalent stressors impacting stream macroinvertebrates in Washington State.

AB  - Agroecosystems are naturally variable at different scales showing strong environmental variations through time and in space. Therefore, temporal dynamics should be taken into account to understand the species-habitat relationship and provide information for biodiversity management. Droughts are climatic events that introduce variations in environmental conditions by reducing food resources and are increasing in severity and frequency due to global climate change. In 2008, a severe drought occurred in the argentine Pampas, which allowed us to test its short-term effect on avian diversity patterns according to different land uses. Also, we could test how variations in net primary productivity affected bird populations and explore the usefulness of this ecological process as an indicator of ecosystem service supply applicable to different ecological contexts. We surveyed bird diversity in two consecutive years (2007-2008) in the Rolling Pampas of Argentina, and we assessed environmental attributes at two spatial scales. We explored the relationship between bird diversity and an ecosystem services provision index (ESPI) that uses a proxy of net primary productivity and its intra-annual variation to test its adequacy in the changing conditions, we conducted our surveys. Results showed that drought affected negatively both species richness and abundance as a consequence of net primary productivity reductions. There was not a clear association of diversity changes with land use, and it is probable that the effect of drought is a complex combination of productivity, land use and spatial scale. ESPI proved robust in front of the environmental changes, and its predictive capacity was better at larger scales. These results are promising for the assessment of ecosystem services provision in a context of global climate changes. in Spanish is available with online material.

AB  - This study aimed to simulate conditions in which dispersant (Dasic NS) might be used to combat an oil spill in coastal sub-Arctic water of limited depth and water exchange in order to produce input data for Net Environmental Benefit Analysis (NEBA) of Arctic and sub-Arctic coastal areas. Concentration dependent differences in acute responses and long-term effects of a 48 h acute exposure to dispersed oil, with and without the application of a chemical dispersant, were assessed on the Arctic filter feeding bivalve Chlamys islandica. Icelandic scallops were exposed for 48 h to a range of spiked concentrations of mechanically and chemically dispersed oil. Short-term effects were assessed in terms of lysosomal membrane stability, superoxide dismutase, catalase, gluthatione S-transferases, glutathione peroxidases, glutathione reductase, glutathione, total oxyradical scavenging capacity, lipid peroxidation and peroxisomal proliferation. Post-exposure survival, growth and reproductive investment were followed for 2 months to evaluate any long-term consequence. Generally, similar effects were observed in scallops exposed to mechanically and chemically dispersed oil. Limited short-term effects were observed after 48 h, suggesting that a different timing would be required for measuring the possible onset of such effects. There was a concentration dependent increase in cumulative post-exposure mortality, but long-term effects on gonadosomatic index, somatic growth/condition factor did not differ among treatments.

AB  - The investigations aimed at the assessment of nickel contamination of the environment based on the content of this element in the coat of domestic and feral cats. The content of nickel in the coat was determined using the method ICP-OES. While assessing the state of nickel supply, a trial was undertaken at checking whether the increase in nickel content in the animal organism affects biological and haematological indexes of the animal. Blood plasma alkaline phosphatase, and alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (transaminase) activities, and haematological parameters were analysed. Then, the correlations between those indexes and the nickel content in cats' hair depending on cats' keeping (feral and domestic cats) and their sex were calculated. No statistically significant differences were noted depending on the cats living conditions. The obtained mean value of nickel content in the coat could be accepted as normal for cats. In the case of nickel, the differences depending, on sex and age were also not significant statistically. The assessment of statistical indexes shows that median, similarly as lower quartile, are identical for the nickel content in the cats from both groups (0.40 mg.kg(-1)) independently from their sex and age. Analysis of nickel content depending on hair colour was also performed assuming that the colour depends On the saturation of hair with melanin. The lowest nickel content was observed in white hair, higher in tortoiseshell hair and black hair, and the highest in the feral colour - brownish grey. The results confirmed the fact that the content of nickel depends on the hair saturation with melanin.

AB  - Reduced cortical gray matter integrity and cognitive abilities are among core deficits in schizophrenia. We hypothesized that higher allostatic load (AL) that accounts for exposure to chronic stress is a contributor to structural and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. One hundred and sixty-seven schizophrenia patients who were on average with normal weight, normal systolic, and diastolic blood pressure and 72 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Group differences in subclinical cardiovascular, metabolic, immune, and neuroendocrine biological markers as indexed by AL and contribution of AL components to the structural and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia were explored. Compared with controls, schizophrenia patients who were normotensive, normoweight, and had low total cholesterol levels still had significantly higher AL mainly due to lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and higher heart rate, waist-hip ratio, hemoglobinAlc, hypersensitive C-reactive protein, and overnight-urine cortisol levels. Patients also had decreased whole-brain mean cortical thickness, and lower cognition assessed by the MATRICS consensus cognitive battery. AL was inversely correlated with mean cortical thickness and cognition in schizophrenia, while none of these relationships existed in controls. Mediation analyses showed the effect of AL on cognitive deficits in schizophrenia was significantly mediated by cortical thinning, and the most significant mediating cortical area was the left superior frontal gyrus. Cortical thickness may act as a mediator between AL and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Early intervention strategies to reduce cortical thinning and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia should target specific aspects of their high AL in addition to weight gain, hypertension and high cholesterol levels.

AB  - Natural capital serves as a major constraint that affects the sustainable development of mountainous plateau areas. Determining ecological carrying capacity (ECC), as the key to measuring the critical natural capital of cropland, is needed for sustainable development. This study aims to provide new insights into ECC by diagnosing whether human activities are within the allowable range of natural capital and whether the spatial allocation of natural capital is reasonable in such specific areas. Taking Yunnan Province, China as the study area, we proposed an improved Ecological Footprint (EF) model to evaluate cropland's ecological capacity (CEC), and then, a framework of balance evaluation and spatial optimal allocation was constructed to examine the cropland's allowable range and optimize its spatial allocation if found unreasonable. Results show the following. (1) The per capita CEC of Yunnan Province between 2009 and 2016 decreased from 0.103 ha/capita to 0.095 ha/capita, and the cropland ecological balance index (EBI) presented a "critical overload" state ranging from 0.433 to 0.463, at which the supply exceeded the demand. Hence, the cropland was not within the allowable range in terms of supply-demand balance. (2) The comprehensive Gini coefficient of CEC was 0.462-0.515, and the gravity center of ca . deviated from the geometric center and shifted toward the westward, thereby, at is neither balanced in terms of spatial allocation nor coordinated with the population, economy, and resource environment. (3) The spatial allocation pattern of the study area was grouped into five zones on the basis of the optimization model. These zones are key optimization zone, adjustment optimization zone, maintenance zone, reasonable reduction zone, and key reduction zone. Accordingly, the targeted and differentiated strategies were accordingly put forward. Our study can contribute to identifying the practical approach to sustainable ecosystem management in mountainous plateau areas from the perspective of ECC and are beneficial for decision-making as regards new policies on cropland protection and Chinese ecological civilization construction.

AB  - Multimetric indices of biotic integrity (IBIs) are commonly used to assess condition of stream fish assemblages, but their ability to monitor trends within streams over time is largely unknown. We assessed the trend detection ability of two IBI formulations (one with traditional scoring and metrics, and one with nontraditional scoring and region-specific metrics) and of similarity and diversity indices using simulations that progressively altered the fish assemblages of 39 streams in the United States mid-Atlantic Highlands region. We also assessed responses to simulated 50% variability in fish abundances, as a measure of background "noise." Fish assemblage indices responded little to changes that affected all species proportionally despite substantial changes in total fish number. Assemblage indices responded better to scenarios that differentially affected fish species, either according to life history traits or by increasing dominance of already common species, but even these changes took some time to detect relative to background variability levels. Ordinations of stream fish assemblage data suggested that differences among sites were maintained even after substantial alterations of fish composition within sites. IBIs are designed to detect broad assemblage differences among sites while downplaying abundance changes and variability increases that were the first indications of within-site changes, and they appear more suited to detecting large departures from natural fish assemblages than for monitoring gradual changes such as those our simulations produced. Inferences about causes of assemblage changes should be made with caution because of correlations among species traits and interdependence among IBI component metrics. Site trend assessments should be made based on all available data rather than just by summary indices.

AB  - The Mid-Ebro Valley (MEV) is an area of the northeast Iberian Peninsula with a large number of hailstorms throughout the year. Therefore, new forecasting tools are required to improve the spatiotemporal detection of such storms. Using a database of 100 days with severe storms (SSs) over a 13-year period between 2001 and 2013, we obtained vertical profiles predicted by the WRF mesoscale model. A total of 31 indexes describing conditions of humidity, stability, helicity or precipitable water were obtained from the profiles and input to a binary logistic regression model. The regression model was applied using the forward stepwise method, which indicated that the stability indexes were the most accurate for SS in the study area. Of the 31 indexes, 5 were selected: Showalter index (SI), wind speed at 500 hPa (SPD500), dew point temperature at 850 hPa (Td850), relative helicity between 0 and 3 km (SREH3km), and wet bulb zero height (WBZ). Combination of these indexes in a logistic equation gives the probability of SS risk/no risk in the study area. Results of the logistic equation show a Probability of Detection (POD) of 0.94 and a False Alarm Ratio (FAR) of 0.22. The second part of the article describes regionalization of the study area by SS spatial distribution according to the logistic equation. Thus, using multivariate techniques, we used principal component analysis (PCA) in T-mode and posterior cluster analysis, getting four clusters according to the spatial distribution of SS thermodynamic behavior and the distribution of storms observed via radar data. Clusters 1 and 2 showed probabilities of hail occurrence that were lower than Clusters 3 and 4, mainly affecting the MEV and the eastern end of the study area. Likewise, the predicted hail area was more extensive in those last two clusters. These results provide a new tool that complements those previously developed for this study area, toward improving SS prediction and pinpointing these storms in space and in time.

AB  - In the present research, accumulation of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, V, and Zn were determined in sediments and fillet, liver, kidney, gonads, and gills of three commonly fish species in the largest wetland ecosystem that is located in southwest of Iran; Shadegan wetland. Shadegan is one of the most important wetland that posses various fauna and flora but suffers inputs from agricultural and industrial activities. So, sediment samples and fish species including Barbus grypus, Barbus sharpeyi, and Cyprinus carpio were collected during winter 2009. Results showed that mean concentrations of trace elements (except Ni and Co) were high in liver and gills of B. grypus. Also trace elements had the most accumulation in liver of B. sharpeyi except for Cd (0.26 mg kg (-aEuro parts per thousand 1) d.w.) and Mn (13.45 mg kg (-aEuro parts per thousand 1) d.w.) that were high in gills. Beside, kidney is determined as target tissue for Ni and V in B. grypus and for Pb in C. carpio, due to their high concentration. Zn levels in all tissues of C. carpio showed the highest concentrations in comparison to other fish species. Generally, accumulations of most of the studied elements in B. grypus and B. sharpeyi were higher in females than in males, while in fillet and gonads of C. carpio, this trend was inverted. Bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) were determined for different tissues of fish species with respect to elemental concentrations in sediment. BAFs results indicated that Zn, Pb, and Cu have higher BAF than other elements. Also this investigation demonstrated that trace elements have different affinities with condition factor of studied fish species. Gonadosomatic index (GSI) and Pb showed positive correlation together in both B. sharpeyi and B. grypus, respectively, in females and males. Moreover, females of C. carpio showed significantly positive relation of GSI and all studied elements.

AB  - A brief review of studies of the hydrological regime of the Sea of Azov and approaches to assessing the average salinity-a key indicator of the state of its ecosystem is given. A database of salinity measurements at 47409 oceanographic stations over hundred years (from 1913 to 2014) were used to evaluate the sea-averaged mean annual salinity. The obtained values of the average salinity were found to differ from those published before because of the different approaches used to its calculation and different volumes of data involved. The difference was most significant for Taganrog Bay because of the high variability of its hydrological regime. Anomalies of the average salinity over period 1922-2014 were constructed, and the start of one more period of salinity increase in the Sea of Azov was recognized.

AB  - The United States Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) will monitor the nation's resources by evaluating the status and trends of selected indicators of condition using a probability-based sampling design. The EMAP-Wetlands program will monitor the condition of the nation's wetlands. The EMAP classification system is an aggregation of the many subclasses of the US Fish and Wildlife Service's National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) classification system. This aggregation results in fewer wetland classes with more wetlands per class than the NWI system. Aggregation of the NWI classification was based primarily on dominant vegetation cover, flooding regimes, dominant water source, and adjacency to rivers and lakes. We evaluated the EMAP classification system and sampling design using NWI digital wetlands data for portions of Illinois, Washington, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Relative numbers of wetlands, total areas, average areas, and common versus rare classes were compared between the EMAP and NWI classification systems. As expected, the EMAP classification provided fewer wetland polygons, each with larger areas, without altering total wetland area. Summary statistics comparing sample estimates to true population parameters (represented by the NWI data) demonstrated the effectiveness of the EMAP sampling design with the exception of rare EMAP classes in the selected regions. Although simple random sampling is inadequate for both targe and small wetlands, the EMAP sampling design is readily adapted to provide better estimates for these categories. Aggregating the NWI classification to the EMAP classification provides fewer wetland classes, with more wetlands per class, for EMAP's annual reports and statistical summaries.

AB  - Environmental pollution with oil and oil products is a serious issue faced both by Russia and by the whole world. Currently, the use of microbiological preparations, which include indigenous microorganisms adapted to climatic and environmental conditions of a particular region, is an effective way to remediate oil-polluted soils. The use of microorganisms isolated from plant rhizosphere is promising for soil bioremediation due to their high biotechnological potential. The paper presents the results of model experiments on the influence of strains of oil-degrading microorganisms (Rhodococcus erytropolis 108, Acinetobacter guillouiae 112, Acinetobacter guillouiae 114) isolated from wheatgrass rhizosphere and their consortium on the purification of oil-polluted soil. The changes in soil enzymatic and respiratory activity are the indicators of its phytotoxicity. After 60 days of the experiment, the oil loss in oil-polluted soil with the introduction of the studied strains was shown to increase by 19-24% relative to the control and amount to 62-68% of its initial content. The enzymatic and respiratory activity of the soil increased at the background of oil destruction by the microorganisms. Treatment of oil-polluted soil with the strains of oil-degrading bacteria contributed to an increase in its phytotoxicity in the early stages of radish (Raphanus sativus) ontogeny. This was especially characteristic of the A. guillouiae 112 strain. The soil inoculated with R. erytropolis 108 had the least phytotoxicity throughout the experiment. For the first time, the obtained rhizospheric strains of the genera Rhodococcus and Acinetobacter were shown to accelerate the process of purifying the soil from oil and be able to be used for bioremediation of oil-polluted soils.

AB  - Aim Most existing studies that examined the biotic mechanisms of ecosystem stability have focused on aboveground biodiversity. Whether and how belowground biodiversity affects the stability of natural ecosystems is largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the relationships between above- and belowground biodiversity and the temporal stability of grassland biomass production across a large gradient of soil and climatic conditions.
   Location Tibetan Plateau.
   Time period 2001-2016.
   Major taxa studied Alpine grass and soil bacteria, arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) fungi and fauna.
   Methods We coupled a field biodiversity survey conducted in 54 alpine grassland ecosystems across the Tibetan Plateau with a satellite-sensed proxy (enhanced vegetation index, EVI) of ecosystem productivity during 2001-2016. The temporal stability of primary productivity was calculated as the ratio of the mean annual peak EVI to the standard deviation of the annual peak EVI over this period. Plant diversity was determined using a classic vegetation survey approach, soil bacterial and AM fungal diversity were measured using a high-throughput sequencing approach, and soil fauna was counted and identified at the order level after being extracted using a modified Berlese-Tullgren method.
   Results Our results demonstrated that both above- and belowground biodiversity were positively associated with ecosystem stability. Belowground biodiversity not only affected ecosystem stability directly, but also influenced it indirectly through plant diversity and soil fertility. Furthermore, soil pH, climate and its variability strongly influenced soil biodiversity, which in turn influenced ecosystem stability.
   Main conclusions Our study demonstrates the indispensable role of belowground biodiversity in regulating ecosystem stability, emphasizing the necessity of conserving this 'hidden' biodiversity in fragile alpine ecosystems facing ongoing environmental change.

AB  - An evaluation of the health status of feral populations of the freshwater catfish Clarias gariepinus was carried out between 2009 and 2010 at three dams in the Limpopo and Olifants river systems with varying levels of human impact. Fish health was assessed using a modified health assessment index (HAI) protocol, with the inclusion of the inverted parasite index (IPI) and condition factor (K). These biomonitoring tools provide relatively simple and rapid indications of how well fish are coping in their environment. To verify the biomonitoring results, water quality analyses were included in the study. The nutrients and mining-related pollutants in the three dams differed to a great extent and showed an increasing trend in the order: Luphephe-Nwanedi Dams < Flag Boshielo Dam < Return Water Dam. The HAI score varied across the three sampling sites, with individual mean values of 93.3, 84 and 42.7 at the Return Water Dam, Flag Boshielo Dam and Luphephe-Nwanedi Dams, respectively. The top six metrics that correlated best with fish health scores were the levels of ectoparasites, haematocrit values and the condition of the gills, liver, skin and fins. Although the HAI successfully differentiated among the three localities, which differed in water quality, it was non-specific in response to contaminants. Notably, the premise set forth by the IPI that endoparasites increase with a decrease in water quality was not supported.

AB  - Observed bimodal distributions of woody cover in western Africa provide evidence that alternative ecosystem states may exist under the same precipitation regimes. In this study, we show that bimodality can also be observed in mean annual shortwave radiation and above-ground biomass, which might closely relate to woody cover due to vegetation-climate interactions. Thus we expect that use of radiation and above-ground biomass enables us to distinguish the two modes of woody cover. However, through conditional histogram analysis, we find that the bimodality of woody cover still can exist under conditions of low mean annual shortwave radiation and low above-ground biomass. It suggests that this specific condition might play a key role in critical transitions between the two modes, while under other conditions no bimodality was found. Based on a land cover map in which anthropogenic land use was removed, six climatic indicators that represent water, energy, climate seasonality and water-radiation coupling are analysed to investigate the coexistence of these indicators with specific land cover types. From this analysis we find that the mean annual precipitation is not sufficient to predict potential land cover change. Indicators of climate seasonality are strongly related to the observed land cover type. However, these indicators cannot predict a stable forest state under the observed climatic conditions, in contrast to observed forest states. A new indicator (the normalized difference of precipitation) successfully expresses the stability of the precipitation regime and can improve the prediction accuracy of forest states. Next we evaluate land cover predictions based on different combinations of climatic indicators. Regions with high potential of land cover transitions are revealed. The results suggest that the tropical forest in the Congo basin may be unstable and shows the possibility of decreasing significantly. An increase in the area covered by savanna and grass is possible, which coincides with the observed regreening of the Sahara.

AB  - Springs are environmental objects of unique character, determined by water resources and high water quality, important for economic, recreational, landscape, and cultural aspects. Springs, on the boundary of surface and groundwater resources, are fundamental for understanding resources and circulation of water in the river catchment, and can be good indicators for assessment of the natural environment changes.
   The paper presents results of discharge measurements analyses for 65 springs performed in the period 1946-2016 in the area of the Lublin Upland and Rortocze in Poland. Based on approximately 5,000 measurements, characteristic discharges were determined for each spring: minimum, mean, and maximum, as well as the variation coefficient. The role of spring waters in the alimentation of rivers was assessed.
   The most abundant springs (continuously or periodically exceed 100 dm(3) s(-1), maximum discharge 400 dm(3) s(-1)) are alimented from the Cretaceous aquifer. The springs show high discharge stability in the multiannual rhythm and seasonal regime of water resource fluctuations resulting from the appearance of a series of years with increased or reduced atmospheric precipitation. Variable response to atmospheric alimentation results from the conditions of water flow through the aeration zone. Springs provide from 40% to almost 100% of river water.
   Because of economic activity, contributing to the transformation of environmental components and constituting a threat to springs, their niches, and water quality, there is the need for their protection and their preservation in a possibly natural state in accordance with the local environmental conditions.

AB  - Blooms of the disaster opportunist Guembelitria species are proxies for environmental catastrophes, whether impact or volcanism, leading to severe biotic stress crises that may range from temporary exclusion of ecological specialists and generalists to mass extinctions. During the late Maastrichtian and early Danian (zones P0 and Pla), Guembelitria blooms show global distributions, but with the largest blooms (40-80% Guembelitria) in low and middle latitudes and only minor blooms (10-20%) in high latitudes. Late Maastrichtian Guembelitria blooms are, so far, known from the Indian Ocean and eastern Tethys. The most intense Guembelitria blooms (>60% Guembelitria) occurred in shallow continental shelf areas, slope/shelf margins and volcanic provinces of the Indian Ocean. What these environments have in common is high nutrient influx (eutrophication) either from continental runoff, upwelling along continental margins or volcanic input. At times of biotic crises, Guembelitria blooms may have spread rapidly to the exclusion of most or all other species, much like today's red tides, but with near global distributions.
   A simple model can explain the ecological succession and recovery phases that follow major biotic perturbations caused by impacts or volcanism that lead to exclusion of specialist and most generalist species. Within such highly stressed environments, Guembelitria is the only genus to thrive, and without competition, rapidly reproduce and exponentially increase their populations. When nutrients are depleted, populations rapidly decrease, leading to ecologic niches for other generalists and ecosystem recovery. Small low-O-2-tolerant heterohelicid populations mark this second stage, followed by small trochospiral and planispiral species. With further environmental recovery, increasing competition, niche development and restoration of a well-stratified water mass, oligotrophic conditions are restored, opening habitats for the highly specialized and diverse species and a return to normal diverse assemblages. This ecological succession is observed in association with mantle plume volcanism in the Indian Ocean and eastern Tethys during the late Maastrichtian, and in association with the K-T impact and volcanism during the early Tertiary.

AB  - Anthropogenic impact on the population of ground beetles leads to a change in their numbers, structure of dominance, density, species composition, spectrum of life forms. This makes the beetles Carabidae a convenient and informative bioindicator of the ecological state of biocenoses. The material for this work was the Carabidae collections conducted in June-August 2016-2017 in the park zone of different regions of Barnaul, differing in location, area, hydrological regime, vegetation cover, purpose and anthropogenic load. When processing the material, the quantitative, species and generic composition of the carabidae was determined, calculations were made for such indicators as the Berger-Parker dominance index, the Shannon species diversity index (Hs), and the Jacquard species similarity index. The fauna (Coleoptera, Carabidae) of the park zone of Barnaul is represented by 55 species belonging to 20 genera. The dominant group is represented by species belonging to steppe, forest and polyzonal groups. Forest-steppe species of ground beetles as dominants have not been identified in any of the investigated territories. The greatest variety of ecological groups was noted on the territory of the Yubileyny park, which is explained by the presence of zones with various microclimatic conditions, the presence of a birch grove that flows through the park with the Pivovarka River, and a wide log in the park. Registered species belong to eight groups of life forms belonging to two classes zoophagous and myxophytophagous. On the numerical and species abundance, zoophages predominate. The spectrum of life forms corresponds to the zonal spectrum characteristic of the forest-steppe zone.

AB  - Objective, To examine cross-sectional baseline data from the Consortium for the Longitudinal Evaluation of African Americans with Early Rheumatoid Arthritis registry for the association between socioeconomic status (SES) with clinical and self-report health outcomes.
   Methods. We analyzed data on 937 African Americans who provided comprehensive sociodemographic data in addition to self-reported health outcomes. SES measures included educational attainment, homeownership, household income, and occupation. Outcomes included measures of disease activity, joint damage, a.utoantibody status, and self-reported measures. Multivariable linear, logistic, and zero-inflated Poisson regression models were used to estimate associations of each SES measure with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) outcomes, controlling for sex, age, disease duration, comorbid conditions, body mass index, smoking, methotrexate/leflunomide use, and biologic agent use.
   Results. The mean age was 54 years, 86% were women, and the mean RA disease duration was 7.8 years. Approximately 24% had less than a high school degree, 56% had a nonprofessional occupation, 75% had a household income <=$30,000, and 55% were nonhomeowners. In multivariable regression models, significantly increased associations of disease activity measures and self-reported health outcomes were observed with low household income (<=$30,000/year) and nonhomeownership. Education less than high school was primarily associated with self-reported health outcomes. Among participants with disease duration <2 years, associations of SES were confined to self-reported measures.
   Conclusion. Our results indicate significant socioeconomic disparities in self-reported physical and mental health, clinical disease activity measures, and autoantibody status among African Americans with RA not explained by differences in demographics, medication use, and health behaviors.

AB  - According to the increasing need of our country to edible oil and also according to the limit of country water sources and its effect on yield and production of oil plants, an experiment was conducted in order to evaluate the response of safflower to drought stress, in a split plot arrangement based on randomized complete block design with three replications at Research Farm, Research Center of Kerman Agricultural Institute. The main plots included four irrigation levels (complete irrigation, irrigation disruption from the flowering stage, irrigation disruption from the heading-bud and irrigation disruption from stem elongation) and the secondary plots included three cultivars of safflower (Esfahan local, Kerman local and IL genotype). The results of this experiment showed that irrigation disruption in all stages caused a significant reduction of plant height, leaf area index (LAI), dry matter at max LAI, seed yield and components, biological yield, harvest index, oil percentage and oil yield. Maximum seed and oil yield was obtained in normal irrigation treatment, and irrigation disruption from flowering, heading-bud and stem elongation stages were in the next ranks, respectively. Among the cultivars, the highest and lowest seed yield was related to IL and Kerman local, respectively. Also among the yield components, number of seeds per head had the highest correlation with the grain yield. In overall, the results of this study showed that supplying suitable water amount during the growth period and sowing the Esfahan local cultivar prepare best yield production possibility. In contrast, with the limit in water sources and the possibility of encountering of the plant with drought stress during the growth period, IL cultivar is better than the other cultivars.

AB  - Our investigation pointed out, with a detailed classification, a vast variability of forest humus and soil under spruce forests on two different sites with North and South exposition, permitting to identify a pedogenetic trend between different sylvogenetic phases of forest evolution and specific humus forms.
   We identified the soil indicators that have to be checked for measuring soil changes relating to humus changing. First of all we noted a humus change on soil morphological features. Such features are produced by physical and biochemical pedofauna bioturbations. Pedofauna according to the peculiar microclimate of the soil, depends on the forest development. Biochemical litter environment produces specific humus form.
   During the growth of a forest there is a policyclic soil evolution with physical-chemical changes that we can observe in time on soil and humus forms. The humus forms are related with the air (biospheric fluxes), with the organic-mineral components (as micro and macroelements cycles) and with pedofauna. We observe physical change (as structure, porosity, horizontation, particle-size, pattern, mineralogy) and chemical change (as for pH, C, N) in soil horizons which is due to humus change.
   The humus forms have been investigated in relation to the development of vegetation growth, with the aim to identify a representative humus form of a specific sylvogenetic phase. Such research suggests an hypothesis that the humus form is a guide of the environment states to which it belongs. During the open canopy stage (that is the phase before the presence of very young plantations) it is possible to observe many different humus forms: from the acid one as Moder (Hemimoder), that is heredity of the previous use of the land, to the new form of Mull (Oligomull) that is the result of the new forest cycle, more suitable for spruce renovation.

AB  - Chris R. de Freitas: The role and importance of cave microclimate in the sustainable use and management of show caves
   Cave microclimate is important in the study of cave flora and fauna, certain karst processes underground and hydrogeologic aspects of speleothems; thus an understanding of microclimatic processes is especially important in the management of show caves. Here, examples are drawn from research on New Zealand caves and examined in the context of sustainable cave use management practices. The work considers that the cave manager is concerned, firstly, with defining the desired or optimal level or range of environmental conditions that should prevail and, secondly, with maintaining them. To do this requires an appropriate and reliable monitoring system. It involves selecting key indicators to be monitored and setting target standards. Selection of an appropriate monitoring system, however, relies on having a good understanding of the climate processes operating, essentially how they work and how they might be appropriately managed. Unlike microclimates in the atmosphere-land boundary layer, which are characterized by vertical exchanges, processes determining climate in all but nearly closed caves are dominated by advection of heat and moisture. It is this process that may give rise to distinct spatial and temporal patterns of climates in caves. Thermoadynamic aspects of external air-cave air interaction are assessed to explain spatial as well as short term and seasonal variations of thermal and moisture states of the cave atmosphere. The relevance of all this to cave management is discussed. It is argued that cave management is not simply a matter of determining usage levels or carrying capacity of caves; rather, it involves determining environmental management techniques that are appropriate to a particular cave condition or environmental state that should prevail.

AB  - National economic systems are investigated in a 3-axis diagram where three different indicators are used to account for resource use, societal organization, and goods and services produced, respectively. This framework is consistent with an input-state-output (environment-society-economy) scheme based on a logical, physical and thermodynamic order between the three dimensions of sustainability. This approach highlights which input-state-output relations are realized and which relations are less common in the behavior of these systems. It assesses and overcomes major drawbacks of common representations of sustainability. Within a cube diagram, 99 national economies are ranked and grouped into 8 categories, which are labeled to reflect the main characteristics of their behavior according to the three environmental, social and economic parameters. A cluster analysis is also performed in order to statistically support the classification and strengthen the interpretation of results. Results show that no countries exhibit a dematerialization of economic activity and that non-sustainable economic activity can take place over a wide range of income distributions (Gini coefficients).

AB  - Intensive and incessant disruptions in watercourses such as dams are taking place due to the growing demand for hydroelectric generation, and can result in severe deterioration of ecosystem integrity. This research concentrates on the impact of dams on macroinvertebrate communities downstream of two hydropower dams on tributaries of the upper Ayeyarwady River basin (Myitnge and Chaungmagyi Rivers) in Myanmar. A total of 52 and 49 aquatic invertebrate taxa with a total abundance of 2,743 and 1,356 were collected from the Myitnge and Chuangamgyi Rivers, respectively. We found the natural flow regime had changed in both study rivers after the construction of the dams. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) indicated the communities of morphospecies of taxa and the very sensitive insects (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, and Odonata, EPTO) were significantly different between upstream and downstream of both dams. We used the preliminary Myanmar Aquatic Biomonitoring Assessment Index (MABA) detect ecological water quality. The MABA analysis using all taxa at family-level showed that upstream of the dams was rated as good quality whereas downstream of the dams was rated as fair quality. Our research showed that macroinvertebrates communities can be used as a bioindicator to detect the impact of human influences on river health such as dams. We concluded that the novel biomonitoring assessment tool recently developed for Myanmar is a promising monitoring tool as further river development occurs in Myanmar, which could also be linked to citizen science projects.

AB  - Whilst there are a number of mapping methods available for determining important areas for conservation within protected areas, there are few tools available for assessing the ecological value of landscapes that are 'beyond the reserves'. A systematic tool for determining the ecological value of landscapes outside of protected areas could be relevant to any development that results in a parcel of land being transformed from its 'natural' state to an alternative state (e.g., industrial, agricultural). Specifically what is needed is a method to determine which landscapes beyond protected areas are important for the ecological processes that they support and the threatened and vulnerable species that they contain. This paper presents the results of a project to develop a method for mapping ecologically important landscapes beyond protected areas; a Local Ecological Footprinting Tool (LEFT). The method uses existing globally available web-based databases and models to provide an ecological score based on :five key ecological features (biodiversity, vulnerability, fragmentation, connectivity and resilience) for every 300 m parcel within a given region. The end product is a map indicating ecological value across the landscape. We demonstrate the potential of this method through its application to three study regions in Canada, Algeria and the Russian Federation. The primary audience of this tool are those practitioners involved in planning the location of any landscape scale industrial/business or urban (e.g., new town) facility outside of protected areas. It provides a pre-planning tool, for use before undertaking a more costly field-based environmental impact assessment, and quickly highlights areas of high ecological value to avoid in the location of facilities.

AB  - Aims. A complex interaction exists between age, body mass index, medical conditions, polypharmacotherapy, smoking, alcohol use, education, nutrition, depressive symptoms, functioning and quality of life (QoL). We aimed to examine the inter-relationships among these variables, test whether depressive symptomology plays a central role in a large sample of adults, and determine the degree of association with life-style and health variables.
   Methods. Regularised network analysis was applied to 3532 North-American adults aged >= 45 years drawn from the Osteoarthritis Initiative. Network stability (autocorrelation after casedropping), centrality of nodes (strength, M, the sum of weight of the connections for each node), and edges/regularised partial correlations connecting the nodes were assessed.
   Results. Physical and mental health-related QoL (M = 1.681; M = 1.342), income (M = 1.891), age (M = 1.416), depressive symptoms (M = 1.214) and education (M = 1.173) were central nodes. Depressive symptoms' stronger negative connections were found with mental health-related QoL (-0.702), income (-0.090), education (-0.068) and physical health-related QoL (-0.354). This latter was a `bridge node' that connected depressive symptoms with Charlson comorbidity index, and number of medications. Physical activity and Mediterranean diet adherence were associated with income and physical health-related QoL. This latter was a `bridge node' between the former two and depressive symptoms. The network was stable (stability coefficient = 0.75, i.e. highest possible value) for all centrality measures.
   Conclusions. A stable network exists between life-style behaviors and social, environmental, medical and psychiatric variables. QoL, income, age and depressive symptoms were central in the multidimensional network. Physical health-related QoL seems to be a `bridge node' connecting depressive symptoms with several life-style and health variables. Further studies should assess such interactions in the general population.

AB  - The objectives of the study described were to (1) compare environmental temperature-humidity index (THI) with the THI measured within two different calf housing systems and (2) determine how THI affects Holstein heifer calf body temperatures, serum cortisol concentrations, and serum thyroxine concentrations. At 24 to 48 h of age, calves were assigned to one of two individual housing treatments: (1) stalls in a three-sided barn (n = 8) or 2) hutches placed outside (n = 8). Calves were observed until 42 days of age during the summer months. Ambient temperature and relative humidity within housing systems were recorded hourly. Calf body temperatures were measured hourly using devices attached to the underside of each calf's tail. Blood samples were collected at 7, 21, and 42 days of age via jugular venipuncture. Blood serum was analyzed for cortisol and thyroxine concentrations using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Overall average THI was higher in hutches than in stalls (P < 0.0001). Calves housed in hutches had higher body temperatures (39 +/- 0.18 degrees C vs 38 +/- 0.15 degrees C,P = 0.005). No differences occurred in serum cortisol concentrations (P = 0.89) but at 21 days of age, calves housed in hutches had higher serum thyroxine concentrations (16.55 +/- 0.51 mu g/dl vs 13.91 +/- 0.54 mu g/dl,P = 0.0006) than calves housed in stalls. Although both housing systems in this study were located on the same dairy, calves housed in hutches were exposed to higher THI values, had higher body temperatures, and at 21 days of age had higher serum thyroxine concentrations than calves housed in stalls inside a three-sided barn.

AB  - Isotopic composition of lead is a very sensitive indicator allowing us to determine even very low contamination of soils by this element, which is not noticeable from the change in its concentration against the background of the natural variability. Isotopic composition of loosely bound lead fractions (exchangeable and specifically sorbed) changes in soils of the Kologrivskii Forest State Natural Reserve under the impact of global or regional atmospheric transport and deposition of contaminants, though these soils are not subjected to the local technogenic pollution. The maximum portion of lead bound with the soil organic matter in the upper organic horizons reaches 75% of the total lead content. The portion of lead bound with iron and manganese (hydr)oxides increases down the soil profile. The portion of the residual fraction of lead also increases significantly down the soil profile. The most pronounced changes are observed for the Pb-206/Pb-207 ratio, which decreases from 1.20-1.24 to 1.15-1.18 under the impact of global pollution. The technogenic compounds of lead migrate down the soil profile. In the gray-humus gley alluvial soil (Fluvic Gleysol), low values of the Pb-206/Pb-207 ratio are observed for the exchangeable and specifically sorbed lead fractions in the entire soil profile, which is explained by the worse conditions for lead fixation in the profile of this soil in comparison with those in the podzolic soils.

AB  - Compared to data on adolescents and adults, limited research has been conducted on biological correlates among young children with possible psychological difficulties, especially in Asian countries. By focusing on various peripheral biochemical indicators, we investigated potential biological correlates of psychological states in a community sample of Taiwanese school children aged 6-10 years. In total, 307 students (159 obese children and 148 normal-weight children) were selected from first-and fourth-grade school children in eight elementary schools in the Taipei metropolitan area in 2009. These children underwent a comprehensive health examination, including a physical examination, blood sample analysis, and questionnaire administration in a hospital. Differences in anthropometric and serum biochemical readings were compared between children with average and worse levels on each of the five psychological domains. We found that interleukin (IL)-1 beta [beta = 1.29, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.50-2.09], IL-10 (beta = 1.61, 95 % CI <0.01-3.24), fasting blood glucose (beta = 0.08, 95 % CI 0.01-0.15), homocysteine (beta = 0.63, 95 % CI 0.09-1.18), and aspartate transaminase (AST) (beta = 0.15, 95 % CI <0.01-0.31) were significantly positively associated with anxiety. In addition, IL-1 beta, insulin, AST, and alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) were significantly positively associated with depression. Anger and disruptive behaviors were also related to specific biological correlates. Specific biological correlates, including AST/ALT, cardiovascular disease-related variables, and specific cytokines, were linked to particular psychological states among young children in this Asian population. These might provide a route for better understanding the biological aspects of children's mental health and might contribute to research on diagnostic or predictive biomarkers for psychiatric diseases in young children.

TI  - The effectiveness of vermiculture in human pathogen reduction for USEPA biosolids stabilization
T2  - COMPOST SCIENCE & UTILIZATION
LA  - English
AB  - A field experiment tested the feasibility of vermicomposting as a method for eliminating human pathogens to obtain United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Class A stabilization in domestic wastewater residuals (biosolids). The experimental site was at the City of Ocoee's Wastewater Treatment Facility in Ocoee, Florida. and Class B biosolids were used as the earthworm substrate. Two windrows of biosolids 6 m long were heavily inoculated with four human-pathogen indicators, fecal coliforms, Salmonella spp., enteric viruses and helminth ova. The test row was seeded with earthworms, Eisenia fetida. The quantity of E. fetida was calculated at a 1:1.5 wet weight earthworm biomass to biosolids ratio and the earthworms allowed time to consume the biosolids and stabilize the biosolids. The test indicated that all of the pathogen indicators in the test row were decreased more than in the control row within 144 hours. The test row samples showed a 6.4-log reduction in fecal coliforms compared with the control row, which only had a 1.6-log reduction. The test row samples showed an 8.6-log reduction in Salmonella spp, while the control row had a 4.9-log reduction. The test row samples showed a 4.6-log reduction in enteric viruses while the control only had a 1.8-log reduction. The test row samples had a 1.9-log reduction in helminth ova while the control row only had a 0.6-log reduction. Dr. Jim Smith, Senior Environmental Engineer and Pathogen Equivalency Commission (PEC) Chair, for the USEPA, indicated by personal communications, that a three- to four-fold reduction in indicator organisms would be sufficient to warrant serious consideration of vermicomposting as an effective stabilization methodology (Smith 1997). These results in conjunction with pilot project results strongly indicate that vermicomposting could be used as an alternative method for Class A biosolids stabilization. This was obtained statistically by vermicomposting.

AB  - The microbial metabolic quotient (respiration-to-biomass ratio) or qCO(2), conceptually based on Odum's theory of ecosystem succession, is increasingly being used as an index of ecosystem development (during which it supposedly declines) and disturbance (due to which it supposedly increases). We investigated the suitability of qCO(2) as an bioindicator using: (1) data from the Franz Josef Glacier chronosequence, spanning over 22,000 years; and (2) data recalculated from published studies. In the Franz Josef sequence, a detectable decline in qCO(2) occurred in the first 250 years in both the L-layer and mineral soil layer. However, in the later phases of the succession there was a sharp increase in qCO(2) indicating reduced microbial efficiency, which appeared to be related to stress (independent of disturbance) resulting from steady-state conditions. Calculation of qCO(2) from three previous studies on disturbance and ecosystem development indicated that this index responds unpredictably and does not necessarily decline during succession. Plant litter decomposition studies demonstrate that while qCO(2) usually declines initially, a significant increase in qCO(2) can eventually follow on litter types resistant to decomposition. Correlation analysis of each of 24 previous studies demonstrated that qCO(2) often declines with increasing pH, clay content and amounts of microbial biomass; these three soil properties are all indicative of varying stress rather than disturbance levels. Reanalysis of data from 16 previous studies indicated that some disturbances such as fertilization and liming can either increase or decrease qCO values depending on whether the disturbance alleviates stress (reducing qCO(2)) or is more extreme than the stress it alleviates (enhancing qCO(2)). Although cultivation represents a severe disturbance, qCO(2) is not predictably enhanced by this perturbation. While qCO(2) undoubtedly provides a useful measure of microbial efficiency, our data suggests it has limitations because it can be insensitive to disturbance and ecosystem development, fails to distinguish between effects of disturbance and stress, and does not decline predictably in response to ecosystem development whenever stress increases along successional gradients.

AB  - An ecological functional assessment (EFA) was used on 10 southwest Costa Rica sites representing a chronosequence of formerly pastured lands to undisturbed tropical wet forest. Ecological functional assessment is a tool designed to assess wetland functions in the United States that was adapted to upland forests. Models to indicate characteristic soil hydrologic features and soil structure and aboveground spatial structure of habitat were used to examine the degree to which selected sites within the chronosequence approach the undisturbed condition of the natural forest. An index of the functional model for the maintenance of characteristic soil hydrologic features (such as infiltration, bulk density, etc.) showed that the 20-year-old secondary forest was at approximately 60% of the condition of the undisturbed sites, whereas active pasture was evaluated at approximately 20% of the reference undisturbed forest; 4- and 10-year-old sites were intermediate. The spatial structure of habitat model showed that 20-year-old secondary forest was approximately 50% of reference forest, whereas active pasture was approximately 10% of the condition of undisturbed forest; 4-year-old sites were evaluated at approximately 20% and 10-year-old sites at approximately 60% of the reference state. Overall the functional assessment process indicated that degraded tropical wet forest sites have recovered almost 60% of their functional qualities 10 years following pasture abandonment. These results indicate that EFA can be a useful technique for monitoring restoration programs in the tropics.

AB  - The Gulf of Nicoya is a large tropical estuary located on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica and accounts for the country's main fish production. It is increasingly impacted not only by its fisheries, but also by urbanization, tourism developments, the input of pollutants from urban centers and agriculture activities in the catchment areas of large rivers entering the gulf. Similar to other coastal ecosystems, the gulf is particularly sensitive to shortand long-term changes in the climate, such as the precipitation rate, Sea Surface Temperature, wind speed and current regimes. While the gulf has been studied for decades, until now no attempt has been made to combine the analysis of the impacts of fishing and environmental changes on the ecosystem. By following a holistic approach that uses fisheries and environmental time series data from collaborative research and simulation models, this study aims at identifying the main drivers of the observed changes in the Gulf of Nicoya ecosystem. While the model simulations indicate that variations in the catch of some target species (e.g., cephalopods and shrimps) are mainly driven by the fisheries' exploitation rates, several other species (e.g., corvina, snook, small pelagics, and crabs) are also substantially affected by climate variations, particularly during El Niflo periods of high Sea Surface Temperature extremes and increased precipitation. During these periods, phytoplankton productivity and zooplankton biomass deceases with bottom-up effects on the entire food chain. Indicators of the environmental state of the system thus have to be considered along with regulations of the fishing pressure to form the basis for the development of appropriate management strategies.

AB  - In the study, the relationship between some aquatic insect species (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Odonata) and some heavy metals (cadmium, lead, copper, zinc, nickel, iron and manganese) and boron were assessed using data obtained from the Ankara Stream, which flows through Ankara, the capital city of Turkey and receives high organic and industrial wastes. Sampling was carried out monthly along the Ankara Stream in 1991. environmental data were used to explain biological variation using multivariate techniques provided by the program canonical correspondence analysis ordination. The ordination method canonical correspondence analysis was applied to evaluate the relationships between environmental variables and distribution of aquatic insect larvae. Data sets were classified by two way indicator species analysis. In this study, aquatic insecta communities have been shown by canonical correspondence analysis ordination as related to total hardness, pH, cadmium, lead, copper, zinc, nickel, iron, manganese and boron. Cadmium, lead, copper and boron exceeded limits of the United States Environmental Protection Agency criteria for aquatic life. Trichopteran, Dinarthrum iranicum was an indicator of two way indicator species analysis and was placed close to the arrow representing copper. Odonate, Aeschna juncea was an indicator of two way indicator species analysis in site 10 and was placed close to the arrows representing manganese, lead, and nickel. Trichopteran, Cheumatopsyche lepida and odonate, Platycnemis pennipes were indicators of two way indicator species analysis for sites 6, 7, 11, 14, 15, 18 and were placed close to the arrows representing cadmium, boron, iron and total hardness.

AB  - This study was an attempt to analyse the regional environmental quality with the application of remote sensing, geographical information system, and spatial multiple criteria decision analysis and, to project a quantitative method applicable to identify the status of the regional environment of the study area. Using spatial multi-criteria evaluation (SMCE) approach with expert knowledge in this study, an integrated regional environmental quality index (REQI) was computed and classified into five levels of regional environment quality viz. worse, poor, moderate, good, and very good. During the process, a set of spatial criteria were selected (here, 15 criterions) together with the degree of importance of criteria in sustainability of the regional environment. Integrated remote sensing and GIS technique and models were applied to generate the necessary factors (criterions) maps for the SMCE approach. The ranking, along with expected value method, was used to standardize the factors and on the other hand, an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was applied for calculating factor weights. The entire process was executed in the integrated land and water information system (ILWIS) software tool that supports SMCE. The analysis showed that the overall regional environmental quality of the area was at moderate level and was partly determined by elevation. Areas under worse and poor quality of environment indicated that the regional environmental status showed decline in these parts of the county. The study also revealed that the human activities, vegetation condition, soil erosion, topography, climate, and soil conditions have serious influence on the regional environment condition of the area. Considering the regional characteristics of environmental quality, priority, and practical needs for environmental restoration, the study area was further regionalized into four priority areas which may serve as base areas of decision making for the recovery, rebuilding, and protection of the environment.

AB  - Over the past several years, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has urged states to adopt numeric nutrient criteria to protect water quality. In a number of states, new numeric nutrient criteria have incorporated both a nutrient (nitrogen and/or phosphorus) criterion and a biological endpoint (e.g., chlorophyll a in lakes or benthic macroinvertebrates in streams). While the causal relationship between nutrient levels and chlorophyll in lakes is well-established, quantifying causal relationships between nutrients, chlorophyll a, and benthic macroinvertebrate communities in rivers and streams has been more elusive. This is especially true in highly agricultural ecoregions of the upper midwest United States where a number of confounding factors may be present. Predictive relationships derived from field collected data can provide important support for setting numeric criteria and identifying management alternatives that can achieve and sustain water quality goals. In this paper, we examine the empirical basis for a causal relationship between nutrients, chlorophyll, and benthic macroinvertebrates in the context of other potential macroinvertebrate stressors in a highly agricultural region. We developed a Bayesian network (BN) model for the number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera taxa (EPT) present in streams of the Eastern Corn Belt Plains Ecoregion of Ohio using Ohio Environmental Protection Agency data collected over roughly a decade (2005-2013). For the data evaluated in this study, useful relationships between nutrients, chlorophyll a, and EPT were not found. An alternative BN model including total Kjeldahl nitrogen with habitat quality and dissolved oxygen appeared to reflect stronger causal influences on this indicator of stream macroinvertebrate quality. However, the predictive power of the BN was relatively low, suggesting that other factors not accounted for in the model may contribute significantly to EPT taxa abundance in these streams.

AB  - Organic matters in drinking water are composed of soluble and particulate fractions. Soluble organic matters generally originated from allochthonous, autochthonous, and synthetic organic. Silica sand filters, which are utilized in water treatment, have a low potential of removing the soluble organic matters. Traditional carbon-based media such as activated carbon and anthracite are among the choices for the removal of soluble organic. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have a higher potential in removing synthetic and natural organic materials than the other traditional carbon based media. Utilization of CNTs at the slurry state requires the removal of the nanotubes themselves at the end of the process which leads to yet another problem to take care of. The present study, therefore, aims at solving this problem. In so doing, oxidized CNTs (140 degrees C, 5h, Nitric acid) were bound to the surface of silica sand through 3-(triethoxysilyl)propylamine to act as a bonding agent. Humic acid was used as the index of natural organic matters. The removal potential of humic acid with the new adsorbent (CNTsand) was studied under various operational conditions (contact time, temperature, and initial concentration). According to the obtained data, CNTsand has a good potential in the removal of humic acid (q(max) = 81.96mg/g CNT). Additionally, the kinetic, isotherm, and thermodynamic of adsorption were investigated, for which the data followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm. Evaluation of enthalpy change (H = 11.02kJ/mol) and free energy change (G = -7.32 to -9.20kJ/mol) indicated that the reaction is spontaneous, endothermic, and thermodynamically favorable. Regeneration study showed that the desorption step of humic acid was faster than its adsorption step. It was observed that after five cycles, the adsorption capacity amounted to roughly 50% of the initial adsorption capacity. The above data depict that the new engineered material is a good reusable adsorbent in water treatment.

AB  - In the Multiple-Use Zone of Guatemala's Maya Biosphere Reserve, the usufruct rights to timber and non-timber forest resources were granted through concession agreements to 12 community organizations and two private timber companies in the late 1990s and early 2000s. After more than a decade, some concessions are successfully managing forests for multiple uses while others have had limited success or failed completely. This paper provides a management unit-based analysis and evaluation of the evolution of these forest concessions. First, we present a critical assessment of the current state of ecological integrity, socio-economic development, governance, and financing within each of the 14 forest concessions, using a series of quantitative and qualitative indicators. Next, we categorize the different trajectories that the concessions have experienced, and describe the key biophysical, socio-economic, and market events and drivers that may have influenced their outcomes. Lastly, we provide suggestions for the continued consolidation of multiple-use forest management practices in the Maya Biosphere Reserve, and draw out lessons for multiple-use forest management elsewhere in the tropics.

AB  - In the southern areas of the Siberian platform, geological and mining conditions are highly complex for design, drilling and construction of deep wells for oil and gas. Complicating factors are related to specific features of deforming cavity-fractured carbonate reservoirs. Geological models of carbonate reservoirs should be designed on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the conditions of each specific field, including its complex filtration field, confirmed deformation of filtering fractures with constant parameters of the cavern component, etc. If an incomprehensive geological model is used for production planning with a lack of a well-based approach to the development of a carbonate reservoir, design well flow rates may not be achieved, the field reserve coverage will be reduced and, consequently, the oil recovery ratio will be lower. When developing oil, gas and brine deposits, it is required to consider the natural-technical system of 'reservoir - reservoir' (mechanical impact) - 'reservoir fluid system and well' (hydrodynamic impact) on the basis of a comprehensive analysis of its interrelated and interdependent components. Our study shows that each part of the system contributes directly to the entire complex. The stress state of the rock mass in the fluid-permeable part of the natural fractured reservoir and fluid-saturated reservoirs is dynamically changeable during the fluctuations of the pressure field of the reservoir hydrocarbon system at the initial penetration of a well into the reservoir. The authors analyzed the natural-technical system 'well - fluid-saturated bed' as a real on-line model of leaking - hydraulic fracturing based on a standard pressure vs. time curve during hydraulic fracturing. Based on the knowledge of the on-going processes in carbonate cavern-fractured reservoirs, it becomes possible to predict the reaction of the rock mass during hydraulic repression (i.e., during the initial penetration of a well into the reservoir) and depression (during testing and operations of a production well). All pressure effects hydraulically applied to the reservoir fluid system can lead to changes in the stress state of the natural reservoir. The stress state with significantly changing permeability parameters of filtering fractures is among the most complex states of stress [Belonin et al., 2005; Borevsky, 1986]. It is important to take into account that such stress state transition during the drilling process is uncontrollable and unpredictable, which means that the reservoir permeability and porosity may be irreversibly affected and considerably reduced and, consequently, the oil well productivity and the final profitability of developing the hydrocarbon field will be significantly decreased. Based on the actual deep drilling data, we continue comprehensive studies of deforming fractured reservoirs in the area of the stress state of the rock mass and investigation of pressure characteristics of fluid systems and their mutual influence during hydraulic operations in the well completion cycle. We have analyzed the stress state of the rock mass in various reservoirs. Indicators characterizing a particular state of the rock mass are substantiated. Geological and technological recommendations are specified for the initial penetration of wells into the reservoir, as well as for testing the wells with respect to the state of the natural-technical system 'well - fluid-saturated formation'. New geological and technological solutions are proposed.

AB  - This study exploited the historical rockfall inventory and the meteorological stations database of Mont Cervin and Mont Emilius Mountain Communities (Aosta Valley, northern Italy) to decipher relationships between climate processes, typical of mountain environments and rockfall phenomena. The period from 1990 to 2018 was selected as reference to perform the analysis. Climate processes were translated into four climate indices, namely short-term rainfall (STR), effective water inputs (EWI, including both rainfall and snow melting), wet and dry episodes (WD) and freeze-thaw cycles (FT). The comparison between climate indices values at each rockfall occurrence and the statistical distributions describing the whole indices dataset allowed to define not ordinary climatic conditions for each index and their influence on rockfall occurrence. Most of the events analysed (>95% out of 136) occurred in correspondence of the defined not ordinary climatic conditions for one or for a combination of the indices. The relationships between rockfalls and climate showed a seasonality. In spring, most of the events resulted to be connected to FT (70%) while in autumn to EWI (49%). The relative seasonal importance of WD reached its maximum in summer with 23% of the events related to this index alone. Based on these results, different strategies to define empirical critical thresholds for each climate index were explored, in order to make them valid for the whole study area. A preliminary exploratory analysis of the influence of high temperatures and temperature gradients was carried out for some summertime rockfalls, not correlated to the other investigated indices. The presented approach is exportable in neighbouring regions, given the availability of a dated rockfall dataset, and could be adapted to include different processes.

AB  - Adequate stimulation of cutaneous afferents from the fingertip evokes a short-latency inhibition followed by a long-lasting excitation in human flexor carpi radialis (FCR) motoneurones. Changes in excitability of flexor motoneurones were investigated in 11 subjects by means of the H-reflex conditioning technique. The index fingertip, immobilised on a flat table, was stimulated by a small probe mounted on an electromagnetic vibrator. Contact time and tactile perception threshold (PT) were monitored throughout the experiment. In all subjects, tactile stimulation of the skin covering the index pulp, with 10 ms long square pulses, at an intensity of 2-2.5 PT, produced an inhibition starting at a conditioning-test interval of 15 ms and lasting about 2 ms. This was followed by a powerful facilitation lasting more than 10 ms. Excitation appeared just at tactile threshold, whereas threshold for inhibition was about 2 PT. Similar effects were observed after mechanical stimulation of the skin covering the dorsal aspect of the index, close to the nail. Local anaesthesia of the finger pulp drastically reduced both the inhibition and the facilitation of FCR H-reflex. By contrast, electrical stimulation of the index digital nerves, by means of ring electrodes, was always ineffective in modifying the excitability of the FCR I-I-reflex. It is proposed that inhibition and excitation of FCR H-reflex are caused by activation of oligosynaptic pathways fed by cutaneous afferents; however, it cannot be excluded that joint receptors and primary endings of small hand muscles may contribute in part to the late excitation. The pathways described might play an essential role in modulation and control of exploratory movements and object manipulation, actions that need tactile information to regulate muscle force.

AB  - Increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) in agroecosystems is a promising solution to simultaneously address climate change mitigation, adaptation, and food security. Yet, the best management practices that could achieve these goals remain to be identified. Here, we analyze the long-term effects of application of green manure, cereal straw, farmyard manure, and cattle slurry on SOC in a 37 year long field experiment in Switzerland. The treatment effects were compared against control conditions that received only optimal mineral fertilization. More specifically, this study aimed at evaluating the effect of organic amendments on SOC accumulation and distribution in different soil particle-size fractions by means of a set of indicators about organic matter quality (biological reactivity, humification index) and microbial activity (extracellular enzyme activities). In the absence of organic matter input, application of mineral fertilizers alone resulted in the lowest SOC content and the highest humification index of the bulk soil organic matter. Among the organic amendments, cereal straw, farmyard manure, and cattle slurry promoted a higher SOC content and a lower humification index due to an increase of SOC in the clay-size fraction. The annual C accrual reached 4.4 parts per thousand per year over 37 years with farmyard manure. The higher biological reactivity measured for the green manure and cereal straw amendments was associated with higher soil enzymatic activities, while C retention coefficients decreased by at least 2.5 times compared to animal-derived amendments. The low availability of nutrients in green manure and straw amendments as suggested by the high phosphatase and N-acetylglucosaminidase activities may indicate a reduction in C retention of organic matter inputs due to nutrient microbial mining with plant-derived amendments.

AB  - United States Environmental Protection Agency guidance on the use of photochemical models for assessing the efficacy of an emissions control strategy for ozone requires that modeling be used in a relative sense. Consequently, testing a modeling system's ability to predict changes in ozone resulting from emission changes is critical. We evaluate model simulations for precursor species (NOx, CO, and volatile organic compounds [VOCs]), radicals (OH and HO2), a secondary pollutant (O-3), and the model response of these compounds to weekend/weekday emission changes during California Nexus study in 2010. The modeling system correctly simulated the broad spatial and temporal variation of NOx and O-3 in California South Coast. Although the model generally underpredicted the daytime mixing ratios of NO2 at the surface and overpredicted the NO2 column, the simulated weekend to weekday ratios are consistent with each other and match the observed ratios well. The modeling system exhibited reasonable performance in simulating the VOC compounds with fossil fuel origins but has larger bias in simulating certain species associated with noncombustion sources. The modeling system successfully captured the weekend changes of the enhancement ratios for various VOC species to CO and the relative changes of HOx, which are indicators of faster chemical processing on weekends. This work demonstrates satisfactory model performances for O-3 and most relevant chemical compounds with more robust performance in simulating weekend versus weekday changes. Improved planetary boundary layer height simulations, a better understanding of OH-HO2 cycling, continued improvement of emissions, especially urban biogenic emissions and emissions of oxygenated VOCs, are important for future model improvement.

AB  - Pressures are mounting for the simplification of environmental impact assessment (ETA). This phenomenon is drawing increasing scholarly attention, but studies have not gone far beyond speculating what could happen as a result of recently implemented or proposed regulatory changes. This paper takes a more longitudinal look at simplified EIAs. The main objective was to analyze the perceived outcomes of a number of simplified ETA processes, using Brazil as the empirical context. More specifically, this paper aimed at understanding: 1) how simplified EIAs have been conceptualized and implemented in southeastern Brazil; and 2) how developers and civil servants in that region perceive the outcomes of simplified EIAs. This study adopted a sequential mixed method research approach. Data was collected through literature reviews, 261 telephone-based interviews and 10 face-to-face interviews. Degrees of ETA simplification can vary significantly within and across jurisdictions. In any case, simplification is often framed as a win-win solution to EIA ineffectiveness, through which regulatory and procedural changes are made to ease the process, while, at the same time, maintaining or providing better environmental protection. This approach is more frequently applied to potentially low-impact processes. Chi-square tests of the data collected through telephone interviews in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais indicated that developers tend to perceive EIA processes as difficult and slow regardless of how simplified it is. Most civil servants, who were directly involved in the implementation of simplified ElAs in state environmental agencies, argued that simplified EIAs are driven mostly by environmental agencies, as these institutions have long been unable to cope with an ever-increasing load of license applications. Policy outcomes of simplified EIAs in the territory are not sufficiently monitored by state agencies. Civil servants revealed concerns about the potential long term effects of EIA simplification on the ground, as they have had limited resources for audits and inspections.

AB  - Most assessments of whether a water body will comply with Pollutant standards after modification of land use, loading, or climate change are based on the results of deterministic simulation models. These models, including those used to support the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) total maximum daily load (TMDL) program, typically do not account for common sources of assessment uncertainty. Instead, model results are typically represented by a time series of predicted Pollutant concentration values or the parameters of a frequency-based distribution of these values over a specified time period. The rate of exceedance of relevant pollutant limits is then assessed directly from this time series or distribution to determine standard compliance. In this way, sampling and analysis-based variability and model uncertainty are typically ignored, although they may substantially influence the probability of non-compliance. To help address this problem, we introduce ProVAsT (Probabilistic Water Quality Standard Violation Assessment Tool), a software tool encoded in the graphical model-based package Analytica (R). Here, we present a version of ProVAsT which translates model-predicted in situ fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) pollutant concentrations into the expected frequency of water quality standard violations and provides a Bayesian measure of the degree of confidence in this assessment. We call this version ProVAsT-FIB. Along with inputting their own Simulation model results, users can specify the particular water quality analysis methods employed (e.g. the analytic procedure used and the number and volume of sample aliquots) as well as the numeric limits pertaining to local water quality standards. It is our hope that ProVAsT will encourage the rational consideration of uncertainty and variability in water quality assessments by reducing the burden of complex statistical calculations.

AB  - The development of modern science and technology tends to accompany environmental crisis and ecological degradation. And the evaluation of the security condition of the forestry ecosystem has become an urgent task. This paper details the development of a decision support system (the FESEDSS), which was built to provide a range of actors with an effective tool for the evaluation and governance of forestry ecological security in China. The FESEDSS considers multiple factors through a general decision-support framework, making possible the calculation of ecological security indexes and relative indexes for the forestry ecosystem and its three subsystems (forest, wetlands and desert) at both the national and provincial level. The system integrates econometric models, mathematical methods, geographic information systems and a dynamic database, providing users with an understanding of spatiotemporal patterns and regional differences in the ecological security of the forestry ecosystem and its three subsystems in China's 31 provinces. Results generated using the FESEDSS and addressing the period 1999-2012 demonstrate a positive change in forest ecological security condition and a negative change in wetland and desert ecological security. Spatially, the ecological security of the forest subsystem was shown to have improved significantly in eastern and central China, while in the western region it experienced degradation. The ecological security of wetland ecosystems performed well in the southwest region and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River; and desert ecological security was shown to be of a higher standard in south of Qinling-Huaihe Line than in the northern regions of the country. The overall forestry ecological security condition (which integrates the three subsystems) demonstrated an upward trend with some fluctuations, with high values generally being located in the south and low values in the north of the country. Finally, the paper also discusses performance, uncertainty, and implementation challenges, as well as detailing potential extensions of the FESEDSS. The paper lays a foundation to the national forestry ecological security evaluation and monitoring.

AB  - One of the key features in reproduction of polygynous species is seminal recovery after mating. However, it is poorly known how environmental factors affect the recuperation period of seminal material. This study aims to test plasticity in recovery of seminal reserves in response to distinct environmental conditions of the kelp crab Taliepus dentatus. Male crabs were maintained after depletion of seminal reserves in one of eight different treatments in a factorial design of temperature (12 and 16 degrees C), food availability (with alimentation and food deprivation), and time period (15 and 30 days), simulating different environmental situations in the laboratory to which the crab might be exposed to along its distribution. Temperature and food availability modulated the seminal recovery period in T. dentatus. Complete replenishment was reached within 30 days in all treatments (i.e., 12 and 16 degrees C each with alimentation and food deprivation), but the highest recovery index was found in crabs without food provision (16 degrees C). In this condition, the recovery index was twice as high compared with males maintained at a similar temperature but with feeding. Prolonged starvation at 16 degrees C may be extremely stressful conditions for male crabs, during which risk to die probably triggered a concentration of the reproductive effort in favor of immediate reproduction. This suggests that plasticity of energy allocation toward reproduction may be expressed during extremely suboptimal conditions, which might be a similar strategy as proposed by the terminal investment hypothesis. The generally relatively fast seminal recovery regardless of the temperature may explain the kelp crab's continuous mating throughout the year.

AB  - Diazinon exposures have been linked to the onset of toxic pathways and adverse outcomes in aquatic species, but the ecological implications on model species are not widely emphasized. The objective of this study was to determine how the organophosphate pesticide diazinon affected hematological (hemoglobin, total red blood count, total white blood count, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin), growth (condition factor, hepatosomatic index, specific growth rate), biochemical (total serum glucose, total serum protein), and endocrine (growth hormone, tri-iodothyronine, and thyroxine) parameters in Clarias batrachus after chronic exposure. Diazinon was administered at predefined exposure doses (0.64 and 1.28 mg/L) and monitored at 15, 30, and 45 days into the investigation. Observation for most biomarkers revealed patterns of decreasing values with increasing toxicant concentration and exposure duration. Correlation analysis highlighted a significant inverse relationship between variables (mean corpuscular hemoglobin, condition factor, specific growth rate, tri-iodothyronine, thyroxine, and total serum protein) and elevated chronic diazinon exposure concentrations. The integrated indices (IBR and BRI) indexes were used to provide visual and understandable depictions of toxicity effects and emphasized the relativity of biomarkers in terms of sensitivity and magnitude or severity of responses under graded toxicant exposures. The significant damage reflected by evaluated parameters in diazinon exposure groups compared to control portends risks to the health of local fish populations, including Clarias batrachus in aquatic systems adjacent to agrarian landscapes.

AB  - l-Lysine is an essential amino acid that can be produced by chemical processes from fossil raw materials, as well as by microbial fermentation, the latter being a more efficient and environmentally friendly procedure. In this work, the production process of l-lysine-HCl is studied using a systematic approach based on modeling and simulation, which supports decision making in the early stage of process design. The study considers two analysis stages: first, the dynamic analysis of the fermentation reactor, where the conversion of sugars from sugarcane molasses to l-lysine with a strain of Corynebacterium glutamicum is carried out. In this stage, the operation mode (either batch or fed batch) and operating conditions of the fermentation reactor are defined to reach the maximum technical criteria. Afterwards, the second analysis stage relates to the industrial production process of l-lysine-HCl, where the fermentation reactor, upstream processing, and downstream processing are included. In this stage, the influence of key parameters on the overall process performance is scrutinized through the evaluation of several technical, economic, and environmental criteria, to determine a profitable and sustainable design of the l-lysine production process. The main results show how the operating conditions, process design, and selection of evaluation criteria can influence in the conceptual design. The best plant design shows maximum product yield (0.31 g l-lysine/g glucose) and productivity (1.99 g/L/h), achieving 26.5% return on investment (ROI) with a payback period (PBP) of 3.8 years, decreasing water and energy consumption, and with a low potential environmental impact (PEI) index.

AB  - This is the first quantitative study of temporal assemblage turnovers of the relationships between intertidal foraminifera. Time series datasets collected from tropical Caroni Swamp and Claxton Bay (Trinidad, SE Caribbean) and temperate Cowpen Marsh (NE England, U.K.) and Bay of Cadiz (SW Spain) were used. The assemblage turnover index (ATI) examined species interrelationships through comparisons of monthly or biweekly species proportional abundances over one or two years. Species contributing to major assemblage turnovers (All > x + sigma) were identified using the conditioned on-boundary index (CoBI). Foraminiferal species are heterogeneously distributed within the sediment; multiple sample stations at a study location cumulatively represent the foraminiferal metacommunity and clusters represent foraminiferal assemblages. The ATI and CoBI were applied to the proportional abundances of live specimens recorded for the metacommunity and assemblages at each location. At Caroni Swamp and Claxton Bay, major assemblage turnovers were driven by the most abundant species and the majority coincided with seasonal change or the arrival of the seasonal Orinoco plume in the Gulf of Paria. Seasonal turnovers of the foraminiferal metacommunities at temperate Cowpen Marsh and Bay of Cadiz occurred during the summer and winter. Major assemblage turnovers in the upper Cowpen Marsh occurred in the summer, and the lower marsh in the winter. Foraminiferans are useful bioindicators for monitoring the health of coastal environments. Understanding foraminiferal population dynamics will allow cyclical changes to be differentiated from abrupt and persistent changes, which are related to anthropogenic disturbances or long-term climate change. The ATI and CoBI are useful indices for quantitatively exploring relationships of foraminiferal populations over time. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper investigates the perceived well-being of residents of two coastal rural areas located in the central part of the Great Barrier Reef region in Australia. Typically, well-being studies concentrate on collating data from respondents about their perceptions of levels of satisfaction on specific predetermined points. However, recording respondents' satisfactions with various contributors to their well-being does not provide researchers with an indication of how important those contributors are to the respondents. This paper presents an approach to the analysis of well-being that combines the perceived importance of the well-being factors with the reported levels of satisfaction with the factor, aggregated to a regional level. A total of 372 individuals were asked to comment on how satisfied they were with twenty-seven well-being factors from the domains of society, the natural environment, and the economy and services. The highest reported satisfaction rates were associated with family relations, family safety, family health, family education levels, and work ( > 75%). Information about the perceived importance of the well-being factors was also recorded and combined with information about levels of satisfaction, thus creating an index of dissatisfaction-an index that allows one to identify an 'action list', or set of regional priorities that, if addressed by policy makers, has the potential to enhance regional well-being. Several high-scoring factors in the index, such as condition of the landscape and beaches and access to nature, came from the domain of the natural environment, indicating the importance of integrated approaches to well-being that also include environmental concerns.

AB  - This study presents the interannual CO2 exchange of a semiarid shrubland overlying a carbonaceous substrate where abiotic processes may interact with biological processes in the ecosystem carbon cycle. Estimated by the eddy covariance technique and two different gap-filling models (RBF neural network and MDS ``Marginal Distribution Sampling''), the mean annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 varied from -63 to 29 g C m(-2), averaging -2 +/- 23 g C m(-2) from May 2004 to December 2007. In addition, CO2 exchange was divided into periods likely dominated by clear signals of biological activity (high daytime uptake, low Bowen ratio) and periods of apparent plant senescence (dry conditions) to better understand the relative contributions of ``biological versus abiotic processes'' to the annual NEE and the interannual variability of these processes. During biological periods, CO2 exchange appears to be related to changes in the ecosystem leaf area index, whereas abiotic fluxes are most closely related to evapotranspiration. The timing of rainfall events seems to be a main determinant of both activation and duration of biological processes. During apparent abiotic periods, CO2 exchange is characterized by daytime emissions averaging 1.5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), whereas biological periods are characterized by daytime CO2 uptake with mean values of around 1.4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). As a preliminary result, the abiotic period characterized from 19% of 2004 to 45% of 2007 with a mean duration of approximately 2 months. However, future research is needed in order to achieve a more reliable division between determinant processes involved in CO2 exchange over carbonaceous substrates.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the variation over time in thermal comfort indices and the behavior of physiological parameters related to thermolysis, blood parameters, and semen in natura of buffalo bulls reared in tropical climate. The study was carried out in an artificial insemination station under a humid tropical climate (Afi according to Koppen). Ten water buffalo bulls (Bubalus bubalis) were used during the 5 months (April to August) of study. The environmental Temperature Humidity Index (THId) and the pen microclimate Temperature Humidity Index (THIp) were calculated. Every 25 days, respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), rectal temperature (RT), and Benezra's thermal comfort index (BTCI) were assessed in the morning and in the afternoon. A blood assay was performed every month, while semen was collected weekly. THIp did not vary over the months (P > 0.05) and was higher in the afternoon than in the morning (77.7 +/- 2.6 versus 81.8 +/- 2.1, P < 0.05). RR, HR, and BTCI significantly increased over the months and were different between the periods of the day (P > 0.05) but within the physiological limits. RT varied between the periods of the day and decreased over the months, being the lowest in August (37.8 +/- 0.7 A degrees C), time-impacted hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, hemoglobin levels, and spermatic gross motility and vigor (P < 0.05). Thus, buffalo bulls reared under a humid tropical climate may have variations in thermal comfort during the hotter periods but are able to efficiently activate thermoregulatory mechanisms and maintain homeothermy, hence preserving their physiological and seminal parameters at normal levels.

AB  - A pilot study on the fatty acid composition of the bone marrow, brain tissue and muscle (flesh) of the medium-sized marsupial the Bennett's wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus), aimed to explore the mechanisms behind the dominance of this human prey species in late Pleistocene southwest Tasmania. In particular it was designed to investigate why humans frequently selected and transported the wallaby hindquarters, breaking open their longbones and metatarsals to expose the marrow cavity, when these animals could easily have been transported whole. Initial results indicated that the percentage of unsaturated fatty acids particularly palmitoleic acid (C-16:1) and oleic acid (C-18:1) in the bone marrow increased distally away from the body core temperature or the heart, towards the hands and feet. There is a corresponding decrease in the percentage of the saturated fatty acids, particularly palmitic acid (C-16:0) and stearic acid (C-18:0). This is similar to the pattern identified in placental artiodactyls (even-toed ungulates) and rodents. The preliminary study was then expanded to a year-long seasonal experiment involving wallabies from different Tasmanian environmental and climatic zones to see if this can better help explain the apparent seasonal occupation of caves indicated from recent Bennett's wallaby teeth annuli (Skeletochronological studies). It was found that the Bennett's wallaby remained a relatively stable and dependable resource throughout the year, with environmental, altitudinal and seasonal variability having only a minor effect on the fatty acid composition or nutritional quality of their bone marrow, muscle and brain tissue. Interestingly, the animals had increased desirable unsaturated fatty acids in their marrow, muscle and brain during the winter and spring with decreased amounts during the summer and autumn. This lends support to an earlier Kidney Fat Index (KFI) analysis for the Bennett's wallaby which recorded significant seasonal differences within and between regions, indicating an environmental effect on overall body condition. Fatty acid analysis of the Common wombat Vombatus ursinus, the Tasmanian pademelon Thylogale billardierii, and the Forester or Eastern Grey kangaroo Macropus giganteus were also included to ascertain why these animals remained constant, although minor, prey species throughout the late Pleistocene. While the results from these animals were similar to the Bennett's wallaby, there were some unexpected and surprising patterns that require further investigation. All of these fatty acid analyses have important implications for understanding human decision-making and occupation of southwest Tasmania during the Last Glacial Maximum, for modern dietary and palaeodietary benefits, and for understanding the physiology of these unique Australian marsupials.

AB  - Yield under drought stress is a highly complex trait with large influence to even a minor fluctuation in the environmental conditions. Genomics-assisted breeding holds great promise for improving such complex traits more efficiently in less time, but requires markers associated with the trait of interest. In this context, a recombinant inbred line mapping population (TAG 24 9 ICGV 86031) was used to identify markers associated with quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for yield and yield related traits at two important locations of West Africa under well watered and water stress conditions. Among the traits analyzed under WS condition, the harvest index (HI) and the haulm yield (HYLD) were positively correlated with the pod yield (PYLD) and showed intermediate broad sense heritability. QTL analysis using phenotyping and genotyping data resulted in identification of 52 QTLs. These QTLs had low phenotypic variance (<12 %) for all the nine traits namely plant height, primary branching, SPAD chlorophyll meter reading, percentage of sound mature kernels, 100 kernel weight, shelling percentage, HI, HYLD and PYLD. Interestingly, few QTLs identified in this study were also overlapped with previously reported QTLs detected for drought tolerance related traits identified earlier in Indian environmental conditions using the same mapping population. Accumulating these many small-effect QTLs into a single genetic background is nearly impossible through marker-assisted backcrossing and even marker-assisted recurrent selection. Under such circumstances, the deployment of genomic selection is the most appropriate approach for improving such complex traits with more precision and in less time.

AB  - Habitat distribution is critically informative for stock assessment, since incorporating its variabilities can have important implications for the estimation of stock biomass or the relative abundance index. A refined ecological niche model with habitat characteristic parameterization was developed to reconstitute a 3-D ecological map of bigeye tuna in the Pacific Ocean. We determined the boundaries and hierarchies of oceanographic features and hydrological conditions at horizontal and vertical scales to define the habitat preference of bigeye tuna associated with their feeding and physiological requirements. Ecogeographic projections underlined the depth- and region-specific habitat distribution of bigeye tuna, with noticeable dynamic variations in the response to climate variability. Depths from 300 to 400 m represented layers of the most productive habitat, which was widespread through the equatorial Pacific Ocean and extended to the north-central Pacific Ocean. The proportion of high-quality habitat size in the north Pacific had a strictly regular intra-annual cycle with peaks during the winter. Climate variability appeared to disturb the balance of the regular fluctuations in habitat size in the equatorial Pacific. Habitat hotspots during an El Nino period were characterized by their expansion to the north of the Hawaiian islands, shrinkage in the west for the hotspot band north of the Equator, and an eastern shift for the band south of the Equator. This variability may be the consequence of the incorporated fluctuations of the oxygen minimum zones (OMZ), current systems, and stratification in the open ocean.

AB  - This study evaluates the contribution of an unsupervised factor optimisation based on sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to spatial landslide modelling with regularised greedy forests (RGFs). A total of 952 landslides were identified by field surveys, equally divided and used for training and testing of the proposed model. Ten conditioning factors related to landslides, including geo-morphometrical (i.e. altitude, slope, aspect, curvature, slope length, topographic wetness index and sediment transport index) and geo-environmental (i.e. lithology, nearness to roads and nearness to streams), were used to investigate the spatial relationships between the variables and landslides. 'The steps of the modelling were twofold. First, the factors were optimised by SAE to reduce information redundancy and correlation in the data. Second, RGF was used to create landslide susceptibility maps with the optimised feature representations. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to assess the predictive ability of the proposed models. Experimental results show that the proposed SAE-RGF outperforms the RGF and random forest (RF) models in terms of prediction rate and is less sensitive to overfitting and underfitting. The highest prediction rate (AUROC = 0.892) was obtained with only seven features by the SAE-RGF model, which is better than the two other methods (RGF and RF). The unsupervised factor optimisation approach not only reduces computation time but also improves the prediction accuracy of tree based models, including RGF. The generated landslide susceptibility maps can be implemented to mitigate landslide hazards and to designate land use by stakeholders (e.g. planners and engineers).

AB  - Although complex cooccurrence patterns have been described for microbes in natural communities, these patterns have scarcely been interpreted in the context of ecosystem functioning and stability. Here we constructed networks from species cooccurrences between pairs of microorganisms which were extracted from five individual aquatic time series, including a dystrophic and a eutrophic lake as well as an open ocean site. The resulting networks exhibited higher clustering coefficients, shorter path lengths, and higher average node degrees and levels of betweenness than those of random networks. Moreover, simulations demonstrated that taxa with a large number of cooccurrences and placement at convergence positions in the network, so-called "hubs" and "bottlenecks," confer resistance against random removal of "taxa." Accordingly, we refer to cooccurrences at convergence positions as system-relevant interdependencies, as they, like hubs and bottlenecks, determine network topology. These topology features of the cooccurrence networks point toward microbial community dynamics being resistant over time and thus could provide indicators for the state of ecosystem stability.

AB  - Biological assessments have been used for decades to determine ecological conditions in aquatic environments, yet they have not been extensively applied in estuaries that serve as transition zones between freshwater and marine environments. We present the development and validation of a nekton (fish and selected macroinvertebrate) index for annual monitoring of ecosystem health in Tampa Bay, Florida. We relied on long-term fisheries independent monitoring data of the early recruit and juvenile life history stages of nekton in Florida's inshore waters. A set of metrics that included measures of abundance, species diversity, trophic structure, and taxa of commercial or recreational importance were explored, and a subset was selected via statistical models. Reference conditions specific to each season and management section of the bay were established from the long-term dataset. The final Tampa Bay Nekton Index included five metrics: the total number of taxa, the number of benthic taxa, the number of recreational/commercial fishery taxa, the number of feeding guilds, and the Shannon-Weiner diversity index. Nekton index scores were calculated for each sample and averaged by bay management section and year and then a "stoplight" color-coding system, based on quantiles, was used to group index scores for communication and management. In general, Tampa Bay's nekton community appears to be resistant to large-scale changes in functional structure. The index was sensitive to a prolonged red tide event but eventually returned to preperturbation levels, indicating nekton community resilience. This index will be incorporated into monitoring and managing strategies of the local estuary program. Because this index was developed specifically for Tampa Bay and relies on bay-specific reference conditions, the index cannot be directly applied to other systems, but the methodology is transferrable so similar indices could be developed for other ecosystems with long-term monitoring data. Furthermore, using regional data, the index could be expanded/developed to assess health status among estuaries to inform decisions on prioritization of limited resources.

The progress achieved in restoring the Tampa Bay ecosystem over recent decades would not be possible without the steadfast commitments to routinely monitor and assess the Bay's condition. The Tampa Bay Estuary Program helped fund the analyses that developed the index and its staff was instrumental in decisions regarding communication of the index. TBEP funding for this project stems from EPA Section 320 Grant Funds, and the TBEP's local government partners (Hillsborough, Manatee, Pasco, and Pinellas Counties; the Cities of Clearwater, St. Petersburg, and Tampa; Tampa Bay Water; and the Southwest Florida Water Management District) through contributions to the TBEP's operating budget.

AB  - Background: A number of field studies have demonstrated that the yield potential of hybrid rice cultivars is higher than that of inbred cultivars, although the magnitude of difference between hybrid and inbred cultivars at different yield levels has not been described. The objective of this study is to compare the yield increase potential at different yield levels between hybrid and conventional rice. Ten field experiments were conducted at five locations in southern China in 2012 and 2013. At each location, two hybrid and two inbred cultivars were grown at three N levels: high (225 kg/hm(2)), moderate (161-191 kg/hm(2)) and the control, zero N (0 kg/hm(2)).
   Results: Hybrid rice yielded approximately 8 % more grain than did inbred cultivars in Huaiji, Binyang and Haikou; approximately 7 % more in Changsha; and approximately 19 % more in Xingyi. The high grain yields observed for hybrid rice cultivars were attributed to high grain weight and biomass accumulation at maturity. On average, rice yields were approximately 6.0-7.5 t ha(-1) (medium yield) in Huaiji, Binyang and Haikou; approximately 9.0 t ha(-1) in Changsha (high yield); and approximately 12.0 t ha(-1) (super high yield) in Xingyi. The yield gaps among Huaiji, Binyang and Haikou and Changsha were attributed to the differences in spikelets m(-2) and biomass production, whereas the yield gap between Changsha and Xingyi was caused by the differences in grain-filling percentage, grain weight and harvest index. The differences in biomass production among sites were primarily due to variation in crop growth rate induced by varied temperatures and accumulative solar radiation.
   Conclusions: The yield superiority of hybrid rice was relatively small in comparison with that of inbred cultivars at medium and high yield levels, but the difference was large at super high yield levels. Improving rice yields from medium to high should focus on spikelets m-2 and biomass, whereas further improvement to super high level should emphasize on grain-filling percentage, grain weight and harvest index. Favorable environmental conditions are essential for high yields in hybrid rice.

T2  - SOIL SCIENCE

KW  - SOIL
AB  - Little information exists about the extent to which fixed ammonium in soils is released under conditions imposed during analyses that are bases of nitrogen availability indexes and under conditions of very low soil solution concentrations of ammonium and potassium. This information is needed because fixed ammonium constitutes a significant portion of the total N in many soils. In this study, 5 to 45% of the total N in 10 surface soils and 10 to 85% in their associated subsoils was fixed, representing from 45 to 1763 mg fixed ammonium-N kg-1. These agriculturally important U.S. soils, including Alfisols, Aridisols, Inceptisols, and Mollisols, were subjected to analytical procedures designed to provide chemical (i.e., autoclave-distillable N) and biological (i.e., aerobic and anaerobic N mineralization) indexes of available N. Results indicated only small fractions (generally <0.1) of the fixed ammonium were released using the indexes. Subsequent extractions of 168-day aerobic incubated samples with sodium tetraphenylboron, which precipitates soluble ammonium and potassium in the soil solution, resulted in most of the fixed ammonium being released in 7 days. Obviously, then, much of the fixed ammonium in soils is available in the absence of an ammonium/potassium blocking effect. Consequently, the degree to which plants can extract soil fixed ammonium will depend on the extent to which they lower ammonium and potassium concentrations in the vicinity of the roots and, thereby, remove the blocking effect. For soils containing high contents of fixed ammonium, additional information is now needed to establish the extent to which fixed ammonium is made available to crops so that appropriate accounting can be given to this source when calculating supplemental N needs.

AB  - In an estuary, large numbers of riparian wetlands have high conservation values, and it is essential for the conservation of these wetlands to assess their ecological conditions. A wetland zooplankton index (WZI) was modified to assess the ecological conditions of the riparian wetlands (both natural and constructed) of the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), including water quality, presence/absence of macrophytes, soil texture, wetland origin, wetland location and zooplankton distribution. A water quality index (WQI) is established to compare the accuracy of the WZI to conventional community indices. The results show that although some conventional community indices show no significant differences between natural and constructed riparian wetlands, significantly higher scores of WZI and WQI are found in the constructed riparian wetlands compared to the natural riparian wetlands. The results of a regression analysis with Pearson's correlations show that WZI was significantly correlated with the WQI compared with the conventional community indices. The results of this study indicate that the WZI can more accurately reflect the ecological conditions of wetlands than the conventional community indices. Although a better water quality (lower WQI value) is found in natural riparian wetlands than in the constructed riparian wetlands, the ecological conditions of natural riparian wetlands are significantly worse than those of constructed riparian wetlands, based on the scores of the WZI; these data suggest that the origin of the wetland may cause a deterioration in the water quality but is unlikely to cause a degradation of the wetlands. This study shows that the WZI is an effective tool to assess the ecological condition of the riparian wetlands and that it can be used to guide programs for the conservation, restoration and the construction of wetland networks in the estuary.

AB  - We developed a fish index of biotic integrity (FIBI) to evaluate the relationship between urbanization and fish assemblages. The FIBI was developed with data collected from 70 sites in 30 basins and tested with a validation data set from 71 sites in 18 basins within the greater Lake Washington watershed. Fish assemblage data were evaluated at each site according to species-specific attributes and the level of human disturbance (total impervious area [TIA], impervious and vegetative coverage, mixed development, and road density) within each sampling basin. In this study TIA proved to be the most useful measure of urbanization. Approximately 50 metrics were evaluated and six were included in the final FIB] based on their response to urbanization. Each metric was scored according to standardized criteria, and the scores of all of the metrics were summed to create a final index score for each sampling location. A relationship between FIBI and TIA was expected, prompting the use of linear regression as a tool to evaluate the FIBI against five disturbance measures; correlation coefficients ranged from 0.13 to 0.68, with an overall trend of decreasing biotic integrity with increasing urbanization. Comparisons of data collected over a 10-year period from the same sampling locations demonstrated decreases in biotic integrity at most sites corresponding with an observed increase in urbanization. The FIBI developed in this study can serve as a useful management tool (in conjunction with other indicators of the condition of fish communities across Puget Sound lowland streams) as well as a metric with which to describe conditions to the public in an easily understood manner.

AB  - Relationship between priority heavy metal (Zn, Cu, Ni, Cr, Pb, Cd) concentration in water, their content in main body tissues (gills, liver, kidneys and muscle) and condition parameters [condition factor (CF), branchio-, hepato-, reno- and viscero-somatic indices (BSI, HSI, RSI and VSI), respectively] of Atlantic salmon smolts at the same age (1+ year) in two hydrologically similar but of different pollution level salmonid rivers of Lithuania (Vilnia and Siesartis) was investigated. Evident relation between heavy metal concentration in site water and fish tissue levels was determined. The well-being of fish from unpolluted site was significantly higher in comparison with those from polluted site: their CF and VSI were lower, while BSI was higher (had enlarged gills) indicating toxic effects of pollution. Condition factor was the most informative among parameters studied, followed by BSI and VSI, which could be successfully used in the monitoring of young Atlantic salmon river population state and environmental risk assessment.

AB  - Three field experiments comparing bread wheats representing different eras of genetic improvement in the Mediterranean area of Spain (one landrace, seven cultivars released since 1950 and two advanced breeding lines) were carried out at the province of Lleida (Catalonia, north-eastern Spain). Experiments were conducted during the 2004/05, 2005/06 and 2006/07 growing seasons at Gimenells and during 2005/06 at Foradada in order to quantify gains in yield, and in its physiological determinants, during much of the last century. At Gimenells, the first two seasons were conducted under relatively high-yielding backgrounds (Gimenells, irrigated) and in the last season under moderately stressed conditions (Gimenells. rainfed), while at Foradada the experiment was conducted under a severely stressed low-yielding environment. For almost all the traits analyzed in this paper, there were only significant differences when cultivars were grown under relatively high-yielding environments. In this conditions, grain yield increased with the year of release of the cultivars from 1940 to the 1970s, with no clear further improvements thereafter. On the other hand, total biomass did not show any association with the year of release of the cultivars. Results showed that, even when breeding was performed under Mediterranean conditions, harvest index was the main attribute responsible for yield improvements. Stem height was linearly and negatively related with harvest index, implying a marked height reduction until the 1970s, with no clear further reductions thereafter. while average grain weight did not exhibit any clear trend In general yield was lineally and positively associated with number of grains per m(2), with the year of release of the cultivars. The increase in number of grains was more associated with that in grains per spike than with differences in spikes per m(2). Finally, the increase in number of grains per m(2) was associated with both number of grains per unit of spike dry weight at anthesis, or "fruiting efficiency", and spike dry weight at anthesis.

AB  - An analytical model is presented for nonlinear vibration analysis of variable thickness, thin isotropic and functionally graded rectangular micro-plate containing a partial crack located within the centre line of the plate. Linear and parabolic thickness variation is considered in one or both the in-plane directions of the plate. The thickness variation is such that the volume of the plate is equal to that of the uniform thickness plate. The continuous line crack is parallel to one of the edges of the plate. The equations of motion are derived using the equilibrium principle based on Classical Plate Theory while the size effect is incorporated using the modified couple stress theory. The partial crack is represented by bending moment and in-plane force according to the simplified line spring model. The effect of in-plane forces is considered by employing the Berger's formulation. The derived governing equation is converted into a cubic nonlinear Duffing equation by employing Galerkin's method. The effect of nonlinearity is established by deriving the frequency response equation for the cracked variable thickness plate using the method of multiple scales. The nonlinear frequency response curves show the phenomenon of bending hardening or softening. The influence of crack length, crack location, internal material length scale parameter, boundary conditions, gradient index, unidirectional and bidirectional taper constant on the fundamental frequency of square plate is demonstrated. Similar to uniform thickness plate, it is found that the presence of crack affects the vibration characteristics of variable thickness plate. When compared to uniform thickness plate, the effect of crack can be reduced by varying the thickness of the plate. Thus, it is concluded that in a given volume, it is better to employ variable thickness plate as far as the vibration characteristics are considered.

AB  - Especially in local areas, the formation of different soils on the same parent material is closely related to the topographic position, which has an important effect on the morphological, mineralogical, biological, and weathering processes of soils. Because, topography affects the distancing of water and other materials from the soil or addition of soil. Besides mineralogical and geochemical events occurring due to topographic change in soils with different development levels on basalt parent material under semitemperate ecological conditions, the purpose of this study is to examine the changes in the biological properties of soils with microbial biodiversity that affect these changes. For this purpose, six soil profiles representing high land plateau, high land back slope, low land plateau, low land back slope, toe slope, and foot slope were examined, which show distribution on the section in the South-North direction on basalt parent material of Engiz cayi Basin, Turkey. Since soils formed on high slope land have poor profile development, they are described as young soils and classified in the Entisolls, and others are classified in Inceptisol and Vertisolls according to their horizon developments. pH values of surface horizons of all profiles range between 6.74 and 8.28, while organic matter values range from 1.54 to 3.53%. Although the dominant clay mineral is Smectite especially in surface soils, kaolinite clay mineral is also available in Entisol soils. Soil weathering rates are generally between very little weathering and moderate weathering, and Base/R2O3 values are determined between 0.5 and 1.3. Besides, it was determined that fungi has the most diversity among microorganisms of soil formed on basalt and actinobacterium varieties have the most diversity according to bacillus groups. Moreover, in this study, it has been determined that the isolated Actinobacteria members have gene regions that synthesize molecules called siderophores. This case has also been proposed as evidence that Actinobacteria members contribute to soil formation processes.

AB  - This study characterizes the macrobenthic gradients in Ria de Aveiro, Western Portugal. Ria de Aveiro is the meeting place of a number of river basins, resulting in a transition system of complex geometry, with channels running parallel to the coast line, north and south of the entrance, but also inland, creating an intricate system of navigation channels, islands and intertidal sand and mudflats. This renders unique characteristics to this system within the framework of transitional waters. The study was based on the analysis of samples from 248 sites, covering the full salinity gradient and the entire channel system. A total of 120 taxa in more than 76,350 specimens were identified. The most abundant and frequent taxa were all annelids, namely Alkmaria romijni, Streblospio shrubsolii, Tharyx sp., Tubificoides benedii, Nereis diversicolor, Capitella sp., Pygospio elegans, Polydora ligni and an unidentified oligochaete. The spatial distribution of the fauna was found to be mainly related to hydrodynamics and the salinity gradient, whereas sediment grain-size characteristics were much less important. Shear stress, flux, current velocity, salinity and sediment redox potential were the environmental variables which best related to the biological data. Benthic assemblages succeed from the euhaline pole, at the entrance, to the limnetic poles, located in the inner parts of the channels. In this succession, mean abundance increased from the outward to the inward assemblages but species richness and diversity were higher in intermediate assemblages. These descriptors decrease abruptly in the limnetic areas. Using the M-AMBI index, the ecological quality of Ria de Aveiro revealed moderate, poor and bad status. However, the ecological status spatial trend closely followed the benthic assemblages succession, their species richness and diversity, indicating the need for proper reference conditions and inter-calibration exercises in the transition waters before final assessment and conclusions about the use of such indices may be drawn.

AB  - The research shows that the southwest highland area of China along the rivers is the inhabited area of ethnic minorities, and the sustainable development of the water ecological environment in the southwest mountainous area is inseparable from the excellent river ecology and ethnic culture. Based on the concept of water resources ecology and sustainable development, and on the basis of analyzing the characteristics of ecological development of rivers in southwest mountainous areas, this paper selects typical river sections and establishes an ecological evaluation system of river flow. At the same time, the spatial auto-correlation distance of different indicators was studied by using GIS software, and the spatial correlation of different factors was determined. Finally, the function index and leading index of water ecosystem in southwest mountain area were determined. At last, according to the spatial superposition method of argis10.0, the boundary of a single indicator grid is modified to determine the functional level and regional test of water ecological change in southwest mountain area. With the rapid development of China's economy, the problem of environmental pollution is becoming more and more serious. More and more people are concerning about their own living conditions and their families' living conditions. The discharge of pollutants from rivers in southwest mountainous areas poses a threat to the country's fragile water environment. Therefore, we must strictly abide by environmental laws and regulations, monitor the water quality of river basins in real time, and take necessary measures to prevent water environmental pollution. In this paper, the GIS software system technology is used to study the changes of water ecological environment and environmental detection in the southwest mountain area of China, and an important research on the water quality detection and water ecological detection management of rivers in the southwest mountain area is designed.

AB  - A major goal of the national aquatic surveys being, conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency in partnership with the states and tribes is to assess the relative importance, at a regional scale, of stressors that impact aquatic biota. The Wadeable Streams Assessment (WSA) was a prototype of these surveys, and it assessed 8 individual water-chemistry, physical-habitat, and landuse stressors in 2 ways. First, the WSA estimated the total length of streams in a region that was deemed to be in poor condition for each stressor considered separately Estimates of stressor extent describe the prevalence and regional breadth of each stressor's potential effects. Second, the WSA estimated each stressor's relative risk, a measure widely used in human epidemiology. Relative risk estimates a stressor's association with biota in terms of the likelihood that poor stressor conditions and poor biota conditions co-occur ill a region's streams. We describe how the population attributable risk, also borrowed from epidemiology, combines extent and relative risk into a single, overall measure of a stressor's regional effect. The attributable risk of a stressor is the % reduction in the regional extent of poor biological condition (measured here by the macroinvertebrate index of biotic integrity [MIBI]), that presumably would result from eliminating that stressor. Under the attributable risk assumptions, for example, the WSA data imply that the nationwide extent of poor MIBI conditions would be reduced by all estimated 26% if excess total P were eliminated as a stressor, but only by 3% if excess salinity were eliminated. We also illustrate the attributable risk for the combined effects of multiple, correlated stressors. Last, we discuss how best to interpret and apply attributable risk estimates.

AB  - The impacts of grazing animals on the carbon balance of grasslands globally can potentially impact atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and soil carbon stocks. In this study, we measured net ecosystem CO2 exchange (F-N) for two periods with contrasting environmental variables, in early and late summer. We used a closed dynamic chamber system for continuous measurements of the components of F-N (gross canopy photosynthesis, A, and ecosystem respiration, R-E, and its components: above-ground plant respiration, R-L and soil respiration, R-S). We calculated an empirical phytomass index (calculated P-i) from continuous measurements of F-N to account for variability in above-ground biomass following grazing events. In addition, we developed a model for the phytomass index from environmental variables (modelled P-i'). Then, using cross validations, we tested the efficacy of calculated P-i and modelled P-i' in improving environmental models for F-N and its components. Grazing events affected A and R-L significantly but did not result in changes in R-S. Inclusion of the phytomass index (either calculated or modelled) increased the predictive performances of the models for A and R-L, but not for R-S. For both measurement periods, the ecosystem was a sink of CO2 with mean +/- standard error (SE) rates of net uptake of 1.88 +/- 0.23 and 1.47 +/- 0.69 g C m(-2) d(-1) for the periods in early summer and in late summer, respectively. Overall, F-N was poorly described by the models when the phytomass indices were not included. Estimates of F-N using either the calculated or the modelled phytomass index over both periods were not significantly different from the measured values. We showed that the use of a modelled phytomass index can account for the effects of grazing well, and can be used to improve models to predict F-N and the carbon balance for grazed grasslands under different climatic conditions and management practices.

AB  - An adaptation of the Drivers-Pressure-State-Impact-Response methodology is presented in this work. The differential DPSIR (Delta DPSIR) was developed to evaluate impacts on the coastal environment and as a tool for integrated ecosystem management. The aim of the Delta DPSIR is to provide scientifically-based information required by managers and decision-makers to evaluate previously adopted policies, as well as future response scenarios. The innovation of the present approach is to provide an explicit link between ecological and economic information related to the use and management of a coastal ecosystem within a specific timeframe. The application of Delta DPSIR is illustrated through an analysis of developments in a Southwest European coastal lagoon between 1985 and 1995. The value of economic activities dependent on the lagoon suffered a significant reduction (ca. -60%) over that period, mainly due to a decrease in bivalve production. During that decade the pressures from the catchment area were managed (ca. 176 million Euros), mainly through the building of waste water treatment plants. Notwithstanding this, the ecosystem state worsened with respect to abnormal clam mortalities due to a parasite infection and to benthic eutrophication symptoms in specific problematic areas. The negative economic impacts during the decade were estimated between -565 and -315 million Euros, of which 9-49% represent the cost of environmental externalities. Evaluation of these past events indicates that future management actions should focus on reducing the limitation on local clam seeds, which should result in positive impacts to both the local socio-economy and biodiversity.

AB  - We describe a simple empirical modeling approach for determining least-disturbed conditions for the great rivers of the Upper Mississippi River basin: Missouri, Upper Mississippi, and Ohio Rivers. We used multivariate analysis to identify reference strata (reaches for which a single reference expectation was appropriate) on each river. Strata included the Upper Missouri, Lower Missouri, impounded Upper Mississippi, unimpounded Upper Mississippi, and the Ohio River. We created a multimetric stressor gradient for each stratum using a suite of site- and landscape-scale metrics. Site-scale metrics included water chemistry, aquatic and riparian habitat, and human disturbance metrics. Landscape-scale metrics included land use, land cover, and proximity to human disturbance. The gradient was scaled from 0 (least stressed) to 1 (most stressed). Multimetric indices of condition based on fish assemblages for the Lower Missouri and Upper Mississippi River were responsive to stressor gradients based on 18-24 abiotic stressor metrics. Ohio River fish assemblages were responsive to a hand-picked three-metric gradient. We used the y-intercept of quantile regression to predict the fish index value for a stressor gradient value of 0 (the fish index value at a site with the lowest mean stressor gradient score in the reference stratum) which we designated as least-disturbed condition for the fish index for that stratum. We trisected the difference between predicted least-disturbed condition (ceiling value) and a floor value set at the 5th percentile of the sample to create thresholds for three condition classes: least-disturbed, intermediate, and most-disturbed. Based on the derived condition class thresholds for the fish index, 10% (by length) of the Lower Missouri was in least-disturbed condition, compared to 14% of the Ohio River and 19% of the impounded Upper Mississippi River. The index of condition exhibited longitudinal variation that was associated with the location of major urban areas along each river. We conclude that empirical modeling based on an abiotic stressor gradient can provide an alternative approach for deriving internal reference expectations for great rivers with few, if any, minimally disturbed sites.

AB  - The present study aimed to clarify whether a kinesthetic illusion arises in our experimental condition (visual stimulus) and whether corticomotor excitability changes in parallel with the kinesthetic illusion. The visual stimulus was a movie in which someone else's limb was being moved. The computer screen showing the movie was installed at an appropriate portion of the subject's forearm, so that the performer's hand appeared as if it were the subject's hand (illusion). The experience of kinesthetic illusion under this condition was verified by interview using a visual analog scale. Healthy male subjects participated in this experiment. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied to induce motorevoked potential (MEP) from the first dorsal interosseous and abductor digiti minimi muscle. Each subject was instructed to watch the same computer display shown as in the illusion, with his own stationary hand in full view (non-illusion) and to watch a display of non-biological movement (moving text) (sham) as the control conditions. The present results showed significant facilitation of MEP under the illusion compared with the control conditions for the index finger abducting in the movie, although not for adducting. MEP in the abductor digiti minimi showed no change during either abduction or adduction of the little finger. The present study demonstrated that an illusion of self-motion can be created by a video of a moving abstract index finger, and inputs to the corticomotor pathways during the self-motion illusion facilitated the corticomotor excitability. The excitatory effect of the illusion depended on the movement direction of the index finger. (c) 2007 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Benthic organisms and their communities are key components of estuarine systems. We provide an overview of the biology and key ecological features of benthic communities of York River Estuary (YRE), which is the site of the Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve in Virginia (CBNERRVA). Major subtidal benthic habitats in YRE include soft mud and sand bottoms, with only limited distribution of submerged aquatic vegetation and oyster shell. Major taxonomic groups of macrofauna dominating muds and sands of YRE include annelids, molluscs and crustaceans; similar to those found in other temperate estuaries or the US Mid-Atlantic. Meiofaunal assemblages of YRE soft bottoms are dominated by nematodes and copepods. Species distribution patterns in YRE are strongly correlated with salinity and bottom type, while other factors such as eutrophication and hypoxia may be growing in importance. Much of the YRE benthos fails to meet the restoration goals set by the Chesapeake Bay, Program. The poor condition of the benthos is expressed as low biomass and abundance and may be associated with degraded water quality, hypoxia and sediment disturbance processes. No comprehensive inventory of the benthic biota of the CBNERRS sites is available, which will make it difficult to assess future changes due to human impacts such as climate change or the introduction of exotic species. Given this paucity of data, a systemic cataloging of the benthic resources of the reserve sites and any potential invasive species is a much needed avenue of future research for CBNERRVA.

TI  - Survey techniques for freshwater streams on oceanic islands: Important design considerations for the PABITRA project
T2  - PACIFIC SCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - Fundamental differences in life history patterns of most indigenous freshwater stream species on oceanic islands and freshwater species in continental stream systems require important differences in design of appropriate aquatic survey methodologies. As an example of these issues, use of Instream Flow Incremental Methodology (IFIM) and the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) for describing island stream conditions are examined. Designed mainly for identifying optimal flow for salmonid fishes in the western United States, IFIM is difficult to apply to Hawaiian streams because of frequent flash floods in the Islands and because of the inherent difficulty of relating observed fish densities to total usable habitat in island streams. IBIS have been applied widely on the United States mainland as a technique for determining the health of a stream and aiding in stream fish conservation and management. Recently, there has been an attempt to establish an IBI for Hawaiian streams. Application of this technique to oceanic island streams raises a number of serious questions about the IBI's validity for use in Hawaiian streams. Potential problems are inherent in the basic assumptions of the IBI. They result in unintended consequences when applied to oceanic island streams; examples include erroneously attributing naturally occurring differences in observed fish assemblages to human-induced environmental change, not accommodating differences in closed and open system dynamics linked to life cycles of indigenous stream species, and not understanding implications of low-diversity environments typical of remote oceanic islands. Past research on Hawaiian streams supports use of appropriate survey and analysis techniques such as those developed for the Pacific-Asia Biodiversity Transect (PABITRA) for use among islands of the tropical Pacific.

AB  - Land use/land cover classifications for 1973 and 1991, derived from the interpretation of satellite imagery, are quantified on the basis of biophysical land units in a study area in southeastern Australia. Nutrient export potentials are estimated for each land unit based on their composition of land use/land cover classes. Spatial and temporal comparisons are made or the land units based on the calculated pollution hazard indicators to provide an insight into changes in the state of the environment and the regional significance of land use changes. For example, one ecosystem, unique to the study, showed a large increase in pollution hazard over the study period as a manifestation of an 11-fold rise in cleared area and an expansion of cropping activities. The benefits to environmental management in general are discussed.

TI  - Framework for Buddhist Environmentalism: The Horizontal and Vertical Dimensions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUDDHIST THOUGHT & CULTURE
LA  - English
KW  - Buddhism
KW  - Buddhist Environmentalism
KW  - Religious Environmentalism
KW  - Environmental Crisis
AB  - Resorting to Buddhism to advance a form of religious environmentalism has been done by many scholars both from inside and outside the tradition because Buddhism holds a worldview and a number of teachings often perceived as environmentally friendly. This paper contributes to this effort by proposing a framework that is faithful to the Buddhist pedagogical approach. It asserts that this approach comprises two overarching and integral dimensions-a horizontal (relational) and a vertical (developmental) dimension. In establishing Buddhist environmentalism, the horizontal dimension is employed to assess the root cause of the environmental crisis and the state of human-nature relationship. The horizontal dimension also helps to provide a corrective to the abnormalities in this relationship is proposing a vision of harmonious human-nature relationship characterized by solidarity, responsibility, accountability, service and gratitude. These relationships can be established by resorting to Buddhist cosmogony and fundamental teachings such as the Principle of Dependent Origination and the Three Characteristics of Existence. The vertical dimension constitutes the prescriptive aspect of Buddhist environmentalism, which insists that self-cultivation aimed at emancipation from mundane existence is part and parcel of the effort to promote self and environmental well-being. It asserts that human-nature relationship must be added to the total number of relationships in one's life, and it must be held in view in the process of self-cultivation so that it becomes an indicator of a person's spiritual progress. Virtues such as loving kindness, gentleness, moderation and generosity developed through the Noble Eightfold Path not only go towards promoting interpersonal relationship but also promote environmental well-being and flourishing. Consequently, this paper is critical of any Buddhist environmentalism that fails to give due attention to both dimensions, and it emphasizes that both the relational and developmental dimensions must be held in balance in order for a genuine Buddhist environmentalism to be possible.

AB  - We characterized coldwater stream fish community response to habitat degradation and channelization for agriculture. Coldwater streams are not common in the lower midwestern United States, and these streams differ from warmwater streams with respect to their diversity and community response to degradation. Six sites were sampled on the coldwater Mac-o-chee Creek in Ohio. Three reaches were classified as geomorphically constrained (by a roadway) and three as recovering (unconstrained and not channelized or cleaned for more than 100 y). Within each reach 31 mesohabitat units were sampled and were delineated as riffles, runs, or pools. Our goals were: (1) to examine how habitat and geomorphic impairment influences the abundance and community structure of coldwater fishes; and (2) to test whether the constraints on recovery from channelization were more influential in structuring communities than mesohabitat types. Our hypothesis was that we would find lower species diversity overall in the recovering sites because they would be more indicative of a coldwater fauna. In contrast, we hypothesized that the sites that are not able to recover (geomorphically constrained) would be more indicative of a warmwater fauna, and thus more diverse. We found lower species abundances, diversity, and species richness in recovering stream reaches than impaired reaches. Mesohabitat types present are influenced by channelization and recovery but, are also largely a product of geomorphologic setting of the study streams. The effects of habitat degradation on the biota and the resulting trophic structure are important for designing restoration targets for coldwater systems, which may be naturally less diverse than warmwater counterparts. For example, biometric scores like Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) are often used as restoration targets, but this would be inappropriate unless a coldwater-specific IBI were used.

AB  - Effects of land use changes on chemical soil properties were studied in a southern alpine valley of Ticino, Switzerland by analysing three different land cover-topography units: (i) natural forested slopes (NFS); (ii) deforested, cultivated terraces (DCT), and (iii) reforested, abandoned terraces (RAT). Whereas NFS represents the natural reference state with negligible anthropogenic influence, DCT corresponds to intense agricultural utilization, and RAT refers to a post-cultural natural evolution after terrace cultivation. Land use-induced changes in vegetation cover and topography (i.e., terracing) had a clear influence on chemical soil properties. 'Ihe presence or absence of the European chestnut (Castanea .sativa Mill.), one of the main soil acidifying agents in the study area, clearly affected soil acidity, soil organic matter (SOM), and nutrient status. Compared to the vegetation change, terracing has a less obvious effect on soil chemistry. A greater effective rooting depth and a flat microtopography on terraces lead to a rapidly increased SOM accumulation due to better growing conditions for trees. Thus, the reforested, abandoned terraces develop peculiar soil chemistry conditions after 36 to 46 years of abandonment only.

AB  - Freshwater ecosystems are continuously affected by anthropogenic pressure. One of the main sources of contamination comes from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents that contain wide range of micro- and macropollutants. Chemical composition, toxicity levels and impact of treated effluents (TEs) on the recipient aquatic ecosystems may strongly differ depending on the wastewater origin. Compared to urban TEs, hospital ones may contain more active pharmaceutical substances. Benthic diatoms are relevant ecological indicators because of their high species and ecological diversity and rapid response to human pressure. They are routinely used for water quality monitoring. However, there is a knowledge gap on diatom communities' development and behavior in treated wastewater in relation to prevailing micro- and macropollutants. In this study, we aim to (1) investigate the response of diatom communities to urban and hospital TEs, and (2) evaluate TEs effect on communities in the recipient river. Environmental biofilms were colonized in TEs and the recipient river up- and downstream from the WWTP output to study benthic diatoms using DNA metabarcoding combined with high-throughput sequencing (HTS). In parallel, concentrations of nutrients, pharmaceuticals and seasonal conditions were recorded. Diatom metabarcoding showed that benthic communities differed strongly in their diversity and structure depending on the habitat. TE sites were generally dominated by few genera with polysaprobic preferences belonging to the motile guild, while river sites favored diverse communities from oligotrophic and oligosaprobic groups. Seasonal changes were visible to lower extent. To categorize parameters important for diatom changes we performed redundancy analysis which suggested that communities within TE sites were associated to higher concentrations of beta-blockers and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in urban effluents vs. antibiotics and orthophosphate in hospital effluents. Furthermore, indicator species analysis showed that 27% of OTUs detected in river downstream communities were indicator for urban or hospital TE sites and were absent in the river upstream. Finally, biological diatom index (BDI) calculated to evaluate the ecological status of the recipient river suggested water quality decrease linked to the release of TEs. Thus, in-depth assessment of diatom community composition using DNA metabarcoding is proposed as a promising technique to highlight the disturbing effect of pollutants in Alpine rivers.

AB  - When reviewing the various fish-based community indicators aiming at assessing the ecological status of marine communities and/or ecosystems, a typology consisting of three major components emerges. The first component highlights the choice of relevant metrics associated with a level of organization (e. g. population or community). The second relies on the method used to combine the metrics (an aggregated indicator or a synoptic table). The third refers to the type of analysis (direct or indirect) that is used to establish the link between the metrics and a given pressure. In this paper we use the Vilaine coastal-estuarine fish communities as a case study to discuss and relate two different approaches to the suggested typology. The first approach (time-trend approach) is based on historical series of data, whereas the second approach (multi-metric index, MMI) is based on a geographic series including various French estuaries. They were developed or adapted from French studies but are representative of the approaches used in Europe. When applied to the case study, they differed in their diagnosis: the time-trend approach indicated that the bay of Vilaine habitat was deteriorating, whereas the MMI, which compares many French estuaries, indicated a good environmental state. Differences and complementarities between the approaches are thoroughly discussed with respect to the three mains components of the typology. This work appears at a particular moment, when several fish-based indicators are being developed in France and the rest of Europe. It intends to serve as an element of the ongoing reflection concerning the limitations of the various approaches that can be used to develop such indicators.

AB  - Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) is cultivated across a wide range of environments ranging from extremely stressful to favourable. The objective of this research was to compare methods to identify productive cultivars for stress and non-stress conditions. Thirty pearl millet cultivars were evaluated at 22 locations that were grouped as stress, non-stress, or intermediate environments. Five selection indices viz., arithmetic mean (AM), geometric mean (GM), AM (standard units), stress susceptibility index (S) and drought response index (DRI) were calculated for each genotype to determine correlation between selection indices and yield under stress (Y-S), non-stress (Y-NS), and average conditions (Y-AV) Both cultivars and locations were significant sources of variation. Phenology of cultivars had different influence on yielding ability in contrasting environments. While earliness was advantageous for stress conditions, cultivars with longer duration tended to yield more under non-stress conditions. Y-S was only moderately determined by Y-NS Both AM and GM were suitable indices for selection of cultivars that would perform well across stress, non-stress, and intermediate environments. Stress susceptibility index (S) was negatively correlated with Y-S (r = -0.62**) but should only be used as a selection criterion in combination with yield under stress (Y-S) to identify cultivars adapted to stress environments. DRI was positively correlated with Y-S but had no association with Y-NS. Results indicated that DRI might be useful for identifying cultivars with high performance under stress particularly when days to Bower differ considerably among test entries.

AB  - Very few studies have focused on diatomaceous earth slopes along high-speed railways, and the special properties of diatomaceous earth under alternating dry and wet conditions are unknown. This paper studies diatomaceous earth in the Shengzhou area, through which the newly built Hangzhou-Taizhou high-speed railway passes, and the basic physical and hydraulic properties of diatomaceous earth are analyzed by indoor test methods. A convenient, efficient, and controllable high-speed railway slope artificial rainfall simulation system is designed, and in situ comprehensive monitoring and fissure observation are performed on site to analyze the changes in various diatomaceous soil slope parameters under rainfall infiltration, and to explore the cracking mechanisms of diatomaceous earth under alternating dry and wet conditions. The results indicate extremely poor hydrophysical properties of diatomaceous earth in the Shengzhou area; the disintegration resistance index values of natural diatomaceous earth samples subjected to dry and wet cycles are 1.8-5.6%, and the disintegration is strong. Comprehensive indoor tests and water content monitoring show that natural diatomaceous earth has no obvious influence when it contacts water, but it disintegrates and cracks under alternating dry and wet conditions. The horizontal displacement of both slope types mainly occurs within 0.75-2.75 m of the surface layer, indicating shallow surface sliding; after testing, natural slope crack widths of diatomaceous earth reach 10-25 mm, and their depths reach 40-60 cm. To guarantee safety during high-speed railway engineering construction, implementing proper protection for diatomaceous earth slopes is recommended.

AB  - Based on the geochemical elements Rb and Sr in sediments with three different grain size fractions from profile H3 on the northern lacustrine bottomland 13 m above the Huangqihai Lake surface in 1986, the paper investigates the record of palaeolake stand state, sedimentary environmental evolution, and winter monsoon change. First, these samples are separated into three different grain size fractions, i.e., total sediments, 77-20 pm and <20 mu m. Second, the chemical elements-Rb and Sr-of the grain size separation were tested and analyzed systematically in this paper. Then the elements compositions of these samples are measured using VP-320 mode fluorescence spectrum instrument, respectively. The magnetic susceptibility of these samples is measured using Kappabridge KLY-3 mode instrument made in Czech AGICO Company. The results showed the elements and the ratios varied regularly with the grain size. But the ratio of Rb/Sr in the sediments <20 pm correlates positively with the magnetic susceptibility of these samples. Therefore, the ratio of Rb/Sr in the fraction <20 pm from the lake sediments reflected the strengthening of the weathering in the deposition sites. It is a good indicator of the summer monsoon-induced weathering and pedogenesis fluctuations and can be used to reconstruct the conditions of the paleoclimate and paleoenvironment.

AB  - The degradation of freshwater ecosystems can be attributed to stressors associated with the increased demand for water and other aquatic resources. Freshwater ecosystems face such challenges in supporting agriculture, industry, and high-density urban areas in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province, South Africa. In this study, the presence of fish species and their abundance was quantified at 40 sites in KZN on 16 major rivers systems. Surveys were done during a drought period between February 2015 and April 2016, as part of the River Health Programme, a national river monitoring assessment. The Fish Response Assessment Index (FRAI) was used to evaluate the condition of the sites, and redundancy analysis was used to evaluate the habitat, water quality and fish community relationships. The FRAI scores showed four sites to be in a 'Seriously Modified' condition. These areas were associated with intensive agricultural activities and urban environments. The presence of invasive fish species, abstraction and industrial use all had negative impacts on the ecological state of the rivers. When compounded by excessive water use, the drought resulted in poor fish community integrity, highlighting the vulnerability of fish communities in this region. The absence or low abundances of some indigenous fish alongside the high presence of invasive fish requires additional investigation. Results highlight the importance of mitigation measures against anthropogenic impacts should be enforced to ensure sustainable use of KZN water resources.

AB  - The Laguna Brava Nature Reserve is a stressful habitat in the Andean Mountains (Argentina) dominated by extreme abiotic factors: high altitude and UV radiance, hypersalinity, alkalinity, and high concentrations of toxic elements in the soil. The sparse native vegetation that inhabits Laguna Brava and Mulas Muertas wetlands is frequently colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. It is, however, unknown which AM species can survive in such a harsh environment and how those environmental conditions influence the AM communities. To answer these questions, 454-amplicon pyrosequencing and morphological (based on spore traits) approaches were used to assess fungal diversity. A total of 23 molecular operational taxonomic units and 14 distinct morphospecies of AM fungi were identified. The morphological characterization of AM fungal communities in Laguna Brava and Mulas Muertas, supported by the molecular data, revealed that Glomeraceae and Claroideoglomeraceae were the dominant families, confirming the predominance of generalist and ruderal AM fungal taxa but with stress-tolerant life history traits. Our results showed that the presence of AM fungi is strongly associated with local environmental variations in Laguna Brava (hypersalinity and high Na+, Sr, As and U contents in soils). The AM fungal communities in Laguna Brava and Mulas Muertas wetlands were similar according to the Simpson diversity index and the ecological distance estimated by Bray Curtis index. These results were also supported by the environmental parameters measured, as they did not vary between the studied sites. This study represents the first characterization of AM fungal community in a high-altitude Andean wetland in Argentina, improving our knowledge about these fungi from extreme environments.

AB  - Controversy surrounds the measurement of competition intensity. Moreover, when biomass varies systematically along productivity and other environmental gradients, common indices of competitive outcome mask important ecological interactions.
   This study presents two indices derived from how neighbours interact with target plants. The first, relative crowding, increases directly with the abundance of neighbours present and decreases inversely with the potential size and vigour of the target plant itself. The second, interaction strength, is the integral of suppression of the target by neighbours over the range of neighbour abundance. Relative crowding and interaction strength are derived independently, but when multiplied produce the commonly used relative competitive index, showing the biological underpinnings of the relative competition index in terms of crowding and strength of interaction. Since the new indices of relative crowding and interaction strength explicitly account for the amount of neighbour biomass, they serve as a valid method to track the effects of changing habitat conditions on the components of competition.
   The new indices are applied to three published data sets. In each case, relative crowding increased with standing crop. In one case competition was reported as unchanged along a productivity gradient, whereas the new indices show that relative crowding and interaction strength both had significant patterns, but their effects were counteracting. These results do not fit current theories of competition. Further empirical studies are needed to see if competition theory needs revision.
   Separating the mechanisms of competition into relative crowding and strength of interaction reveals previously hidden patterns that help bring to light underlying processes of competition along productivity gradients.

AB  - Drought is the mainly abiotic stress factor effect yield and quality. The research carried out in the experimental field of Trakya Agriculture Research Institute in 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 growing years. The research was set up with 15 genotypes in randomized completely blocks design in split plot with three replications. Drought treatments are placed on main parcel and genotypes on the sup-plot. Drought treatments were applied at various plant growth stages from shooting up to physiological maturating stage. Grain yield, biological yield, harvest index, number of spike per square meter, spikelet number per spike, number of grain per spike and length of spike and pairwise comparison were investigated among those characters. Drought stress had various impact on yield and yield component and there was various decreasing in grain yield in all genotypes depending upon drought stress application. Highest grain yield was obtained in Bereket cultivar with 658.3 kg da(-1). According to treatment the highest grain yield was determined with 763.8 kg da(-1) in non-stress condition. Under fully drought stress condition grain yield decreasing was 40.1%, under shooting stage of drought 28.0%, and during grain filling period of drought 26.2%. Drought stress on shooting stage more affected to grain yield than grain filling period. It was found positive and significant correlation between grain yields with biological yield, number of pike per square meter, number of grain per spike depending on drought stress increasing. Fully drought stress condition had significantly effect on biological yield and yield component followed by drought under shooting stage.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system with autoimmune nature that is typified by varying degrees of demyelination and axonal damage. Paeonol is an active ingredient in some medicinal plants with anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective property. This study was conducted to reveal whether paeonol can alleviate hippocampal demyelination and cognitive deficits in cuprizone-induced murine model of demyelination as a model of MS. C57BL/6 mice received oral cuprizone (400 mg/kg) for 6 weeks, and paeonol was administered p.o. at two doses of 25 or 100 mg/kg, starting from the second week post-cuprizone for 5 weeks. After assessment of learning and memory in different tasks, oxidative stress and inflammation were evaluated besides immunohistochemical assessment of hippocampal myelin basic protein (MBP). Paeonol (100 mg/kg) properly ameliorated cognitive deficits in Y maze, novel object discrimination (NOD) test, and Barnes maze with no significant improvement of performance in passive avoidance task. In addition, paeonol treatment at the higher dose was also associated with partial restoration of hippocampal level of oxidative stress and inflammatory markers including MDA, ROS, GSH, SOD, catalase, NF-kB, and TNF. Besides, paeonol improved MMP as an index of mitochondrial integrity and health and reduced MPO as a factor of neutrophil infiltration. Furthermore, paeonol treatment prevented hippocampal MBP immunoreactivity, indicating its prevention of demyelination. In conclusion, the current study showed the preventive effect of paeonol against cuprizone-induced demyelination and cognitive deficits through reversing most oxidative stress- and inflammation-related parameters in addition to its improvement of mitochondrial health.

AB  - Unravelling the effect of climate variability on species biology has been one of the main goals of ecological studies. Environmental factors such as river discharge and temperature have being proposed as triggers of reproductive cycle in fish. In temperate climates, fish reproduction is affected mainly by temperature, while is influenced by flood pulses in large tropical rivers. We evaluated the influence of temperature and river discharge as triggers of Iheringichthys labrosus' reproduction. We studied the following reproductive variables: gonadosomatic index (GSI), hepatosomatic index (HSI) and condition factor (K). Females of I. labrosus were examined in a time series of ten years along three sites located in Lower Uruguay River at the beginning (last week of November-first week of December, spring) and by the end of the reproductive period (middle-end of April, autumn). Generalised linear models detected a positive effect of mean winter temperature and site on the spring mature female GSI. Site was significant in addition to the interaction between temperature and site. Moreover, the effect of winter temperature was stronger than water discharge in triggering reproductive timing of I. labrosus, contrary to the model proposed for other species in tropical systems. Additionally, a literature review suggested a latitudinal gradient on reproduction, occurring earlier and prolonged with decreasing latitude (and increasing temperature). In this study, we stated the effect of temperature on the life history in a Neotropical fish using a multifaceted approach, particularly important in the current context of global climate warming.

AB  - Growing global demand and growth in oil production and refining lead to an increase in environmental pollution by waste from these industries. Huge territories of Kazakhstan are influenced by the activities of the oil and oil refining industries. The consequence of this is the deterioration of ecosystems in the oil-producing regions, the decline in biodiversity and deterioration of public health. In this regard, there is a need in an informative bioindicator for studying the state of ecosystems of oil producing regions. The aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of oil and petroleum products exposure on the function of thyroid gland in tadpoles of local amphibian species. The study revealed that chronic exposure to water-soluble fraction of oil, o-xylene or diesel fuel causes hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the thyroid follicular cells, a decrease in the colloid volume in the follicles, as well as a decrease in the content of thyroid hormones in the tadpoles of the marsh frog (Rana ridibunda) and green toad (Bufo viridis), which indicates a suppression of thyroid function.

AB  - Biological soil crusts are a key component of many dryland ecosystems. Following disturbance, biological soil crusts will recover in stages. Recently, a simple classification of these stages has been developed, largely on the basis of external features of the crusts, which reflects their level of development (LOD). The classification system has six LOD classes, from low (1) to high (6). To determine whether the LOD of a crust is related to its ecohydrological function, we used rainfall simulation to evaluate differences in infiltration, runoff, and erosion among crusts in the various LODs, across a range of soil depths and with different wetting pre-treatments. We found large differences between the lowest and highest LODs, with runoff and erosion being greatest from the lowest LOD. Under dry antecedent conditions, about 50% of the water applied ran off the lowest LOD plots, whereas less than 10% ran off the plots of the two highest LODs. Similarly, sediment loss was 400gm-2 from the lowest LOD and almost zero from the higher LODs. We scaled up the results from these simulations using the Rangeland Hydrology and Erosion Model. Modelling results indicate that erosion increases dramatically as slope length and gradient increase, especially beyond the threshold values of 10m for slope length and 10% for slope gradient. Our findings confirm that the LOD classification is a quick, easy, nondestructive, and accurate index of hydrological condition and should be incorporated in field and modelling assessments of ecosystem health.

AB  - Few attempts have been made to combine multimetric and multivariate analyses for bioassessment despite recognition that an integrated method could yield powerful tools for bioassessment. An approach is described that integrates eight macroinvertebrate community metrics into a Principal Components Analysis to develop a Multivariate Condition Score (MCS) from a calibration dataset of 511 samples. The MCS is compared to an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) derived using the same metrics based on the ratio to the reference site mean. Both approaches were highly correlated although the MCS appeared to offer greater potential for discriminating a wider range of impaired conditions. Both the MCS and IBI displayed low temporal variability within reference sites, and were able to distinguish between reference conditions and low levels of catchment modification and local habitat degradation, although neither discriminated among three levels of low impact. Pseudosamples developed to test the response of the metric aggregation approaches to organic enrichment, urban, mining, pastoral and logging stressor scenarios ranked pressures in the same order, but the MCS provided a lower score for the urban scenario and a higher score for the pastoral scenario. The MCS was calculated for an independent test dataset of urban and reference sites, and yielded similar results to the IBI. Although both methods performed comparably, the MCS approach may have some advantages because it removes the subjectivity of assigning thresholds for scoring biological condition, and it appears to discriminate a wider range of degraded conditions.

AB  - In the nontarget analysis, a maximum of organic substances was extracted by a sequence which separates high polar, medium polar, and nonpolar compounds. This leads to the detection of 477 different organic substances in the example of the groundwater contamination investigated. To reduce the high expense for an exact identification of 477 compounds as a first step the individual compound is defined as a data set of retention time and the mass spectrum belonging to this retention time. The table of data contains now 477 individual compounds in groundwater samples collected at 10 different locations. The application of mathematical filters helps to reduce the size of the data set. Graphical methods enable large amounts of data to be visualized in a clear manner and enable to detect patterns in a data set. These patterns are the key to select typical compounds as indicator substances for the contamination source as well as the geogenic background. Similarities between the groundwater samples should not be changed by selection of the indicator compounds. Therefore, cluster analysis was applied as a controlling instrument for the final selection of the indicator compounds.
   The combination of graphical and multivariate data analysis is a useful tool to deduce indicator compounds for monitoring and control of complex environmental pollution states.

AB  - This study clarifies the previously unknown limitations of the entropy-based land-use mix index and suggests conditions under which the index is valid. The land-use mix index has an n-shaped relationship to dependent variables, which was evidenced by this study, but previous studies have ignored the problem. This study identified a non-linear relationship between the land-use mix index and a common dependent variable of interest, pedestrian volume. Pedestrian volume is a common measure of the vitality of a district and/or a city and a major goal of urban design and regeneration. Using mathematical analysis, simulation, and empirical analysis, this study found that the land-use mix index had an inconsistent quadratic relationship to pedestrian volume. It was confirmed that an analytical model using the land-use mix index, and that index squared, should be used together when samples representative of entire cities are tested. Otherwise, in samples from predominantly residential areas, the land-use mix index positively relates to pedestrian volume, whereas, in predominantly commercial areas, it will be negative. Previous studies failed to observe the hidden side of the entropy-based land-use mix index in commercial areas because their focus was mainly on residential areas or residents. Future studies should clarify the logical and theoretical relationships between the index and the outcome variable of interest, review the characteristics of the data and, then, implement appropriate statistical analyses by being aware of the hidden side.

AB  - The EC Water Framework Directive (WFD) suggests using abundance and species composition of intertidal seaweed communities for ecological quality classification of rocky seashores. There are two difficulties with this. According to WFD all sensitive species should be present on a shore. There is no accepted list of sensitive seaweed species and those which may be sensitive in one location may not be so in another. Second, natural successions can result in very large abundance changes of common species, e.g. from almost completely fucoid-dominated shores to almost totally barnacle-dominated shores, without any change in ecological quality. Studies have shown that numerical species richness, not the list of actual species present, is broadly constant in the absence of disturbance. The ephemeral species, possibly the sensitive members of the community, change regularly in such a way as to conserve species richness. It is proposed that species richness on a defined length of shore be used as a criterion of ecological quality. A database of species found on over 300 shores in the British Isles, under strictly controlled sampling conditions, has given ranges of values of species richness to be expected and has allowed for variations in these values due to sub-habitat variability, wave exposure and turbidity to be factored in. A major problem in applying such a tool is the lack of expertise of many workers in critical identification of seaweed species. A reduced species list has been extracted from the database using species commonly present and identifiable with reasonable certainty. A numerical index of ecological quality is proposed based on scores for various aspects of the physical nature of the habitat combined with a score for species richness which may be based on the reduced species list. The scoring system also uses further aspects of community structure, such as ecological status groups and the proportions of rhodophyta, chlorophyta and opportunist species. For this system to be effective there has to be close control of the way in which sampling is carried out to ensure a uniform level of thoroughness. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sufficient energy reserves are crucial to the overwinter survival of northern non-hibernating mustelids. We sought a reliable index of body condition (fatness) in harvested populations of wolverine Gulo gulo, based on the relationship between fatness and the mass of distinct fat depots extractable by necropsy. Fatness did not differ significantly between genders or winter months, nor was it significantly related to body size or age. Using a first group of 18 males and 14 females, we developed predictive least-square linear regressions between fat depots (popliteal, sternal, omentum, mesenteric and perirenal) and fatness (g fat/100 g body mass) using skinned carcasses provided by fur trappers in the Yukon, Canada. Fatness was consistently better predicted in females than in males. Fatness was best predicted by the sternal fat depot (R-2=0.73) in males and by the omentum as well as sternal fat depots in females (R-2=0.94 and 0.87, respectively). We then compared known fatness and fatness predicted from regressions of the sternal fat depot using a second group of 14 males and nine females, and mean fatness did not differ significantly. We suggest that, due to its ease of extraction and predictive power, the sternal fat depot is a valid fat index with both sexes of wolverine, although it (or any other fat depot) should be used with caution with males, which seem more prone to obesity. This new index will help wildlife managers monitor changes in body condition of wolverines in response to changes in environmental conditions.

AB  - Despite their importance as water reservoirs and endemism hotspots, Paramos or tropical alpine ecosystems are threatened by global warming and anthropic activities. An important but often neglected component of paramo biodiversity are hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae), which play key roles in the provision of ecosystem services at high elevations where bee abundance decreases. We characterized the spatial distribution of Syrphidae diversity at two Paramo complexes to identify potential bioindicator species for montane habitats. We hypothesized that bioindicator species must be easily detected and exhibit affinity for a particular habitat when replacement between and/or within habitats tend to be strong. Twelve bimonthly samples of ten days were done at Santa-Ines-Belmira and Sonson Paramo complexes in Colombia, comprising 18 sampling stations distributed among three habitat types: paramo, forest, and grassland. Flies were collected using ground and canopy Malaise traps, colored pan-traps, and sweeping. We estimated alpha and beta diversity components within and between habitats. We identified potential bioindicator species based on exclusivity and fidelity criteria. We collected 2783 specimens belonging to 41 genera and 148 species. Paramo had the highest richness and number of collected specimens (110 species, 84% completeness percentage, n = 1878), followed by forest (88 species, 65%, n = 357), and grassland (59 species, 80%, n = 571). Species replacement was the dominant component of incidence-based beta diversity. The similar contribution of nestedness and turnover between paramo and grassland reinforces the hypothesis that grassland communities may represent disturbed paramo. We propose eleven genera and fourteen species as bioindicators of paramo, one genus for forest, and one genus and two species for grassland, potentially useful to evaluate and implement conservation programs in Andean ecosystems. Implications for insect conservation: Bioindicator species facilitate monitoring the state of ecosystems, a necessary procedure to forecast and mitigate changes due to climate change and anthropogenic advances. Paramos harbor great species richness in relatively small areas and are under constant threat due to agricultural and mining practices. The conservation of these habitats will guarantee not only the continuity and persistence of ecological services provided by hoverflies but also the protection of a unique component of the world's biodiversity.

AB  - Ensuring the sustainability of critical and limited natural soil resources is a major challenge in arid regions such as Kuwait. Investigations should be performed to identify and characterise collapsible surface soil deposits, and collapse potential should be assessed if possible in order to evaluate suitable stabilizing techniques. The cementation effect of different types of salts gives arid soils their considerable strength and stiffness in dry conditions. The collapse in these soils may occur due to the reduction of the chemical or physical bonds between the soil particles under wet conditions. Collapse Potential (CP) is an indication of the collapsibility of these soils. This paper presents the results of experimental work that was carried out to evaluate the collapse potential of two types of surface soil: sabkha soil and dune sand. The experimental program included physical and chemical soil characterization alongside a modified compaction test. The collapsibility of the soil at a stress of 200 kPa was obtained by performing a Single Collapse Test (SCT) via a conventional odometer device in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment. Collapse potential index tests were performed on the tested soil samples collected from eight locations in two study areas. The results suggest the problem severity is slight to none. However, the CP was higher for the sabkha soil samples than for the dune sand samples. The increase in collapsibility of the sabkha soil samples may be attributed to the removal of bonding between cementing particles upon wetting, leading to softening due to the rearrangement of soil particles.

AB  - High energy events are responsible for most significant and visible changes in beach morphology and sediment disposal in a short temporal scale. Storms are associated with damage to the coastal ecosystem and societal services such as severe shoreline erosion, collapse of coastal infrastructures and properties (ports, seawalls). These also affect the effectiveness of coastal defence works such as beach nourishment. In a scenario of climate change, with predictions of sea level rise and an increase in storminess being the most important threats affecting the coastal environments, the understanding of wave climate and the role of high energy events are of key importance. In this paper an index for the characterisation of modal regimes and extreme wave events, based on a 10-year wave hindcast on a 1-hour basis, is developed to characterize wave storms regime of the Andalusia region of southern Spain. Results of the implementation of this method are presented through two case studies; one concerning a low-energy environment located on the Mediterranean coast and other for the higher energy Atlantic coast. Analysis and characterisation of the wave parameters during modal and storm conditions and the study of the spatial distribution of wave energy dissipation patterns, among other hydrodynamic parameter such as wave orbital velocity, are carried out and implemented through a morphodynamic index for nearshore environments. Results show the variability of wave energy dissipation patterns among both study sites, the role of the nearshore topography and the adaptation of the surf zone in wave hydrodynamic processes. Further, the morphodynamic resilience helps in identifying the potential for changing behaviour in energy dissipation and morphological effects derived from high energy events when compared with low-energy modal conditions.

AB  - Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) requires an accurate representation of the preferences of decision makers, for instance in the form of a multi-attribute value function. Typically, additivity or other stringent assumptions about the preferences are made to facilitate elicitation by assuming a simple parametric form. When relaxing such assumptions, parameters cannot be elicited easily with standard methods. We present a novel approach for identifying multi-attribute value functions which can have any shape. As preference information indifference statements are used that can be elicited by trade-off questions. Instead of asking one indifference statement for each pair of attributes, we ask for multiple trade-offs at different points in the attribute space. This allows inferring parameters of complex value functions despite the simplicity of the preference statements. Parameters are estimated by taking into account preference and elicitation uncertainty with a probabilistic model. Statistical inference supports identifying the most adequate preference model out of several candidate models through quantifying the uncertainty and assessing the need for non-additivity. The approach is elaborated for determining value functions by hierarchical aggregation. We apply it to an assessment of the ecological state of rivers, which is used to support environmental management decisions in Switzerland. Preference models of four experts were quantified, confirming the feasibility of the approach and the relevance of considering non-additive functions. The method suggests a promising direction for improving the representation of preferences. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The biogeochemical and ecological assessment of the industrial city territory including urban soils and trees was carried out. Chemical (macroelement and microelement) composition of the city soils, morphological and biochemical properties of the linden leaves, possible impact of de-icing salts on soil and tree state, the correlation between the content of trace elements, and the S-containing plant compounds (phytochelatins) were included in the assessment. It was found that concentrations of trace elements in the soils near road with intensive traffic are changed from the soils, located at a distance of 40-50 m from the road. They have higher concentrations of As, Fe, Mn, Se, and Sr and lower concentration of Zn. The linden leaves from the roadside were characterized by the increase in As, Cu, Fe, Zn, and Cr and sharp decrease in the Mn and Sr concentrations. The analysis of soil water extracts showed a slight decrease of pH and low content of Ca, Mg, K, and Na for the distant sites. The phytochelatin test of linden leaves was weakly effective as well as asymmetry degree study of leaf lamina. The main differences were observed in the damage symptoms of leaves (chlorosis and necrosis) and the content of pigments (chlorophyll and carotenoids). The biochemical and ecological assessment of soils and trees showed relatively satisfactory ecological state of the investigated area in Moscow. The data obtained shows the weak local impact of the application of de-icing salts and automobile emissions.

AB  - Fish and macroinvertebrate assemblage composition, instream habitat features and surrounding land use were assessed in an agriculturally developed watershed to relate overall biotic condition to patterns of land use and channel structure. Six 100-m reaches were sampled on each of three first-order warm-water tributaries of the River Raisin in southeastern Michigan. Comparisons among sites and tributaries showed considerable variability in fish assemblages measured with the index of biotic integrity, macroinvertebrate assemblages characterized with several diversity indexes, and both quantitative and qualitative measurements of instream habitat structure. Land use immediate to the tributaries predicted biotic condition better than regional land use, but was less important than local habitat variables in explaining the variability observed in fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages. Fish and macroinvertebrates appeared to respond differently to landscape configuration and habitat variables as well. Fish showed a stronger relationship to flow variability and immediate land use, while macroinvertebrates correlated most strongly with dominant substrate. Although significant, the relationships between instream habitat variables and immediate land use explained only a modest amount of the variability observed. A prior study of this watershed ascribed greater predictive power to land use. In comparison to our study design, this study covered a larger area, providing greater contrast among subcatchments. Differences in outcomes suggests that the scale of investigation influences the strength of predictive variables. Thus, we concluded that the importance of local habitat conditions is best revealed by comparisons at the within-subcatchment scale.

AB  - It is preferable to transport or store natural gas (NG) in a liquid state, as liquefied natural gas (LNG). In recent decades, a variety of natural gas liquefaction processes (NGLPs) using mixed refrigerants (MRs) with different configurations have been developed, which have greatly enriched the family of NGLPs. In this review, we introduce the configurations of featured commercial processes or patented designs chronologically in each category based on a modified classification framework. The corresponding refrigerant combinations and operating parameters such as operating pressures, the refrigeration temperature in each stage, and the number of evaporating pressure levels are also discussed. Specific power consumption (SPC) was considered as the major performance indicator. This review aims to clarify the development of NGLPs using MRs (MR-NGLPs) from a configurative perspective, and to provide a reference for the future improvement of their thermodynamic performance.

AB  - Earthquakes are a major danger in a constantly growing society due to their imminent impact and power of destruction. Therefore, the idea of successfully forecasting an earthquake continues to motivate the multidisciplinary study of phenomena proposed as possible earthquake precursors such as ionospheric anomalies. In that sense, total electron content (TEC) has demonstrated to be an efficient parameter for investigating the state of the ionosphere by making use of the Global Positioning System receivers. In the present study, raw vertical TEC data obtained from the standard RINEX files of the GPS constellation are used to examine the state of the ionosphere during the occurrence of light to moderate earthquakes in Mexico from years 2008 to 2015 with the aim of search for possible ionospheric anomalies related to seismic activity. In order to evaluate the impact at the geomagnetic and ionospheric environments, the Geomagnetic Equatorial Dst index, which is considered to have a great influence on TEC during geomagnetic storm period, and solar activity parameters, have been considered. The results indicated that 17 (74%) of the studied events presented not quiet geomagnetic conditions for the days before the earthquake. Thus, the changes in VTEC are most likely related to geomagnetic anomalies which rules out its possible seismic origin. Contrariwise, 3 (13%) of the events presented geomagnetic anomalies the days after the earthquake. For the remaining 3 (13%) events, these presented particular characteristics, such as: not quiet geomagnetic condition for the earthquake day, geomagnetic anomalies throughout the period and the opposite.

AB  - Co-infection with microparasites (e.g., bacteria) and macroparasites (e.g., helminths) is often the natural state for wild animals. Despite evidence that gut helminths can bias immune responses away from inflammatory processes, few field studies have examined the role that helminths, or their potential interactions with internal microbial communities, play in modulating immunity in free-living, wild birds. Here, we used anthelmintic drugs to treat wild Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia) for helminth infections and measured markers of systemic inflammation (heterothermia and locomotor activity) in response to an immune challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a cell wall component of gram-negative bacteria. Using birds from a population that previously showed high helminth prevalence, we monitored skin temperature and activity remotely using automated radio telemetry. We also collected cloacal swabs to determine whether drug treatment was associated with changes in the cloacal microbiota, and whether cloacal microbial community structure was associated with the severity of birds' immune responses. Because helminths can reduce the severity of inflammatory immune responses in other species, we predicted that in comparison with untreated control birds, anthelmintic-treated birds would be more lethargic and display higher fevers when challenged with LPS. Consistent with these predictions, anthelmintic-treated birds expressed higher fevers in response to immune challenge. However, all LPS-challenged birds decreased locomotor activity to a similar degree, regardless of anthelmintic treatment. Although several individual indicator bacterial taxa were strongly associated with anthelmintic treatment, this treatment did not alter overall bacterial alpha- and beta-diversity. Similarly, we did not find evidence that bacterial community diversity influenced the severity of immune responses to LPS. These results suggest that under field conditions, natural helminth infection can reduce the severity of songbirds' thermoregulatory responses (fever) during an immune challenge, without major impacts on internal microbial communities or behavioral responses to infection.

AB  - Controls on oil family distribution in tectonically complicated, nonmarine, petroliferous basins are commonly difficult to isolate because of the varying ages of potential source rocks, the complex assemblage of organic-rich sedimentary facies, and the geographic variability of burial histories. The Turpan-Hami basin of northwestern China is an oil-bearing intermontane basin where stratigraphic, sedimentologic, and geochemical controls are sufficient to address each of these issues independently and to determine how they influence the current distribution and composition of liquid hydrocarbons.
   Source rock age is one of three major statistically significant discriminators affecting oil family composition. Both Lower/Middle (Lower or Middle) Jurassic and Upper Permian rocks are important source rocks for the basin. A newly developed diterpane biomarker parameter can distinguish Permian rocks and their correlative oils from Jurassic coals and mudrocks and their derivative oils.
   Source facies is a second key control on petroleum occurrence and character. A variety of biomarker parameters that reflect source rock depositional conditions are indexed to rock samples from interpreted depositional environments. By erecting rock-to-oil correlation models, the biomarker parameters separate oil families into endmember groups: group 1 oils Lower/Middle Jurassic peatland/ swamp facies (high land-plant input, less reducing conditions), group 2 oils = Lower/Middle Jurassic profundal lacustrine facies (high algal input, more reducing conditions), and group 3 oils Upper Permian lacustrine facies (high algal, stratified, anoxic conditions).
   Burial history exercises a third major control on petroleum distribution. Source rock maturation modeling can demonstrate that relatively uninterrupted burial in the asymmetrically subsiding northern Turpan-Hami area (Taibei depression) exhausted Upper Permian-sourced rocks by the Late Cretaceous, which led to southward migration of Upper Permian-sourced oils (group 3) into Triassic reservoirs of southern and southwestern Turpan-Hami (Tainan and Tokesun depressions). Subsequent to uplift of the central basin thrust that currently partitions Taibei from Tainan, Lower/Middle Jurassic-sourced oils were expelled in the Taibei depression by Paleocene-Eocene time, which locally charged Jurassic and Cretaceous reservoirs (groups 1 and 2), forming Turpan-Hami's largest oil accumulations in the basin.

AB  - With the continued adoption of passive acoustic monitoring as a tool for rapid and high-resolution ecosystem monitoring, ecologists are increasingly making use of a suite of acoustic indices to summarise the sonic environment. Though these indices are often reported to well represent some aspect of the biology of an ecosystem, the degree to which they are confounded by various extraneous sonic conditions is largely unknown. We conducted an aural inventory across 23 field sites in Okinawa to identify the number of unique animal sounds present in recordings. Using these values of 'measured richness', we then examined how the performance of 11 commonly-used acoustic indices varied across a range of sonic conditions (including in the presence and absence of insect stridulation, audible wind or rain, and human-related sounds). Our analysis identified both well- and poor-performing acoustic indices, as well as those that were particularly sensitive to sonic conditions. Only two indices reflected measured richness across the full range of sonic conditions examined. A few indices were relatively insensitive to extraneous sonic conditions, but no index correlated with measured richness when masked by sound from broadband stridulating insects. Our results demonstrate considerable sensitivity of most commonly used acoustic indices to confounding sonic conditions, highlighting the challenges of working with large acoustic datasets collected in the field. We make practical recommendations for acoustic index use based on study design, with the aim of identifying the suite of acoustic indices with greatest utility as indicators for rapid biodiversity monitoring and management of the world's natural soundscapes.

AB  - Drainage ditches are a prominent feature of many intensively managed agricultural areas. These small, shallow, line-shaped waterbodies could harbor a rich macroinvertebrate community, resembling that of natural small lentic ecosystems. Despite their high biodiversity potential, many ditch ecosystems are degraded due to nutrient enrichment, resulting in a shift from a mesotrophic system characterized by a diverse vegetation of emergent-, submerged-, and floating macrophytes to a hypertrophic state dominated by Lemnaceae or phytoplankton.
   Tools to assess the ecological quality of drainage ditches are currently lacking. Therefore, a multimetric index based on macroinvertebrates was developed to assess the ecological quality of drainage ditch systems in The Netherlands. Based on a large dataset from regional water district managers, who conduct routine sampling of macroinvertebrates in drainage ditches, a degradation gradient composed of 223 samples was derived, which represented the combined stressors eutrophication, organic pollution and salinity.
   We used a stepwise process to evaluate the discriminatory efficiency of a variety of diversity, abundance/composition, tolerance/sensitivity, and functional metrics for assessing ecological degradation in drainage ditches. After evaluating metric range, strength of correlation to the stressor gradient, degree of redundancy, and sample- and seasonal repeatability, five metrics were selected for the drainage ditch multimetric index: number of Trichoptera families, percentage of Gastropoda families, percentage of taxa preferring fresh water (CI- < 300 mg L-1). Dutch Saprobic index, and the percentage of predator taxa. The relationship of these single metrics with the stressor gradient is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article overviews community-based water monitoring (CBWM) in Aotearoa-New Zealand (NZ). CBWM was strongly boosted in NZ around 2000 by the development of the Stream Health Monitoring and Assessment Kit (SHMAK) and the Wai Care community initiative. Reform of freshwater management in NZ may be one driver for renewed interest recently in CBWM. Because professionals perceive volunteer-monitoring data as unreliable, they currently give little support to volunteer monitoring. To address their concern, we compared CBWM with measurements by regional authorities (RAs) - the main water management agencies in NZ. Agreement was encouragingly close for a comprehensive range of variables, including the important state-of-environment (SoE) indicators: visual clarity, Escherichia coli and macroinvertebrates. Community volunteers need and want ongoing professional support and encouragement, and, fortunately, there are important benefits for water management agencies, including engagement of citizens in water management and use of volunteer data. Professional support for CBWM in NZ could include: advice and encouragement, training, database development and quality assurance. Current research and development is focused on improving resources and systems for volunteer monitoring, notably with upgrading of the SHMAK. We are enlisting volunteers, equipped with improved tools and support systems, to assess the benefits of riparian rehabilitation and the suitability of water for swimming.

AB  - Identification of minimally disturbed reference sites is a critical step in developing precise and informative ecological indicators. We tested procedures to select reference sites, and quantified natural variation (inter-site and -annual variability) among reference conditions using a macroinvertebrate data set collected from 429 mediterranean-climate stream reaches in the San Francisco Bay Area, California (USA). We determined that a landscape GIS-based stressor screen followed by a local field-based stressor screen effectively identified least-disturbed reference sites that, based on NMS ordination results, supported different biological communities than sites identified with only landscape (GIS) or local (field) stressors. An examination of least-disturbed reference sites indicated that inter-site variability was strongly associated with stream hydrology (i.e., perennial vs. non-perennial flow) and annual precipitation, which highlights the need to control for such variation when developing biological indicators through natural gradient modeling or using unique biological indicators for both non-perennial and perennial streams. Metrics were more variable among non-perennial streams, indicating that additional modeling may be needed to develop precise biological indicators for non-perennial streams. Among 192 sites sampled two to six times over the 8-year study period, the biological community showed moderate inter-annual variability, with the 100 point index of biotic integrity scores varying from 0 to 51 points (mean = 11.5). Variance components analysis indicated that inter-annual variability explained only a fraction (5-18 %) of the total variation when compared against site-level variation; thus efforts to understand causes of natural variation between sites will produce more precise and accurate biological indicators.

AB  - Biological health assessment (BHA) has developed as an imperative gauge in efficient management of freshwater resources and fish assemblages. The principal objective of this research is directed at the development and application of a new index under the umbrella of the famous index of biological integrity (IBI). Further, we intended to carry out comparative assessments of the new index with two existing indices and testified to their rational in Geum River watershed, which is the third largest river water basin in South Korea. We analyzed the biotic integrity of 149 different study sites in the streams and rivers of Geum River watershed, perusing fish assemblages and water quality data. The results revealed the newer index, i.e., multi-metric (mm) IBI (06) (mmIBI (06) metrics), as comparatively more efficient than previously used indices, i.e., mmIBI (08) and mmIBI (11). Furthermore, the linear regression and correlational analyses indicated harmonic relation of mmIBI (06) with mmIBI (08) (R-2 = 0.85) and mmIBI (11) (R-2 = 0.87). Nonetheless, linear regression modeling discovered a very strong positive relation between mmIBI (08) and mmIBI (11) (R-2 = 0.91), thereby implying previously used indices demonstrate better approximation. In significant contrast to both old indices, the newer index exhibited improved facility to better classify the study sites between the assortments of excellent to very poor' compared to old indices elucidated one-step lower, i.e., from excellent to poor'. For instance, the newer index categorized 60 sites as very poor', requiring immediate attention owing to biological degradation. Additionally, the newer index endures grander ability to indicate sites requiring immediate management or restoration attention with a plausible site classification, especially in relation to the invasive alien species (IAS). The water chemistry was mainly influenced by rampant anthropogenic actions compounded by intensive monsoon precipitation that may relinquish highly suitable grounds for invasive alien fish species. This may eventually lead to severe biological degradation and successive deterioration of habitat by the IAS. In conclusion, the newer index endures ample capacity to indicate the fish community disturbances in rivers and streams. Further, correlation, linear regression, as well as principal component analysis (PCA) analyses on biotic indices and water chemistry showed higher approximations. Therefore, our newer index would be a valuable BHA tool to classify and elucidate the streams and rivers by indicating sites necessitating preferred attention and restoration measures.

AB  - This paper presents a new approach which was developed to find an optimal combination of candidate metrics for creating a fish-based estuarine biotic index (EBI) for defining the quality status of an estuarine area. The key idea was that a powerful index should minimise two prediction errors simultaneously: falsely declaring the status of a site as disturbed while it is not (Type I error) and the reverse, falsely declaring a disturbed site as undisturbed (Type II error). The balance between both errors is an inherent characteristic of an index and can be displayed as a curve. The area under this curve (AUC) is a measure of the misclassification rate (smaller = better). This criterion was the basis for a stepwise approach whereby in each step a metric resulting in the highest reduction of AUC was added. Five metrics were selected and the distribution of their average was the basis to derive the thresholds for the classes of the EBI. This paper presents the fish-based index (EBI) for the brackish Schelde estuary in Flanders (Belgium). The index was calibrated against fyke net data from five sites during the period from 1995 to 2004. The sites ranged in quality from moderately impacted to very disturbed, classes 3 to 5 respectively. Despite there being neither of the highest classes 1 (high) and 2 (good), the EBI presented can serve as an evaluation tool in the highly impacted situation in Flanders as it discriminates well between moderate and highly impacted sites. In addition, its definition complies with the biological status classes of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD).

AB  - We report a detailed study of the different categories and types of abnormal morphologies in planktic foraminifera recognizable in the lowermost Danian, mainly from the El Kef and Ain Settara sections, Tunisia. Various types of abnormalities in the test morphology were identified, including protuberances near the proloculus, abnormal chambers, double or twinned ultimate chambers, multiple ultimate chambers, abnormal apertures, distortion in test coiling, morphologically abnormal tests, attached twins or double tests, and general monstrosities. Detailed biostratigraphic and quantitative studies of the Tunisian sections documented a major proliferation of aberrant planktic foraminifera (between approximately 5% and 18% in relative abundance) during the first 200 Kyr of the Danian, starting immediately after the Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg) boundary mass extinction (spanning from the Guembelitria cretacea Zone to the lower part of the P. pseudobulloides Zone). This contrasts with the proportionately low frequency of aberrant tests (generally <2%) identified within the uppermost Maastrichtian, suggesting more stable environmental conditions during the last similar to 50-100 Kyr of the Cretaceous. Two main pulses with abundant aberrant tests were recognized in the earliest Danian, the one recorded in the well-known K/Pg boundary clay being the more intense of those (maxima of >18%). These main pulses of aberrants coincide approximately with relevant quantitative and evolutionary turnovers in the planktic foraminiferal assemblages. In this paper, we explore the relation of these high values of the foraminiferal abnormality index with the environmental changes induced by the meteorite impact of Chicxulub in Yucatan, Mexico, and the massive eruptions of the Deccan Traps, India.

AB  - Various pathological processes are associated with the aberrant expression and function of cytokines, especially those belonging to the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family. Nevertheless, the functions of members of the TGF-beta family in cancer progression and therapy are still uncertain. Growth differentiation factor-15, which exists in intracellular and extracellular forms, is classified as a divergent member of the TGF-beta superfamily. It has been indicated that GDF-15 is also connected to the evolution of cancer both positively and negatively depending upon the cellular state and environment. Under normal physiological conditions, GDF-15 inhibits early tumour promotion. However, its abnormal expression in advanced cancers causes proliferation, invasion, metastasis, cancer stem cell formation, immune escape and a reduced response to therapy. As a clinical indicator, GDF-15 can be used as a tool for the diagnosis and therapy of an extensive scope of cancers. Although some basic functions of GDF-15 are noncontroversial, their mechanisms remain unclear and complicated at the molecular level. Therefore, GDF-15 needs to be further explored and reviewed.

AB  - The spatial integrity of a habitat or landscape is determined by the occurrence of habitat fragments and of perforations inside them. A landscape is said to have less spatial integrity with increasing numbers of fragments and perforations. The Euler number (epsilon) is a numerical measure of spatial integrity, based upon the difference \n(f) - n(p)\ between the number of fragments (n(f)) and the number of perforations (n(p)). In this contribution, epsilon is evaluated, and an improvement is presented as a new index epsilon*, which is a combination of two metrics (epsilon(j), epsilon(d)) based on of n(f) and n(p). The term epsilon(f) quantifies the intensity of perforation and/or fragmentation. The term epsilon(d) measures the extent to which fragmentation predominates perforation, and vice versa. The intensity and dominance measures are combined into an Euclidean distance measure, generating the new ensemble value epsilon*, calculated as epsilon* = (n(f) + n(p))(-1) root[1 + n(f)(2)]. Use, sensitivity, and application of epsilon*, epsilon(j), and epsilon(d) are illustrated using percolation maps. Application of the new metrics by environmental scientists is encouraged because (1) no negative values can be generated with epsilon*, epsilon(j), and epsilon(d); (2) the range of epsilon*, epsilon(j), and epsilon(d) is fixed; (3) process dominance and intensity are both assessed; (4) epsilon*, epsilon(j) and epsilon(d) are easy to calculate and to interpret; and (5) epsilon* is not only based upon \n(f) - n(p)\ as epsilon is. Guidelines for practical use by means of a biplot of epsilon(j) and epsilon(d) are given.

AB  - Under the Water Framework Directive (WFD) taxonomic composition, presence of disturbance sensitive species, abundance and cover are stated attributes for monitoring the status of marine angiosperms; a biological quality element required for assessment of environmental condition. Member States (MS) are required to devise metrics for assessing these attributes to establish ecological status of water bodies. Furthermore the Directive requires intercalibration of metrics and data between MSs. Seagrass are the only truly marine angiosperms. The proposed suites of UK and Dutch metrics for assessing the specified seagrass attributes are described and comparisons made. UK and Dutch metrics are intercalibrated through testing against each nationality's seagrass data. Strong agreement is established in the outcomes of the two suites of tools; > 83%. Differences in outcomes are usually due to lack of availability of raw data. Importantly, where outcomes differ they still fall on the same side of the Good/Moderate boundary.

AB  - From 1985 to 1988, stream and riparian habitats in Pen branch and Four Mile branch began recovering from deforestation caused by the previous release of hot water from nuclear reactors. The Pen branch corridor was replanted with wetland trees in 1995 to expedite recovery and restore the Pen branch ecosystem. Pen branch, Four Mile branch, and two relatively undisturbed streams were electrofished in 1995/1996 to determine how fish assemblages differed between the previously disturbed and undisturbed streams and whether such difference could be used to measure restoration success in Pen branch. Fish assemblages were analyzed using nonparametric multivariate statistical methods and the index of biotic integrity (IBI), a bioassessment method based on measurement of ecologically sensitive characteristics of fish assemblages. Many aspects of fish assemblage structure (e.g. species richness, disease incidence, taxonomic composition at the family level) did not differ between disturbed and undisturbed streams; however, the disturbed streams were characterized by higher densities of a number of species. These differences were successfully detected with the multivariate statistical methods, whereas, the IBI did not differ between most recovering and undisturbed sampling sites. Because fish assemblages are strongly influenced by instream habitat, and because instream habitat is strongly influenced by the riparian zone, fish assemblages can be used to measure restoration success. Nonparametric ordination methods may provide the most sensitive measure of progress towards restoration goals, although the IBI can be used during early stages of recovery to indicate when certain ecologically important aspects of structure and function in recovering streams have reached levels typical of undisturbed streams.

AB  - Power plant with organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is currently the most perspective technology for electricity production when low-temperature source of energy is to be used. Because of the 'narrow' temperature range (ca 70 divided by 200 K) between upper and bottoming energy sources of the ORC, it is characterized by a low thermal efficiency. Thus, a lot of research and scientific effort have gone into developing new calculation techniques to optimize the work of such a system and the selection of a working fluid. In most of the recent studies a multi-criteria approach was applied and a single optimal operating point of the ORC was indicated as the final result of the optimization. The primary goal of this paper is to present an alternative approach. The general idea is to determine and indicate a set of the optimal operating parameters for which none of the considered criteria dominates significantly. In order to meet these conditions, multi-objective optimization using weight function G and genetic algorithm (GA) is conducted. The outcomes of the proposed model converge with Pareto set findings obtained using commonly known Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) method. The analysis is carried out for three sampled working fluids of the ORC: R1234yf, R1234ze and R245fa. The final results show that R1234yf is the optimal choice, since, in case of that fluid, the lowest values of the function G are observed for all weight distribution cases. Specifically, when the economic criterion is dominant (w(1) > w(2) case), the function G for R1234yf, R1234ze and R245fa is equal to: 0.1069, 0.1270 and 0.1460, while for the environmental criterion predominance (w(2) > w(1) case), the following values of G are obtained: 0.0985, 0.1260 and 0.1474. Simultaneously, the component criteria of the function G, i.e. the APR parameter (economic criterion) and SI index (environmental criterion) are minimized as well for all considered cases. In accordance with the fluid order given above, the optimized values of the APR parameter for w(1) > w(2) case are as follows: 0.61 m(2) kW(-1), 0.68 m(2) kW(-1) and 0.68 m(2) kW(-1), while, for w(2) > w(1) relation, the SI index is equal to: 0.48, 0.49 and 0.48. Furthermore, using the optimized values of the decision variables (pinch point temperature difference, evaporation temperature and condensation temperature), the novel 3-D plots with so-called sustainable surface are developed in the study to reveal the potential optimal ranges of important ORC parameters, such as: thermal efficiency, exergy efficiency or net power output. In general, the method should be a useful tool in the design process of the ORC systems, since it allows for the straightforward indication of several optimal operating points with respect to the adopted criteria. In other words, the designer has a wider choice and can opt for the parameters values that favor the selected objective.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to identify multi-level stressors at the DNA/biochemical level to the community level in fish in an urban stream and to develop an integrative health response (IHR) model for ecological health diagnosis. A pristine control site (S-c) and an impacted site (S-i) were selected from among seven pre-screened sites studied over seven years. Various chemical analyses indicated that nutrient enrichment (Nitrogen, Phosphorus) and organic pollution were significantly greater (t > 8.783, p < 0.01) at the S-i site compared to the S-c site. Single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assays) of DNA-level impairment indicated significantly (t = 5.678, p < 0.01) greater tail intensity, expressed as % tail-DNA, at the S-i site and genotoxic responses were detected in the downstream reach. Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) assays, as a physiological bioindicator, were 2.8-fold higher (p < 0.05, NK-test after ANOVA) at the S-i site. Tissue analysis using a necropsy-based health assessment index (NHAI) showed distinct internal organ disorders in three tissues, i.e., liver, kidney, and gill, at the S-i site. Population-level analysis using the sentinel species Zacco platypus showed that the regression coefficient (b) was 3.012 for the S-i site and 2.915 for the S-c site, indicating population skewness in the downstream reach. Community-level health was impaired at the S-i site based on an index of biological integrity (IBI), and physical habitat modifications were identified by a qualitative habitat evaluation index (QHEI). Overall, the model values for the integrative health response (IHR), developed using the star plot approach, were 3.22 (80.5%) at the S-c site and 0.74 (18.5%) at the S-i site, indicating that, overall, ecological health impairments were evident in the urban reach. Our study was based on multi-level approaches using biological organization and the results suggest that there is a pivotal point of linkage between mechanistic understanding and real ecological consequences of environmental stressors.

AB  - Indices of biological integrity (IBIs) have been developed for a wide variety of locales and ecological systems to describe their biological condition. Due to variability in geophysical and chemical conditions, IBIs are often developed regionally and applied to similar ecological systems. Researchers in Minnesota previously developed a fish IBI (FIBI) for lakes; however, its application was limited to lakes 40?200 ha surface area and located in central Minnesota. The objectives of this study were to develop FIBIs and ecologically meaningful thresholds for application to a broader suite of Minnesota lakes with surface areas 40?4,050 ha. Fish communities in 419 lakes throughout Minnesota were sampled using gill nets, trap nets, backpack electrofishers, and beach seines between mid-June and early-September 2005?2013. Fish species were assigned to functional groups based on family, tolerance, primary feeding niche, special habitat use, and whether they were native to Minnesota. Lakes were classified into seven groups based on their geophysical and chemical attributes, and four groups were ultimately used in FIBI development. A suite of potential metrics was evaluated for each of the four FIBIs based on their relationships to measures of human-induced watershed and in-lake stressors and 8?15 were retained for each FIBI. Metrics that were retained were summed, and composite scores were scaled 0?100. Biological Condition Gradient (BCG) models were developed for each FIBI. The BCG models established thresholds for impairment and exceptional condition. The FIBIs and thresholds are being used to guide clean water planning, restoration, and protection efforts and to complement pollutant-based water quality sampling efforts in lakes during the Minnesota watershed assessment process.

AB  - Phytoplankton composition, development, and distribution, as well as hydrooptical characteristics, were studied in mesotrophic drainless Lake Krasilovskoe (Altai krai, Russia) in March and August 2017, and February 2018. Phytoplankton comprised 147 taxa with a rank below genus. In winter, the phytoplankton abundance was 0.03-1.06 x 10(6) cells/L, biomass 0.2-12.2 g/m(3), and Chl a content 1.8-24.1 mg/m(3) at a snow depth of 0.13-0.34 m, ice thickness of 0.56-0.70 m, and water temperature of 0.1-4.5 degrees C. Summer phytoplankton was characterized by higher values of indicators of development (0.11-1.74 x 10(6) cells/L, 0.6-18.2 g/m(3), and 27.5-83.4 mg/m(3) Chl a, respectively). A positive relationship between the Chl a content and the absorption coefficient in the range of 400-460 and 670-800 nm and the total phytoplankton abundance and absorption coefficient in the range of 520-580 nm was found both in winter and summer periods. This indicates that active photosynthesis in algae takes place not only in summer, but also during the ice period.

AB  - The restoration of degraded land using biosolids provides a well known means of recycling these organic residues. In semiarid ecosystems they can enhance the chemical and physical properties of the soil and stimulate soil microbe growth and activity, leading to increases in soil fertility and quality. However, the respiratory activity in biosolids-treated soil may contribute to an increase in atmospheric CO2. Few studies examining CO2 emissions from biosolids-amended soils in semiarid climates have been conducted under field conditions. The aims of the present study were to determine the effect of applying different amounts of biosolids on the soil organic matter content and respiratory activity of a semiarid, abandoned agricultural soil. The CO2 fluxed from the soil surface (kg CO2 ha(-1) d(-1)) was measured using a portable analyser. Soil temperature and soil water content were measured in the first 5 cm of soil. The results show that a large proportion of the organic matter incorporated into the soil via the biosolids was easily biodegradable in the first three years following its application. In addition, biosolids application generally increased soil CO2 emissions, although in a manner not proportional to the quantity applied. Differences in soil humidity were associated with differences in soil CO2 flux over the year. The soil water content was the major factor affecting soil respiration; a strong correlation was found between these variables. Soil respiration activity could serve as a useful index of soil biological activity, allowing the decomposition of biosolids under field conditions to be monitored.

AB  - This paper addresses environmental monitoring through a robust dynamic integration between biomonitor and biosensor systems, a strategy that has not been attempted before. The two systems are conceptually interrelated and methodologically correlated to a cooperative/synergistic scheme (CSS) with a view to minimise uncertainty and monitoring costs and increase reliability of pollution control and abatement. The structures and operations of the biosensor component (in terms of sensitivity, device and method versatility, nature-mimicking physicochemical mechanisms, prospects and technological input) are such that they reinforce or promote the structures and operations of the natural component (in terms of biosurveillance, impact assessment, environmental quality indexing, stress responses, metabolic pathways, etc.) and vice versa.
   The bioindicator ontology presented herein, including concepts, relations and controlled vocabulary aiming at establishing an integrated methodology for mapping/assessing negative environmental externalities, provides a useful tool for the design/development/implementation of an environmental network for the monitoring of a variety of pollutants over time and space and the assessment of environmental quality; the collection of the available information and its classification into taxonomic and partonomic relations allows the construction of a database that links pollutants with organisms' response, at a phenomenological and in-depth level, considering ecological parameters, relations and geomorphologic characteristics. As a result, a computer program has been designed/developed as a decision support system and has been successfully tested on a representative population of species indigenous to southern Greece.
   Significantly, a novel system in the form of a rational framework at the conceptual design level has been developed, that actually contributes towards achieving a cost-effective long-term monitoring program, with the flexibility to counter on-course any (anticipated or not) variations/modifications of the surveillance environment. This novel and pioneering approach will further offer a dynamic system utilised in (a) environmental impact studies and risk assessment (positive/analytic approach), (b) decision-making in the short-run (normative/tactic approach), and (c) policymaking in the long-run (normative/strategic approach). The proposed CSS, based on the integration of multiple data sources, can establish a local area network, incorporated into/expanding to a wide area network, thus offering the potential of better predictive ability and greater lead-time warning at alarm conditions than that provided by separate, stand-alone surveillance modalities.

AB  - Regionally scaled assessments of hydrologic alteration for small streams and its effects on freshwater taxa are often inhibited by a low number of stream gages. To overcome this limitation, we paired modeled estimates of hydrologic alteration to a benthic macroinvertebrate index of biotic integrity data for 4522 stream reaches across the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Using separate random-forest models, we predicted flow status (inflated, diminished, or indeterminant) for 12 published hydrologic metrics (HMs) that characterize the main components of flow regimes. We used these models to predict each HM status for each stream reach in the watershed, and linked predictions to macroinvertebrate condition samples collected from streams with drainage areas less than 200 km(2). Flow alteration was calculated as the number of HMs with inflated or diminished status and ranged from 0 (no HM inflated or diminished) to 12 (all 12 HMs inflated or diminished). When focused solely on the stream condition and flow-alteration relationship, degraded macroinvertebrate condition was, depending on the number of HMs used, 3.8-4.7 times more likely in a flow-altered site; this likelihood was over twofold higher in the urban-focused dataset (8.7-10.8), and was never significant in the agriculture-focused dataset. Logistic regression analysis using the entire dataset showed for every unit increase in flow-alteration intensity, the odds of a degraded condition increased 3.7%. Our results provide an indication of whether altered streamflow is a possible driver of degraded biological conditions, information that could help managers prioritize management actions and lead to more effective restoration efforts.

AB  - We evaluated the response of riparian forest soil nematode community structure to the physico-chemical environment associated with urban land use. Soils were sampled seasonally between December 2000 and October 2002 along an urban-rural transect in Asheville, North Carolina. We characterized the taxonomic (to genus) and functional composition (trophic groups) of the nematode community of forest soils, as well as several nematode ecological indicators (maturity index, channel index, weighted faunal index). The diversity of nematode genera was not affected by urban land use. However, there tended to be functional differences in the nematode communities along the land use gradient. The urban soils tended to have lower abundances of predatory and omnivorous nematodes. Differences in channel index scores indicated that there was less fungal dominance in the soil food webs of the urban soils. Our results indicate that the functional composition of the soil food web is an important component of soil biodiversity that can be affected by land use practices. This study was conducted in a relatively small city; hence the influence of pollutants on the soil environment was not as great as in larger cities. Correspondingly, the impact on the soil nematode community was not very severe. The utilization of the nematode community assemblage as an indicator of soil conditions should be further explored in urban places of differing magnitudes of environmental effects.

AB  - Globally, estuaries are among the most productive ecosystems with many threatened by anthropogenic activities. Zooplankton is a bioindicator of ecosystem integrity. The spatial and temporal composition of zooplankton communities were quantified and compared within and between three estuaries (uMvoti, Thukela and aMatikulu/Nyoni estuaries) with different levels of human pressure in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Additional effects of some physico-chemical variables and seasonal flow patterns to zooplankton community structuring were analyzed. The aMatikulu/Nyoni Estuary was selected as a reference site due to its good ecological state. Sampling dates represented high flow (March and April) and low flow (August and September) from 2014 to 2016. Following aMatikulu/Nyoni, highest abundance was recorded in Thukela and then uMvoti Estuary with copepod Pseudodiaptomus hessei and Acartia natalensis dominating the three estuaries. Highest abundance was recorded during low flow in the uMvoti and Thukela estuaries. Redundancy analysis revealed higher salinity and oxygen as environmental determinants of zooplankton community structure in the aMatikulu/Nyoni while turbidity and pH were the determinants of zooplankton community structures in uMvoti and Thukela estuaries. Elevated concentrations of DIN in the Thukela Estuary during high flow identifies the Thukela River as an important source of nitrogen to this estuary. Our findings suggest that these estuaries be managed to ensure sufficient freshwater supply which controls primary production. Although the three estuaries were from the same biogeographical region with a similar river dominated function, high variability in their zooplankton communities could be explained by differing water quality due to differing human pressure in their catchments.

AB  - Large wood has important structural and functional roles in streams but there is little information on large wood dynamics in the southeastern coastal plains, USA. In this study, we surveyed 35 streams in the Choctawhatchee River watershed of southeastern Alabama. These streams were broadly classified into three categories based on land use: urban, forest, and mixed (agriculture plus forest). The number, volume, and functions of large wood were quantified. Pool number, pool spacing, and drainage areas of each stream were measured along with assessment of macroinvertebrate assemblages. Large wood number and volume plus pool number and spacing were used to examine the relationship among large wood characteristics and functions, pool characteristics, drainage area, and attributes of macroinvertebrate assemblages including species richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity (H'), number of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) species, and the Invertebrate Community Index (ICI a multimetric index that reflects biological integrity of streams). There were significant differences in large wood number and volume among the three different stream categories, with highest large wood number and volume in forest streams. More pools and storage sites for sediment and organic matter were found in forest streams than urban and mixed streams. Large wood appeared to be positively related to macroinvertebrate assemblages, as species richness, H', EPT, and ICI were generally higher in forest streams as compared to those of urban and mixed streams. The outcome of this study suggests that large wood contributes to the physical and biological complexity of streams in the southeastern coastal plain streams of the USA.

AB  - Six diverse wheat cultivars/lines viz; Baviacore, Nesser, 9247, 9252, 9258 and 9267 were crossed in a complete diallel fashion to develop 30 F-1 crosses, which were tested alongwith their parents under normal and water stress conditions. Numerical analysis was made for spike density, number of grains per spike, 100-grain weight, biological yield, grain yield and harvest index. Significant differences among genotypic mean were observed in all of the traits under both conditions. GCA and SCA differences were significant for all the traits under study except spike density and 100-grain weight in both conditions. Wheat variety Nesser showed maximum general combining ability value for spike density under water stress conditions and maximum GCA value for biological yield and grain yield under irrigated condition. The variety Baviacore proved best general combiner for number of grains per spike and harvest index under both conditions while biological yield and grain yield under water stress condition. Variety 9252 found best general combiner for 100-grain weight under both condition. The cross 9252 x Nesser showed maximum specific combining ability value for spike density and biological yield under irrigated while for 100-grain weight under water stress condition. 9258 x 9252 exhibited maximum SCA for number of grains per spike under irrigated while 9258 x Nesser under water stress condition. 9267 x Nesser showed maximum SCA for 100-grain weight under irrigated condition while spike density under water stress condition. 9258 x 9247 was proved best combiner for grain yield and harvest index irrigated while 9267 x 9258 for biological yield, grain yield and harvest index under water stress condition.

AB  - Periphyton is a commonly used biomonitoring tool for streams. Often only one or few riffles are sampled and assumed to be representative of a stream reach. Current literature focuses on periphyton heterogeneity at small scales, on individual rocks within a riffle, and larger scales, within watersheds or ecoregions. The intermediate scales, within single riffles or among riffles, have not been adequately addressed. The purpose of this research was to determine how many riffles must be sampled in order to represent a reach and whether the number of necessary riffles varied with stream health. Since periphyton is sensitive to habitat change, it was hypothesized that heterogeneity would be primarily partitioned among riffles. Eight to ten consecutive riffles were sampled at eight individual stream reaches. Sampled reaches were categorized based on previously collected bioassesment data: three non-attaining, three partially-attaining, and two fully-attaining water quality standards as defined by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. Data were analyzed using the Bray-Curtis Similarity Index, Hill's N(2) dominance diversity index, and the Acid Mine Drainage Diatom Index of Biotic Integrity. Diatoms appeared to be patchily distributed within a reach. This patchiness often led to varied relative abundance of common species and the introduction or loss of rare species among riffles. To account for this variation within a reach, at least two riffles should be sampled. However, a multimetric index may correctly classify a stream based on a one-riffle sample. Variation does not appear to correspond directly to stream health, but to species richness and diversity.

AB  - The Everglades and South Florida ecosystems are the focus of national and international attention because of their current degraded and threatened state. Ecological risk assessment, sustainability, and ecosystem and adaptive management principles and processes are being used nationally as a decision and policy framework for a variety of types of ecological assessments. The intent of this study is to demonstrate the application of these paradigms and principles at a regional scale. The effects-directed assessment approach used in this study consists of a retrospective, eco-epidemiological phase to determine the causes for the current conditions and a prospective predictive risk-based assessment using scenario analysis to evaluate future options. Embedded in these assessment phases is a process that begins with the identification of goals and societal preferences which are used to develop an integrated suite of risk-based and policy relevant conceptual models. Conceptual models are used to illustrate the linkages among management (societal) actions, environmental stressors, and societal/ecological effects, and provide the basis for developing and testing causal hypotheses. These models, developed for a variety of landscape units and their drivers, stressors, and endpoints, are used to formulate hypotheses to explain the current conditions. They are also used as the basis for structuring management scenarios and analyses to project the temporal and spatial magnitude of risk reduction and system recovery. Within the context of recovery, the conceptual models are used in the initial development of performance criteria for those stressors that are determined to be most important in shaping the landscape, and to guide the use of numerical models used to develop quantitative performance criteria in the scenario analysis. The results will be discussed within an ecosystem and adaptive management framework that provides the foundation for decision making. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Data analyzed at national, multistate or state scales often reveal more serious deterioration of various biological assemblages than that suspected from site specific studies simply because the impacts are observed regionally rather than locally. Unfortunately many regional assessments are based on data collected with differing sampling designs and methods, making their representativeness, accuracy and precision questionable. In 1989, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) began EMAP-Surface Waters (EMAP-SW), a program for developing methods to monitor and assess status and trends in the nation's lakes and rivers in a statistically and ecologically rigorous manner. EMAP-SW has now conducted regional multistate pilots in streams and rivers throughout the U.S.A. in collaboration with State agencies, universities and EPA regional offices. We discuss EMAP's conceptual design, which focuses on biological integrity through use of multiple biological assemblages and includes physical and chemical habitat and landscape characteristics. When coupled with appropriate biological indicators, a probability-based design enabled us to provide accurate, precise and unbiased assessments of biological conditions, along with quantitative estimates of sampling uncertainty. Regional EMAP-SW surveys indicated the importance of assessing multiple biological assemblages because each assemblage was differentially sensitive to different stressors and at different spatial scales. Synthesizing multiple metrics from multiple assemblages allowed us to detect the effects of multiple anthropogenic disturbances. We also illustrate the value of using historical reconstruction and paleolimnological data for determining reference conditions where disturbance is extensive. We conclude that an EMAP approach to sampling design and indicators (recognizing natural ecoregional differences) has distinct advantages for monitoring and assessments that may be applicable to European Communities seeking to assess the ecological integrity of waters.

AB  - Ecoacoustics is an emerging field that allows inferences about biodiversity trends and ecosystem health. Several acoustic indices have been developed for fast, automated assessments of ecosystem condition and are often used to assess changes in species richness/diversity across space or time. However, studies have reported inconclusive relationships between acoustic indices and species richness/diversity and the conclusions regarding "best" performing index differ between ecosystems. Here we assess the use of acoustic indices, using birds as a proxy for ecosystem health in a Northern Great Plains grassland system. We recorded soundscapes during bird morning chorus at 47 sites for 12-14 consecutive days and used these data to assess the accuracy of four acoustic indices (i.e. Bioacoustic Index; Acoustic Evenness Index; Acoustic Diversity Index; and Acoustic Complexity Index). We compared indices to bird richness derived from a trained ornithologist listening to sound recordings. The Bioacoustic Index (BI) and Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI) had the absolute highest correlation with bird richness in Northern Great Plains systems. Where Bioacoustic Index had a positive correlation and Acoustic Complexity Index had a negative correlation with grassland birds. The latter had the opposite direction from the 'theoretical' prediction. We further explored the relationship between indices and landscape gradients with known influences on bird diversity to further validate each index. We also discuss implications of acoustic indices as a tool for monitoring grassland birds. We found BI model outcomes align with known relationships between grassland birds and spatial covariates, whereas ACI did not concur these trends. We discuss these outcomes in relation to habitat-specific bird biophonic characteristics and provide possible explanations for differences between studies.

AB  - Concentrations of biogenic and toxic elements (Na, K, Mg, Ca, P, S, Fe, Cu, Zn, Co, Mn, Se, Ni, Sr, Al, Cd, Pb, As) were determined for the first time in feathers of gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua) and chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antaretica) from Antarctica. A comparison of element levels was performed among these species in years 2002-2003. Penguins molt annually and this fact allows defining precisely the concentrations of accumulated toxic elements and heavy metals in plumage every year. A continual environmental biomonitoring could establish a possible trend to contamination of the Antarctica sea zones. The penguin feather is an excellent subject for monitoring because penguins have long life span, permanent ecological niche and dominate the aviafauna in Antarctica. Because of its remoteness, Antarctica is believed to be unpolluted. The relatively elevated levels of Cd established are due to the Cd-enrichment of the Antarctic marine food chain. Because of great bioaccumulation of lead in feathers, the concentration of Pb in penguin feather was higher (4-8 times) compared to that of Cd. In both penguin species the levels of Zn were 1.9 times higher than respective Fe levels. The concentrations of most of the investigated elements were significantly higher in R papua than in R antarctica and this probably could be explained by the different diet and feeding habit of these species.

AB  - Nematode communities in a Norway spruce forest in High Tatra National Park, Slovakia were monitored for the period of several years (2006 and 2013). Unfortunately, in May 2014 natural windstorm damaged the forest. This disastrous event, together with preliminary obtained results allowed us to compare the direct impact of windstorm damage of forest habitat on soil nematode assemblages. The forest destruction by windstorm had a significant effect on the total nematode abundance, the abundance of omnivores and herbivores, as well as the nematode species diversity. The most dominant species, representing 55 % of the total nematode fauna, in the plot studied were Acrobeloides nanus followed by Malenchus exiguus, Filenchus vulgaris, Plectus communis, Plectus parvus and Tylencholaimus mirabilis. The abundance of bacterivorous significantly increased after the windstorm, meanwhile the abundance of omnivores, fungivores, and herbivores ectoparasites and epidermal/root hair feeders showed an opposite trend. Of the evaluative indicators, Shannon species diversity (H'spp), maturity index (MI), maturity index 2-5 (MI2-5), sigma maturity index (Sigma MO, enrichment index (El) and structure index (SI) decreased significantly after windstorm. The El and SI indexes characterized soil ecosystems before windstorm (2006 2013) as maturing with low or moderate disturbance, but soil ecosystems shortly after the windstorm (2014) were degraded and nutrient depleted. This also corresponded with graphical display of metabolic footprints characteristics of soil food web. Overall, the nematode communities differed significantly before and after forest damage. These results suggest the role of nematode communities as indicators of environment condition quality or its disruption.

AB  - The growth of human populations has resulted in the expansion of metropolitan areas and changes in land use, both of which affect watersheds and streams. The ecological integrity of streams is likely to be negatively affected by urbanisation, compromising freshwater ecosystem services. The aim of this study was to assess how efficient structural and functional indicators are in evaluating the ecological conditions of water in urban stream ecosystems. Two urban streams crossing the city and one stream crossing a suburban area of Coimbra, Portugal were selected. Total impervious area (TIA) was used as an indicator of urbanisation. Physical and chemical parameters of water were measured and analysed within the Water Framework Directive (WFD/2000/60/EC). Benthic macroinvertebrates were used as structural indicators, and the IBMWP biotic index (modified) and the Portuguese IPtIS index were calculated. The decomposition rates of oak (Quercus robur) and alder (Autos glutinosa) leaves were used as indicators of functional quality. Biotic indices and litter decomposition rates indicated poor ecological conditions in the urban streams compared to the suburban stream, consistent with the degree of urbanisation. The decrease in ecological quality in urban streams most likely reflected decreases in dissolved oxygen and increases in water temperature and conductivity. We emphasise (a) the need to combine physical and chemical data with biological data and (b) the high performance of a novel functional indicator based on litter breakdown rate as an accurate, efficient and integrative measure of ecological integrity in urban streams.

AB  - Shallow lakes have been affected by a variety of human activities profoundly altering their ecological structure and function. Cladocerans have been used to track change resulting from a variety of drivers at a number of time scales. Aquatic macrophytes are well recognised as reflecting the ecological condition of a lake. Here, we compare the plant macrofossils with the sub-fossil cladoceran assemblages from 20 dated sediment cores. Co-correspondence analysis was used to determine the degree of commonality of change in community composition of the two biological groups through time. This analysis revealed very high levels of agreement in the nature and timing of change at all the sites examined with very high correlation coefficients between the axis 1 scores for macrofossils and cladocerans. Furthermore, at all sites a high proportion of the variance (min 20%, max 54%) in the macrofossil data was explained by the change in the cladoceran assemblage. Sub-fossil macrofossil and cladoceran assemblages, from at least from 1700 AD onwards, were examined in more detail at three sites: Ormesby Great Broad, Felbrigg Lake and Lake Sobygaard. There was very good accord in the main shifts of the cladoceran and macrofossil assemblages at all three sites. This may reflect the long-term shift in the principal focus of primary production from the benthic to the pelagic habitat. We suggest that the combination of their central position in the food-web and the presence of both pelagic and benthic taxa make cladocerans a strong candidate as the single best indicator of (palaeo) ecological condition related to changing trophic status and alteration in food-web structure in shallow lakes.

AB  - Water yield is a key ecosystem function index, directly impacting the sustainable development of the basin economy and ecosystem. Climate and land use/land cover (LULC) changes are the main driving factors affecting water yield. In the context of global climate change, assessing the impacts of climate and LULC changes on water yield in the alpine regions of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is essential for formulating rational management and development strategies for water resources. On the basis of the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model, we simulated and analyzed the spatiotemporal variations and the impacts of LULC and climate changes on water yield from 2001 to 2019 in the upstream regions of the Shule River Basin (USRB) on the northeastern margin of the QTP. Three scenarios were designed in the InVEST model to clearly analyze the contributions of climate and LULC changes on the variation of water yield. The first scenario integrated climate and LULC change into the model according to the actual conditions. The second scenario was simulation without LULC change, and the third scenario was without climate change. The results showed that (1) the InVEST model had a good performance in estimating water yield (coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.986; root mean square error (RMSE) = 3.012, p < 0.05); (2) the water yield significantly increased in the temporal scale from 2001 to 2019, especially in the high altitude of the marginal regions (accounting for 32.01%), while the northwest regions significantly decreased and accounted for only 8.39% (p < 0.05); (3) the spatial distribution of water yield increased from the middle low-altitude regions to the marginal high-altitude regions; and (4) through the analysis of the three scenarios, the impact of climate change on water yield was 90.56%, while that of LULC change was only 9.44%. This study reveals that climate warming has a positive impact on water yield, which will provide valuable references for the integrated assessment and management of water resources in the Shule River Basin.

AB  - The decision on treatment after a first venous thromboembolism (VTE) to prevent recurrences may be influenced by many factors. The prospective, observational, WHITE study aimed to analyze how this issue was tackled in every-day clinical practice in various countries, which have sensibly different socio-economic conditions and healthcare systems. Doctors active in 79 Internal or Vascular clinical centers in 7 countries (China, Czechia, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Slovakia, and Tunisia) enrolled VTE patients after the maintenance treatment phase. The present report analyzed information, collected in the central database, regarding the baseline characteristics, index events, type and duration of anticoagulant therapy and decision on post-maintenance treatment. From April 2018 to December 2020, 1240 patients were enrolled, 58% with an unprovoked index event. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) were used in > 85% of all cases in China, Poland, Portugal, Russia and Czechia, in 52% in Slovakia and in no patient in Tunisia. The maintenance anticoagulation lasted in average approximately 6 months. Altogether, anticoagulation was stopped in 20%, extended in about 50%, regardless of whether the event was unprovoked or provoked and shifted to antithrombotics (mainly sulodexide or aspirin) in the remaining patients. In conclusion, some differences in VTE patient management were found between countries. The provoked/unprovoked nature of the index event, instead, was not the prevalent criterion to drive the decision on extension of anticoagulation, without large variations between countries. DOACs were the most widely used anticoagulant drugs, whereas > 25% of patients received antithrombotic drugs instead of anticoagulants as extended treatment.

AB  - A 150-d feeding experiment was conducted to assess the effect of the dietary energy to protein ratio (E/P ratio) on growth, biological indices, proximate composition, and amino acid profiles in the muscle of Varicorhinus macrolepis. Six experimental diets were formulated with different E/P ratios (30.51, 33.90, 37.82, 42.34, 47.70, and 54.09kJ/g). In the experiment, 360 fish with a mean weight of 8.75g (SD, 0.59) were randomly divided into six groups (three replicates per group, 20 fish per replicate) and fed three times daily with the experimental diet. Results showed that when the dietary E/P ratio was 37.82kJ/g, Varicorhinus macrolepis tended to gain the highest specific growth rate. With a change in the increment of dietary E/P ratio, the condition factor, intestosomatic index, hepatosomatic index, and viscerosomatic index all changed in the quadric polynomial regression model. Muscle crude lipid content showed a tendency of leveling-off first and then increased with increasing dietary E/P ratio. Varicorhinus macrolepis gained the highest concentration of total amino acids and essential amino acids when the dietary E/P ratio was 37.82kJ/g. Except for methionine+cysteine, phenylalanine+tyrosine, and the amino acid score of lysine, the amino acid scores and chemical scores of the other essential amino acids were highest when the dietary E/P ratio was 37.82kJ/g. These results suggest that Varicorhinus macrolepis obtained optimal growth and muscle amino acid composition when the dietary E/P ratio was 37.82kJ/g.

AB  - An RLW-2000 micro-computer servo-control rock triaxial testing machine was used to carry out triaxial cyclic loading and unloading experiments of saturated and natural shales under different confining pressures. The mechanical properties and hysteresis effects of two hydrated shales were analyzed. The evolution law of the damping ratio was discussed based on the energy principle. The experimental results show that as the cycle number increases, the cumulative residual strain increases gradually. The relative residual strain decreases first and then tends to a stable region, and finally increases rapidly prior to the rock damage. The deformation modulus of the saturated shale is smaller than that of the natural shale during the loading and unloading process. Besides, the loading deformation modulus is smaller than that of the unloading deformation modulus. In the loading and unloading stages, it is observed that the strain always lags the stress. The hysteresis effect of saturated shale is more obvious than that of natural shale. An energy calculation method is proposed considering the hysteresis effect with a smaller error of the calculated energy compared with that of the previous energy calculation. Finally, the calculation formula of the damping ratio is revised based on the energy principle. It is found that the damping ratio of saturated shale is larger than that of natural shale. The change of damping ratio reflects the shale damage mechanism, which can be used as an important indicator to predict the instability of shale.

AB  - A comprehensive biological, sediment, and water quality study of the lower Little Scioto River near Marion, Ohio, USA, was undertaken to evaluate the changes or improvements in biotic measurements following the removal of creosote-contaminated sediment. The study area covered 7.5 river miles (RMs), including a remediated section between RMs 6.0 and 6.8. Fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages, fish biomarkers (i.e., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon [PAH] metabolite levels in white sucker [Castostomus commersoni] and common carp [Cyprinus carpio] bile and DNA damage), sediment chemistry, and water quality were assessed at five locations relative to the primary source of historical PAH contaminationupstream (RM 9.2), adjacent (RM 6.5), and downstream (RMs 5.7, 4.4, and 2.7). Overall, the biomarker results were consistent with the sediment PAH results, showing a pattern of low levels of PAH bile metabolites and DNA damage at the upstream (reference or background location), as well as the remediated section, high levels at the two immediate downstream sites, and somewhat lower levels at the furthest downstream site. Results show that remediation was effective in reducing sediment contaminant concentrations and exposure of fish to PAHs and in improving fish assemblages (60% increase in index of biotic integrity scores) in remediated river sections. Additional remedial investigation and potentially further remediation is needed to improve the downstream benthic fish community, which is still heavily exposed to PAH contaminants. Environ. Toxicol.

AB  - Behavioural responses of animals are often placed conceptually along some axis characterized by the extremes, e.g. bold versus shy or timid. Ecological and evolutionary pressures can be associated with increased frequencies of different behavioural patterns that are also subject to intrinsic factors such as differing metabolic requirements or cognitive abilities. We exposed individual wild-caught juvenile bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus, to kairomones from predatory northern pike, Esox lucius, or to lake water controls during a Z-maze arena assay commonly used to assess relative levels of boldness and exploratory behaviours. Fish were subsequently lethally sampled for liver and brain mass to obtain estimates of relative body condition (hepato-somatic index, HSI) and cognitive capacity (brain-somatic index, BSI), as well as the state of the gallbladder, to test for relationships between these indices and observed boldness-related behaviours. Using principal components analysis (PCA) we identified a boldness eexploration syndrome in bluegill independent of chemical treatment and body metrics where bolder fish emerged from a start chamber in less time, travelled farther through the maze and crossed more lines than less bold fish. Bluegill exposed to kairomones were bolder on average than their counterparts in the control treatment independent of body metrics, suggesting that elevated risk levels indicated by predator kairomones can elicit behavioural responses consistent with boldness, exploration and risk taking. The role of relative cognitive ability in the expression of boldness and exploration is equivocal and may be resolved through repeated assays on individuals at different risk levels.

AB  - In this study, 63 groundwater samples were collected in the Kashgar Delta Area in Xinjiang in 2016, and then, the samples were tested and the test results were analyzed. Multivariate statistical techniques were used to determine the sources of pollution, and the USEPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) model was used to assess the long-term health risk of groundwater to adults and children in the study area. The concentrations of groundwater chemical Na+, Cl-, SO42-, NH4+-N, TDS, F-, I-, As, Fe, Mn, Pb, Hg, pH, TH, and CODMn, which exceed the permissible level in the study based on groundwater quality index and possibly pose a potential threat to the health of the residents in the area, which are mainly influenced by geological conditions. The source of the pollutants is the dissolution of minerals in the aquifer medium, which is greatly affected by the high-salinity groundwater environment, pH conditions, redox conditions, and evaporation and concentration effect. The values of the noncarcinogenic health risk index HQ(n) follow the descending order of Cl- > F- > As > Fe > Mn > Pb > Hg > NH4+-N; There are eight nonarcinogens and one carcinogen in groundwater of which Cl- is the dominant noncarcinogenic factor, while As is the main carcinogenic pollutant in the study area. The health risk ratio results show that Cl- and As are the main pollutants that pose the greatest threat to both adults' and children's health, and they should be considered as the primary indicators for health risk management and control.

AB  - Fish assemblage-based indices of biotic integrity (IBIs) are commonly used by many states. These IBIs contain a core of common metrics and a few metrics that are specific to the local environmental setting and fish assemblage. This implies a consistency of responses as degradation increases, but the responses are modified by the local environmental setting. These implications lead to two hypotheses: (1) stream physical characteristics, such as substrate composition, geomorphologic composition, and hydraulic characteristics, will differ among integrity classes regardless of geographic location or environmental setting and (2) the differences in stream physical characteristics among integrity classes change due to the environmental setting. To test these hypotheses, fish assemblages and stream physical characteristics were examined across a priori defined degradation gradients in four diverse environmental settings by comparing species traits (preferences for substrate, preferences for geomorphic channel units, and locomotion morphology) and stream physical characteristics (substrate composition, geomorphic channel unit abundance, and stream hydraulic characteristics) among three IBI classes (high, moderate, and low). Across all environmental settings combined, Euclidean distances of species traits normalized to local reference conditions indicated differences in substrate preferences among each of the three integrity classes: substrate particle size preferences differed among all three integrity classes, geomorphic channel unit preference differed between the high-integrity sites and the other sites, and locomotion morphology differed between low-integrity sites and the other sites. These results indicate that degradation occurs in each of the three physical stream characteristics regardless of environmental setting. Within the individual environmental settings, there were some specific differences in the changes in substrate preferences, geomorphic unit preference, and locomotion morphology among integrity classes. Within individual environmental settings, differences in stream physical characteristics among integrity classes generally reflected the same differences as indicated by differences in fish assemblage composition.

AB  - For ectotherms, thermal physiology plays a fundamental role in the establishment and success of invasive species in novel areas and, ultimately, in their ecological interactions with native species. Invasive species are assumed to have a greater ability to exploit the thermal environment, higher acclimation capacities, a wider thermal tolerance range, and better relative performance under a range of thermal conditions. Here we compare the thermal ecophysiology of two species that occur in sympatry in a tropical dry forest of the Pacific coast of Mexico, the microendemic species Benedetti's Leaf-toed Gecko (Phyllodactylus benedettii) and the invasive Common House Gecko (Hemidactylus frenatus). We characterized their patterns of thermoregulation, thermoregulatory efficiency, thermal tolerances, and thermal sensitivity of locomotor performance. In addition, we included morphological variables and an index of body condition to evaluate their effects on the thermal sensitivity of locomotor performance in these species. Although the two species had similar selected temperatures and thermal tolerances, they contrasted in their thermoregulatory strategies and thermal sensitivity of locomotor performance. Hemidactylus frenatus had a higher performance than the native species, P. benedettii, which would represent an ecological advantage for the former species. Nevertheless, we suggest that given the spatial and temporal limitations in habitat use of the two species, the probability of agonistic interactions between them is reduced. We recommend exploring additional biotic attributes, such as competition, behavior and niche overlap in order assess the role of alternative factors favoring the success of invasive species.

AB  - Five Virginia trout farms were selected for examination of effluent impacts on downstream water quality, periphyton production, and composition of macroinvertebrate and fish communities during fall 1994 and summer 1995. Annual trout production and feeding rates varied from 18.5 to 59.5 thousand kilograms and 15.6 to 87.6 thousand kilograms, respectively, and were correlated with discharge. Substrate embeddedness increased significantly (P < 0.07) downstream at two farms, but settleable solid concentrations in effluent were always less than 0.1 mL/L. Total ammonia nitrogen, un-ionized ammonia nitrogen, and nitrite nitrogen levels increased significantly (P < 0.001) downstream but were well below recommended thresholds for lethal exposure for aquatic organisms. Dissolved oxygen levels were significantly reduced (P < 0.001) downstream at postfeeding and predawn hours but were typically greater than 7.0 mg/L. Effluent water temperatures, pH, nitrate nitrogen, and total phosphorus concentrations did not differ from upstream levels. Settling ponds at two farms effectively reduced nutrient loadings downstream. Periphyton increased significantly (P < 0.001) downstream, but enrichment was localized to within 400 m. Macroinvertebrate richness and abundance of sensitive taxa (mayflies, stoneflies, and caddisflies) were reduced downstream, and pollution-tolerant noninsect taxa (isopods and gastropods) increased. Results of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's rapid bioassessment protocol (RBP), which integrates macroinvertebrate community metrics, reflected moderately impaired environmental conditions downstream at farms A and C and only slightly impaired or unimpaired water quality at the other farms. Results of the index of biotic integrity (IBI), which is based on fish community metrics, did not correspond with those of the REP and reflected poor environmental conditions at farms C and D. Low fish species richness and abundance in these headwater streams limited the usefulness of the TBI for examining impacts of trout farm effluents.

AB  - Accurate and reliable benthic quality indicators are in great demand following the recent developments and the strict time schedule for implementing the European Water Framework Directive. The Mondego estuary has experienced a progressive deterioration during the 1990s, followed by a partial ecological recovery clue to restoration measures in 1997/1998. We have used the estuary as a model system to test the performance and robustness of a set of ecological indicators in highlighting the changes in the ecological state of intertidal areas. Over a period of 17 years (1985-2002), we calculated Margalef, Shannon-Wiener, Berger-Parker, Taxonomic Distinctness measures, AZTI's Marine Biotic Index, Infaunal Trophic Index, and Eco-Exergy based indices and tested differences across periods characterised by different anthropogenic disturbance. We combined temporal data within three periods: before, during and after disturbance, based on progressive information on the changes in the extended type of anthropogenic disturbance. Indices were then compared with biological and abiotic descriptors (macroalgae, macrophytes, benthic macrofauna, nutrients concentration, sediment grain size and total organic carbon). We found great disparity in the indicators ability to capture temporal changes, showing distinct performances at each site. At the Zostera noltii site, only Margalef, Total Taxonomic Distinctness and the thermodynamically based indices Captured temporal changes, despite giving higher Values during the disturbance period. At the bare sediment site, Taxonomic Distinctness, ITI, Shannon-Wiener, Berger-Parker, AMBI and the TBI were able to distinguish between periods, in agreement with the differences observed analysing the macrobenthic assemblages. Furthermore, Taxonomic Distinctness was not robust enough to detect any temporal or spatial change. We thus Suggest further research to understand the behaviour of ecological indicators, in view of their crucial importance for the management and protection of marine coastal areas.

AB  - River biomonitoring uses biotic indices that assess human-induced degradation, including pollution, by comparison with type-specific static biological reference conditions. However, index scores that indicate pollution may reflect biological responses to natural hydrological variability associated with low flows and drying, leading biomonitoring schemes to misclassify sites as degraded. To address this, dynamic, site-specific adjustments of static biological reference conditions have been proposed, but current biomonitoring tools cannot facilitate implementation of these adjustments. We analyzed 329 samples from mediterranean-climate rivers in Greece, to evaluate the use of six stressor-specific macroinvertebrate-based indices of hydrological variability (CEFI, DEHLI, ELF, LIFE, LIFENZ, MIS-index) as tools to facilitate dynamic adjustments of static biological reference conditions. We examined macroinvertebrate assemblage responses to physicochemical and land use drivers in relation to each sample's hydrological conditions, as assessed by the six indices. We evaluated index performance beyond the region of development by exploring correlations among indices, including correlations with the regionspecific Greek ELF index, for which 100% of taxa were represented. We also examined the influence of inorganic nutrient pollution on index performance by comparing index scores from samples with and without nutrient pollution. Season, water temperature, agricultural land use and nutrient pollution were major drivers of macroinvertebrate assemblage composition. Indices were positively correlated but correlation strength varied considerably, driven primarily by taxonomic representation (the proportion of sampled taxa included in each index's calculation), and potentially also by differences in river types, taxonomic resolution and sampling strategies. All indices identified site-specific hydrological conditions both in the presence and absence of nutrient pollution. We recommend the development of region-specific biotic indices of hydrological variability, or regional adaptation of existing indices, to represent 100% of the regional taxa pool and thus to enable acceptable performance beyond their region of development. Such indices could inform dynamic adaptation of static biological reference conditions by assessing site-specific hydrological conditions based on a macroinvertebrate assemblage, without the collection of additional, abiotic field data. Application of our proposed approach could prevent misclassification of ecological status, thus avoiding time-demanding and costly mismanagement of rivers and streams.

AB  - Neottianthe cucullata (L.) Schltr. is an endangered orchid species. It grows in forest communities from Central Europe to Eastern Asia. Despite the wide range, this species is considered as rare and/or endangered plant everywhere. In Central Russia, the four Neottianthe cucullata populations are located in the Republic of Mordovia. The aim of our study was to assess the modern state and the endangerment of Neottianthe cucullata populations in Central Russia. We compared the age structure, abundance dynamics in populations, some morphological parameters of generative individuals, composition of the accompanying flora and environmental conditions of localities for all investigated populations. Our results show that Neottianthe cucullata inhabits plant communities, where permanent components are Pinus sylvestris, which forms the forest stand and Pleurozium schreberi (rarely Climacium dendroides), which forms the moss layer. Most important environmental factors determining Neottianthe cucullata presence in plant communities are moisture and light conditions, while soil fertility and pH are not so significant for this species. All investigated Neottianthe cucullata populations are vegetatively orientated. The percentage of generative individuals in the age spectrum varies from 4.9% to 46.1%. There is a threat to population decrease in the National Park 'Smolny' due to a very low percentage of young (juvenile and immature) individuals that varies from 8.0% to 9.2% despite to the relatively high level of flowers formed per one inflorescence. B2c (iv) status of the IUCN assessment should be attributed to this species due to the annual significant fluctuations in the number of individuals (about 10-times). A good strategy for conservation of Neottianthe cucullata in Central Russia might be further monitoring of studied populations as to their status in each habitat, and maintaining the special protection regime in the Mordovia State Nature Reserve and in National Park 'Smolny'.

AB  - Body condition is an important measure to estimate the energy reserve of an organism. Scientists frequently use body condition indices (BCIs) with morphometric measures but direct measurements, such as blood glucose, seem to be more reliable. We observed oscillations in the body condition and glucose indexes of individuals of Artibeus planirostris (Spix, 1823) during 13 nights in the field. We assume that if glucose levels are proportional to feeding state and body condition is a measure of energy reserve, blood glucose and BCI should be positively correlated and both are expected to increase during the night as the bats leave their diurnal roost to feed. To test this, we examined the relationship between blood glucose levels, BCI and reproductive phase of free flying male bats (n = 70) for 12 hours after sunset for 13 nights. Bats were captured in Reserva Biologica de Guaribas (Paraiba, Brazil) using mist nets. Blood glucose was analyzed with a portable glucometer. Supporting our assumptions, the number of hours after sunset and BCI presented significant positive correlations with glucose levels in A. planirostris. Reproductive phase did not present a significant correlation with any other variables. As we predicted, glucose level can be used as proxy for morphometric BCI and it can be measured with a simple portable glucometer. The increase both in glucose and BCI around the night can be explained by the efficient assimilation of nutrients present in fruits ingested by bats and the quick metabolism that increases the levels of glucose (an other nutrients) in blood, increasing the body mass.

AB  - After 3 years of CO (2) treatments, A stimulation from ambient to elevated CO (2) was strongly related to the total dry mass change (%), supporting the sink demand A hypothesis.
   Adaptations related to gas exchange are important fitness traits in plants and have significant growth and ecological implications. Assimilation (A) and assimilation to internal CO2 (AC (i) ) response curve parameters were quantified from a red spruce (RS) (Picea rubens Sarg.)-black spruce (BS) [P. mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.] controlled-cross hybrid complex grown under ambient and elevated CO2 conditions. Under ambient conditions, maximum A (A (max)), maximum rate of carboxylation by rubisco (V (cmax)), maximum rate of electron transport (J (max)), and carboxylation efficiency (CE) generally increased with increasing BS content; however, under elevated CO2 conditions, hybrid index 50 (hybrid index number is the percentage of RS, balance BS) often had greater values than the other indices. There were significant hybrid index, CO2, and hybrid index x CO2 effects for A (growth) at 360 ppm (A (360)) and 720 ppm (A (720)). The net A stimulation (A (stim)), from ambient to elevated CO2 treatment after 3 years was 10.8, 57.8, 74.1, 69.8, and 58.7 %, for hybrid indices 0 (BS), 25, 50, 75, and 100 (RS), respectively. Why does BS have the least A (stim), hybrid index 50 the most, and RS a moderate level? There was a significant relationship between A (360) and ambient total biomass among indices (P = 0.096), but none was found between A (720) and elevated total biomass. However, A (stim) (%) was strongly related to the change in total dry mass (%) in response to elevated CO2 (R (2) = 0.931, P = 0.008), supporting the hypothesis that sink demand drives A. Traits A (max), V (cmax) and J (max) were correlated to total chlorophyll concentration. Moreover, A (max) V (cmax) and J (max) also showed a significant underlying male effect, particularly under ambient conditions consistent with the paternal inheritance of the chloroplast genome.

AB  - Soil pollution by heavy metals is increasing continuously in developing countries due to industrial activities such as mining. This study addresses the distribution, potential risk to human health, and ecological risk of heavy metals (Cu, Ni, Cr, Co and Zn) taken from the soil in the vicinity of a relinquished Cu-Ni mine in Selibe Phikwe, Botswana. Furthermore, source apportionment of heavy metals was also conducted through Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF). The geochemical analysis results showed that the mean Cu, Ni, Cr, Pb, Co and Zn concentrations in the soil reached 141.65, 132.30, 87.64, 4.30, 8.97 and 37.15 mg/kg, respectively. Although Hazard Quotient (HQ) calculations results suggest that non-cancerous risks of the target heavy metals are low under the present conditions, the Hazard Index (HI) calculation results indicate a potential non-carcinogenic risk of Cr (HI > 1) for children. The mean values for cancer risk (CRtotal) also reached 3.00 x 10(-5) in children and 5.59 x 10(-5) in adults. The findings also suggested a potential ecological risk resulting from Cu and Ni in the region. The PMF model effectively revealed that Pb, Zn, and Co were mainly geologic, while anthropogenic sources were primarily responsible for the Cr, Ni, and Cu enrichment in soils. This study suggests that inexpensive risk mitigation efforts such as phyto-capping should be implemented, particularly in areas with slag piles and tailings dams.

AB  - The proposal for a Management Model based on the Sustainability Triangle is presented for the pond systems of the rural environment, Pan American Zone, Merida State, Venezuela. The environmental aspects considered are the identification and mitigation of environmental impacts in the construction and operation phases, as well as the use of effluent and by-products of Pond Systems. For social aspects, the indicators of Environmental Social Equity coverage of drinking water and sewage services are provided. The technical-economic aspects involve the Hydrodynamic Study of the implemented pond prototypes, the Organizational Model and Economic Viability. Among the conclusions and recommendations are that the proposed management model, if adapted and implemented, is in full force and effect, as it would solve a problem of sanitation, historical and common, throughout the Venezuelan rural environment.

AB  - Our overall goal was to develop indicators that both estimate ecological condition and suggest plausible causes of ecosystem degradation across the U.S. Great Lakes coastal region. Here we summarize data gathered along the U.S. Lake Huron coastline for breeding bird, diatom, fish, invertebrate, and wetland plant communities. We sampled these biotic communities on 88 sites in Lake Huron coastal wetlands, uplands, estuaries/bays, and high-energy shorelines. The sites were selected as part of a larger, stratified random design for the entire U.S. Great Lakes coastal region using gradients of anthropogenic stress that incorporated over 200 stressor variables (e.g. agriculture, land cover, human populations, and point source pollution). The U.S. Lake Huron coastal region exemplified wide variation in human-related stress relative to the entire U.S. Great Lakes coast. In general, levels of stress decreased from south to north partly reflecting the change in climate and physiography, but also due to the greater human influences in the southern region as compared with the north. The primary stressors in the southern region are due to agriculture and human development, while the northern region has substantially less agriculture and less human population. The biotic communities sampled were strongly related to the environmental stress gradients, especially agriculture and urbanization. The following indicators were developed based on responses to stress: 1) an index of biological condition for breeding bird communities corresponding to land use, 2) a diatom-inferred total phosphorus indicator corresponding to water quality, 3) exotic fish (carp [Cyprinus carpio] and goldfish [Carassius auratus]) corresponding to agriculture, and 4) a multi-taxa index for wetland plants corresponding to a cumulative stress index. These communities can all serve as useful indicators of the ecological condition of the Lake Huron coast. The ecological indicators provide a baseline on selected conditions for the U.S. Lake Huron coastal region and a means to detect change over time.

AB  - The objective of this trial was to characterize the assemblage structure of fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae) by determining the diversity and faunal indices. Fruit flies were collected for ten years between 2003 and 2015 in six municipalities of the Metropolitan Region of Curitiba, Parana. The orchards were divided into three crop protection strategies: organic, conventional, and integrated pest management. The characteristic of each community was determined using the Shannon-Wiener, Margalef, and Pielou's indexes. The frequency, constancy, and dominance indexes were also determined. Biological material was analyzed using the explanatory variables: site, crop, plant protection strategy, and susceptibility period. A total of 8,089 fruit flies were collected, of which 4,681 were females. The species Anastrepha daciformis Bezzi, A. dissimilis Stone, A. distincta Greene and A. pickeli Lima were recorded for the first time in Parana State, the occurrence of three other species was recorded for the first time in the Metropolitan Region of Curitiba (A. montei Lima, A. obliqua Macquart, and A. sororcula Zucchi), in addition A. fraterculus (Wiedemann), A. grandis (Macquart) and Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann). A. fraterculus accounted for 98.5% of the collected species. Only A. fraterculus and A. sororcula were found in fruits. Fruit flies occurred predominantly in peach trees cultivated under organic conditions. The Shannon index indicated that the municipality of Cerro Azul had the highest diversity and richness whereas apple orchards had the lowest diversity. Crops cultivated under organic conditions exhibited the highest diversity whereas those cultivated under conventional conditions had the highest evenness index. The largest specimens number was collected during the period of crop susceptibility.

AB  - The designation of marine protected areas (MPAs) requires the development of a monitoring design to assess the effectiveness of the closure in meeting its conservation objectives. Natural variability should be considered in the design, ideally determined using baseline information collected at the scale of the closure. Monitoring benthos informs on general ecosystem state. Benthic habitat maps are widely used as surrogates of benthos in marine spatial planning, and could potentially be used to inform monitoring by minimizing confounding habitat effects. Here, epibenthic diversity was assessed in the St. Anns Bank MPA in Atlantic Canada, the first assessment of benthic patterns at the scale of this closure. Epibenthic assemblages were determined using a photographic camera system along a single transect (similar to 100-150 m in length) at 44 locations in 2013 and 2014 (with 10 or 11 images per location, providing a total of 438 images), prior to the designation of the MPA. Epibenthic patterns were correlated with a previously developed benthic habitat (benthoscape) map to determine the potential of using benthoscape classes as units for monitoring. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering of epibenthic assemblages and similarity profile analysis revealed five clusters of assemblages in the MPA (P < 0.01), each of which were associated with specific indicator taxa. Some clusters of assemblages correlated well with distinct benthoscape classes representing either hard/coarse (gravel) or soft sediment (sand and mud), whereas clusters associated with mixed sediment segregated spatially. The within-cluster variability in assemblages between locations was lower overall than within the management zones, but differed between clusters. Similarities were detected with previous coarser-scale assessments of epibenthic diversity in the St. Anns Bank MPA, but this study revealed a more complex benthic structure than previously thought. A monitoring design should thus consider this natural variability to reliably monitor change and aid in determining the effectiveness of the MPA.

AB  - In the present study we investigated dinocyst assemblages in the Trondheimsfjord over the last 25 to 50 yr from three well-dated multi-cores (Pb-210 and Cs-137) retrieved along the fjord axis. The downcore distribution of the dinocysts is discussed in view of changes in key hydrographic parameters of the surface waters (sea-surface temperatures (SSTs), sea-surface salinities (SSSs), and river discharges) monitored in the fjord. We examine the impact of the North Atlantic Oscillation pattern and of waste water supply from the local industry and agriculture on the fjord ecological state and thus dinocyst species diversity. Our results show that dinocyst production and diversity in the fjord is not evidently affected by human-induced eutrophication. Instead the assemblages appear to be mainly controlled by the NAO-related changes in nutrient availability and the physicochemical characteristics of the surface mixed layer. Still, discharges of major rivers have been modulated since 1985 by the implementation of hydropower plants, which certainly influences the amounts of nutrients supplied to the fjord. The impact, however, is variable according to the local geographical setting, and barely differentiated from natural changes in river run off.
   We ultimately test the use of the modern analogue technique (MAT) for the reconstruction of winter and summer SSTs and SSSs and annual primary productivity (PP) in this particular fjord setting. The reconstructed data are compared with time series of summer and winter SSTs and SSSs measured at 10m water depth, as well as with mean annual PPs along the Norwegian coast and in Scandinavian fjords. The reconstructions are generally in good agreement with the instrumental measurements and observations from other fjords. Major deviations can be attributed to peculiarities in the assemblages linked to the particular fjord setting and the related hydrological structure.

AB  - Thalli of the lichen Pseudevernia furfuracea were transplanted for 3 months (November 2010-January 2011) at 61 monitoring sites around a cement plant near Castrovillari (Calabria, southern Italy). NH3, NOx and SO2 concentrations were monitored monthly in a subarea of 10 sites (SA10) where the cement plant was located. At the end of the exposure period, the integrity of cell membranes; membrane lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, TBARS level); vitality (cell respiration); chlorophyll a; chlorophyll b; carotenoids; phaeophytization quotient; photosynthetic efficiency and thalli concentrations of Al, Ca, Mg, Vand Fe were measured. NOx concentrations correlated with the site distance from the cement plant while NH3 concentrations correlated with lichen vitality within SA10. For the monitoring area as a whole, only Fe and Mg concentrations correlated with membrane lipid peroxidation, while TBARS levels showed a significant increase and chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoids a significant decrease with respect to the lichen origin area. Multivariate analysis (detrended correspondence analysis, cluster analysis and multi-response permutation procedure) of the eco-physiological parameters x monitoring sites data set resulted in four clusters termed C1, C2, C3 and C4. The ecophysiological parameters were compared among the four clusters and lichen origin area by one-way ANOVA. An index of environmental favourableness (IEF) to lichens was calculated to evaluate the spatial recovery of impaired values of TBARS, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, xanthophylls + carotenoids and phaeophytization quotient. The results indicate that there is no clear spatial trend in mycobiont impairment even though the IEF values suggest a higher number of sites with low levels of membrane lipid peroxidation in the 2--3-km distance band from the cement plant (the outermost) than in the two other distance bands (0-1 and 1-2 km). The photobiont seems to be damaged mainly in the inner distance band of the study area as suggested by the gradual but significant recovery trend of pigment levels and phaeophytization quotient from the inner distance band to the outer one (as shown by the IEF values). Conversion of chlorophyll to phaeophytin probably is not the only process affecting pigment levels.

AB  - Geomorphologies tend to categorize dunes into three major states (mobile, semi-stabilized and stabilized) based on their shape and mobility rate. However, the ecologists try to find bio-indicators that can characterize the mobility rate and the ecological features of the various dune states. Unfortunately, there are limited numbers of significant bio-indicators, if any. The aim of our study was to develop a Dune Assemblage Index (DAI) in order to indicate the affinity of annual plants and arthropods assemblages to dune mobility. The DAI values range between 0 for stabilized dunes and 1 for bare and active dunes. The index was calculated for 10 coastal dunes in Nizzanim nature reserve, located at the southern part of the Israeli Mediterranean coast, from data that were collected in the years 2006 and 2007. Generally, the lower the vegetation cover is, the higher are DAI values for both taxon groups. Generalist species tend to mask the differences between active and stabilized dunes whereas psammophiles (sand-dwelling species) tend to increase the DAI values. Additionally, the DAI may differ among dunes with the same perennial coverage due to differences in the spatial plant distribution patterns. Likewise, the DAI depends also on the distance of the dunes from rural areas, which encourage invasion of generalist species, thus decreases the DAI value. This new defined spatial index that relies on plant and animal assemblages, rather than on individual bio-indicators, can be adapted to any taxon and dune ecosystems. The use of several taxons may support better understanding of the ecosystem state of the dune. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - BackgroundAlternative polyadenylation (APA) has emerged as a pervasive mechanism that contributes to the transcriptome complexity and dynamics of gene regulation. The current tsunami of whole genome poly(A) site data from various conditions generated by 3 end sequencing provides a valuable data source for the study of APA-related gene expression. Cluster analysis is a powerful technique for investigating the association structure among genes, however, conventional gene clustering methods are not suitable for APA-related data as they fail to consider the information of poly(A) sites (e.g., location, abundance, number, etc.) within each gene or measure the association among poly(A) sites between two genes.ResultsHere we proposed a computational framework, named PASCCA, for clustering genes from replicated or unreplicated poly(A) site data using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). PASCCA incorporates multiple layers of gene expression data from both the poly(A) site level and gene level and takes into account the number of replicates and the variability within each experimental group. Moreover, PASCCA characterizes poly(A) sites in various ways including the abundance and relative usage, which can exploit the advantages of 3 end deep sequencing in quantifying APA sites. Using both real and synthetic poly(A) site data sets, the cluster analysis demonstrates that PASCCA outperforms other widely-used distance measures under five performance metrics including connectivity, the Dunn index, average distance, average distance between means, and the biological homogeneity index. We also used PASCCA to infer APA-specific gene modules from recently published poly(A) site data of rice and discovered some distinct functional gene modules. We have made PASCCA an easy-to-use R package for APA-related gene expression analyses, including the characterization of poly(A) sites, quantification of association between genes, and clustering of genes.ConclusionsBy providing a better treatment of the noise inherent in repeated measurements and taking into account multiple layers of poly(A) site data, PASCCA could be a general tool for clustering and analyzing APA-specific gene expression data. PASCCA could be used to elucidate the dynamic interplay of genes and their APA sites among various biological conditions from emerging 3 end sequencing data to address the complex biological phenomenon.

AB  - The United States Environmental Protection Agency recently released their most sweeping overhaul to the Lead and Copper Rule in three decades. One of the most significant changes is requiring a fifth-liter (L5) sample at homes with lead service lines (LSLs) rather than the original first-liter (L1) sample for a demonstration of compliance with water lead level (WLL) limits. We analyzed sequential sampling data from three large water systems and compliance data from Michigan utilities.which base compliance on the 90th percentile of the greater of L1 and L5 samples.to evaluate whether L5 WLLs better represent water in contact with LSLs and to explore regulatory impacts of including L5 samples in compliance monitoring. The sequential sampling data demonstrated that it is impossible to use a single sample volume within a sequential profile to universally capture the volume of water in an LSL. While L5 is not always a reliable indicator of water in contact with an LSL, Michigan compliance data showed that the L5 sample is more likely to be from an LSL and can identify utilities that benefit from an improved corrosion control treatment. Michigan compliance data indicate that it is likely that L5 sampling will result in more systems having a higher 90th percentile WLL and that a high proportion of the systems likely to exceed regulatory action levels based on L5 samples can be identified through a retrospective analysis of historic L1 data. The impact of the switch to L5 sampling on the effectiveness of corrosion control treatment over time has yet to be determined.

KW  - INTRODUCTIONS
AB  - Gibel carp, Carassius gibelio (Bloch), impacts on native fish species have been reported but little studied despite a long history of introductions in Europe. This species is able to reproduce gynogenetically, which involves the use of sperm from males of other species to activate egg development, so reproductive competition is a likely but virtually unstudied impact of gibel carp on native fishes. This study evaluates the impact of introduced C.similar to gibelio on the population biology of native fishes over a 6-year period in a mesotrophic drinking water reservoir in north-western Turkey. A dramatic decrease in the relative density (i.e. catch per unit effort) of native species correlated significantly with an increase in C.similar to gibelio relative density. Growth characteristics (back-calculated ages, growth index and relative condition) and length at maturity did not differ significantly among years in C.similar to gibelio and native fishes. Relative density, duration of spawning, reproductive effort and gonado-somatic index of C.similar to gibelio increased with some water quality variables [total phosphorus (TP); chlorophyll-a (Chl-a)] and coincided with decreasing trends for natives. However, TP and Chl-a were not correlated with growth features in C.similar to gibelio or natives fishes. The results suggest that the decline in the reservoirs native cyprinid populations is likely due to a combination of degrading environmental conditions and a disparity in reproductive effort, with introduced C.similar to gibelio invasion facilitated by gynogenetic reproduction and an observed interference with native fishes during spawning.

AB  - In environmentally conscious design of chemical processes, environmental assessment is applied system atically during each of the different stages of the conceptual design process to help select options that are benign from an environmental perspective. Nevertheless, deviations from the design conditions over the course of operation of the industrial plant may compromise the environmental performance that was initially forecast, causing environmental damage liable to compensation. This paper presents an alternative method for assessment of chemical processes that is based on utilization of an index called the Environmental Return Time-ERT. This index represents, for a given set of design conditions, the time needed to compensate for predictable environmental damage and return to an acceptable level of environmental quality. A case study is used to demonstrate application of the proposed method to a stage of the conceptual design phase of a process for production of benzene by hydrodealkylation of toluene (the HDA process). In this case study, the design conditions for the conversion reaction and for the gas purge fraction of the process that will enable an ERT <= 1 to be achieved are defined. This exercise, based on selection of alternative design options from an environmental perspective, leads to the conclusion that utilization of the ERT index enables choice of environmental quality criteria with lower subjectivity than utilization of absolute values for potential environmental impacts. The study's results also include prediction, during the design phase, of the operational conditions and the time operating under these conditions necessary to compensate in advance for the environmental damage that is likely to occur during the life cycle of the operation.

AB  - Urban land use can adversely affect the water quality of adjacent streams through interactions at the edges of the two ecosystems. From a landscape ecological perspective, edges control the flow rate of materials between two adjacent systems. Based on the rationale that the streamline complexity formed between land uses and water bodies may function in this manner, we investigated the potential role of streamline complexity in the relationship between stream ecological communities and urban land use in Korea. Various indices of biological indicators including the diatom assemblage index for organic pollution, the trophic diatom index, the Korean saprobic index, and the index of biotic integrity were applied at 80 sampling sites in the Nakdong River system. We computed the fractal dimensions of the streamlines within 1-km buffers and the proportion of urban land use in the watershed within 5-km buffers around the sampling sites. A moderation model was adopted to investigate the role of streamline complexity in the relationship between urban land use and the biological indices of ecological communities. A comparison between a simple geometry regression model and complex geometry models indicated that streamline complexity may moderate the adverse impacts of urban land use on ecological communities in streams. The moderating effect of streamline complexity was particularly significant for assemblages of macroinvertebrates and fishes. Therefore, to enhance the ecological integrity of streams, we strongly recommend considering streamline complexity when restoring channelized streams in developed areas.

AB  - The traffic pressure is increasing, resulting in the emission of atmospheric pollution. Soil organisms will need to respond to pollution stressors. Among them, land snails are valuable indicators of ecosystem disturbance. In this study, land snails Helix pomatia were sampled from three city localities with different traffic intensity. Oxidative stress biomarkers catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in the foot muscle (FM) and hepatopancreas (HP) tissue were determined. Also, five heavy metal (Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) concentrations were quantified in soil and tissue samples. According to the results, the highway induces the strongest contamination on the surrounding environment, with the highest metal concentrations measured in soil and snails. At the most polluted locality, only Cd exceeded some soil guidelines authorities that we referred to in this study. In addition, tissue Cd concentrations exceeded the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) value (1 mg kg(-1)) for soil invertebrate toxicity at all localities making it likely responsible for generating adverse effects in snails. Regarding HP, the CAT and GST are the most sensitive parameters that could be useful as oxidative stress biomarkers in snails exposed to the actual metals in the environment. On the other hand, in FM tissue, the most pronounced changes were recorded for GPX and GR. Based on tissue-specific enzyme responses, three urban populations were clearly separated. Therefore land snails are the promising candidates for quick field-based biomarker studies after showing a tissue-specific concentration-dependent induction of certain enzymes to heavy metals.

AB  - The estrogenic potential (expressed as a score composite of 18 high throughput screening bioassays) of 1528 compounds from the ToxCast database was modeled by a 3-dimensional spectral data activity relationship approach (3D-SDAR). Due to a lack of O-17 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) simulation software, the most informative carbon-carbon 3D-SDAR fingerprints were augmented with indicator variables representing oxygen atoms from carbonyl and carboxamide, ester, sulfonyl, nitro, aliphatic hydroxyl, and phenolic hydroxyl groups. To evaluate the true predictive performance of the authors' model the United States Environmental Protection Agency provided them with a blind test set consisting of 2008 compounds. Of these, 543 had available literature data-their binding affinity served to estimate the external classification accuracy of the developed model: predictive accuracy of 0.62, sensitivity of 0.71, and specificity of 0.53 were obtained. Compared with alternative modeling techniques, the authors' model displayed very little reduction in performance between the modeling and the prediction set. A 3D-SDAR mapping technique allowed identification of structural features essential for estrogenicity: 1) the presence of a phenolic OH group or cyclohexenone, 2) a second aromatic or phenolic ring at a distance of 6 angstrom to 8 angstrom from the oxygen of the first phenol ring, 3) the presence of a methyl group approximately 6 angstrom away from the centroid of a phenol ring, and 4) a carbonyl group in close proximity (similar to 4 angstrom measured to the centroid) to 1 of the phenol rings.

AB  - Regime shift and principal component analysis of a spatially disaggregated database capturing time-series of climatic, nutrient and plankton variables in the North Sea revealed considerable covariance between groups of ecosystem indicators. Plankton and climate time-series span the period 1958-2003, those of nutrients start in 1980. In both regions, the period from 1989 to 2001 identified in principal component I had warmer surface waters, higher Atlantic inflow and stronger winds, than the periods before or after. However, it was preceded by a regime shift in both open (PC2) and coastal (PC3) waters during 1977 towards more hours of sunlight and higher water temperature, which lasted until 1997. The relative influence of nutrient availability and climatic forcing differed between open and coastal North Sea regions. Inter-annual variability in phytoplankton dynamics of the open North Sea was primarily regulated by climatic forcing, specifically by sea surface temperature, Atlantic inflow and co-varying wind stress and NAO. Coastal phytoplankton variability, however, was regulated by insolation and sea surface temperature, as well as Si availability, but not by N or P. Regime shifts in principal components of hydrographic and climatic variables (explaining 55 and 61% of the variance in coastal and open water variables) were detected using Rodionov's sequential t-test. These shifts in hydroclimatic variables which occurred around 1977, 1989, 1997 and 2001, were synchronized in open and coastal waters, and were tracked by open water chlorophyll and copepods, but not by coastal plankton. North-central-south or open-coastal spatial breakdowns of the North Sea explained similar amounts of variability in most ecosystem indicators with the exception of diatom abundance and chlorophyll concentration, which were clearly better explained using the open-coastal configuration.

AB  - We utilized the terahertz time-domain spectroscopy system to differentiate the two polymorphs of progesterone and to identify the occurrence of interpolymorph transitions. The stable polymorph of progesterone was prepared by ethanol-mediated evaporating/cooling methods, and the metastable state was obtained by using pregnenolone as an additive. These two polymorphs show distinct different absorption spectrum in the terahertz region. As the metastable state of progesterone naturally converted to the stable state over time, the absorption mode of the metastable state disappeared and those of the stable state re-emerged. Interpolymorph transformations of progesterone can be rapidly identified using an apparent absorption mode as an indicator, which represents the existence of the metastable state of progesterone.

AB  - Changes in phenology are an ecological response to climate changes, in addition to other factors that may stress or dampen phonological responses. For this study, we investigated how climate variability can affect the phenology of the reproductive process of the anchovy Engraulis ringens. We used 29 years of sea surface temperature (SST) data and biological information from northern Chile stock, particularly, gonadosomatic index (GI), body condition (K), and mean weight (MTW) between 1988 and 2017. The Breaks for Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) method was applied to SST to estimate seasonal breaks and to correlate them with the seasonality of the GI. Seasonality and trend were extracted from the series to evaluate them as co-variables in GAM and GLM models in the explanation of the GI variability. The GAM model explained 56% of the variance, because it rescues the nonlinear relationships of the variables. The seasonality of the temperature explained 40%, followed by the body condition of the fish (10%). BFAST results indicate a seasonal change in SST, recording three periods: prior to 1993, 1994-1998 and after 2009. This seasonal change in the SST determines a delay in the start and the maximum in the GI. The K presented a negative relationship such as the MTW, associated with energy expenditure during the reproductive period. Faced with projections of climate change, the effects of the decoupling between larvae and the abundance during spring are not known; therefore, knowing the mechanisms that control phenology can improve our capacity to monitor and manage marine resources under climate change.

AB  - This study outlines the development and application of a new multimetric index (Greek Lake Benthic macro invertebrate Index - GLBiI) for the assessment of the ecological quality of Greek lakes, based on the ecological quality ratio (EQR), under the requirements of the Water Framework Directive. Profundal and sublittoral benthic macroinvertebrates from 18 lakes were biannually sampled across Greece. Additionally, 21 environmental parameters and 5 human pressures were assessed for each lake. The hindcasting approach was used for the establishment of reference conditions after minimizing human pressures. A pool of 84 candidate metrics, representing diversity/richness, sensitivity, functional traits, and taxonomical composition, were tested for the development of the multimetric index. Spearman's rank correlation extracted seven environmental parameters (lake area, mean depth, altitude, alkalinity, dissolved oxygen at bottom and conductivity at bottom) and three human pressures (total phosphorus, population density and non-natural land cover) that were further stepwise linear regressed against each biological metric for pressure-response relationships. Finally, three metrics, the number of taxa and the Simpson's diversity index in the profundal and sublittoral zones, and the relative contribution of Chironomidae (%) family in the profundal zone, were selected as the most appropriate, responding to eutrophication (expressed as total phosphorus and non-natural land cover). The multimetric index GLBiI was expressed as the mean of the EQRs of its metrics following a five class ecological status system. This assessment method may be used in other Mediterranean lakes with similar characteristics.

AB  - Land degradation reduces the production of biomass and vegetation cover for all forms of land use. The lack of specific data related to degradation is a severe limitation for its monitoring. Assessment of the current state of land degradation or desertification is very difficult because this phenomenon includes several complex processes. For that reason, no common agreement has been achieved among the scientific community for its assessment. This study was carried out as an attempt to develop a new approach for land degradation assessment, based on its current state by modifying of Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)-United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) index and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) index in Khuzestan province, southwestern Iran. Using the proposed evaluation method it is easy to understand the degree of destruction caused by the pursuit of low costs and in order to save time. Results showed that based on the percent of hazard classes in the current condition of land degradation, the most and least widespread areas of hazard classes are moderate (38.6 %) and no hazard (0.65 %) classes, respectively. Results in the desert component of the study area showed that the severe class is much more widespread than the other hazard classes, which could indicate an environmentally dangerous situation. Statistical results indicated that degradation is highest in deserts and rangeland areas compared to dry cultivated areas and forests. Statistical tests also showed that the average degradation amount in the arid region is higher than in other climates. It is hoped that this study's use of geospa-tial techniques will be found to be applicable in other regions of the world and can also contribute to better planning and management of land.

AB  - Ecosystem degradation is usually abrupt and unexpected shifts in ecosystem states that cannot be easily reversed. Some ecosystems might be subject to high risks of irreversible degradation (RID) because of strong undesirable resilience. In this study, we propose a probabilistic method to quantify RID by measuring the probability of the recovering threshold being unattainable under real world scenarios. Bayesian inference was used for parameter estimations and the posteriors were used to calculate the threshold for recovery and thereby the probability of it being unattainable, i.e., RID. We applied this method to lake eutrophication as an example. Our case study supported our hypothesis that ecosystems could be subject to high RID, as shown by the lake having a RID of 72% at the whole lake level. Spatial heterogeneity of RID was significant and certain regions were more susceptible to irreversible degradation, whereas others had higher chances of recovery. This spatial heterogeneity provides opportunities for mitigation because targeting regions with lower RID is more effective. We also found that pulse disturbances and ecosystem-based solutions had positive influences on lowering the RID. Pulse disturbances had the most significant influence on regions with higher RID, while ecosystem-based solutions performed best for regions with moderate RID, reducing RID to almost 0. Our method provides a practical framework to identify sensitive regions for conservation as well as opportunities for mitigation, which is applicable to a wide range of ecosystems. Our findings highlighted the worst scenario of irreversible degradation by providing a quantitative measure of the risk, thus raising further requirements and challenges for sustainability.

AB  - The amount of High Nature Value farmland (HNVf) is a commonly used environmental indicator for assessing the performance of the Common Agricultural Policy, to support sustainable agriculture and monitor changes in agricultural land use in Europe. HNVf comprises agricultural areas of semi-natural state, low-intensity farming and fine-scale landscape mosaics of different habitat types. For a successful implementation, the identification of HNVf should correctly reflect the variation in biodiversity values between different agricultural landscapes. We examined how well the Finnish HNVf indicator and the sub-indicators constituting it recalculated for the purposes of this study for five study regions reflect the variation in bird and butterfly species richness and diversity patterns at different spatial scales. We found that butterfly diversity index was positively associated with the HNVf indicator at the finest scale of 0.5 km x 0.5 km squares. Among the HNVf sub-indicators, extensive cultivation of grasslands was most strongly related to the farmland bird diversity and the density of edge to the butterfly diversity. Thus, the HNVf concept reflects well the distribution of butterflies in the Finnish agricultural landscapes but insufficiently the diversity patterns of farmland birds. Importantly, semi-natural vegetation and long-term pastures the backbone of the concept presently occur in small and highly fragmented patches in agricultural landscapes in Finland. The Pan-European concept of HNVf has restricted application to farmland birds of this boreal country and the national HNVf concept may need to be revised.

AB  - The aim of this research was to evaluate the acute toxicity of fenitrothion to the crayfish (Astacus leptodactylus Eschscholtz, 1823), which is chosen as an alternative aquatic organism to fish by using the static test system and evaluate the basic lipid peroxidation parameters for the first 24 h. Crayfish of 27.3 +/- 0.56 g mean weight and 10.0 +/- 0.72 cm mean length were selected for the bioassay experiments. The experiments were repeated three times in 20 liters of tap water. The temperature of water was 21 +/- 1 degrees C. The data obtained were statistically evaluated by using a computer program developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, based on Finney's probit analysis method and the 96-h LC50 value for crayfish was calculated to be 15.75 mu g/L. The 95% lower and upper confidence limits for the LC50 were 9.45 to 25.01 mu g/L. In addition to the acute toxicity bioassay experiments, 24-h oxidative stress parameters such as malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and ferrous oxidation assay (FOX HP[ hydrogen peroxide] equivalents) were also determined. Only MDA levels of hepatopancreas decreased at 5, 10, and 20 mu g/L of fenitrothion doses. We can conclude that fenitrothion is highly toxic to crayfish, a nontarget organism in the ecosystem, and the lipid peroxidation indicators can be easily used for monitoring environmental effects.

AB  - Identifying markers that are indicative of individual state, related to fitness, and which could be used to study life-history tradeoffs in wild populations is extremely difficult. Recently, it has been suggested that telomeres, the ends of eukaryote chromosomes, might be useful in this context. However, little is known of the link between telomere length and fitness in natural populations and whether it is a useful indicator of biological state. We measured average telomere length in red blood cell samples taken from a wide age range of individuals of a very long-lived and highly sexually dimorphic seabird, the southern giant petrel (Macronectes giganteus). We examined the relationship with age, sex, and subsequent survival over an 8-year period. Telomere length was longer in chicks than adults. Within the adult group, which ranged in age from 12 to 40 years, telomere length was not related to age. For the first time in birds, there was some evidence of a sex difference. Male giant petrels, which are substantially larger than females, had significantly shorter telomere lengths than females. This difference was evident from an early stage in life and is likely to relate to differences in growth trajectories. Those adults that died during the 8-year time window following the telomere length measurement had significantly shorter telomere lengths than those that survived this period, irrespective of age or sex, neither of which were significant predictors of survival. These results show that relatively short telomere length is related to future life expectancy at any adult age, demonstrating its usefulness as a state variable.

AB  - Biological indicators based on fish assemblage characteristics are used to assess stream condition worldwide. Fish-based bioassessment poses challenges in Southern New England, the USA, due to the effects of within-watershed thermal gradients on fish assemblage types, low regional species richness, and lack of minimally disturbed sites. Dual multi-metric indices (MMI) of biological condition were developed for wadeable streams based on fish assemblage characteristics sampled across watershed landscapes with varying levels of human disturbance. A coldwater MMI was developed using streams with drainage area of <= 15 km(2), and a mixed-water MMI for streams with drainage areas of >15 km(2). For each MMI development, candidate metrics represented by ecological classes were sequentially tested by metric range, within-year precision, correlation with stream size, responsiveness to landscape-level human disturbances, and redundancy. Resultant coldwater and mixed-water MMI were composed of 5 and 7 metrics, respectively. Stream sites tended to score similarly when the two MMI were applied to transitional sites, i.e., drainage areas of 5-40 km(2). However, some sites received high scores from the mixed-water MMI and intermediate scores from the coldwater MMI. It was thus difficult to ascertain high-quality mixed-water streams from potential coldwater streams which currently support mixed-water assemblages due to ecological degradation. High-quality coldwater streams were restricted to stream sites with drainage areas <= 15 km(2). The newly developed fish-based MMI will serve as a useful management tool and the dual-MMI development approach may be applicable to other regions with thermal gradients that transition from coldwater to warmwater within watersheds.

AB  - Carvacrol and thymol are the two main active components of oregano essential oil (OEO). In this study, the effect of carvacrol and thymol was evaluated separately, in combination and in their natural composition as natural OEO. A total of five treatments, i.e., negative control group, carvacrol, thymol, a combination of carvacrol and thymol and Orego-Stim (R) (OS, commercial product containing natural OEO From Origanum heracleoticum L) were added to the diets of channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) to investigate the effects of the respective treatments on the growth performance and antioxidant activity. After eight weeks of feeding, fishes were infected with Aeromonas hydrophila and mortality was recorded. Results of this study showed that channel catfish fed with natural OEO (OS), containing a combination of carvacrol, thymol and other minor constituents, significantly enhanced growth performance, which was the highest amongst all treatments (P < 0.05). The addition of OS also effectively enhanced hepatosomatic index (HSI), viscerosomatic index (VSI) and condition factor compared to the control diet (P < 0.05) and distinctly promoted the sedimentation of muscle protein. CS also remarkably enhanced the antioxidant activity of channel catfish. Both the combination of carvacrol and thymol and OS reduced fish mortality following A. hydrophila infection, but the lowest mortality was observed in the group fed with OS. It can be concluded that OS, which contains natural OEO extracted from O. heracleoticum L, can act as a growth promoter, increase antioxidant activity, enhance muscle protein sedimentation and also improve disease resistance to pathogens when added to channel catfish feed.

AB  - P50 suppression deficit has been reported in patients with psychotic bipolar disorder. In our previous report on twin pairs concordant and discordant for bipolar disorder, we found significant genetic overlap between bipolar disorder and P50 sensory gating. However, the sample size in that study was relatively small. A separate study, the Maudsley Bipolar Family Study, reported diminished P50 gating in unaffected relatives of psychotic bipolar patients. However, genetic and environmental influences are confounded in family studies due to lack of monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs. The current study combines the twin sample and the family sample in order to improve statistical power and study design, with the aims of. (1) substantiating the association between psychotic bipolar disorder and diminished P50 suppression and (2) verifying the genetic overlap between the two traits reported in the twin sample. We also assessed the relationship between bipolar disorder and an alternative suppression index, the P50 Condition-Testing (C-T) amplitude difference. A total of 309 subjects was included in this study, comprising 91 twin pairs, 31 bipolar families, and 45 unrelated healthy controls. Statistical analyses were based on structural equation modeling. Bipolar disorder was significantly associated with a diminished P50 suppression ratio and decreased C-T amplitude difference. Shared genetic factors were the main source of these associations. Suppression impairment was due to larger, poorly gated, T amplitude responses. The results provide further evidence that impaired P50 suppressions are promising endophenotypes for psychotic bipolar disorder. The non-specificity of impaired P50 suppression may reflect the impact of shared psychosis susceptibility genes. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The buffalo green monkey (BGM) cell line is required for the detection of enteric viruses in biosolids through a total culturable viral assay (TCVA) by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. In the present study, BGM and PLC/PRF/5 cell lines were evaluated for TCVA and for their use in determining the incidence of adenoviruses and enteroviruses in raw sludge and Class B biosolids. Six raw sludge and 17 Class B biosolid samples were collected from 13 wastewater treatment plants from seven U.S. states. Samples were processed via organic flocculation and concentrate volumes equivalent to 4 g total solids were assayed on BGM and PLC/PRF/5 cells. Cell monolayers were observed for cytopathic effect (CPE) after two 14-days passages. Cell lysates were tested for the presence of adenoviruses and enteroviruses by PCR or RT-PCR. The PLC/PRF/5 cells detected more culturable viruses than the BGM cells by CPE (73.9% vs. 56.5%, respectively). 52% of the samples were positive for CPE using both cell lines. No viruses were detected in either cell line by PCR in flasks in which CPE was not observed. No adenoviruses were detected in 13 CPE-positive samples from BGM lysates. In contrast, of the 17 samples exhibiting CPE on PLC/PRF/5 cells, 14 were positive for adenoviruses (82.4%). In conclusion, PLC/PRF/5 cells were superior for the detection of adenoviruses in both raw sludge and Class B biosolids. Thus, the use of BGM cells alone for TCVA may underestimate the viral concentration in sludge/biosolid samples.

AB  - Consistent expanding urbanization dramatically transforms natural habitats and exposes organisms to novel environmental challenges, often leading to reduced species richness and diversity in cities. However, it remains unclear how individuals are affected by the urban environment and how they can or cannot adjust to the specific characteristics of urban life (e.g. food availability). In this study, we used an integrative multi-component approach to investigate the effects of urbanization on the nutritional status of house sparrows (Passer domesticus). We assessed several morphological and physiological indices of body condition in both juveniles (early post-fledging) and breeding adults from four sites with different levels of urbanization in France, Western Europe. We found that sparrows in more urbanized habitats have reduced body size and body mass compared to their rural conspecifics. However, we did not find any consistent differences in a number of complementary indices of condition (scaled mass index, muscle score, hematocrit, baseline and stress-induced corticosterone levels) between urban and rural birds, indicating that urban sparrows may not be suffering nutritional stress. Our results suggest that the urban environment is unlikely to energetically constrain adult sparrows, although other urban-related variables may constrain them. On the other hand, we found significant difference in juvenile fat scores, suggesting that food types provided to young sparrows differed highly between habitats. In addition to the observed smaller size of urban sparrows, these results suggest that the urban environment is inadequate to satisfy early-life sparrows' nutritional requirements, growth, and development. The urban environment may therefore have life-long consequences for developing birds.

AB  - There is a pressing need to integrate biophysical and human dimensions science to better inform holistic ecosystem management supporting the transition from single species or single-sector management to multi-sector ecosystem-based management. Ecosystem-based management should focus upon ecosystem services, since they reflect societal goals, values, desires, and benefits. The inclusion of ecosystem services into holistic management strategies improves management by better capturing the diversity of positive and negative human-natural interactions and making explicit the benefits to society. To facilitate this inclusion, we propose a conceptual model that merges the broadly applied Driver, Pressure, State, Impact, and Response (DPSIR) conceptual model with ecosystem services yielding a Driver, Pressure, State, Ecosystem service, and Response (EBM-DPSER) conceptual model. The impact module in traditional DPSIR models focuses attention upon negative anthropomorphic impacts on the ecosystem; by replacing impacts with ecosystem services the EBM-DPSER model incorporates not only negative, but also positive changes in the ecosystem. Responses occur as a result of changes in ecosystem services and include inter alia management actions directed at proactively altering human population or individual behavior and infrastructure to meet societal goals. The EBM-DPSER conceptual model was applied to the Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas marine ecosystem as a case study to illustrate how it can inform management decisions. This case study captures our system-level understanding and results in a more holistic representation of ecosystem and human society interactions, thus improving our ability to identify trade-offs. The EBM-DPSER model should be a useful operational tool for implementing EBM, in that it fully integrates our knowledge of all ecosystem components while focusing management attention upon those aspects of the ecosystem most important to human society and does so within a framework already familiar to resource managers.

AB  - Soil salinity is a serious threat to agriculture sustainability worldwide. Seed germination is a critical phase that ensures the successful establishment and productivity of soybeans in saline soils. However, little information is available regarding soybean salt tolerance at the germination stage. The objective of this study was to identify the genetic mechanisms of soybean seed germination under salt stress. One natural population consisting of 191 soybean landraces was used in this study. Soybean seeds produced in four environments were used to evaluate the salt tolerance at their germination stage. Using 1142 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the molecular markers associated with salt tolerance were detected by genome-wide association analysis. Eight SNP-trait associations and 13 suggestive SNP-trait associations were identified using a mixed linear model and the TASSEL 4.0 software. Eight SNPs or suggestive SNPs were co-associated with two salt tolerance indices, namely (1) the ratio of the germination index under salt conditions to the germination index under no-salt conditions (ST-GI) and (2) the ratio of the germination rate under salt conditions to the germination rate under no-salt conditions (ST-GR). One SNP (BARC-021347-04042) was significantly associated with these two traits (ST-GI and ST-GR). In addition, nine possible candidate genes were located in or near the genetic region where the above markers were mapped. Of these, five genes, Glyma08g12400.1, Glyma08g09730.1, Glyma18g47140.1, Glyma09g00460.1, and Glyma09g00490.3, were verified in response to salt stress at the germination stage. The SNPs detected could facilitate a better understanding of the genetic basis of soybean salt tolerance at the germination stage, and the marker BARC-021347-04042 could contribute to future breeding for soybean salt tolerance by marker-assisted selection.

AB  - Objective: Dermatomyositis (DM) may result from exogenous triggers, including airborne pollutants, in genetically susceptible individuals. The United States Environmental Protection Agency's 2011 National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) models health risks associated with airborne emissions, available by ZIP code tabulation area (ZCTA). Important contributors include point (fixed), on-road, and secondary sources. The objective of this study was to investigate the geospatial distributions of DM and subtypes, classic DM (CDM) and clinically amyopathic DM (CADM), and their associations with airborne pollutants.
   Methods: This retrospective cohort study identified 642 adult DM patients from 336 unique ZCTAs. GeoDa v.1.10 was used to calculate global and local Moran's indices and generate local indicator of spatial autocorrelation (LISA) maps. All Moran's indices and LISA maps were permuted 999 times.
   Results: Univariate global Moran's indices for DM, CDM, and CADM prevalence were not significant, but LISA maps demonstrated differential local spatial clustering and outliers. CADM prevalence correlated with point sources (bivariate global Moran's index 0.071, pseudo-p = 0.018), in contrast to CDM (-0.0053, pseudo-p = 0.46). Bivariate global Moran's indices for DM, CDM, and CADM prevalence did not correlate with other airborne toxics, but bivariate LISA maps revealed local spatial clustering and outliers.
   Conclusion: Prevalence of CADM, but not CDM, is geospatially correlated with fixed sources of airborne emissions. This effect is small but significant and may support the hypothesis that triggering exposures influence disease phenotype. Important limitations are NATA data and ZCTA population estimates were collected from 2011 and ZCTA of residence may not have been where patients had greatest airborne pollutant exposure.

AB  - Drought resistance of rice is a complex trait and is mainly determined by mechanisms of drought avoidance and drought tolerance. The present study was conducted to characterize the genetic basis of drought resistance at reproductive stage in field by analyzing the QTLs for drought response index (DRI, normalized by potential yield and flowering time), relative yield, relative spikelet fertility, and four traits of plant water status and their relationships with root traits using a recombinant inbred population derived from a cross between an indica rice and upland rice. A total of 39 QTLs for these traits were detected with individual QTL explained 5.1-32.1% of phenotypic variation. Only two QTLs for plant water status were commonly detected in two environments, suggesting different mechanisms might exist in two types of soil conditions. DRI has no correlation with potential yield and flowering time under control, suggesting that it can be used as a good drought resistance index in field conditions. The co-location of QTLs for canopy temperature and delaying in flowering time suggested a usefulness of these two traits as indexes in drought resistance screening. Correlation and QTL congruence between root traits and putative drought tolerance traits revealed that drought avoidance (via thick and deep root traits) was the main genetic basis of drought resistance in sandy soil condition, while drought tolerance may play more role in the genetic basis of drought resistance in paddy soil condition. Therefore, both drought mechanisms and soil textures must be considered in the improvement of drought resistance at reproductive stage in rice.

AB  - In recent years, coal combustion by-products have attracted much attention because of their large production volume, adverse environmental effects of potentially toxic elements, and as potential sources of critical metals. In order to better evaluate the leaching characteristics of alkaline coal combustion by-products, the Leaching Environment Assessment Framework (LEAF) proposed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency was adopted in this study. Depending upon the properties of the samples, the test methods used in this paper mainly included Methods 1313, 1314, and 1316. The liquid-solid partitioning curves of samples were drawn according to the results of chemical analysis. Samples were collected from the coal-fired Sunzhuang Power Plant, Hebei Province, China. The leaching characteristics of coal combustion by-products are discussed from three aspects: pH values, liquid-solid ratios, and accumulated liquid-solid ratios. According to the trend of the liquid-solid partitioning curves, the modes of occurrence and causes of mobility of trace elements in the coal combustion by-products are discussed. To assess the potential environmental risk of hazardous elements leached from coal combustion by-products, the maximum leaching values of hazardous elements were compared to the upper limit value of the Type III Chinese groundwater quality standard, suggesting that in the eluates of Method 1313, arsenic, selenium, beryllium, thallium, nickel, and lead contents in the eluates of fly ash and bottom ash exceed the recommended upper limit. However, in the eluates of Methods 1314 and 1316, selenium, molybdenum, barium, and nickel exceed the recommended upper limit.

AB  - Iconic sagebrush ecosystems of the American West are threatened by larger and more frequent wildfires that can kill sagebrush and facilitate invasion by annual grasses, creating a cycle that alters sagebrush ecosystem recovery post disturbance. Thwarting this accelerated grass-fire cycle is at the forefront of current national conservation efforts, yet its impacts on wildlife populations inhabiting these ecosystems have not been quantified rigorously. Within a Bayesian framework, we modeled 30 y of wildfire and climatic effects on population rates of change of a sagebrush-obligate species, the greater sage-grouse, across the Great Basin of western North America. Importantly, our modeling also accounted for variation in sagebrush recovery time post fire as determined by underlying soil properties that influence ecosystem resilience to disturbance and resistance to invasion. Our results demonstrate that the cumulative loss of sagebrush to direct and indirect effects of wildfire has contributed strongly to declining sage-grouse populations over the past 30 y at large spatial scales. Moreover, long-lasting effects from wildfire nullified pulses of sage-grouse population growth that typically follow years of higher precipitation. If wildfire trends continue unabated, model projections indicate sage-grouse populations will be reduced to 43% of their current numbers over the next three decades. Our results provide a timely example of how altered fire regimes are disrupting recovery of sagebrush ecosystems and leading to substantial declines of a widespread indicator species. Accordingly, we present scenario-based stochastic projections to inform conservation actions that may help offset the adverse effects of wildfire on sage-grouse and other wildlife populations.

AB  - One of the deadliest forms of malignancy affecting females worldwide alongside breast cancer is cervical cancer, which urgently calls for novel treatment approaches. Gold nanocarriers are attaining acceptance due to their inert nature, minimal side-effects, low cytotoxicity and easy fabrication. Synthesis of gold nanorods conjugated with graphene and folic acid was carried out, which were finally loaded with bevacizumab for improved therapeutics. The drug loaded folic acid conjugated graphene-gold nanorods were irradiated with non-infrared laser for improved penetration of the drugs into the specifically targeted tissue. The graphene-gold nanorods with/without drugs and irradiation at different power densities (0.25 and 0.5 W/cm(2)) were studied. Transmission electron microscopy, zeta potential and polydispersity index established the integrity of prepared graphene nanorods carriers. The encapsulation efficiency and drug loading of the graphene-gold nanorods were determined. In vitro cytotoxicity assay was carried out via 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, or MTT assay, with HeLa cells. There was non-significant difference between drug loading and encapsulation with irradiated and non-irradiated graphene-gold nanorods. But with irradiation the blank graphene-gold nanorods had increased cytotoxicity. The graphene-gold nanorods were released in a sustained manner as depicted by in vitro release studies. The drug loaded nanorods were also internalized by HeLa cells and distributed within the cellular compartment. We also tested drug loaded folic acid conjugated graphene-gold rods in vivo in U8GMG tumor bearing mice and results clearly indicated the irradiated ones were most efficient in suppressing tumors.

AB  - We developed a pilot study on the potential of aquatic plants as indicators of ecological quality in tropical rivers to provide an index of biotic integrity for monitoring, conservation, and restoration purposes. We used floristic, environmental, and anthropogenic disturbance data from a 950 km(2) river basin in the southern littoral area of Sao Paulo State, Brazil (Itanhaem River Basin), and proposed a five-step methodological framework for the development of a macrophyte index in tropical river basins. Field surveys were carried out in 137 sites (Spring 2013-2014) of Itanhaem River for the index development and in 27 sites of Itapanhad River (Spring 2015) for its validation. A total of 44 aquatic plant species were recorded in the study area, and 11 metrics were evaluated as potential core metrics of the index. Principal Component Analysis distinguished two river types mostly related to geomorphological characteristics - the Upper river type in the mountainous region (average slope 23.7 degrees) and the Middle-low river type (average slope 9.2 degrees) in the floodplain. The Upper river catchment was characterized by extensive areas occupied by banana plantations, low water conductivity, sandy substrates, and homogeneous aquatic vegetation, whereas the Middle-low river catchment had more urban settlements and displayed high nitrogen and phosphorus contents in water and sediments. The index (MIBI-ITA) is preliminary and was based on species richness and life forms (e.g. submerged hydrophytes, helophytes). MIBI-ITA could only be developed for the lowlands and displayed a high discriminatory ability for distinguishing disturbance and a good performance with external data. Bioassessment in tropical rivers require further investigation on biogeography and long-term responses of macrophyte populations to stressors, as well as knowledge-base on river typology and functional traits of macrophytes, other than morpho-anatomic traits and diversity measures.

AB  - The objective of this study was to develop a rapid multimetric index using benthic macrofauna as bioindicators of ecological conditions for the upper reaches of the Piabanha-Paquequer-Preto Basin located in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A total of 33698 macroinvertebrates were collected in 27 sites. Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled using the multi-habitat method that consists in sampling 20 m(2) of substrate collected in approximate proportion to the representation of all major habitat types in the reach. A subsampling procedure was used. The main steps followed to develop and test the index were: exclusion of unsuitable metrics using box-whisker plots, considering the degree of overlapping among interquartile limits (1 degrees-3 degrees) and confirmed by Mann-Whitney U test (p <= 0.05) using six reference rivers and six impaired rivers. From all the candidate potential metrics, 36 were considered suitable. After identifying redundant metrics, through Spearman correlation analysis, and considering practical application criteria, six core metrics were selected to compose the Piabanha-Paquequer-Preto Multimetric Index (PPPMI) using the continuous method: Family richness, Shannon-Wiener family diversity, EPT family richness, %Diptera, %MOLD (Mollusca + Diptera) and %Collectors. The sensitivity of the index was tested in 15 rivers using a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of the six environmental variables. The first axis of the PCA was highly correlated to the PPPMI scores (r = 0.703, p < 0.001). The PPPMI responded to a set of environmental variables associated to a gradient of human disturbance affecting the ecological condition of the waterbodies. This indicates that the PPPMI is an effective tool for biological monitoring and decision making in the hydrographic region of the Piabanha-Paquequer-Preto rivers.

AB  - To effectively manage a river system, systematic tracking and diagnosing the change and risks of a river system are essentially required to efficiently conserve or restore its conditions. Hence, this study focuses on how to integrate current status assessment, trend prediction, and cause diagnosis in river health to guide early warning decision-making in river protection and management. This study has presented a three-phase approach by coupling spatial with nonspatial information in a highly systematic and reliable way, and an early warning system has been designed. In phase I, the current health status is assessed and nowcasted by using the order degree of each indicator. In phase II, health predictors, including the single perspective-based health index (HI) (e.g., water quality index (WQI) and index of biotic integrity (IBI)) and multi-perspective-based health index, have been forecasted under normal conditions or emerging conditions using predictive models. In phase III, key causal factors threatening the river health have been identified to enable early notification and to address unexpected events before occurrence. Although different modeling methods can be used in each phase to demonstrate this concept, we tested the model of partial least square regression (PLSR) associated with time series. Additionally, the three-phase approach has been integrated with geographic information system (GIS) and a decision support system (DSS) to develop a river health prediction and early warning system (RHP-EWS), an automatic prediction and decision-making tool. This tool was implemented to deal with the landing of typhoon "Maria" in 2018 into the Shanxi River watershed in China. Because of the timely responses and decisions, the drinking water supply was not influenced. However, the models should be extended to other river systems for testing and improvement at different temporal or spatial scales.

AB  - The Pelagiques Gascogne (PELGAS) integrated survey has been developed by a multidisciplinary team of Ifremer and La Rochelle University scientists since 2000, joined by commercial fishermen in 2007. Its initial focus was to assess the biomass and predict the recruitment success of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay in spring. Taking advantage of the space and versatility of R/V Thalassa II, sampling has been progressively extended to other ecosystem components. PELGAS therefore further developed the second objective of monitoring and studying the dynamic and diverse Biscay pelagic ecosystem in springtime. The PELGAS survey model has allowed for the establishment of a long-term time-series of spatially-explicit data of the Bay of Biscay pelagic ecosystem since the year 2000. Main sampled components of the targeted ecosystem are: hydrology, phytoplankton, mesozooplankton, fish and megafauna. The survey now provides two main ecosystem products: standard raster maps of ecosystem parameters, and a time series dataset of indicators of the Bay of Biscay pelagic ecosystem state. They are used to inform fish stock and ecosystem-based management, and support ecosystem research. The present paper introduces the PELGAS survey, as a practical example of an integrated, vessel-based, ecosystem survey. The evolution of the PELGAS scientific team and sampling protocols are presented and analysed, to outline factors crucial to the success of the survey. Data and results derived from PELGAS are reviewed, to exemplify scientific questions that can be tackled by integrated ecosystem survey data. Advantages and challenges of the survey are discussed and put into the context of marine ecosystem surveys in the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the Common Fisheries Policy.

AB  - An integrated geochemical and toxicological assessment of environmental mercury contamination and attendant human exposure in Honda Bay, Palawan was undertaken in 1995 following a nationally reported pollution scare centered on a coastal jetty, Sitio Honda Bay, constructed using approximately 1 million tons of tailings and beneficiation waste from a cinnabar mine. Mercury (Hg) data for marine and fluvial sediments, fish tissues and human hair indicate that the toxicological hazard is considerably lower than initially reported by state environment and health officials. Typical Hg concentrations in surficial Honda Bay sediments were found to lie within the global background range (<60 mu g/kg). Downcore profiles provide no evidence of enhanced Hg fluxes coincident with the onset of mining and/or coastal tailings disposal. The mean and median Hg concentrations recorded in tissues of six species of Honda Bay fish are compliant with thresholds established by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) for marketable stocks. Earlier reports of 'Minamata range' Hg concentrations in fish and shellfish from Honda Bay remain unsubstantiated. Geochemical analyses of samples of the Sitio Honda Bay substrate have confirmed the prevalence of solid-phase Hg concentrations to ca. 340 mg/kg. The speciation of Hg is, however, dominated by secondary oxides of low bioavailability. The mean Hg concentration in hair from Sitio Honda Bay residents (4.41 mg/kg) was found to be statistically analogous to that for a neighbouring coastal community unimpacted by the coastal disposal of mine waste. A negligible residential exposure factor is thus inferred for the former. Relatively high hair Hg burdens prevail throughout the coastal Honda Bay population, consistent wit significant methyl Hg ingestion through daily fish consumption. The data presented provide no environmental or toxicological justification for immediate remedial action.

AB  - We argue that two problems weaken the claims of those who link corruption and the exploitation of natural resources, The first is conceptual and the second is methodological. Studies that use national-level indicators of corruption fail to note that corruption comes in many forms, at multiple levels, that may affect resource use quite differently: negatively, positively, or not at all. Without a clear causal model of the mechanism by which corruption affects resources, one should treat with caution any estimated relationship between corruption and the state of natural resources. Simple, atheoretical models linking corruption measures and natural resource use typically do not account for other important control variables pivotal to the relationship between humans and natural resources. By way of illustration of these two general concerns, we used statistical methods to demonstrate that the findings of a recent, well-known study that posits a link between corruption and decreases in forests and elephants are not robust to simple conceptual and methodological refinements. In particular, once we controlled for a few plausible anthropogenic and biophysical conditioning factors, estimated the effects in changes rather than levels so as not to confound cross-sectional and longitudinal variation, and incorporated additional observations from the same data sources, corruption levels no longer bad any explanatory power.

AB  - We intend to estimate the value of ecosystem services in the U.S. State of New Jersey using spatially explicit benefit transfer. The aggregated net rent, a conservative underestimate for the total economic value of the state's natural environment, ranged from $11.6 to $19.6 billion/year, conditional on how inclusive we were in selecting the primary studies used to calculate the central tendency values to transfer. In addition to calculating the range, mean, and standard deviation for each of 12 ecosystem services for 11 Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) types, we also conduct a gap analysis of how well ecosystem service values are represented in the literature. We then map these values by assuming a mean value for each LULC and apply this to spatial data. As to sensitivity analysis, we calculate the net present value of New Jersey's natural environment utilizing three different methods of discounting. These research results provide a useful, albeit imperfect, basis for assessing the value of ecosystem services and natural capital, and their comparison with the value of conventional human and built capitals.

AB  - Moncayo-Estrada R, Lyons J, Escalera-Gallardo C, and Lind OT. 2012. Long-term change in the biotic integrity of a shallow tropical lake: A decadal analysis of the Lake Chapala fish community. Lake Reserv Manage. 28:92-104.
   We describe the successful application of a 4-decade analysis of an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) demonstrating its assessment value when applied to the fish community of Lake Chapala. We based our analysis on fish community and fishery composition and on the proportion and density of native and exotic species for each decade. Fisheries landings and IBI values document a long-term downward trend since the 1970s. Data from the 1990s and 2000s reveal a dramatic drop in the IBI score to 20 points (out of a possible 100), a rating of very poor. The fisheries collapse and the loss of 11 native species as a consequence of habitat degradation and invasive species have reduced native fish biomass and richness. Fluctuations in rainfall, principally, and water-extraction related to human activities have had a major impact on the lake. Additionally, water quality deterioration has been caused by a lack of wastewater treatment. The fish community has been further modified by large increases in the number and biomass of exotic fishes. Although the exact degree of decline in biotic integrity is impossible to determine because of uncertainty about the representativeness and accuracy of some historical information, the analysis of the temporal changes in the IBI provides compelling evidence for an accelerating drop in ecosystem health. The application of IBI, which is broad in scope and has flexible data requirements, can serve as a template for assessing trends in other water bodies with a history of fisheries data but limited standardized monitoring of the fish community.

AB  - Fat accumulation in the mesenteric adipose tissue is a serious problem in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) culture. Lipid droplet-related proteins (LDRPs) are involved in the formation, degradation, and biological functions of lipid droplets. In this study, we aimed to provide reference proteomics data to study lipid droplet regulation in fish. We isolated LDRPs from the mesenteric adipose tissue of grass carp (1-year-old) after normal feeding and 7 days of starvation, and identified and analysed them using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technology. Short-term starvation had no significant effect on the body weight, condition factor, visceral index, hepatopancreas index, intraperitoneal fat index, adipose tissue triglyceride content, and adipocyte size of grass carp. Nine hundred and fifty proteins were identified and annotated using the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases; they are involved in a variety of metabolic and signalling pathways, including amino acid, lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism, and the PI3KAkt signalling pathway. There were 296 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), with 143 up-regulated and 153 down-regulated proteins. Three proteins involved in triglyceride and fatty acid syntheses and two proteins involved in autophagy were up-regulated, and six proteins involved in lipid catabolism were down-regulated. These results indicate that under short-term starvation, lipid droplets in the adipose tissue of grass carp may maintain their shape by promoting fat production and inhibiting lipolysis, and autophagy may be one of the main strategies for coping with short-term energy deprivation.

AB  - Differences in the prevalence and abundance of helminth parasites amongst host populations may result from variations in resistance to infection, differences in habitat preferences, diet or social behaviour. The use of helminth parasites as 'ecological markers' for determining differences between morphological groups of wild-living cats in Scotland was investigated, in light of the debate over the definition of a wildcat. The prevalence and abundance of the tapeworm Taenia taeniaeformis did not differ significantly between cats designated as 'wild' and 'feral' types. The prevalence of both helminths was high (94% and 69%, respectively) and there was significant variation in worm abundance related to season and geographical area. Also, prevalence of infection with Toxocara cati was significantly higher in female cats. Cats which harboured large numbers of one worm species were also likely to harbour large numbers of the other. However, a possible relationship with cat condition was only found for T. taeniaeformis for which there was a significant negative correlation between an index of cat condition and worm abundance amongst 'wild type' cats, but not amongst 'feral type' cats. Variations in worm burdens could not be attributed to differences in the diet of the cats as there was no significant relationship between the presence of any individual prey type and either the presence or abundance of T. cati or T. taeniaeformis. There was a significant negative correlation between density and biomass of individual worms in infections of T. taeniaeformis, suggestive of a density-dependent constraint on tapeworm growth.

AB  - Mediterranean infralittoral soft bottoms are dominated by extensive seagrass meadows of the endemic phanerogam Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile. Both leaves and rhizomes are substrates suitable for colonization by a vast array of epiphytic organisms, including foraminifera. Epiphytic foraminifera are very useful bioindicators, because of their relatively short life cycles and their quick reaction to environmental changes at global and local scales. To evaluate the environmental conditions reflected by the foraminiferal assemblages in P. oceanica-dominated environments, the FORAM Index (FI) has been slightly modified to include changes to the ecological categories defined in the original Langer A-D morphotype scheme. Sensitive, long-lived species are now represented by the SB and A* groups; the stress-tolerant taxa correspond to D*; and the small heterotrophic forms are still represented by B and C. Consequently, the FI was modified as follows: FI' = 10 x (P-A*+P-SB) + P-D* + 2 X (P-B+P-C). The Posidonia oceanica foraminiferal assemblage contains very abundant B and C forms that remain more or less constant regardless of environmental conditions as they do not have as strict requirements for light and substrate as the A* and SB groups. Moreover, B and C taxa are not as well-adapted to stressful conditions as is D*. Therefore, to magnify the differences between, a priori, minimally altered and stressed areas, a new index is calculated. The "long vs. short life span" index (I-LS), which is expressed as: I-LS = (3.5 X (P-A* + P-SB) + 0.01) / (P-D* + 0.01). Index I-LS has a high correlation with the modified FORAM Index, which was developed to characterize water quality. Index I-LS can be used as a reference for the quality assessment and preservation of P. oceanica meadows.

AB  - Boka Kotorska bay is a unique coastal ecosystem in the south-eastern Adriatic Sea that has been recently under the increasing influence of human activities. In this paper, we investigated the temporal distribution of biological and environmental parameters and the trophic state of the Bay. Sampling was conducted weekly from March 2008 to February 2009 in the inner part of the Bay (Kotor Bay). The phytoplankton biomass ranged between < 1 to > 4 mu g l(-1) chlorophyll a (Chl a), reaching maximum values in the late winter and spring period. On the basis of Chl a and nutrient concentrations, the study area can be defined oligo-mesotrophic. Two indicators of the trophic state, trophic index - TRIX and the pigment ratio - Fp were calculated from the available physiochemical and biological data. The TRIX value ranged from 3.02 to 5.58 (average 4.11 +/- 0.66) while the Fp ratio varied between 0.05 and 0.33 (average 0.17 +/- 0.08). These results indicate a system that is in a good trophic state, where natural eutrophication still dominates over eutrophication of an anthropogenic origin.

AB  - The concept of an Ideal Soil (IS) has been presented in a previous paper where soil attributes have been grouped in four functions or services that they must render to crops. However, attributes of an IS have critical values, which must be above certain Critical Thresholds (CT). Here we are proposing some edaphic variables which are taken as parameters of the physical state, chemical composition and biological activity of such soils (especially in Mollisols in Argentinian North Pampean Region). Based on our own experience, we also show the appropriate measurement techniques and critical thresholds of the soils.

AB  - Stream bank condition is an important physical form indicator for streams related to the environmental condition of riparian corridors. This research developed and applied an approach for mapping bank condition from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and high-spatial resolution optical image data in a temperate forest/woodland/urban environment. Field observations of bank condition were related to LiDAR and optical image-derived variables, including bank slope, plant projective cover, bank-full width, valley confinement, bank height, bank top crenulation, and ground vegetation cover. Image-based variables, showing correlation with the field measurements of stream bank condition, were used as input to a cumulative logistic regression model to estimate and map bank condition. The highest correlation was achieved between field-assessed bank condition and image-derived average bank slope (R-2 = 0.60, n = 41), ground vegetation cover (R-2 = 0.43, n = 41), bank width/height ratio (R-2 = 0.41, n = 41), and valley confinement (producer's accuracy = 100%, n = 9). Cross-validation showed an average misclassification error of 0.95 from an ordinal scale from 0 to 4 using the developed model. This approach was developed to support the remotely sensed mapping of stream bank condition for 26,000 km of streams in Victoria, Australia, from 2010 to 2012. (C) The Authors.

AB  - The Quaternary aeolian deposits in the Sichuan Basin consist of three stratigraphic units. With the increasing depth, they are the Chengdu clay, brown clay, and red clay. The differences in the pedogenic features of these clays and the sensitivity of the weathering indices of the paleo-aeolian sediments to the present environment remain unclear. Based on the weathering indices of the particle size distribution, mineralogical composition, and element geochemistry, we investigated the pedogenic features of the three clay layers and some modern soils in the Sichuan Basin in China. Based on the results, the Chengdu clay and the underlying clays have all experienced more than moderate weathering, and the intensity of the weathering decreased from the red clay to the Chengdu clay to the brown clay, indicating a climatic evolution from hot and wet to cold and dry to warm and wet since the mid-Pleistocene in the Sichuan Basin. Compared with the underlying parent materials, the modern soils have lower weathering index values (SiO2/(Al2O3+FeO3) and SiO2/Al2O3) and higher Rb/Sr ratios. Although the grain size compositions, chemical index of alteration (CIA), (K2O+Na2O)/Al2O3, and rare earth element (REE) signatures of the paleo-aeolian sediments remained unchanged under the present conditions, the pedogenic index values of the paleo-aeolian sediment outcrops exhibited a varied sensitivity to the present environment. Therefore, the unchanged indices may be more suitable for estimating the paleoenvironment when using exhumed and relict paleosols.

AB  - The Intra-Americas Sea (IAS) low-level jet has been studied mainly for the summer and winter seasons. In contrast, spring conditions have been studied less. Here we analyze the boreal spring variability of the IAS low-level jet (IA-LLJ) and its relation with precipitation and tornadic activity in the region of the lower Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio River basins (MORB). The main mode of variability of the spring IA-LLJ is obtained from a combined principal component analysis of zonal and meridional winds at 925-hPa. The first empirical orthogonal function of the IA-LLJ is a strengthening of the climatological flow with stronger easterlies in the Caribbean and stronger southeasterlies in the Gulf of Mexico. This first mode of variability of the IA-LLJ is related mainly to the Pacific North American (PNA) teleconnection pattern as the PNA modulates the pressure in the southeast region of the U.S. Consequently, there is an increase in precipitation over the MORB region as the moisture fluxes associated with the IA-LLJ increase. Tornadic activity in nine states spanning the MORB region is also significantly related to the IA-LLJ and the PNA index for March, in addition to the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and the Nino indexes. Among the environmental factors that influence tornadic activity are southwesterly wind shear, dry transients at the mid-troposphere, moist transients at low levels, and an increase in convective available potential energy (CAPE). The decadal shifts in MORB precipitation and tornado activity appear to be related to the decadal shift of the IA-LLJ.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING FOR GAS TURBINES AND POWER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME
LA  - English
CP  - 48th International Gas Turbine and Aeroengine Congress and Exhibition
AB  - The application of a gas turbine generally allows to increase the number of possible configurations of cogenerated heat and electrical power systems, which became a significant substitute for classic, coal-fired power plants. They are characterized by better thermodynamical, economical, ecological, and operating indexes. Gas turbine units are also the best option for the modernization of existing power plants. This paper discusses the effectiveness of various technological configurations with gas turbines, which are to be applied during modernization projects of already existing conventional combined heat and power plants. In the analysis enthalpy and entropy methods were applied. Algorithms of the entropy method allow to determine the entropy generation in each section of a combined heat and power (CHP) plant. Several criteria were taken into consideration while analyzing the effectiveness of technological cycle configurations with gas turbines. These include the energy effectiveness, the efficiency of the HRSG and the steam cycle, the efficiency of the whole thermal electric power station, the exergetic efficiency of the HRSG and the steam cycle, and the fuel efficiency index. It was assumed that gas turbines operate under their nominal conditions. The composite curves were also taken into consideration while choosing the type of the turbine. The modernization project tends not to eliminate those existing power plant sections (machines and equipment), which are able to operate further. The project suggests that those units should remain in the system, which satisfy the applied durability criterion. The last phase of the optimization project focuses on the sensibility verification of several steam-gas CHP plant parameters and their influence on the whole system.

AB  - Recently, the concurrent use of multiple taxonomic groups in stream bioassessment is becoming increasingly common because the responses of each group to anthropogenic stressors may be different. In this study, a multimetric index based on fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages for the Huntai River basin (MMIHT) was developed using a dataset covering 54 sampling sites in order to assess ecosystem health. An index of land use, water, and habitat quality (ILWHQ) was calculated to evaluate the environmental quality at the studied sites. The five least deteriorated sites (ILWHQ < 2; T13, T15, T16, T17, and T18) were selected as the reference sites. Seven of an initial 68 candidate metrics were selected using a stepwise procedure that evaluated metric stability, responsiveness to environmental variables, and redundancy. The selected metrics included number of Cyprinidae species, the proportion of individuals as benthic species, the proportion of omnivore species, the proportion of individuals as tolerant species, the proportion of demersal egg species, number of EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plectopera, and Trichoptera) taxa, and the proportion of clingers. The ration scoring method was used to score the seven metrics and four classes were defined to describe the ecosystem health of the Huntai River basin. The findings that the final multimetric index was negatively correlated with the ILWHQ and successfully differentiated reference from impaired condition indicated that the index should be useful for evaluating river conditions. According to the results, more than half of the sites (57.4%) were classified as poor or very poor. The ecosystem health in the Taizi River was better than that in the Hun River. Furthermore, testing with additional data is needed to assess the suitability and robustness of the index.

AB  - This review examines the literature available on the state of the environment and environmental protection in the Russian Federation. As the largest country on Earth, rich in natural resources and biodiversity, Russia's problems and policies have global consequences. Environmental quality and management are influenced by the legacy of Soviet economic planning and authoritarian governance, as well as by Russia's post-Soviet economic recession and current strategies of economic development. Russia achieved a reduction in some pollutants owing to the collapse of industrial production in the 1990s, but many environmental indicators suggest growing degradation. Russia has signed on to a number of international environmental agreements, but its record on implementation is mixed, and it discourages environmental activism. Scholarship on the Russian environment is a limited, but growing, field, constrained by challenges of data availability, yet it offers great potential for testing scientific and social scientific hypotheses.

AB  - Opuntia ficus-indica (L.) Mill., a prickly pear cactus cultivated worldwide for its fruits and stem segments, can have an annual dry weight productivity exceeding that of many crops. Using a recently introduced environmental productivity index (EPI), the influences of water status, temperature, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) on its productivity can be predicted. This investigation calculated the water index the temperature index, and the PAR index, whose product equals EPI, for 169 sites distributed approximately uniformly across the contiguous USA for present climatic conditions as well as for those associated with an elevated CO2 concentration of 650-mu-L L-1. The effect of elevated CO2 on growth of O. ficus-indica was directly measured, and low temperature limitations on productivity were considered. The dry weight gain of O. ficus-indica during 6 mo in an environmental growth chamber was 23% greater at 650 compared with 350-mu-L L-1 CO2 and increased as the duration of the wet period increased, in agreement with predictions of the water index (the fraction of maximal net CO2 uptake during a 24-h period for the prevailing plant water status). For closely spaced plants that lead to a high productivity per unit ground area, EPI averaged about 0.10, except in desert regions where the water index lowered EPI, in the far North or South and at high elevations where the temperature index lowered EPI, and in the Northeast and Northwest where the PAR index lowered EPI. The predicted annual dry weight productivity for O. ficus-indica was 12.8 Mg ha-1 yr-1 under current conditions, and 16.3 Mg ha-1 yr-1 under those associated with 650-mu-L L-1 CO2. Both productivities are relatively high compared with other agronomic plants. The percentage of sites where temperatures fall below - 15-degrees-C at least once during the 10 years simulated, which would be lethal to most prickly pear cacti, was reduced from 49 to 18% by the general warming expected to accompany an approximate doubling of the atmospheric CO2 concentration.

AB  - Enzymatic and histopathologic alterations of the digestive gland, gill, gonad, and kidney were studied in Asian cram (Potamocorbula amurensis) in April, 1997 from each of four United Stales Geological Survey (USGS) stations in the San Francisco Estuary. Stations were selected based on differing body burdens of metallic contaminants in crams (Stn 4.1>6.1>8.1>12.5) observed over 7 years. Because no pristine sites are known within the estuary and because no laboratory-reared stocks of P. amurensis were available, clams from station 12.5 served as reference animals. Histopathologic analysis revealed no lesions in clams corrected from station 12.5. Mild digestive gland atrophy and moderate distal kidney tubular vacuolation were seen in clams collected from station 8.1. Mild digestive gland atrophy, moderate kidney tubular atrophy, and moderate gill inflammation were seen in clams collected from station 6.1. Lesions found only in clams from station 4.1 were: (1) severe inflammation and moderate atrophy of primary ducts and diverticula, and decreased numbers of heterophagosomes and heterolysosomes in diverticula of the digestive gland; (2) severe gill inflammation; (3) severe kidney tubular atrophy; (4) severe ovarian and testicular inflammation and necrosis; (5) decreased numbers of mature ova; and (6) decreased number of glycogen storage cells in the ovary and testis. Localization of specific enzymes including adenosine triphosphatase (ATP), acid phosphatase (ACP), alkaline phosphatase (ALKP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) was performed and correlated, in serial sections with glycogen (PAS) and haematoxylin and eosin stains. Enzymatic analysis revealed: (1) increased digestive diverticula ATP in stations 6.1 and 4.1; (2) decreased digestive diverticula ACP in stations 6.1 and 4.1 and proximal kidney tubular ACP deficiency in station 4.1; (3) no ALKP differences among stations; (4) increased distal kidney tubular GGT at station 12.5 and decreased distal kidney tubular GGT at station 4.1; (5) decreased digestive diverticula G6PDH G6PDH in all stations except 12.5 and decreased proximal kidney tubular G6PDH in stations 8.1 and 6.1. It is possible that other anthropogenic and natural stressors may have affected the results in this study. However, the prevalence and increased severity of lesions in clams with highest metal body burden suggests a contaminant-associated etiology. Enzymatic and histopathologic biomarker alterations identified in this study were positively correlated with the metal body burden. Crams with the higher prevalence of diseases and enzyme alterations also showed a lower condition index and glycogen content in the month when histopathological assessment was performed. Further study win seek to develop enzymatic and histopathologic biomarkers for use in controlled laboratory conditions to help validate the field study.

AB  - In order to study the responses of wild fish to environmental contaminations, different sites (two references and three contaminated) were sampled across the Walloon hydrographical network (southern Belgium). The status of fish communities was characterized according to an index of biotic integrity (1131). Furthermore, population structure, reproductive parameters and biochemical assays were performed on chub (Leuciscus cephalus) as sentinel species. The results showed impaired responses in fish sampled downstream paper mill effluents (BKME), in a polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) contaminated site, and in a river receiving pesticides (i.e. atrazine and hexachlorocyclohexane). High level of hepatic 7-ethoxyresorufin-Odeethylase (EROD) activity were evidence of direct toxicant exposure, while population structures showed unbalanced size-frequency distributions. Moreover, in the pesticide contaminated site, a higher proportion of atretic oocytes was found in females and abnormally high plasma alkali-labile phosphorus (ALP) values were noticed in males, compared to reference sites, suggesting that chubs were exposed to estrogenic compounds. IBI scores from both sites were also lower than in reference sites. On the other hand, no particular response was found in hepatic glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities, hepatic heat-shock protein HSP70 concentrations and plasma sex steroids (estradiol-17 beta, 11-ketotestosterone and testosterone) in chubs from any sites. By using a multiparametric approach, a better understanding of response mechanisms to pollution in fish may be achieved in order to improve the ecological status of river ecosystems.

AB  - The coastal regions of the Gulf of Guinea constitute one of the major marine ecosystems, producing essential living marine resources for the populations of Western Africa. In this region, the Ivorian continental shelf is under pressure from various anthropogenic sources, which have put the regional fish stocks, especially Sardinella aurita, the dominant pelagic species in Ivorian industrial fishery landings, under threat from overfishing. Here, we combine in situ observations of Sardinella aurita catch, temperature, and nutrient profiles, with remote-sensing ocean-color observations, and reanalysis data of wind and sea surface temperature, to investigate relationships between Sardinella aurita catch and oceanic primary producers (including biomass and phenology of phytoplankton), and between Sardinella aurita catch and environmental conditions (including upwelling index, and turbulent mixing). We show that variations in Sardinella aurita catch in the following year may be predicted, with a confidence of 78%, based on a bilinear model using only physical variables, and with a confidence of 40% when using only biological variables. However, the physics-based model alone is not sufficient to explain the mechanism driving the year-to-year variations in Sardinella aurita catch. Based on the analysis of the relationships between biological variables, we demonstrate that in the Ivorian continental shelf, during the study period 1998-2014, population dynamics of Sardinellaaurita, and oceanic primary producers, may be controlled, mainly by top-down trophic interactions. Finally, based on the predictive models constructed here, we discuss how they can provide powerful tools to support evaluation and monitoring of fishing activity, which may help towards the development of a Fisheries Information and Management System.

AB  - Sediment samples from the coastal area of Asaluyeh harbor were collected during autumn and spring 2015. The acidvolatile sulfide (AVS) and simultaneously extracted metals (SEMs) were measured to assess the sediment quality and potential ecological risks. The average concentrations (and relative standard deviation (RSD)) of AVS in the industrial sediments were 12.32 mu mol/g (36.91) and 6.34 mu mol/g (80.05) in autumn and spring, respectively, while in the urban area, these values were 0.44 mu mol/g (123.50) and 0.31 mu mol/g (160.0) in autumn and spring, respectively. The average concentrations ofSEM(and RSD) in the industrial sediments were 15.02 mu mol/g (14.38) and 12.34 mu mol/g (20.65) in autumn and spring, respectively, while in the urban area, these values were 1.10 mu mol/g (43.03) and 1.06 mu mol/g (55.59) in autumn and spring, respectively. Zn was the predominant component (34.25-86.24 %) of SEM, while the corresponding value for Cd, much more toxic ingredient, was less than 1 %. Some of the coastal sediments in the harbor of Asaluyeh (20 and 47 % in autumn and spring, respectively) had expected adverse biological effects based on the suggested criterion by United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), while most stations (80 and 53 % in autumn and spring, respectively) had uncertain adverse effects.

AB  - Environmental flow is necessary to maintain a healthy ecosystem and sustain aquatic lives. Its assessment is thus aimed at analysing the minimum flow of water required for sustainability of the ecosystem. In the present study, an effort has been made to describe the environmental flow condition of a watershed with the help of a Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), an index often used in drought prediction using precipitation. Among the various drought indices, SPI is very popular and widely used for drought monitoring. SPI is advantageous over other indices as, for example, it requires easily available precipitation data and enables drought monitoring at different timescales, such as monthly, seasonal, annual. On the other hand, the Tennant method requires flow data, which is too scarce in ungauged catchments. This study attempts to correlate the concepts of Tennant and SPI to explore the ability of SPI to predict environmental flow conditions using rainfall. The rainfall and runoff data for the period of 1990-2000 of five watersheds of Godavari Basin, namely Hivra, Kumhari, Nandgaon, Ramakona, and Satrapur, have been analysed. SPI at 9-month timescale for the month of June and the percentage of average annual flow for the same period were determined for respective watersheds separately. When plotted, both correlated positively with coefficient of determination of 0.74 for three (out of 5) catchments, suggesting a very good fit. The relationship indicates significant dependence of environmental flow on SPI, and it can be used for deriving the EF condition for a watershed/gauging site based on SPI, easily derivable from the available rainfall data.

AB  - Measuring fish population responses to climate change requires timely ecological information, warranting innovative approaches to data collection in fisheries research and management. Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy is a promising tool to efficiently and cost-effectively obtain multiple types of fisheries data including fish physiological health and energetics that can provide indicators of stock status and environmental change. We tested the applicability of FT-NIR spectroscopy to determine fish physiological state and condition by developing calibration models for morphometric indices of body condition [Fulton's K and hepatosomatic index (HSI)], biochemical measurements of tissue composition (lipid content and energy density), and a nucleic acid-based index of recent growth (RNA:DNA) of juvenile Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus). Calibration models had the best predictive ability for lipid content followed by HSI and energy density, whereas spectral data had weak relationships with Fulton's K and RNA:DNA. For lipid content, energy density, and HSI, informative spectral regions were primarily associated with carbon-hydrogen bonds in lipid molecules. Additionally, FT-NIR spectroscopy calibration models better predicted lipid content than morphometric measurements that are often used as proxies for measuring energy reserves, indicating that FT-NIR spectroscopy might serve as a more informative index of body condition and energy stores than other rapid methods. Efficient sample analysis by FT-NIR spectroscopy can supplement traditional metrics of body condition and be especially useful for ensuring the availability of monitoring data in support of fisheries research and management.

AB  - The content of various chemical elements such as metals, metalloids, and nonmetals in the environment is associated with natural and anthropogenic sources. It is necessary to normalize the content of metals, metalloids, and nonmetals as potentially toxic elements (PTE) in the Haplic Chernozem. The soils of the Southern Russia are of high quality and fertility. However, this type of soil, like Haplic Chernozem, is subject to contamination with a wide range of PTE. The aim of the work was to rank metals, metalloids, and nonmetals by ecotoxicity in Haplic Chernozem. To assess the ecotoxicity of chernozem, data for 15 years (2005-2020) were used. Biological indicators used to assess the ecotoxicity of Haplic Chernozem: catalase activity, cellulolytic activity, number of bacteria, Azotobacter spp. abundance, to change of length of radish's roots. Based on these biological indicators, an integral indicator of the state of Haplic Chernozem was calculated. The ecotoxicity of 23 metals (Cd, Hg, Pb, Cr, Cu, Zn, Ni, Co, Mo, Mn, Ba, Sr, Sn, V, W, Ag, Bi, Ga, Nb, Sc, Tl, Y, Yb), 5 metalloids (B, As, Ge, Sb, Te) and 2 nonmetals (F, Se) as priority pollutants. It is proposed to distinguish three hazard classes of metals, metalloids, and nonmetals to Haplic Chernozem: I class - Te, Ag, Se, Cr, Bi, Ge, Sn, Tl, Hg, Yb, W, Cd; II class - As, Co, Sc, Sb, Cu, Ni, B, Nb, Pb, Ga; III class - Sr, Y, Mo, Zn, V, Ba, Mn, F. It is advisable to use the results of the study for predictive assessment of the impact of metals, metalloids, and nonmetals on the ecological state of the soil during pollution.

AB  - Intensive agricultural practices can dramatically change the landscape, thereby increasing the concentrations and rates at which nutrients are delivered to aquatic ecosystems. In the United States, concerns about accelerating rates of lake eutrophication related to increases in nutrient loading require a method of quantifying ecological changes that have occurred since European settlement. Because the application of traditional quantitative total phosphorus transfer functions in paleolimnology has proven difficult in shallow, hypereutrophic lakes, we used several approaches in this study to assess ecosystem changes associated with eutrophication of 32 natural lakes in the state of Iowa, USA. In addition to traditional transfer function methods, we estimated changes in primary productivity from the flux of biogenic silica (BSi) and organic carbon accumulation rates (OC AR). Additionally, we compared pre-disturbance diatom communities to modern diatom communities, i.e. floristic change, using non-metric multi-dimensional scaling and square chord distance. OC AR and BSi fluxes increased over time and were positively correlated with the time period of agricultural intensification in the region (post-1940). Ninety-one percent of the lakes in this study showed evidence for eutrophication based on geochemical proxies, and 88 % of lakes showed major floristic change in the diatom community. Whereas geochemical indicators showed consistent increases in productivity across most lakes, floristic changes reflected more complex interactions between other environmental drivers. The magnitude of floristic change did not directly correlate to nutrient-driven increases in primary production, but was driven by ecological diatom assembly related to lake depth. Transfer functions consistently perform poorly, especially for shallow lakes, and other techniques that combine geochemistry and diatom ecology are recommended for reconstructions of eutrophication.

AB  - Urban aquatic ecosystems are often overlooked in toxicological studies even though they serve many ecosystem functions and sustain fish populations despite large-scale habitat alterations. However, urban fish populations are likely exposed to a broad range of stressors, including environmental estrogens (EEs) that may affect anatomy, physiology and reproduction of exposed fish. Although significant progress has been made in establishing ecological consequences of EE exposure, these studies have focused largely on hydrologically simple systems that lack the complexity of urban aquatic environments. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the occurrence and biological effects of EEs across a large urbanized aquatic ecosystem. A multi-pronged study design was employed relying on quantitative determination of select EEs by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and repeated biological monitoring of wild-caught and caged fish for indications of endocrine disruption. Over three years, EEs were measured in aqueous samples (n = 42 samples) and biological effects assessed in >1200 male fish across the 2000 km(2) aquatic ecosystems of the Greater Metropolitan Area of Chicago, IL Our study demonstrated that in addition to water reclamation plant (WRP) effluents, non-WRP sources contribute significant EE loads to the aquatic ecosystem. While resident and caged male fish responded with the induction of the egg-yolk protein vitellogenin, an indicator of EE exposure, neither resident nor caged sunfish exhibited prevalent histopathological changes to their reproductive organs (i.e., intersex) that have been reported in other studies. Vitellogenin induction was greater in spring than the fall and was not correlated with body condition factor, gonadosomatic index or hepatosomatic index. Exposure effects were not correlated with sites downstream of treated effluent discharge further affirming the complexity of sources and effects of EEs in urban aquatic ecosystems.

AB  - Streams and adjacent riparian habitats represent linked terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems that exchange materials and energy. Recognized relationships among apex predators and ecosystem biodiversity led us to hypothesize that these predators in riparian-stream systems were more likely to be found in sites with high stream quality, defined as increased ecosystem function and integrity. In our freshwater study system, river otter Lontra canadensis and mink Neovison vison play critical roles as apex predators. We used multi-season occupancy modelling across three sampling years (2012-2014) to compare aspects of the stream communities that explain occupancy dynamics of river otter and mink, including their interactions with other semi-aquatic mammals. We surveyed for semi-aquatic mammals at 77 sites in 12 major watersheds in southern Illinois, USA (44 526 km(2)). Naive occupancy differed among years but generally increased for river otter, and remained high (93.5%) for mink. Increasing substrate availability increased detectability of river otter, whereas mink detection varied by survey period. Occupancy of river otter during the initial survey period was higher in sites closer to reintroduction points. Probability of colonization of river otter was positively associated with macroinvertebrate index of biotic integrity, fish species richness, and beaver presence. Sites with high species richness of fish families preferred by river otter also had increased river otter persistence. Mink occupied sites with increased fish richness, muskrat presence and mussel community index. Taken together, our results show occupancy of both mink and river otter were predicted by aspects of prey diversity and presence, indicating the importance of community composition in occupancy dynamics of riparian predators. Ultimately, these relationships suggest that habitat heterogeneity and system stability are important to apex predator site use. However, the relative role of bottom-up and top-down forcing in stream systems remains to be resolved.

AB  - Fish assemblages play it key role in stream ecosystems and are influenced by physical habitat. We analyzed fish assemblage,., and physical habitat at 93 randomly selected sites on second- through fifth-order wadeable Iowa streams to explore fish assemblage relationships with reach-scale physical habitat in this agriculturally dominated landscape. Sites were sampled using DC electrofishing and the wadeable streams physical habitat protocol of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program. In all, 92 species were collected. with specie, richness at sites averaging 14. Over 80% of the sites had fish assemblages rated as fair (53%) or poor (32%) based on a fish index of biotic integrity (FIBI). Ordination separated sites from the two major river drainages along an axis of impairment. with sites in the Missouri River drainage exhibiting lower FIBI scores than sites in the Mississippi River drainage. Physical habitat at most sites exhibited fine substrates, eroding banks, and low-gradient, nonmeandering channel and was dominated by glides. Thirty physical habitat variables describing channel morphology, channel cross section and bank morphology, fish cover. human disturbance, large woody debris, relative bed stability, residual pool, riparian vegetation, and substrate differed significantly between sites with FIBI scores rated as poor and those with FIBI scores rated as good or excellent. Eighteen physical habitat variables were significant predictors of fish assemblage metrics and FIBI in multiple linear regression models, with adjusted R 2 values ranging from 0.12 to 0.58. Seventy percent of the model coefficients reflected substrate (40%). residual pool (21%), and fish cover (9%) variables. Fish assemblages in wadeable Iowa streams are strongly associated with the quality of physical habitat. Thus, understanding and addressing the determinants of physical habitat are crucial tor managing streams in Iowa and other agricultural regions.

AB  - Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs) were measured in white sucker liver samples from seven pulp and paper mill sites, and three reference sites in Ontario. The mills included five bleached-kraft mills, with and without secondary treatment, and two sulfite-mechanical mills. 2,3,7,8-T4CDD and 2,3,7,8-T4CDF were the dominant congeners detected in both liver and fillet samples at all of the pulp and paper mill sites, with mean 2,3,7,8-T4CDD toxic equivalent concentrations (TEQs) as high as 124 pg g-1 in liver tissue. Concentrations of PCDDs/PCDFs in liver tissues were several fold higher than in fillet tissue, but this difference can be accounted for by lipid normalization. Biological information, including liver weight, gonad weight, MFO activity (ethoxyresorufin-0-deethylase, EROD), and plasma sex steroids, was measured on individual fish. There was no relationship between TEQs and condition factor, gonadosomatic index, liver somatic index, or circulating plasma 11-ketotestosterone. A weak negative correlation was observed between circulating plasma testosterone and TEQs. Although there was a positive correlation (r = 0.49, p < 0.001) between MFO activity (EROD) and TEQ, one site with very low chlorine use and low TEQs had EROD activity similar to levels observed at more contaminated sites. This finding, along with recent observations that MFO activity is rapidly cleared in pulp-mill-''posed fish, casts doubt on an exclusive causal relationship between MFO activity and PCDDs/PCDFs at these sites.

AB  - Global warming and unexpected climatic change especially increased in temperature and drought incidence were forced the agri-scientist to develop long term future strategies required for all drought and temperature sensitive crops including wheat. The objective of this study was to explore the process of better wheat growth and development under premises of drought. Five wheat cultivars were used to study the effect of drought and to cope drought with hormonal priming. Wheat seeds were primed in 10(-4) M concentration of Salicylic acid (SA) and Gibberellic acid (GA), control was also used. Yield and yield components were decreased under drought. PAKISTAN-13 had the highest grain yield under normal and stress condition. The highest yield reductions were found in CHAKWAL-50 under normal condition. Under stress condition CHAKWAL-50 also had minimum yield. Among five genotypes FSD-08 maintained its yield under drought stress as compared to other genotypes. Hormonal priming improved yield under normal condition and overcome the effect of stress under drought. Priming increased the grain yield in CHAKWAL-50 and other genotypes. PAKISTAN-13 had the highest harvest index under normal condition and also under stress condition. PAKISTAN-13 and FSD-08 had the highest stress tolerance index while SA priming increased the stress tolerance index in CHAKWAL-50. Total sugar and protein contents were increased under drought. In conclusion, under normal and drought stress genotypic difference was observed for yield and yield contributing traits. PAKISTAN-13 and FSD-08 were wining genotypes. Seed priming was able to overcome stress and increased yield. Stress tolerance index was also improved by using hormonal priming. Genotype response was different under normal and drought stress.

TI  - Comparison between F-1's and their parental genotypes for the patterns of character correlation and path coefficients in chickpea (Cicer arietinum)
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
LA  - English
AB  - A study was undertaken to estimate the level and pattern of correlation between various plant characters including grain yield, separately in 28 F1s and 18 homozygous parental genotypes of chickpea grown under similar conditions. The correlation coefficients were partitioned into direct and indirect effects through path analysis. Highly significant genetic differences were recorded for all the characters studied both in F-1 and parental lines. A comparison between F-1 populations and parental lines revealed that the ranges of genotypic variations in F-1 were greater than their corresponding ranges in parental lines. Study of correlation coefficients revealed that genetic correlation's in F-1's as well as in parental lines were higher than phenotypic correlations. Positive and highly significant genetic correlation of grain yield in parental genotypes was observed with number of primary and secondary branches per plant, pods per plant, 100-seed weight and biological yield per plant, whereas in F-1 highly significant and positive correlation of grain yield was noted only with number of secondary branches, pods per plant and biological yield per plant. However, F-1 and parental genotypes appeared to be similar with respect to the pattern of correlation of grain yield with other plant characters except 100 seed weight. The correlation of 100-seed weight with grain yield in F-1 was negative and highly significant, whereas it was positive and highly significant in the case of parents. The study of correlation coefficients between yield components showed that the pattern of correlations between plant height and secondary branches, primary branches and 100-seed weight, biological yield and 100-seed weight and between harvest index and 100-seed weight were dissimilar in F-1 and parental genotypes. The results of path analysis showed harvest index and biological yield to have maximum direct effect on grain yield respectively in parental lines and F-1 genotypes. These results showed that the pattern and level of association between various plant characters in F-1 and parental genotypes were not similar for all the cases. However, the level and pattern of correlation of grain yield with number of secondary branches, number of pods and biological yield per plant were similar in both the sets of genotypes.

AB  - Evaluating progress towards environmental sustainability goals can be difficult due to a lack of measurable benchmarks and insufficient or uncertain data. Marine settings are particularly challenging, as stakeholders and objectives tend to be less well defined and ecosystem components have high natural variability and are difficult to observe directly. Fuzzy logic expert systems are useful analytical frameworks to evaluate such systems, and we develop such a model here to formally evaluate progress towards sustainability targets based on diverse sets of indicators. Evaluation criteria include recent (since policy enactment) and historical (from earliest known state) change, type of indicators (state, benefit, pressure, response), time span and spatial scope, and the suitability of an indicator in reflecting progress toward a specific objective. A key aspect of the framework is that all assumptions are transparent and modifiable to fit different social and ecological contexts. We test the method by evaluating progress towards four Aichi Biodiversity Targets in Canadian oceans, including quantitative progress scores, information gaps, and the sensitivity of results to model and data assumptions. For Canadian marine systems, national protection plans and biodiversity awareness show good progress, but species and ecosystem states overall do not show strong improvement. Well-defined goals are vital for successful policy implementation, as ambiguity allows for conflicting potential indicators, which in natural systems increases uncertainty in progress evaluations. Importantly, our framework can be easily adapted to assess progress towards policy goals with different themes, globally or in specific regions.

AB  - Assessment activity and surveillance of the forests health, held at the global, regional and local level, has continuously developed, culminating in the current period with interdisciplinary and extensive scientific researches, that evaluate the effects of the main factors on forest ecosystems state, in particular, air pollution and climate change. Scientific researches have shown that among trees ecophysiological processes, forest life processes and meteorological parameters there are direct dependences, particularly in the case of trees supply with water during the growing period (May-July), with major influences for critical months (July and August), which have a decisive impact on growth, vitality and production of organic matter in forests. Dry years, from the beginning of the third millennium can lead to a decrease of mesophilic forests area (beech, sessile oak and penduculate oak), which will tend to retreat towards the center of the area (central Europe) in favor of thermophilic forests with pubescent oak. It was determined that a most significant negative impact of climate aridization will feel the forest ecosystems from Southern and central regions of country (conditioned by the mean air temperature (July-August), monthly rainfall (May-August), evapotranspiration and geographic latitude), and less - the Northern part of the country (Forestry Aridity Index calculated for 3 experimental stations revealed variations of this index between 7.8 - 8.3 - in the Central part of country, and 8.4 - 8.6 - for Southern part of country). At the same time the impact of climate change will determine the spatial and temporal dynamics of pests and pathogenic species. The phenomenon of climate aridization was expressed also through the impact of the Microsphaera alphitoides disease, intensity of "mildew" attack being based on the climatic conditions of the study region. Obtained data, for confirmation, were correlated with indications of bioindicators, present in the study region.

AB  - Lakes are highly sensitive to climate change, and climate warming is known to induce eutrophication symptoms in temperate lakes. In Denmark, climate is projected to cause increased precipitation in winter and increased air temperatures throughout the year by the end of the 21st century. Looking further into the future, the warming trend is projected to continue and likely reach a 6 degrees C increase around the 22nd century (relative to a baseline period of 1986-2005). In the present study, we evaluate the consequences of such extreme changes for temperate Danish lakes. We use a multifaceted modelling approach by combining an eco-hydrological model to estimate future water runoff and catchment nutrient exports with both mechanistic and empirical lake models, describing key biogeochemical indicators in lakes, in order to quantify the effects of future nutrient loads and air temperature on lake ecosystems. Our model projections for the future scenario suggest that annual water runoff will increase (46%), driving also increases in exports of nitrogen and phosphorus (13 and 64%, respectively). Both the mechanistic and empirical modelling approaches suggest that phytoplankton biomass will increase and that potentially toxin-producing cyanobacteria may become a dominant feature of the phytoplankton community from spring. Warming and increased nutrient loads also affect the food webs within the lakes in the direction of higher fish control of algae-grazing water fleas, further reinforcing eutrophication. To be able to mitigate these eutrophication effects, external nutrient loading to the lakes must be reduced considerably.

AB  - In the "Sea Diamond" shipwreck, it is estimated that almost 1.7 tons of batteries/accumulators and approximately 150 cathode ray tube technology televisions have gone to the bottom of the sea. Under these circumstances, all the aforementioned materials will eventually undergo severe accelerated corrosion. Consequently, a variety of heavy metals will either be released in seawater or precipitate in the form of salts resulting in contamination of the sea sediments. According to the ship data, and the aforementioned quantities of batteries and televisions, it is estimated that approximately 75-80 g of mercury, 630-1,050 g of cadmium and 1.14-1.26 tons of lead exist in the wreck only due to the electrical and electronic equipment present in the ship, not to mention the significant amount of heavy metals such as copper, nickel, ferrous and chromium that exist in the hulk. Four series of seawater sampling (n = 85) were conducted in different stations surrounding the wreck area in order to assess the overall impact from the release of heavy metals in the surrounding aquatic environment. The analysis indicated that there were stations where lead, zinc and cadmium were present in concentrations higher than the permissible limits set by the Unites States Environmental Protection Agency for seawater. Furthermore, the analysis of three series of sediment sampling (n = 31) from the wreck area showed elevated but expected concentration values for ferrous and manganese, considering the geological background of the area and contamination with lead, copper and cadmium.

AB  - Effective forest ecosystem-based management requires a thorough understanding of the interactions between anthropogenic and natural disturbance processes over larger spatial and temporal scales than stands and rotation ages. Because harvesting does not preclude fire, it is important to evaluate the combined effects of harvesting and fire on forest age structure, a coarse indicator of forest ecosystem state. We performed a sensitivity analysis of landscape scale effects of forest management (strategy, harvest rate and access cost) and fire regime (fire return interval and extent) in terms of combined impacts on forest stand age-class structure on a study area of 3.5 million hectares of boreal forest of Quebec. A series of scenarios were simulated over 500 years and replicated 30 times using a previously reported spatially explicit landscape model. Within the parameter space of our sensitivity analysis, we found that harvest rate, fire return interval and management strategy were the most significant parameters affecting stand age-class distribution across the landscape. The former are not so surprising, given that they combine to produce an overall disturbance rate, but the latter shows that the resulting impact on age-class structure can be influenced to some degree through management objectives. A harvesting strategy of clearcutting for sustained timber supply, using a harvest rotation based on minimum merchantable age (approximately 100 years in this analysis), creates a trend for the stand age-class distribution away from the expected range of natural variation for the study area. Within the scope of our simulations, alternative management strategies with extended harvest rotation age proved the most robust forest management practice to absorb variations in fire regime.

AB  - This article performs an analysis of the article in which Claude E. Shannon proposed his now famous H measure of information amount, by finding that four crucial traits analyzed by Shannon in regard to the meaning of H in information theory (i.e.: (a) introduction of a constant ad hoc - k - in order to achieve a formal connection between the statistical dimension of H and a given system of measurement units; (b) redundancy measurement; (c) joint events; and (d) conditional information) have strong theoretical connections with several important and well-known ecological phenomena (i.e.: (a') extensive measurement of ecological entropy in quasi-physical units; (b') theoretical meaning and successional behavior of redundancy; (c') competitive exclusion; and (d') ecological niche resilience, respectively). This set of corresponding connections (a, b, c, d, vs. a', b', c', d') has not been reported in the literature ever before, and it is fully understandable from the ecological viewpoint, despite the fact that the proposal from Shannon is previous and fully independent in comparison with any posterior attempt to establish a connection between ecology, physics and information theory. So, in practice, Shannon was also investigating in ecology and evolutionary biology, despite he was neither an ecologist nor an evolutionary biologist. In summary, our set of results: (i) implies that Shannon was an spontaneous ecologist, or at least an unwitting founder of ecological science such that, after Shannon, every ecologist of ecosystems can thus be viewed as a sort of "computer technician of nature"; (ii) highlights the fruitfulness of thinking about natural history in interdisciplinary terms; and (iii) expands the theoretical justification for applying H as a key indicator to build reliable models that are coherent with the principles of ecology, evolutionary biology, information theory and physics.

AB  - Water conservation has been a priority action to the government and researchers across the globe due to its limited availability, uneven distribution and equal requirements to every human being. This has resulted into various actions of water management at the local (micro-watershed) as well as at the regional (large watershed) level with the goal to improve agriculture productivity, soil moisture, and groundwater level (GWL). This study was conducted to assess the impact of Integrated Water Management Program (IWMP) activities on crop parameters (viz. coverage, health index, cropping index, and gross primary productivity (GPP)) and GWL in a micro-watershed site over Hisar district, Haryana, India, using data from Landsat, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Water Resource Information System (WRIS) India during the year 1997 to 2017. Results reveal a significant change in different crop parameters and GWL post-IWMP activities. The rate of changes in crop coverage has been observed to be higher (69.41 ha/year) after the project implementation compared to the pre-project period (31.62 ha/year). Similar results have been found for vegetation condition and cropping index (CI, a newly proposed index for cropping frequency). Changes in GPP have also shown an increasing trend both in Rabi and Kharif season. GWL has changed significantly with a declining trend that may be due to the rising population and increasing demand for irrigation. The method and parameters adopted in this study may be applicable for the assessment and monitoring of similar policies across the globe in addition to the other indices.

AB  - The goal of biological monitoring is to evaluate the effect of human activities on biological resources. Ln this Study, ive linked human activities across landscapes to specific changes in assemblages of benthic macroinvertebrates in streams that drain those landscapes. We used data from 2nd- to 4th-order streams in southwestern Oregon to test approximately 30 hypotheses about how macroinvertebrates respond to several common human actions, especially logging and associated road construction. We found 10 attributes of macroinvertebrate assemblages to be reliable indicators of disturbance. Data from a subsequent year confirmed those results. We used simple graphical methods to evaluate land-use data and to relate the data to observed responses of invertebrates.
   We constructed a multimetric index (benthic index of biological integrity, or B-IBI) from component metrics that distinguished disturbed stream sites from minimally disturbed sites. Using an independent data set, we found that B-IBI scores were significantly lower for streams whose watersheds were more degraded by human activities. We also tested rapid bioassessment protocol (RBP) III as modified by Oregon Department of Environmental Quality. REP III failed to detect differences among sites that B-IBI did detect.
   Because biologists continue to debate the relative merits of a multimetric vs. a multivariate approach for interpreting biomonitoring data, we also used principal components analysis (PCA) to explore patterns in our multidimensional data. We chose PCA based on species abundance because it has been the most common technique used by state and federal agency biologists to interpret biomonitoring data. PCA failed to detect clear differences in our data set (e.g., between most and least disturbed sites).
   We suggest that multivariate statistical analyses are most appropriate for exploratory analysis when the investigator has limited knowledge of an ecological system and wants to generate testable hypotheses. We demonstrate that sufficient information about the natural history of stream invertebrates is available to support more direct tests of how invertebrates respond to human disturbance ?he components of a good multimetric index are founded on tested hypotheses and thus provide a sound scientific assessment of a stream site. We argue that a method that incorporates ecological information is more suitable for biomonitoring than one relying on statistical algorithms.

AB  - The surf zone is the unique environment where ocean meets land and a place of critical ecological, economic, and recreational importance. In the United States,this natural resource is increasingly off-limits to the public due to elevated concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria and other contaminants, the sources of which are often unknown. In this paper, we describe an approach for calculating mass budgets of pollutants in the surf zone from shoreline monitoring data. The analysis reveals that fecal indicator bacteria pollution in the surf zone at several contiguous beaches in Orange County, California, originates from well-defined locations along the shore, including the tidal outlets of the Santa Ana River and Talbert Marsh. Fecal pollution flows into the ocean from the Santa Ana River and Talbert Marsh outlets during ebb tides and from there is transported parallel to the shoreline by wave-driven surf zone currents and/or offshore tidal currents, frequently contaminating >5 km of the surf zone. The methodology developed here for locating and quantifying sources of surf zone pollution should be applicable to a wide array of contaminants and coastal settings.

AB  - We tested whether horses (Equus caballus) are sensitive to human attentional states and modify the modality of begging behaviors as a function of human attentional states in a naturalistic food-requesting situation. In Experiment 1, horses tended to produce more auditory or tactile begging behaviors when the human experimenter (E1)'s eyes were covered by her hand than when they were not covered. However, there was no difference in visual begging behaviors between conditions. In Experiment 2, horses produced significantly more auditory or tactile begging behaviors when El's eyes were closed than when they were open. In contrast, horses produced significantly more visual begging behaviors when El's eyes were open than when they were closed. These results suggest that horses understand the role of eyes as an indicator of human attentional states and show effective and flexible begging behaviors proactively as a function of human attentional states.

AB  - Limiting the prevalence of invasive species is a global conservation priority. Invasive species can have varying ecosystem effects and responses to control throughout an invaded range, and removal near invasion fronts may inadvertently alter these characteristics. Bigheaded carp (bighead carp (Hypophthabnichthys nobilis Richardson) and silver carp (H. molitrix Valenciennes)) are invasive fishes from Asia invading North American freshwater ecosystems. We used mobile hydroacoustic surveys to examine bigheaded carp population characteristics from 2012 to 2015 across an invasion gradient in the Illinois River (USA), one of the most likely pathways to the Laurentian Great Lakes. These bigheaded carp species comprised 23-46% of fish community abundance and 45-78% of fish biomass across reaches, with lower contribution near the invasion front where intensive management by harvest occurs. Bigheaded carp prevalence in the community did not differ by habitat and comprised > 50% of community abundance and biomass throughout the river for most size classes. We identified negative relationships between density and relative weight (an index of body condition) of bigheaded carp, suggesting evidence of potential density-dependent intraspecific competition. Efforts to reduce invasive species abundances near invasion fronts may reduce prevalence. However, this could inadvertently release individuals from density-dependent competition and could enhance reproductive potential, growth or movements. By employing a suite of control efforts, including continuous removal efforts (including novel approaches) and by limiting movements (e.g., utilizing roads, fences, dams), it may be possible to offset undesired consequences of increased condition.

AB  - Sixteen priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) regulated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) were analyzed in surface waters and riverine sediments of Brahmaputra and Hooghly Rivers, along urban-suburban-rural transects. Sigma(16) PAHs concentrations were higher in Hooghly riverine sediment (HRS) (Avg, 445 ng g(-1)) than Brahmaputra riverine sediment (BRS) (Avg, 169 ng g(-1)) dominated by 4-ring PAHs. In contrast, PAHs concentrations in surface water of Brahmaputra River (BRW) (Avg, 4.04 mu g L-1) were comparable with Hooghly River (HRW) (Avg, 4.8 mu g L-1), with dominance by 3-ring PAHs, Toxic PAHs (BaA, Chr, BbF, BkF, BaP, InP and DBA) were dominant in sub-urban transect of HRS (Avg, 387 ng g(-1)) and BRS (Avg, 14 ng g(-1)). Diagnostic ratios, principal component analysis (PCA) and ring wise composition suggested combustion as the main PAHs source in these riverine belts. In BRS, higher PAHs in suburban and rural transects were attributed to incomplete combustion of fossil fuel and biomass burning. In HRS, >85% of high molecular weight PAHs were found in the industrial areas of the suburban transect possibly associated with the discharge of industrial effluents. Harbor and port activities were other major contributors of HMW-PAHs in Hooghly riverine system. Carcinogenic potency estimated in terms of toxic equivalent (TEQ) was several folds higher in HRS (Avg, 106 ng TEQ g(-1)) compared with BRS (Avg, 2.5 ng TEQg(-1)). Mostly low molecular weight PAHs are likely posing a risk to fishes in both the rivers. Risk on edible fish species may be a matter of concern considering the regular consumption of fishes in this region. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sunflower is a crop that is used as ornamental, oleaginous, forage, and currently as a bioremediation plant, of hard water affected soils. For this reason, the main objective of this investigation was to study the effect of potassium fertilization on yield under field conditions, and the effect of gibberellic acid (GA(3)), at postharvest of inflorescences. Two experiments were established, under field and laboratory conditions. In the field experiment, four levels of potassium, 0, 50, 100 and 150 kg/ha were evaluated, under a randomized complete block design and four replicates (4x4) = 16 experimental units. The variables evaluated were agronomic and biological yields, harvest index, leaf area index and intercepted radiation. The variables in the laboratory were: diameter of the stem, basal diameter of the stem, weight of tubular flowers, vase life and days at opening of the capitulum. Treatments consisted of six levels of GA(3) and five replicates (6x5) = 30 experimental units, evaluated under a completely randomized design. The results indicated, that the maximum values for agronomic and biological yields were obtained with the application of 150 kg/ha of potassium. The maximum intercepted radiation was reached at 90 days after sowing on all treatments. In the laboratory, the longer vase life was obtained with the application of 20 and 40 mg/L of GA(3) including the control. As for the opening of capitulum, the control opened in less time, while the concentrations of 40 and 60 mg/L of GA(3) delayed the opening of the capitulum. From this work it is concluded, that the sunflower responds positively to potassium fertilization under soil alkalinity conditions. The application of GA(3), in post-harvest conditions affected the inflorescences of the species, delaying the opening of the capitulum.

AB  - The present work has been carried out to investigate the probable effects of fish cage culture on benthic communities as a pollution and stress indicator and to evaluate the biotic health condition using BOPA index, in Ghazale Creek (Khowre-Mussa - Persian Gulf). Monthly sampling from 4 stations was carried out from June 2007 to March 2008 (during nine months). Stations were selected from under the cage to 400 m distant (as control site) in Ghazale Creek. Three samples were taken at each station for macrobenthos and one for sediment grain size and total organic matter (TOM), using a 0.0125 m(2) van veen grab. Also physical-chemical parameters sampling from three stations was done (during nine months). Stations were under cage station, 50 m and 400 m far from cages in Ghazale Creek. The percentage of total organic matter (TOM) in sediment ranged from 6.11 to 23.26 and the range of silty-clay percentage was from 4.76 to 97.47. The dominant macrobenthos groups were Polychaets (60.62%), Mulluska (19.67%), Crustacea (16.49%). Macrobenthic abundance, biomass and diversity index values in the under cage station were less than that in the control station. Comparing the results of BOPA with the guidelines shows that all stations had bad environmental conditions. The under cage station was more polluted than the control station. The range of physical-chemical parameters in water were: DO (6.5-11.43) ppm, BOD (1.5-10.9) ppm, Salinity (43-45.6) ppt, NO2- (0.006-0.29) ppb, NO3- (3.98-32.2) ppm, Turbidity (14-70) NTU temperature (11.8-32.5) degrees C.

AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the effects of different levels of dietary supplementation of grape seed extract (GSE) on growth performance, carcass traits and antioxidant status of rabbits under heat stress conditions (temperature humidity index 87.5-93.5). Weaned male New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits about 6weeks old (n=144, mean body weight 705g) were randomly allotted to four dietary groups. The Control group was fed a basal diet without GSE; the experimental groups received the basal diet with 100, 200 and 300mg GSE/kg (Groups 100 GSE, 200 GSE and 300 GSE, respectively). The experimental period lasted for 8weeks. Compared with other groups, rabbits of Group 300 GSE had the best body weight gain and feed conversion ratio and the lowest mortality. Dietary GSE improved carcass weight, percentage of hot carcass, intestine and edible giblets, while total non-edible parts were reduced (p <= 0.05) in comparison with the Control group. In Groups 200 GSE and 300 GSE, plasma total protein, albumin and globulin were increased (p <= 0.05). In contrast, all supplementation levels of GSE reduced (p <= 0.05) the plasma concentrations of total lipids, total cholesterol, triglycerides and low-density lipoproteins. Antioxidant enzymes of rabbits (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase) and total antioxidant capacity in blood were increased (p <= 0.05) by adding dietary GSE. However, malondialdehyde was reduced (p <= 0.001) with increasing GSE levels. Generally, grape seeds can be considered as rich source of phenolic and flavonoid compounds. The results of the study revealed that all tested levels of GSE were useful as a natural protection against heat stress to maintain performance, carcass traits and antioxidant status and could reduce the negative effects of heat stress in rabbits.

AB  - We examined the impact of lake trophic state on the taxonomic and functional structure of cladoceran communities and the role of nutrient loading in structuring both cladoceran and diatom communities. Surface sediment assemblages from 33 Irish lakes were analysed along a gradient of total phosphorus concentration (TP; 4.0-142.3 mu g l(-1)), using a variety of statistical approaches including ordination, calibration and variance partitioning. Ordination showed that the taxonomic structure of the cladoceran community displayed the strongest response to changes in lake trophic state, among 17 measured environmental variables. Trophic state variables chlorophyll-a and TP explained about 20% of the variance in both cladoceran and diatom assemblages from a set of 31 lakes. Procrustes analysis also showed significant concordance in the structure of cladoceran and diatom communities (P < 0.001). Thus, lake trophic state affects the taxonomic structure of both primary and secondary producers in our study lakes. We also found a significant decrease in relative abundance of taxa associated with both macrophytes and sediments, or sediments only, along the TP gradient (r = -0.49, P = 0.006, n = 30), as well as an increase in the proportion of the planktonic group (r = 0.43, P = 0.017, n = 30). This suggests that cladoceran community structure may also be shaped by lake trophic state indirectly, by affecting habitat properties. We found no relationship between lake trophic state and the relative abundance of each of three cladoceran groups that display different body size. We compared community structure between bottom and top sediment samples in cores from six Irish lakes. Results revealed similar trajectories of nutrient enrichment over time, as well as a strong shift in cladoceran functional structure in most systems. This study confirms that Cladocera remains in lake sediments are reliable indicators of lake trophic state. This study also highlights the fact that taxonomic and functional structure should both be considered to account for the multiple factors that shape cladoceran communities.

AB  - We studied wetland development in a chronosequence of created wetlands in a reclaimed landscape in east Texas seasonally for 1 year. The purpose of the study was to identify features (i.e., indicators) that best reflected changes in wetland ecosystem state through time and could serve as indicators of "maturity" for bond-release. Features considered included surface water nutrients, soil nutrients, soil redox potential, vegetative biomass and diversity, and benthic invertebrate biomass and diversity. Our sampling focused on nine wetlands representing three different-age classes (n = 3 for each) as a surrogate for time. All wetland sites were created with the same homogenized mine spoil and had similar hydrology and climate. Age-specific changes in all parameters were observed, except for surface water nutrients. The oldest wetlands (i.e., "mature") exhibited highest soil concentrations of N, C, K, P, and Ca. Soil redox potential was significantly lower in the mature wetlands, in addition to within-wetland (lowest in deepest sampling zones) and intra-annual variability (i.e., lowest during the summer). Mature created wetlands supported the highest vegetative biomass and species richness and highest densities of invertebrates; however, taxa richness was similar across all age groups. Of all parameters we measured, vegetation metrics were among the simplest and most cost-effective measures used to track the early development of mitigated wetlands. This study provides the basis from which to track the development of these reclaimed ecosystems in a more rigorous and easily replicated manner. With further validation, select use of these parameter sets in east Texas and other similar landscapes could aid both in determining compliance for regulatory purposes as well as tracking success of ecological mitigation.

AB  - The Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) underwent staged impoundment of water from 135 m to 175 m between 2003 and 2010. Periodic water impoundment was divided into drainage (March to early June), low water level (June to August), impoundment (September to October), and high water level (November to February) period. However, the impact of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) and staged impoundment on water quality, especially in the long term, remains unclear. Herein, hydrological, pollution load, nutrient, and biochemical indices were determined for the TGR during 1998-2018. The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index, a K-means clustering algorithm, and the Mann-Kendall (MK) test were applied to this data to explore the spatial and temporal distribution of water quality. The results show that water quality was good overall, but it before the full impoundment stage (2010) was worse than after that. The low water level period had the worst water quality among the four periods, and spatially, midstream was worst. Among water quality indices, the median total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) were in the range of 1505-2303 and 0.071-0.176 mg/L, respectively, and these were the key pollution indices. In addition, due to differences in hydrological and hydrodynamic conditions, and the regional distribution of pollution sources, water quality in the TGR displayed temporal and spatial heterogeneity. TN, TP, potassium permanganate index (CODMn), five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) were maximal during the low water level period, and TN, TP and E. coli were highest in midstream. MK test results revealed that nutrients pollution became worse midstream, and a gradual increase in TP caused severe algal blooms downstream. Therefore, nutritional water treatment and non-point source pollution control should be the focus of future work. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of ghrelin and des-ghrelin on feed intake, growth performance and hypothalamic neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA expression of grouper, Epinephelus coioides. Ghrelin and des-ghrelin (non-acylated form) were supplemented in the basal diet at the dose of 0, 2, 4 mg kg(-1). The highest feed intake, weight gain (WG, %) and final body weight (FBW, g) were recorded when ghrelin was added at the dose of 4 mg kg-1 and they were significantly different from that of the control (Pb0.05). Compared to the control group, no significant (P > 0.05) effect on growth performance and feed intake was observed in fish fed diet supplemented with des-ghrelin at 2 and 4 mg kg(-1). There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in the proximate composition (crude protein, crude lipid, ash and moisture), slaughter variables (condition factor, viscerasomatic index, hepatosomatic index and intraperitoneal fat ratio) and serum lipid (total cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein) in fish fed all the test diets. Grouper hypothalamic NPY mRNA expression was significantly (P < 0.05) increased when ghrelin (2, 4 mg kg(-1)) was supplemented in the diet. However, grouper fed the diet added with des-ghrelin (2, 4 mg kg(-1)) did not show an increase (P > 0.05) in the expression of hypothalamic NPY mRNA. The present results indicated for the first time that ghrelin supplemented in the diet could stimulate feed intake, growth and hypothalamic NPY mRNA expression of grouper, while des-ghrelin did not have those effects.

AB  - Environmental pollution in cities is an increasingly popular issue tackled in research. One of the elements with a significant impact on the state of urban ecosystems is transport with its pressure on individual components of the environment. Sustainable urban transport is gaining prominence as a postulate expressed in cities' strategic documents, constituting an element alleviating the negative effects of anthropopressure. In the light of the need to introduce innovative solutions for clean forms of transport, numerous papers indicate the bicycle as an answer to some of those problems. The article presents a review of literature referring to the socio-economic aspects of using the bicycle in cities as a means of transport for daily commuting. The analysis is based on publications on cyclist safety in road traffic, the perception of the bicycle as a means of transport in cities, and the introduction of innovative solutions, such as bicycle-sharing systems.

AB  - The gastropod Buccinanops globulosus is commonly used as a bioindicator of tributyltin (TBT) contamination due to its high imposex incidence in maritime traffic areas. The aim of this study was to evaluate both oxidative stress in B. globulosus at three sites with different maritime activity, and imposex incidence in Nuevo Gulf, Argentina. Oxidative stress parameters in digestive glands, like superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities, reduced glutathione levels (GSH), and oxidative damage to lipids, estimated as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs) as well as imposex parameters (% imposex and female penis length (FPL)) were measured in females. Gastropods from the harbour area showed 100% imposex, the highest FPL and TBARs content, as well as GSH levels and SOD activity.
   The different oxidative stress responses and high imposex incidence at the harbour site may indicate a negative effect on the organism's physiological state due to environmental pollution.

AB  - We sampled 240 wadeable streams across Wisconsin for different forms of phosphorus and nitrogen, and assemblages of macroinvertebrates and fish to (1) examine how macroinvertebrate and fish measures correlated with the nutrients; (2) quantify relationships between key biological measures and nutrient forms to identify potential threshold levels of nutrients to support nutrient criteria development; and (3) evaluate the importance of nutrients in influencing biological assemblages relative to other physicochemical factors at different spatial scales. Twenty-three of the 35 fish and 18 of the 26 macroinvertebrate measures significantly correlated (P < 0.05) with at least one nutrient measure. Percentages of carnivorous, intolerant, and omnivorous fishes, index of biotic integrity, and salmonid abundance were fish measures correlated with the most nutrient measures and had the highest correlation coefficients. Percentages of Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera individuals and taxa, Hilsenhoff biotic index, and mean tolerance value were macroinvertebrate measures that most strongly correlated with the most nutrient measures. Selected biological measures showed clear trends toward degradation as concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen increased, and some measures showed clear thresholds where biological measures changed drastically with small changes in nutrient concentrations. Our selected environmental factors explained 54% of the variation in the fish assemblages. Of this explained variance, 46% was attributed to catchment and instream habitat, 15% to nutrients, 3% to other water quality measures, and 36% to the interactions among all the environmental variables. Selected environmental factors explained 53% of the variation in macroinvertebrate assemblages. Of this explained variance, 42% was attributed to catchment and instream habitat, 22% to nutrients, 5% to other water quality measures, and 32% to the interactions among all the environmental variables.

AB  - We assessed relationships between chemical and physical characteristics and periphyton assemblages in stream reaches of the mineral belt in the Southern Rockies ecoregion of Colorado, United States. using canonical ordination analyses, we contrasted results wherein assemblage structure was assessed using community metrics or species abundances. Our objectives were to identify community metrics or individual species diagnostic of the primary environmental stressors in these streams, to compare the sensitivity of these two approaches to determining the primary stressors, and to determine how these approaches may be used to differentiate the effects of these environmental stressors from other gradients. For periphyton metrics, the first axis extracted by redundancy analysis correlated with total phosphorus, substrate coarseness and embeddedness, and riparian vegetation condition, whereas the second axis correlated with dissolved metals. For species abundances, the three axes extracted by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) were correlated with (1) stream size and types of in-stream habitats; (2) total phosphorus, dissolved ions, and riparian disturbance by agriculture; and (3) sediment coarseness and embeddedness and riparian vegetation condition. Concentrations of dissolved metals were not correlated with the CCA axes. Analyses of species abundances were sensitive to effects associated with nutrients, substrates, and riparian vegetation, whereas analyses of periphyton metrics were sensitive not only to these nutrient and physical habitat effects but also to toxicological effects associated with metals. As a result, the analyses of periphyton metrics may be used to identify which metrics would be useful for a periphyton index of biotic integrity and would also be individually diagnostic of the larger scale stressors in these streams, nutrient, substrate, and riparian vegetation effects of livestock grazing and increased metal concentrations associated with metal mining.

AB  - This paper reflects upon the current state of the art of strategic environmental assessment (SEA), based on a review of existing literature, recent international conferences and practical experience. It provides an overview of how SEA has evolved, the main schools of thought, and application internationally. It briefly examines whether SEA is making a difference to planning and decision-making processes, and raises the question: 'where to next?' Based on the main strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, a number of recommendations for future practice are made. We conclude that SEA has evolved rapidly into a broad field of application and that the 'family of SEA approaches' continues to develop. SEA brings about numerous benefits and has a high potential to contribute to better decision-making processes, even if it currently falls short of some of its expectations. We suggest that the SEA community must learn to better identify and promote SEA's less tangible benefits beyond the immediate decision-making situation and that SEA practice would benefit from a more explicit understanding and communication of how it can add value to any given context.

AB  - Several studies on birds have proposed that a lack of invertebrate prey in urbanized areas could be the main cause for generally lower levels of breeding success compared to rural habitats. Previous work on house sparrows Passer domesticus found that supplemental feeding in urbanized areas increased breeding success but did not contribute to population growth. Here, we hypothesize that supplementary feeding allows house sparrows to achieve higher breeding success but at the cost of lower nestling quality. As abundant food supplies may permit both high-and low-quality nestlings to survive, we also predict that within-brood variation in proxies of nestling quality would be larger for supplemental food broods than for unfed broods. As proxies of nestling quality, we considered feather corticosterone (CORTf), body condition (scaled mass index, SMI), and tarsus-based fluctuating asymmetry (FA). Our hypothesis was only partially supported as we did not find an overall effect of food supplementation on FA or SMI. Rather, food supplementation affected nestling phenotype only early in the breeding season in terms of elevated CORTf levels and a tendency for more variable within-brood CORTf and FA. Early food supplemented nests therefore seemed to include at least some nestlings that faced increased stressors during development, possibly due to harsher environmental (e.g., related to food and temperature) conditions early in the breeding season that would increase sibling competition, especially in larger broods. The fact that CORTf was positively, rather than inversely, related to nestling SMI further suggests that factors influencing CORTf and SMI are likely operating over different periods or, alternatively, that nestlings in good nutritional condition also invest in high-quality feathers.

AB  - The clinical development of group A streptococcal (GAS) vaccines will require the implementation of a standardized, high-throughput assay to measure the activity of functional opsonic antibodies in vaccine recipients. In the present study, we adapted and modified the HL-60-based protocol that was developed for the detection of opsonic antibodies against Streptococcus pneumoniae for use with multiple M types of GAS. Modifications of the assay conditions permitted the evaluation of 21 different M types of GAS in the assay. The specificity of the antibody-mediated opsonization was demonstrated by inhibition with homologous, but not heterologous, M proteins. Maximum rates of opsonophagocytic killing (OPK) of 14 different M types promoted by rabbit antiserum against the 30-valent M protein-based vaccine were comparable in whole-blood and HL-60 assays. Data are also presented showing OPK serum titers (opsonic index) of naturally acquired human antibodies present in IVIG [intravenous immune globulin (human)]. Results of the HL-60 assay performed on different days using 21 different M types of GAS and IVIG as the antibody source were significantly concordant. This report indicates that the OPK assay conditions may be optimized for the measurement of opsonic antibodies against a number of epidemiologically important M types of GAS and, once standardized, should facilitate the clinical development of effective vaccines to prevent these infections.
   IMPORTANCE Measuring functional opsonic antibodies against group A streptococci is an important component of the clinical development path for effective vaccines. Prior studies have used an assay developed over 60 years ago that relied on whole human blood as the source of phagocytes and complement, both of which are critical components of antibody-mediated killing assays. In this study, we adapted an assay that uses the HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cell line as phagocytic cells and baby rabbit serum as a source of complement for detection of opsonic antibodies against group A streptococci. On the basis of some of the known biological characteristics of the bacteria, we modified the assay conditions to support the evaluation of 21 epidemiologically important M types and demonstrated the utility and reproducibility of the assay for measurement of functional opsonic antibody levels.

AB  - This article discusses the limitations and implications to environmental management issues posed by the Environmental Licensing approach adopted in Sao Paulo State. In Brazil, Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is an essential precondition to the Environmental Licensing of activities and, in fact, it has been the most important and required tool for the licensing of projects. However, in 1994 the State of Sao Paulo implemented a simplified instrument called a "Preliminary Environmental Report" in order to make the environmental licensing process faster. Since then, the Preliminary Environmental Report (PER) has had the role of indicating whether an EIA needs to be elaborated upon or not. The positives and negatives regarding technical, institutional and legal aspects related to the use of Preliminary Environmental Reports (rather than EIA) are discussed using the case study of a high-pressure natural gas pipeline between

AB  - Brain science research often involves the use of low-dimensional tools and stimuli that lack several of the potentially valuable features of everyday activities and interactions. Although this research has provided important information about cognitive, affective, and social processes for both clinical and nonclinical populations, there is growing interest in high-dimensional simulations that extend reality. These high-dimensional simulations involve dynamic stimuli presented serially or concurrently to permit the assessment and training of perceivers' integrative processes over time. Moreover, high-dimensional simulation platforms can contextually restrain interpretations of cues about a target's internal states. Extended reality environments extend assessment and training platforms that balance experimental control with emotionally engaging background narratives aimed at extending the affective experience and social interactions. Herein, we highlight the promise of extended reality platforms for greater ecological validity in the clinical, affective, and social neurosciences.

AB  - Bioindicators (tobacco ssp. BEL W3) and, for comparison, abiotic deposition collectors based on the indigo paper method were exposed for ozone monitoring at various locations with different traffic situations in Munich. The exposure schedule was 10 periods of 14 days each from May to October 1992. At one station in the centre of the city the results were related to the data of a continous ozone analyser of a monitoring-station of the Bavarian State Office for Environmental Protection (LfU). The correlation of ozone doses computed from the contiuous ozone measurements and corresponding extinctions of istatin solutions from the indigo papers (unbuffered variants) revealed a linear relationship with a correlation coefficient of r=0,98. Data correlation between tobacco damages and istatin formation in these indigo papers due to the ozone exposure revealed a correlation coefficient of r=0,92. This correlation shows low increase of tobacco damage at the low ozone dose range and, in comparison, an exponential increase at high indigo values.

AB  - Long chain alkyl diols form a group of lipids occurring widely in marine environments. Recent studies have suggested several palaeoclimatological applications for proxies based on their distributions, but have also revealed uncertainty about their applicability. Here we evaluate the use of long chain 1,14-alkyl diol indices for reconstruction of temperature and upwelling conditions by comparing index values, obtained from a comprehensive set of marine surface sediments, with environmental factors such as sea surface temperature (SST), salinity and nutrient concentration. Previous studies of cultures indicated a strong effect of temperature on the degree of saturation and the chain length distribution of long chain 1,14-alkyl diols in Proboscia spp., quantified as the diol saturation index (DSI) and diol chain length index (DCI), respectively. However, values of these indices for surface sediments showed no relationship with annual mean SST of the overlying water. It remains unknown as to what determines the DSI, although our data suggest that it may be affected by diagenesis, while the relationship between temperature and DCI may be different for different Proboscia species. In addition, contributions from algae other than Proboscia diatoms may affect both indices, although our data provide no direct evidence for additional long chain 1,14-alkyl diol sources. Two other indices using the abundance of 1,14-diols vs. 1,13-diols and C-30 1,15-diols have been applied previously as indicators for upwelling intensity at different locations. The geographical distribution of their values supports the use of 1,14 diols vs. 1,13 diols [C-28 + C-30 1,14-diols]/[(C-28 + C-30 1,13-diols) + (C-28 + C-30 1,14-diols)] as a general indicator for high nutrient or upwelling conditions.

AB  - The metacommunity concept has recently been described to account for the roles of dispersal in regulating community structure. Despite its strong theoretical basis, there exist few large-scale and long-term examples of its applicability in aquatic ecosystems. In this study we used a long-term dataset (1961-2007) on the relative abundances of the dominant limnetic fishes from two interconnected lakes to investigate the synergistic effects of naturally declining lake volume (approximately 50% in 50 years), climate variation, fishery management, and dispersal on community composition. We found a marked shift in fish community composition and variability during a period of rapid natural habitat change; however, the change was most apparent in the downstream, more stable lake of the system rather than at the site of disturbance. Multivariate analysis suggested significant shifts in community composition and variability in the downstream lake. Results indicated that the community composition in both lakes was best explained by habitat loss in the upper watershed and the number of spawning adult sockeye salmon the previous year (reflecting both natural processes and commercial fishing). Furthermore, communities exhibited site-specific responses to climatic conditions (e.g., index of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation), whereby the upper lake responded to climate within a given year and with a 1-year time lag, whereas the downstream community responded only with a 1-year lag. We attribute this difference largely to downstream dispersal and recruitment of fish from the upper lake. Thus, we suggest that the interconnected nature of the communities in this system provides a useful and large-scale example of the metacommunity concept, whereby the effects of environmental disturbance on community structure ultimately depend on the effects of these disturbances on dispersal among ecosystems.

AB  - Chironomid species in water bodies are useful indicators of the nutrient and environmental states. The relative abundance of chironomids and nutrients like organic carbon (C), potassium ions (K+), nitrate (NO3-), and phosphate (PO42-) of the water bodies were analyzed using numerical techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) and Cluster Analysis (CA) to justify the use of chironomids in environmental biomonitoring. The data analyses of 90 samples from eight different ponds Kolkata, India, revealed the presence of 12 chironomid species in different relative densities. The chironomid immature numbers per unit area was found to be positively correlated with C and PO42-, while no definite significant correlation was observed for K+ or NO3-. The PCA yielded three components that could explain >63% of variation of the observed data. In terms of factor loadings, pH, K+, NO3- and PO42- contributed to the first factor; while C, water temperature and dissolved O-2 contributed to the second factor. The CCA showed distribution of the chironomid species to differ against the variance of water quality parameters. The first canonical axis (lambda(1)=0.156; F=5.126; P<0.05) explained 69% of species - environment relationship. The abundance of three species of chironomid midges, Chironomus striatipennis, C. circumdatus and Kiefferulus calligaster was prominent in all the water bodies. Cluster analysis showed that these species were highly correlated in their abundance contrast to remaining species. The results indicate that the water quality parameters influence the chironomid species assemblages to a considerable extent. This is supportive of the use of chironomid midges in biomonitoring for ecological management of urban water bodies of Kolkata, India and similar geographical areas.

AB  - Changing grain yields as a result of growing conditions is the basis for assessing the stability of each variety. It determines the value of the genotype against the background of the other varieties in the group. The purpose of this study is to analyze and establish the effectiveness of various grain yield stability indexes in conditions where we have a strong interaction of a variety by environments.
   A group of 40 winter wheat varieties have been tested with respect to grain yield at three locations of the country for two consecutive seasons. Against the background of the established genotype by environment interaction, eighteen statistical indices were determined and analyzed to determine the stability of genotypes. The correlation relationships between the ranks of all indices, including the grain yield, are analyzed. These are those which, together with grain yield, could independently characterize the value of each variety in relation to known check varieties, both in specific and in a wide range of environments.
   The values of the calculated indices included in the study show significant differences between the stability of the varieties. This stability can be determined by several of the surveyed indices, such as NP(3), NP(4) and S-(6), as well as the experimentally determined result index AR6. Several of the latest varieties such as (9) ARO Sankt, (17) ABC Veto, (31) Riana, (36) ABC Klausius, 38 ABC Zigmund and 40 ABC Navo have the rare ability to realise high and stable yields in the main wheat-growing regions of the country.
   The measurement of variation in grain yield of the variety grown under different conditions is mandatory in determining its breeding value. The correlations between the ranks of the indices differ from grain yield, which indicates the need for careful analysis when interpreting them The grain yield level after correction by its stability is the light approach for grouping varieties to target them in specific environmental conditions. The spatial location of the varieties studied through yield ranges and stability is an effective way of objectively comparing them with the standards. The grain yield stability of each variety can be assessed quickly, accurately and correctly by using modem statistical packages created for that purpose.

AB  - The global farming systems (GFS) approach is extended by adding a soil fertility and nutrient management dimension for Africa's forest-based, maize mixed, cereal-root crop mixed, and agro-pastoral millet/sorghum farming systems. Use is made of sustainable livelihood concepts, translated into farmer capitals (natural, physical, financial, human, social), and the indicator-based DPSIR (driving force-pressure-state-impact-response) framework for environmental reporting. State and impact indicators show, for each GFS, levels of nutrient stocks and flows, respectively. In case of nutrient depletion, soils may (i) initially still be fertile enough to provide reasonable and stable yields, (ii) support declining yields, or (iii) support low yields at low fertility level. In the latter case, food security is generally at stake. Response indicators include the level of uptake of improved integrated nutrient management strategies at land user level, and the enforcement of new and enabling pro-agriculture and pro-environment policies. Although the extended GFS have no direct relevance for farm-level interventions, the approach can be used to frame soil fertility research priorities and policies at a regional level.

AB  - The superficial and cored sediments of the Sidi Moussa lagoon (Atlantic Moroccan coast) have been analysed in order to determine their main characteristics and their heavy metals contents. Two groups of metals can be distinguished:
   Al, Fe and Cu whose distribution is mainly governed by the intra-lagoonal dynamics. These contents are near of those of the natural geochemical backaround noise that underlines their natural origin.
   Zn, Cr and Ni have relatively more elevated contents than the natural geochemical background noise indicating human-made pollution. The geo-accumulation indicator shows that the Sidi Moussa lagoon is moderately polluted. The totality of results in this context compared to the standard values suggested by the Agency of Protection of the Environment of United States [Journal of Great Lakes Research 11 (1985) 353] leads to the conclusion that the sediments of Sidi Moussa lagoon would rank as 'slightly polluted' for, Cu, Zn. Cr and Ni.

AB  - We present results of a multiyear study of the Everglades (Florida, USA) detailing how differences in environmental variables can alter mercury concentrations in the food web. About 1000 random locations throughout the freshwater Everglades marsh have been sampled for the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Everglades Regional Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program ("REMAP") since 1995. REMAP sampling is synoptic and multimedia, including an abundant prey fish (eastern mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki) as an indicator of mercury bioaccumulation. Amplifying an approach we reported to Everglades National Park, we used Generalized Boosted Models on the REMAP data to estimate how much of the mercury concentration in mosquitofish could be explained by water quality constituents or indicators of ecological health (covariates). The resulting model accounts for 60% of the environmental influence on variation in mosquitofish mercury, a robust outcome for a large, disturbed ecosystem such as the Everglades, given its seasonal, annual, and spatial differences. Of the eight most influential covariates, two were methyl mercury in periphyton and water, two can be indicators of trophic state (alkaline phosphatase and chlorophyll-a), one can be a marker of stormwater transport (conductivity), and two can be enablers of mercury methylation (sulfate in soil and water). While these covariates had an average individual influence ranging from 4.0% to 10.1%, together they accounted for 52.2% of the total relative influence. Water with low phosphorus, but with sulfur and carbon above background, moved into the less disturbed parts of the Everglades via modifications to the existing water management system, could increase mercury bioaccumulation in those parts of the marsh.

AB  - Phytoplankton species composition and abundance in the Lembeh Strait waters was studied in four cruises of April 2013, May 2014, June 2012 and October 2015, during the period of monsoon transition time of SE monsoon. With data obtained the seasonal alternations of phytoplankton community structures and its driving factors were discussed. A total of 416 taxa belonging to 5 classes of phytoplankton were recorded in the four month surveys. Phytoplankton density was averaged 2 348 cell/L and diatoms and dinoflagellates had the most diversified species. Cyanobacterium was characterized by its low species numbers but high abundance in the waters of Lembeh Strait. Total phytoplankton abundance occurred low in April and October in the monsoon transition period and it raised high in May and June during the SE monsoon. Frequently occurred species were pelagic diatoms in addition to cyanobacterium Trichodesmium. Abundance and diversity of phytoplankton significantly differed seasonally. The diatoms Thalassionema and Pseudo-nitzschia, and cyanobacterium Trichodesmium contributed most to the community dissimilarities. Due to potentially higher nutrient supply in the south of Lembeh Strait, diatoms and dinoflagellates showed higher densities in the south than in the north of the strait. Though, cyanobacterium preferred distributing much evenly in all waters, it had higher density in the southern Lembeh Strait. Total phytoplankton abundance is quite low compared with the Jakarta Bay and some bays in China. Analysis showed that nutrients from upwelling forced by SE monsoon are the key factor varying the monthly phytoplankton abundances. Due to its primitive nature state, Lembeh water can be an ideal location for the study of pelagic ecosystem under merely the influence of macro environment changes with lower background noise from human activities.

AB  - Reverse osmosis concentrated leachate (ROCL) from landfill leachate treatment contains high amounts of refractory organics. In this study, a combination of polymerized ferric sulfate (PFS) and nanoscale zerovalent iron/peroxymonosulfate/ozone (nZVI/PMS/O-3) approach was adopted to remove refractory pollutants in ROCL. The effects of coagulant species, dosage and initial pH on the pre-treatment of organics from ROCL during coagulation process were investigated. Moreover, the influences of experimental factors, including initial pH, ozone doses, PMS, and nZVI on the removal of refractory organics in ROCL from coagulation effluent were systematically studied. The characteristics of organics were determined by using microscopic, spectroscopic and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analyses. The batch experimental results indicated that the refractory organic contaminants in ROCL were effectively removed through PFS-nZVI/PMS/O-3 treatment. The maximum removal efficiencies of COD and TOC were 89.1% and 83.2% under the optimum conditions: PFS of 8 g/L, ozone dose of 100 mg/min, PMS dose of 1.5 mM and nZVI dose of 10 mM, and at these conditions, the biodegradability index (BOD5/COD) was enhanced from 0.02 to 0.32. The excitation-emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy (EEM) analysis indicated that humic-like and fulvic-like substances in ROCL were effectively removed. According to EPR analysis, hydroxyl and sulfate radicals were the dominant reactive species for the degradation of organics in nZVI/PMS/O-3 system. Overall, the environmental and economic analysis suggested that the PFS-nZVI/PMS/O-3 system was a cost-effective method for cleaning refractory organics from ROCL. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Improper disposal of mining waste is still considered a global problem, and further details on the contamination by potentially toxic metals are required for a proper assessment. In this context, it is important to have a combined view of the chemical and biological changes in the mining dump area. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the Pb, Zn and Cd contamination in a slag disposal area using the integration of geochemical and microbiological data. Analyses of soil organic matter (SOM), pH, Eh, pseudo-total concentration of metals, sequential extraction and microbial community by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) were conducted. Metal availability was evaluated based on the geoaccumulation index (I-geo), ecological risk (E-r(i)), Risk Assessment Code (RAC) and experimental data, and different reference values were tested to assist in the interpretation of the indices. The soil pH was slightly acidic to neutral, the Eh values indicated oxidized conditions and the average SOM content varied from 12.10 to 53.60 g kg(-1). The average pseudo-total concentrations of metals were in the order of Zn > Pb > Cd. Pb and Zn were mainly bound to the residual fraction and Fe-Mn oxides, and a significant proportion of Cd was bound to the exchangeable and carbonate fractions. The topsoil (0-20 cm) is highly contaminated (I-geo) with Cd and has a very high potential ecological risk (E-r(i)). Higher bacterial diversity was mainly associated with higher metal concentrations. It is concluded that the integration of geochemical and microbiological data can provide an appropriate evaluation of mining waste-contaminated areas.

AB  - In membrane bioreactors applied to wastewater treatment, fouling is typically a complex function of sludge characteristics. A pilot-scale tertiary submerged membrane bioreactor (tMBR) was continuously operated for over 200 days to assess the effect of biomass physiological state and environmental stress on process performance. Sludge characteristics were evaluated in terms of suspended solid concentration (MLSS and MLVSS), apparent viscosity, bioflocculation state, filterability, bioactivity, biopolymeric clusters (BPCs) and soluble microbial products. During the initial period of the tMBR start-up, when MLSS was below 3000 mg/L, the biomass was found to be very sensitive to environmental stress by sudden oxygen increase or organic shock loading, resulting in temporary biomass deflocculation and BPC release, and consequently, severe induced membrane fouling. However, at higher MLSS values, low stable biomass growth (0.04 +/- 0.002 kg MLVSS/kg COD) was measured, regardless of organic overloading shocks or feeding failures. This period was also characterised by low bioactivity, BPC content and membrane fouling. Statistical analysis showed that BPCs have an important role when compared with other sludge properties as indicators of its fouling potential.

AB  - This paper aims to improve ecosystem assessment practice by sharing the lessons learned from the Flanders Regional Ecosystem Assessment. The 'EU biodiversity strategy to 2020', requests the EU member states 'to map and assess the state of ecosystems and their services by 2014'. However, a large number of member states have yet to start this assessment, and depend on assistance from the European Commission and on experiences from ongoing national assessments. In the region of Flanders (Belgium), several ecosystem service projects have since 2009 led the way to the 'Flanders Regional Ecosystem Assessment' (Flanders-REA), led by the governments' leading research institute on biodiversity. To attain high regional requirements on scientific quality, acceptance and effective local policy impact, this assessment has tackled a number of challenges. The challenges discussed in this paper are obtaining conceptual clarity and consensus across disciplines and partners, the integration of multiple sources of information, critical handling of maps and the inclusion of experts and stakeholders. This paper also critically reflects on the definition of EU targets, their implementation, the current EU assistance to the member states, and the alignment with actual local and global policy needs.

AB  - Specially protected natural areas (SPNA), due to their remoteness from direct sources of anthropogenic pollution, can be used as background territories. In order to determine the "standard" for assessing the state of surface water bodies of the Kirov region, a study was made of the state of surface waters of the Pizhemsky State Nature Reserve (SNR). Water samples from the Pyzhma and Yaran rivers, as well as floodplain reservoirs located within the protected areas were studied. It is established that the water of the studied water bodies belongs to the category of calcium carbonate waters. In general, surface water bodies of the territory of the Pizhemsky SNR are characterized by a relatively low content of inorganic ions and are poorly mineralized. For some water bodies, an increased content of ammonium, zinc and copper ions has been established. It exceeds the maximum permissible concentration for fishery waters, but does not exceed the maximum permissible concentration for drinking water. The increased content of these ions in water can be associated with natural processes (leaching of rocks, eutrophication, decomposition of organic substances, etc.). Water from the Yaran river within the Pizhemsky SNR is characterized by a higher salinity than the waters of the Pizhma river and floodplain ponds adjacent to it. The data obtained during the study are in good agreement with the indicators obtained earlier on the ionic composition of the lakes of the Nurgush SNR, which is the background territory for the region's environmental monitoring. A feature of water bodies at the Pizhemsky SNR is a higher salinity of water, which is due to the increased content of bicarbonate ions in it. According to the results of the work, surface water bodies of the Pizhemsky nature reserve are recommended as background for objects with calcium-carbonate type of water.

AB  - Stream algal indices of biotic integrity (IBIs) are generally based entirely or largely on diatoms, because non-diatom ("soft") algae can be difficult to quantify and taxonomically challenging, thus calling into question their practicality and cost-effectiveness for use as bioindicators. Little has been published rigorously evaluating the strengths of diatom vs. soft algae-based indices, or how they compare to indices combining these assemblages. Using a set of ranked evaluation criteria, we compare indices of biotic integrity (IBIs) (developed for southern California streams) that incorporate different combinations of algal assemblages. We split a large dataset into independent "calibration" and "validation" subsets, then used the calibration subset to screen candidate metrics with respect to degree of responsiveness to anthropogenic stress, metric score distributions, and signal-to-noise ratio. The highest-performing metrics were combined into a total of 25 IBIs comprising either single-assemblage metrics (based on either diatoms or soft algae, including cyanobacteria) or combinations of metrics representing the two assemblages (for "hybrid IBIs"). Performance of all IBIs was assessed based on: responsiveness to anthropogenic stress (in terms of surrounding land uses and a composite water-chemistry gradient) using the validation data, and evaluated based on signal-to-noise ratio, metric redundancy, and degree of indifference to natural gradients. Hybrid IBIs performed best overall based on our evaluation. Single-assemblage IBIs ranked lower than hybrids vis-A -vis the abovementioned performance attributes, but may be considered appropriate for routine monitoring applications. Trade-offs inherent in the use of the different algal assemblages, and types of IBI, should be taken into consideration when designing an algae-based stream bioassessment program.

AB  - Environmental deterioration around fish farms has been widespread in Japanese coastal areas. In order to prevent self-induced deterioration of the surrounding environment, the "Law to Ensure Sustainable Aquaculture Production" was enacted in 1999. Criteria based on three indicators, i.e., (1) dissolved oxygen content of water in fish cages, (2) acid volatile sulfide content (AVS-S) in the sediment and (3) the occurrence of macrofauna under the fish cages were determined to promote the "Aquaculture Ground Improvement Program" by applying this Law. The second criterion (AVS-S) is based on the assimilative capacity of the sediments to organic wastes from a fish farm. For applying this criterion to each farm, the maximum phase in the process of biological remineralization must be detected for a farm site when the benthic oxygen uptake (BOU) rates shows maximum. The peak of BOU, however, could not be determined during a survey in Gokasho Bay, suggesting a need for reexamination regarding the practical application of this criterion. In order to obtain data for refining the third criterion (macrofauna), a quantitative survey was conducted at 22 fish farms (red sea bream and yellowtail) along the Kumano-nada coast, central Japan. The biomass of the macrobenthos peaked in sediments containing 1.2 mg/g of total nitrogen, where the majority of aerobic mineralization of the loaded organic matter is supposed to occur. In summer, animals were scarcely found in sediments with AVS-S>1.7 mg/g, suggesting that this is a critical condition for the fish farm environment. An index embayment degree (ED), which represents the topographic conditions of a farm site, is proposed to discriminate artificial factors arising from fish farming activities from the natural factors related to the topography. Community parameters of the macrobenthos and environmental factors were significantly correlated with ED (P<0.001). In shallow, semi-enclosed sites (larger ED values), environmental deterioration and decreases in the benthic biomass were more conspicuous in large-scale farms than in small-scale farms. Six assemblages of the macrobenthos were identified by cluster analysis and were classified into three groups, indicating conditions as healthy, cautionary and critical, respectively. As fish production increased, habitat of the assemblage in the cautionary zone shifted to the offshore, deeper areas (smaller ED values), indicating that both of aquacultural activities and topographic conditions affect the species composition. Macrofauna, sediment parameters and the index ED are concluded as useful to develop pragmatic guidelines for site selection of fish farms. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Scientists have dedicated many decades and resources to studying the effects of tillage on soil properties and crop yields. However, the literature lacks empirical data on corn/soybean yields and their stability to variable-weather years under long-term management at multiple locations in mid-Western USA. Thus, the objective of the current study was to evaluate yields and their stability from 2009 through 2013 at eight long-term sites with no-till (NT) and chisel-plow (CP) managed continuous corn (CC) and corn (Zea mays)-soybean (Glycine max) rotations (C-s and c-S for corn and soybean phase). The tillage-treatment durations among the eight sites ranged from eight to 51 years in the Midwestern U.S. Corn Belt. The data indicates that tillage had no significant effect on long-term crop yields, with a few exceptions. During one site-year (southern Minnesota in 2012) in the CC system, NT yielded significantly 15.2% more than CP (9.1 vs. 7.9 Mg ha(-1)). However, CC yields averaged across sites were significantly 10.5 and 13.6% more in CP than NT in 2009 and 2010, respectively (12.6 vs. 11.4 Mg ha(-1) in 2009; 12.5 vs. 11.0 Mg ha(-1) in 2010). In the corn-soybean rotations, CP yielded significantly 18.7% more than NT (12.7 vs. 10.7 Mg ha(-1)) when averaged across years at one site in Iowa for the C-s phase. Yield stability indexes to environmental conditions indicated no differences in NT than CP yield stabilities among variable-weather years. However, NT had significantly lower range of relative yields across the variable-weather years as compared to CP for the CC system and C-s phase. These direct and synthesized data provide evidence of little to no differences between CP and NT managed corn/soybean research plots exist in the Midwestern US. Although CP may produce greater yields when averaged across the regions research plots during some years, this effect was not evident at the individual research plot scale.

AB  - Privately-owned drinking water wells serving fewer than 25 people (private wells) are prevalent and understudied across most of the US. Private wells primarily serve rural households located outside of municipal drinking water and sewerage service coverage areas. These wells are not regulated by United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Safe Drinking Water Act, are not regularly monitored by any public agency or utility, and generally do not undergo disinfection treatment. Coliphages are a group of viruses that infect coliform bacteria and are useful viral surrogates for fecal contamination in water systems in much the same way that fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), such as E. coli and to a lesser extent total coliforms, are used to quantify fecal contamination. Coliphages are approved by the EPA for regulatory monitoring in groundwater wells in the USA, but are not routinely used for this purpose. The present study characterizes the occurrence of male-specific and somatic coliphages, along with FIB, in private wells (n = 122) across two different counties in North Carolina. While occurrences of E. coli were rare and frequency of total coliform was generally low (similar to 20%), male-specific and somatic coliphages were detectable in 66% and 54% of samples, respectively. Concentrations of male-specific coliphages were higher than somatics at each county and on a monthly basis. Rainfall appears to be partly influencing higher coliphage concentrations in December, January and February. This research underscores the need for increased surveillance in private wells and consideration of using coliphages in order to better characterize occurrence of fecal contamination at the time of sampling, especially during rainier months.

AB  - Widespread degradation of wetlands has motivated the development of tools to evaluate wetland condition. The application of field-based tools over large regions can be prohibitively expensive; however, land cover data may provide a surrogate for intensive assessments, enabling rapid and cost-effective evaluation of wetlands throughout whole regions. Our goal was to determine if land cover data could be used to estimate the biotic integrity of wetlands in Alberta's Beaverhills watershed. Biotic integrity was measured using both plant- and bird-based indices of biotic integrity (IBIs) in 45 wetlands. Land cover data were extracted from seven nested landscape extents (100-3,000 m radii) and used to model IBI scores. Strong, significant predictions of IBI scores were achieved using land cover data from every spatial extent, even after factoring out the influence of location to address the spatial autocorrelation of land cover classes. Plant-based IBI scores were best predicted using data from 100 m buffers and bird-based IBI scores were best predicted using data extracted from 500 m buffers. Road cover or density and measures of the proportion of disturbed land were consistent predictors of IBI score, suggesting their universal importance to plant and bird communities. Simplified models using the proportion of undisturbed land were less accurate than more detailed models (reductions in r (2) of 0.31-0.32). Regardless of the level of detail in land cover classification, our results emphasize the need to optimize landscape extent for the taxonomic group of interest: an issue that is typically poorly articulated in studies reporting on the development of GIS-based assessment methods. Our results also highlight the need to calibrate models in test areas before scaling up, to ensure predictive accuracy.

AB  - The social and ecological systems of Mediterranean streams are intrinsically linked as a result of long human occupation. In this region, these links vary greatly across small distances due to geomorphology, resulting in great diversity across space, which poses particular challenges for understanding and managing these systems. This demands (i) interdisciplinary integration of knowledge that focuses on the social-ecological interactions, while according due consideration to the whole; and also (ii) transdisciplinary integration, integrating lay and expert knowledge to understand local specificities. To address these needs-a focus on interactions and local knowledge-the research presented here studies the human-nature relationship in Mediterranean streams. Its main objective is to improve understanding of Mediterranean streams, but it also provides practical inputs to enhance local-level management. The study adopts an applied approach from the perspective of natural resources management. A case study was developed conducting field work on streams within the Natura 2000 site of Monfurado, Portugal-a mainly privately owned area with conflicting land uses between conservation and farming. Rivers and streams in Portugal are considered to be in very bad condition, particularly with regard to water quality. The experimental design was based, from a critical realism perspective of inter- and trans-disciplinarity, on the complementarities between methodologies from (i) the social sciences: value survey and analysis of discourse; and (ii) the natural sciences: biomonitoring and integrity biotic indexes. Results characterized the connected systems from both ecological and social points of view. They also characterized the relationship between both dimensions. We concluded that well-established riparian vegetation cover of streams is a key structural element of the human-nature relationship in the Mediterranean streams of Monfurado at several levels. The central role this structure might have in the dialog between the conflicting land uses with regard to water management is discussed, and priority targets for management are identified. The tree stratum in streams may work as a conciliation factor in the conflict between farming and conservation, as it is in the interest of both sectors to maintain it; however, the shrub stratum is effectively a source of conflict between the two perspectives and needs further work at the social-change level.

AB  - The multimetric index of biotic integrity (IBI) based on fish assemblages has been widely used to monitor aquatic ecosystem status in headwater streams. However, the application of the IBI has generally been biased by the low number of species and natural altitudinal gradients in these systems. To overcome these limitations, taxonomic distinctness and size-weight-based indices were integrated into our candidate metric pool, and calibration was performed to reduce the effects of the altitudinal gradient on the metrics in our study. Eighty-two sites in six headwater streams along a typical high altitude gradient and with low species richness were sampled. Eighty-three candidate metrics were selected to develop our IBI (IBI-Han) based on the systematic screening method. Six metrics based on taxonomic distinctness, habitat, tolerance guild, reproductive guild and trophic guild were finally retained in the IBI-Han: average taxonomic distinctness, percent rheophilic species, percent tolerant species, percent biomass of water column species, percent lithophilic species, and percent carnivorous species. The IBI-Han performed well in discriminating anthropogenic disturbances not only at training sites but also at testing sites, which suggests that our method could provide a reliable evaluation of the condition of headwater stream ecosystems. Among the six rivers, the Jinshui River showed relatively healthy ecosystem status, while the other five streams were disturbed by various human activities. Our work highlights that taxonomic distinctness indices are robust biomonitoring indices that can be combined with other functional indices to assess high altitude gradient streams in the upper Han River. We believe that the process of developing the IBI-Han could be regarded as a reference for managing headwater streams in other regions of China or in other states.

AB  - Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) is an important driver of stand-level tree diversity in temperate forests. CNDD can occur via two main processes. First, soil pathogens and herbivores form a halo of high enemy density surrounding established trees at local spatial scales. As a result, seedlings and saplings residing within this halo experience reduced growth and survival. Second, intraspecific competition can lead to local depletion of resources, reducing the performance of conspecific seedlings and saplings, and encouraging spatial mixing of tree species. While seedlings and saplings respond to nearby conspecific adults, they are simultaneously responding to local environmental conditions. Solar radiation, soil moisture, and soil nutrients can all influence tree recruitment patterns. Furthermore, these environmental factors can influence densities and activities of soil pathogens, as well as seedling and sapling carbon balance. As a result, we expect small-scale variation in the abiotic environment to influence the magnitude of CNDD, although this expectation has thus far received little attention. We combined tree stem and environmental data from a mapped oak-hickory forest plot to evaluate whether the local environment modulates the direction or magnitude of negative density dependence. We tested for the interaction between conspecific and heterospecific basal area within a sapling's neighborhood and each of five environmental covariates: index of canopy gaps, soil organic matter, soil cations, topographic curvature, and topographic slope/aspect. We found that increasing local conspecific and heterospecific basal areas reduced sapling growth and that the conspecific basal area reduced sapling growth more so than did heterospecific basal area. Furthermore, we observed significant interactions between adult tree density and all environmental covariates that differed depending on the category of nearby adults (i.e., conspecific vs. heterospecific), and this effect was most important with variations in soil organic matter, soil cations, and topographic slope/aspect. We conclude that tree basal area not only interacts with environmental conditions to influence sapling growth, but more importantly, that small-scale environmental conditions interact with the density of nearby conspecifics to modulate sapling growth. Thus, if this result proves general, a central mechanism underlying the maintenance of diversity can be modified by small-scale environmental conditions.

TI  - Management of water scarcity: A focus on social capacities and options
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH PART B-HYDROLOGY OCEANS AND ATMOSPHERE
LA  - English
AB  - Water is a scarce resource. It is critical to social and economic development, and directly affects the behaviour of society. With close links between society and water management, the importance of social and economic approaches to management of water scarcity is increasingly being recognized. The focus is here on the adaptive capacity of societies both for policy making and for conflict resolution to address water scarcity, recognizing the limitations in these adaptive capacities. Social resource scarcity could limit not only capacity to address water scarcity but also have wider social security implications for adaptive processes. There is therefore a need to develop policy options to stimulate adaptive processes and strengthen social resource capacity. Further, the paper discusses the links between water scarcity and its driving forces, such as population increase, environmental degradation and unequal access to water, and the various categories of related conflicts.
   The need to consider the social resource capacity of countries and societies and the use of alternative indicators for this purpose is addressed using the UNDP Human Development Index as a proxy for the social adaptive capacity of societies. A broad programme of research and capacity building in the use of a composite biological-social index could be expected to trigger a better understanding between disciplines and re-focus technical cooperation programmes on social issues.
   While markets can sometimes react efficiently to mitigate water scarcity, the necessary institutional conditions are seldom met. Social, environmental and equity parameters also need to be considered in applying market approaches, and neo-classical water resources economics is losing ground to economic paradigms related to political and evolutionary processes.
   Macro- and sectoral issues are increasingly at the forefront of the water scarcity debate, involving a range of questions: from virtual water, high costs of O&M, to privatization of water sector operations. Macro and sector policies often have an important impact on realization of socio-economic and environmental benefits from present and future investments in the water sector. A country's overall development strategy and use of macro-economic policies, including fiscal, monetary and trade policies, affect water demand and investment. As a consequence, there is need for an integrated approach encompassing social, economic and environmental policies.
   The paper draws from examples on water scarcity management that were presented in a recent FAO electronic conference and in regional expert consultations on water scarcity management in the Near East. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Previous national and global conservation assessments have relied on habitat conversion data to quantify conservation risk. However, in addition to habitat conversion to crop production or urban uses, ecosystem alteration (e.g., from logging, conversion to plantations, biological invasion, or fire suppression) is a large source of conservation risk. We add data quantifying ecosystem alteration on unconverted lands to arrive at a more accurate depiction of conservation risk for the conterminous United States. We quantify ecosystem alteration using a recent national assessment based on remote sensing of current vegetation compared with modeled reference natural vegetation conditions. Highly altered (but not converted) ecosystems comprise 23% of the conterminous United States, such that the number of critically endangered ecoregions in the United States is 156% higher than when calculated using habitat conversion data alone. Increased attention to natural resource management will be essential to address widespread ecosystem alteration and reduce conservation risk.

AB  - In the Arctic, warming air and ocean temperatures have resulted in substantial changes to sea ice, which is primary habitat for polar bears (Ursus maritimus). Reductions in extent, duration, and thickness have altered sea ice dynamics, which influences the ability of polar bears to reliably access marine mammal prey. Because nutritional condition is closely linked to population vital rates, a progressive decline in access to prey or an increase in the energetic cost of accessing prey has the potential to adversely affect polar bear population dynamics. We examined long-term (1983-2015) patterns of spring body condition (indexed using residual body mass) and maternal investment (i.e., litter mass of cubs-of-the-year and yearlings; COY and YRL) of polar bears from Alaska's southern Beaufort Sea to evaluate potential relationships with regional- and circumpolar-scale sea ice conditions and atmospheric patterns. The length of the summer openwater (OW) season (i.e., the period of time the sea ice is mostly absent from the continental shelf) increased at a rate of 18 days decade-1 over the study period. However, the OW season duration was not a strong determinant of spring residual body mass or litter mass. Residual body mass of independent (i.e., subadults and adults) female bears varied relative to age class, reproductive status, and the strength of the prior winter's Arctic Oscillation (i.e., a circumpolarscale mode of climate variability driven by long-term atmospheric patterns). Spring residual mass of independent males varied with age class and variation in wind speed (i.e., regional-scale shortterm atmospheric patterns) during the winter of the year preceding capture. Over the study period, mean annual body mass of adult females unaccompanied by COY declined by 4 kg/ decade-1, while no temporal trends were evident in the mean annual body mass of adult females with COY, adult males, and subadults. Litter mass of COY varied relative to capture date, maternal age class and mass, litter size, and year of capture. Litter mass of YRL varied with capture date, maternal age class and mass, litter size, variation in winter wind speed (the year of and year preceding capture), and the strength of the prior winter's Arctic Oscillation. Mean annual litter mass of COY decreased at a rate of 2.6 kg decade-1 and declined 0.68 kg for every 10 kg reduction in maternal mass. No trend was evident in the mean annual litter mass of yearlings. These findings suggest a nuanced response of the southern Beaufort Sea polar bears to environmental change, where some demographic groups (e.g., adult males and subadults) are presently more resilient than others to changes in the Arctic marine ecosystem.

AB  - Endoparasitic infections vary significantly across altered aquatic ecosystems, making these organisms ideal for the biomonitoring of degraded environments. To assess the biomonitoring potential of the Caryophyllaeid tapeworm Adenoscolex oreini and the possible impact of water quality on fish species, a study was carried out in three lakes with marked eutrophication and pollution gradients. The A. oreini infection level in three host fish species of the genus Schizothorax and corresponding fish health status were determined. The pattern of cestode infection varied significantly in the three fish species across the pollution gradient. The prevalence of infection in two fish species (Schizothorax esocinus and S. curvifrons) was significantly greater (P < 0.05) in the eutrophic lake than in the reference lake, whereas in S. niger, the maximum was reached in the hypereutrophic lake. The estimated marginal mean intensity and other infection indices varied significantly (P < 0.05) across the inter and intra-pollution gradients of lakes. Multivariate statistical analysis results revealed maximum cestode infection in the eutrophic lake. An altered seasonal pattern was observed in the highly stressed lake. The gonadosomatic index (GSI) and condition factor values were significantly greater in fish collected from the reference lake than in those collected from the other lakes. A significant negative relationship between GSI and cestode prevalence was observed in the hypereutrophic lake as compared to least eutrophic lake. These findings indicate that infection indices of the Caryophyllaeid tapeworm and health attributes of fish can act as surrogates for the environmental quality of deteriorated lentic water bodies of the north-western Himalayan region, which is currently undergoing environmental degradation.

AB  - The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) was enacted in the year 2000 with a stepwise approach. After legal implementation in the various member states large efforts were undertaken for the initial characterization of water bodies, risk assessment, to implement extensive monitoring schemes and to develop management plans at different aggregation levels by the year 2010. The initial characterization process and risk assessment had to be finalized by 2004 and delineated water bodies including a typological classification and identified the significant pressures and impacts in a screening procedure. In parallel, monitoring programmes and new biological indicator systems were developed in order to proof and refine the results of the risk assessment with an ecological indicator based assessment in a subsequent step which was finalized in 2009. Although the risk assessment for Germany was based on existing data that were originally collected for other purposes and came from a large variety of environmental or economical sectors, the results differ only slightly from the monitoring and indicator based information with respect to classifications of the 'ecological status' and 'chemical status'. From this result we conclude that a risk assessment based on a careful application and intelligent combination of existing data sources with proven quality allows the recognition of trends and the identification of priorities for action of measures already at an early stage of a management process. However, monitoring schemes and advanced sets of ecological indicators are essential in later management steps both for narrowing uncertainties remaining from the risk assessment and to allow for effect controls of implemented measures. Moreover, these monitoring indicators should differentiate the effects of multiple stressors more factor specific and with respect to ecosystem states and functions. In conclusion, we see risk and indicator based assessments as complementary elements in Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), which have to be linked in systematic and phased procedures.

AB  - Do land use and cover characteristics of watersheds associated with small estuaries exhibit a strong enough signal to make landscape metrics useful for identifying degraded bottom communities? We tested this idea with 58 pairs of small estuaries (<260 km(2)) and watersheds in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic coastal plain (Delaware Bay to Chesapeake Bay). We considered 34 landscape metrics as potential explanatory variables and seven estuarine parameters as response variables. We developed three logistic regression models: one to calculate the probability of degraded benthic environmental quality (BEQ), as defined by chemical parameters, and two for the probability of degraded estuarine bottom communities, one using a benthic index (BI) and a second using the total number of bottom-dwelling species (TNBS, consisting of benthic macroinvertebrates and fishes). We evaluated the discriminatory power of the models with ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves of sensitivity and specificity. All three models showed excellent discrimination of high and low values. A model using the sum of all human land uses and percent wetlands correctly classified BEQ in 86% of the cases; low benthic index and low total number of bottom species were each associated with degraded BEQ (p<0.01). The BI model used percent riparian urban, riparian wetlands, and agriculture on steep slopes (76% correct classification) and correctly predicted high-low benthic index of an independent data set 79% of the time (p<0.05). The TNBS model used percent wetlands, riparian wetlands, and riparian agriculture (74% correct classification). Watersheds with higher percentages of urban and agricultural land uses were associated with lower benthic environmental quatity, benthic index, and biodiversity, whereas those with higher percentages of wetlands were associated with higher numbers. As human development of watersheds increases, statistical prediction rules developed from landscape metrics could be a cost-effective method to identify potentially threatened estuaries.

AB  - Assessment of the ecological status of rivers is key to monitoring the achievement of the environmental goal of the EU Water Framework Directive and the success of restoration projects. In summer of 2009 and 2010, repeated assessments of physical habitat conditions and of fish and benthic invertebrate communities were performed at low-flow conditions in 10 unmanaged and 10 channelized cross-sections of the Biala River, Polish Carpathians. Between the two surveys, an 80-year flood occurred, significantly affecting habitat characteristics and river communities. In unmanaged cross-sections, active channel width increased, whereas the degree of cross-sectional variation of flow velocity decreased. In channelized cross-sections, the increase in active channel width and the cross-sectional variation of flow velocity was accompanied by a decrease in bed-material grain size. Before the flood, the unmanaged cross-sections hosted 2.3 times more benthic invertebrate taxa than the channelized ones, whereas after the flood, the number of taxa they supported was so reduced that the taxonomic richness of benthic invertebrate assemblages in both cross-section types became similar. In comparison to pre-flood conditions, the abundance of fish juveniles (YOY) in unmanaged cross-sections was reduced nearly by half; before the flood they hosted 5 times more juvenile individuals than channelized cross-sections and only twice as many after the flood. Finally, a differing assessment of flood impact on the ecological river quality was obtained with the invertebrate-based BMWP-PL index and the European Fish Index, with the former indicating a significant reduction of the quality in unmanaged cross-sections and the latter pointing to no such change. The results indicate that assessments performed before or after a major flood may yield significantly different results for the quality of abiotic and biotic elements of the river ecosystem. Final assessment should thus be based on repeated surveys to balance the effect of extreme hydrological events. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The identification of spatial and temporal patterns of soil properties and moisture structures is an important challenge in environmental and soil monitoring as well as for soil landscape model approaches. This work examines the use of hyperspectral remote sensing techniques for quantifying geophysical parameters from the hyperspectral reflectance of the vegetation canopy. These can be used as proxies of the underlying soil and soil water conditions. Different spectral index derivatives, single band reflectance, and spectral indices from the airborne hyperspectral sensor AISA were quantified and tested in univariate and multivariate regression models for their correlation with geophysical measurements with electromagnetic induction (EMI) and gamma-ray spectrometry. The best univariate models for predicting electrical conductivity based on spectral information were based on the vertical dipole of an EM38DD with an R-2 = 0.54 with the spectral index Normalized Pigments Reflectance Index (NPCI) as well as for the horizontal dipole of an EM38DD with an R-2 = 0.65 with the spectral index NPCI. For predicting soil characteristics measured with gamma-ray spectrometry we received the best model results for gamma Th with an R-2 = 0.55 with the spectral index NPCI and gamma K with an R-2 = 0.44 with the spectral index Triangular Vegetation Index (TVI) and NPCI. The combination of variables including the geographical elevation was tested as the input for a multivariate regression analysis. For EMI and gamma-ray measurements, the "elevation" was found to be the most predictive variable and an integration of spectral indices into the elevation-based model led to only a slight improvement in the predictive power for EMI. An improvement could be made to explain the variance of gamma-ray measurement signals by combining elevation and spectral information.

AB  - Global and regional targets to reduce the rate of biodiversity loss bring with them the need to measure the state of nature and how it is changing. A number of different biodiversity indicators have been developed in response and here we consider bird population indicators in Europe. Birds are often used as surrogates for other elements of biodiversity because they are so well known and well studied, and not for their unique intrinsic value as environmental indicators. Yet, in certain situations and at particular scales, trends in bird populations correlate with those of other taxa making them a valuable biodiversity indicator with appropriate caveats. In this paper, we look at two case studies, in the UK and Europe as a whole, where headline bird indicators, that is, summary statistics based oil bird population trends, have been developed and used to inform and assist policy makers. Wild bird indicators have been adopted by many European countries and by the European Union as indicators of biodiversity and of sustainable development. In the discussion, we review the strengths and weaknesses of using bird populations in this way, and look forward to how this work might be developed and expanded.

AB  - Field experiment was conducted during Rabi seasons of 2010-11, 2011-12 and 2012-13 at Research and Instructional Farm of Indira Gandhi Krishi Vishwavidyalaya, Raipur to examine and study the phenology, accumulation of growing degree days (GDD), heliothermal units (HTU), photothermal unit (PTU) and performance of wheat (Triticum aestivam L.) of four wheat varieties grown under five different sowing dates in factorial Randomized Block Design. It was observed that GDDs got reduced significantly with subsequent delay in sowing time. For our study purpose and as per package of practices, 25 November DI can be taken as early sowing and D-2 - 5 December as timely sowing conditions. The wheat varieties Amar and Sujata took highest GDD, HTU and PTU to maturity. On the mean basis the variety Kanchan produced highest grain yield (3147 kg/ha) followed by GW-273 (2947 kg/ha). The significant reduction in grain yield was recorded when sowing was delayed beyond D2 - December 05. Among the wheat varieties Kanchan showed better performance in terms of RUE followed by GW-273 and Sujata. Highest HUE was observed in wheat variety Kanchan followed by Sujata and GW-273. Varieties giving higher yield, RUE and HUE are identified under varying growing environments so as to suggest the appropriate sowing dates of wheat varieties in Chhattisgarh plains. GDD is giving consistent results as its variability is least varying between 3.4-5.3 per cent for different varieties and therefore it is reliable index for studying environmental effects on wheat in this region. Lowest RUE was observed under 5 January sowing (D5) in the all varieties which leads to conclusion that this sowing date must be avoided and wheat crop sowing must be completed latest by 25 December to avoid adverse effects on productivity.

AB  - The risk of effects to fishes and other aquatic life from impulsive sound produced by activities such as pile driving and seismic exploration is increasing throughout the world, particularly with the increased exploitation of oceans for energy production. At the same time, there are few data that provide insight into the effects of these sounds on fishes. The goal of this study was to provide quantitative data to define the levels of impulsive sound that could result in the onset of barotrauma to fish. A High Intensity Controlled Impedance Fluid filled wave Tube was developed that enabled laboratory simulation of high-energy impulsive sound that were characteristic of aquatic far-field, plane-wave acoustic conditions. The sounds used were based upon the impulsive sounds generated by an impact hammer striking a steel shell pile. Neutrally buoyant juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were exposed to impulsive sounds and subsequently evaluated for barotrauma injuries. Observed injuries ranged from mild hematomas at the lowest sound exposure levels to organ hemorrhage at the highest sound exposure levels. Frequency of observed injuries were used to compute a biological response weighted index (RWI) to evaluate the physiological impact of injuries at the different exposure levels. As single strike and cumulative sound exposure levels (SELss, SELcum respectively) increased, RWI values increased. Based on the results, tissue damage associated with adverse physiological costs occurred when the RWI was greater than 2. In terms of sound exposure levels a RWI of 2 was achieved for 1920 strikes by 177 dB re 1 mu Pa-2.s SELss yielding a SELcum of 210 dB re 1 mu Pa-2.s, and for 960 strikes by 180 dB re 1 mu Pa-2.s SELss yielding a SELcum of 210 dB re 1 mu Pa-2.s. These metrics define thresholds for onset of injury in juvenile Chinook salmon.

AB  - Although several exergy-based indicators of ecosystem state have been put forward during the last decades, their effectiveness still expect a full confirmation. Recently, Ludovisi has proposed a formulation of exergy based on classical thermodynamics, which includes three terms - size (C), concentration (X) and structural information (1)- accounting for the contribution to exergy due to the abiotic and biotic components of an ecosystem, with the latter being expressed as a function of (sub)community structure and diversity. In the present study, the response of the different exergy terms is analysed along the seasonal progression of environmental conditions and phytoplankton in the Lagoon of Lesina (Puglia, Italy). According to the proposed methodology, the equilibrium concentration of the main hydrochemical variables has been calculated on the basis of a suitable hydrochemical model. The estimate of the equilibrium concentration of the phytoplankton (the VECE values) has been performed for logarithmic body-size classes by applying the equilibrium condition to the complete oxidation of the biomass. The results show that: (i) hydrochemical and phytoplankton exergy, as well as exergy terms (size C, concentration X and structural information I) are positively correlated one another, thus suggesting that phytoplankton contributed to enhance the total exergy of the water column of the lagoon also affecting the hydrochemistry of the system, especially during massive blooms; (ii) exergy and structural information of phytoplankton increase with increasing phytoplankton biomass, thus indicating that the size spectrum of phytoplankton diverges from the equilibrium distribution as the biomass stored increases (or vice versa); (iii) the size-fract ioned Shannon information of phytoplankton increases with increasing biomass density as well as structural information, before reaching a superior limit. On the whole, the observed trends are consistent with theoretical expectations based on thermodynamics and classical ecological theories of succession, thus confirming the effectiveness of exergy-based tools as indicators of ecosystem development, as well as ecological orientors.

AB  - Conceptual frameworks of dryland degradation commonly include ecohydrological feedbacks between landscape spatial organization and resource loss, so that decreasing cover and size of vegetation patches result in higher water and soil losses, which lead to further vegetation loss. However, the impacts of these feedbacks on dryland dynamics in response to external stress have barely been tested. Using a spatially-explicit model, we represented feedbacks between vegetation pattern and landscape resource loss by establishing a negative dependence of plant establishment on the connectivity of runoff-source areas (e.g., bare soils). We assessed the impact of various feedback strengths on the response of dryland ecosystems to changing external conditions. In general, for a given external pressure, these connectivity-mediated feedbacks decrease vegetation cover at equilibrium, which indicates a decrease in ecosystem resistance. Along a gradient of gradual increase of environmental pressure (e.g., aridity), the connectivity-mediated feedbacks decrease the amount of pressure required to cause a critical shift to a degraded state (ecosystem resilience). If environmental conditions improve, these feedbacks increase the pressure release needed to achieve the ecosystem recovery (restoration potential). The impact of these feedbacks on dryland response to external stress is markedly non-linear, which relies on the non-linear negative relationship between bare-soil connectivity and vegetation cover. Modelling studies on dryland vegetation dynamics not accounting for the connectivity-mediated feedbacks studied here may overestimate the resistance, resilience and restoration potential of drylands in response to environmental and human pressures. Our results also suggest that changes in vegetation pattern and associated hydrological connectivity may be more informative early-warning indicators of dryland degradation than changes in vegetation cover.

AB  - This research investigates features of financial regional management taking into account the levels of economic adaptability and potential of sustainable development. The author examined the approach to defining the level of regional sustainable development considering the interrelation of ecological and financial components. For the purpose of the paper, the main indicators of regional sustainable development investment potential, fiscal potential, financial potential, labor potential, potential of natural resources, economic potential of households are allocated. As part of the study, the regional grading scale (self-contained, stable, problematic, stagnant, depressive, environmentally friendly, enough adapted, moderately adapted, slightly adapted, environmentally hazardous), depending on the value of the integrated indexes is worked out. The authors highlighted that given approach would promote development of the effective state policy of regional financial security and improve the quality of strategic administration by means of development of the most suitable for the financial possibilities and ecological situation strategies (state regulation, public private partnerships or ecological enterprise).

AB  - Portions of the Upper Mississippi River are listed as impaired for aquatic life use under section 303(d) of the United States Clean Water Act by the State of Minnesota's Pollution Control Agency and Wisconsin's Department of Natural Resources for exceeding turbidity and eutrophication standards. To help regulatory agencies address Clean Water Act requirements, we developed a submersed macrophyte index (SMI) for the Upper Mississippi River. Aquatic macrophytes are a critical driver of the ecology of the Upper Mississippi River. Because they are rooted, they integrate the effects of long and short term physical and chemical disturbance. Fifty-four submersed macrophyte-based attributes were evaluated for inclusion in the index by testing their range, responsiveness to a published multimetric stressor gradient, scope of impairment among least impaired samples, and redundancy. Four attributes were ultimately selected as metrics for the SMI including (1) percent frequency of occurrence, (2) 95th percentile of maximum depth of submersed macrophyte occurrence, (3) total rake score, a measurement of abundance quantified by the proportion of rake tines filled by aquatic macrophytes, and (4) 95th percentile of submersed species richness. The SMI separated least and most impaired samples. Using the validation dataset, the stressor gradient explained 36% of the variation in the SMI. There was a significant downriver increase in SMI scores mostly due to the effect of Lake Pepin, in the middle of Pool 4 of the Upper Mississippi River, which serves as a settling basin for transported suspended solids, increasing water clarity and improving conditions for submersed macrophyte growth in areas downstream of the lake. Proximity to a navigation dam also affected SMI scores, which consistently decreased from the sample immediately above a dam to the sample immediately below. The individual metrics within the SMI appear to be driven by two principal forces: light penetration and hydrologic conditions created by navigation dams. The correspondingly low SMI scores where listed impairments occur substantiate the use of our SMI to detect such impairments. A significant relationship between the stressor gradient and our SMI further confirms our index's ability to detect anthropogenic stresses on the Upper Mississippi River. Our index is the first developed in North America using aquatic macrophytes for assessing large river ecosystem condition. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study aims to evaluate the level of heavy metal contamination of well water and soil in the Al-Quwayiyah governorate, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The samples for the study were selected from 10 different sites and then tested for the presence of chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and iron (Fe). The physicochemical properties of well water and soil samples were investigated. Multivariate analyses including the correlation matrix (CM), principal component analysis and analysis of variance were used to specify the correlation between and the impact of heavy metals contamination of soil on well water. The potential ecological risk was assessed using the sediment quality guidelines (SQGs), enrichment factor (EF), geo-accumulation index (I-geo), contamination factor (C-f), and the degree of contamination (C-d) to identify the sources of heavy metals in the soil samples. Two ratios prescribed by the SQG's were used. The first was "effect range low (ERL) to effect range median (ERM) values" and the second was "threshold effect level (TEL) to probable effect level (PEL)". The results revealed that these ratios did not exceed the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) guidelines. The EF values of the soil samples showed minimal to deficient enrichment with Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn and As, and extremely low enrichment with Cd and Pb. The data obtained demonstrated that all the sites were polluted with very low levels of these heavy metals. The results strongly and positively correlated the metals in well water with these in soil and clarified that all metals were of a lithogenic origin.

AB  - Due to decreases in the availability and quality of traditional water resources, harvested rainwater is increasingly used for potable and non-potable purposes. In this study, we examined the effect of conventional roofing materials (i.e., asphalt fiberglass shingle, Galvalume (R) metal, and concrete tile) and alternative roofing materials (i.e., cool and green) on the quality of harvested rainwater. Results from pilot-scale and full-scale roofs demonstrated that rainwater harvested from any of these roofing materials would require treatment if the consumer wanted to meet United States Environmental Protection Agency primary and secondary drinking water standards or non-potable water reuse guidelines; at a minimum, first-flush diversion, filtration, and disinfection are recommended. Metal roofs are commonly recommended for rainwater harvesting applications, and this study showed that rainwater harvested from metal roofs tends to have lower concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria as compared to other roofing materials. However, concrete tile and cool roofs produced harvested rainwater quality similar to that from the metal roofs, indicating that these roofing materials also are suitable for rainwater harvesting applications. Although the shingle and green roofs produced water quality comparable in many respects to that from the other roofing materials, their dissolved organic carbon concentrations were very high (approximately one order of magnitude higher than what is typical for a finished drinking water in the United States), which might lead to high concentrations of disinfection byproducts after chlorination. Furthermore the concentrations of some metals (e.g., arsenic) in rainwater harvested from the green roof suggest that the quality of commercial growing media should be carefully examined if the harvested rainwater is being considered. for domestic use. Hence, roofing material is an important consideration when designing a rainwater catchment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A detailed study carried out on 37 well preserved benthic foraminiferal assemblages sampled throughout the upper Toarcian-middle Aalenian in two well calibrated sections representing different facies within the Lusitanian Basin (Portugal) - the Maria Pares and the Zambujal de Alcaria sections - allows interpreting the past environmental conditions. Several mathematical indexes related to diversity, which enable establishing the particular conditions to which the assemblages were submitted, were applied. All the studied assemblages are characteristic of the Jurassic carbonate platforms of the Boreal Realm, in which the genus Lenticulina usually dominates. The suborder Lagenina is the most abundant, but taking the second more abundant suborder into account, the comparison between coeval sections in the Lusitanian Basin allows the recognition of a regional gradient ranging from the distal part of the platform (Murtinheira) towards the transitional and proximal parts of the shelf (sections of Maria Pares and Zambujal de Alcaria respectively). The relative abundance values, as well as the obtained data from the diversity indexes indicate that the studied assemblages are relatively abundant and diverse, reflecting general appropriate paleoenvironmental conditions for their development. The detailed analysis of the data allows the identification in both sections of three different episodes, traducing particular environmental conditions: unstable (Mactra Subzone-lower part of the Opalinum Subzone), favorable and stable (lower part of the Opalinum Subzone-upper part of the Comptum Subzone), and unfavorable (upper part of the Comptum Subzone-lower Bradfordensis Subzone). These data are consistent with previous results obtained in the sections of Murtinheira and Sao Giao, located in the Northern Lusitanian Basin and corresponding to the distal and transitional parts of the platform respectively, and they aimed at contributing to a better understanding of the paleoecological conditions prevailing within the Lusitanian Basin during the Early-Middle Jurassic times.

AB  - Two models have been suggested to facilitate the study of genetic variation for seasonal water-use efficiency (WUE) and its components in spring bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). These models were used to estimate the contribution of each component trait to variation in WUE, Eight diverse bread wheat cultivars were grown in replicated pot and field experiments under well-watered and droughted conditions. Significant genotypic variation was observed for WUE (ratio of grain yield to water used), evapotranspiration efficiency (ETE, ratio of total dry matter to water used), and harvest index (HI, ratio of grain yield to total dry matter), Modern short cultivars, on average, had higher WUE than old tall cultivars in well-watered (1.225 vs. 0.984 g kg(-1)) and droughted (1.198 vs. 0.860 g kg(-1)) pot conditions, due mainly to higher HI. Two old tall cultivars exhibited highest values for ETE, Harvest index and ETE accounted for 85 and 15% and for 81 and 19% of variation in WUE in web-watered and droughted conditions, respectively. Harvest index had a higher direct effect and was more highly associated with WUE than ETE, The negative correlation between HI and ETE was not significant, Carbon isotope discrimination (Delta) showed negative correlation with ETE in well-watered (-0.82) and droughted (-0.68) treatments, Grain yield and HI of modern short cultivars, on average, were higher than those of old tall cultivars under field conditions, Mean Delta was lower in droughted (17.9 parts per thousand) than in well-watered (18.9 parts per thousand) held conditions, Plant growth rates estimated at boot stage and at anthesis were negatively associated with a drought susceptibility index based on grain yield, Drought susceptibility index was not correlated with Delta. Water-use efficiency in wheat could be improved by improving either transpiration efficiency or ETE.

AB  - The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires that all aquatic ecosystems in their member states should reach 'good' ecological quality by 2015. To assess ecological quality, the WFD requires the definition of reference conditions using biological, physical and chemical indicators and the assignment of each water body to one of five quality classes using these indicators. Elaborate assessment schemes using large sets of variables are now being developed. Here we address the question whether all this is really needed and what the simplest assessment approach would be for the case of shallow lakes. We explore the relationships between the quality Class assigned to a lake by experts in shallow lake ecology and a rich set of biological, physical, and chemical data:a. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were carried Out based on data from 86 shallow lakes throughout Europe that were sampled In 2000 and/for 2001. Ecological quality of shallow lakes judged by experts was strongly correlated to physical and chemical variables associated with light regime and nutrients and Much less to biological variables.
   Our regression model showed that ecological quality of this set of shallow lakes judged by experts Could be predicted quite well from water transparency expressed as Secchi depth and that other variables did not contribute to it significantly. According to the WFD. lakes Should Lit least have a 'good' ecological quality. Quality judged by experts and predicted quality were similar for 78% of the lakes with respect to meeting this standard. As a cautionary note we stress that Secchi depth alone will be a less useful Indicator if effects of stressors other than eutrophication (e.g. lake a acidification and toxic pollution) are to be considered.

AB  - Few studies examined species or ecosystem dynamics on seamounts/banks. The Galicia Bank (GB), the deepest marine Special Area of Conservation in the Spanish Natura 2000 network, is considered a conservation priority because of its highly vulnerable habitats, such as cold-water and bamboo corals. The biological conditions and population structure of benthopelagic shrimps and their relationship with environmental conditions were analyzed during three expeditions over three years. Shrimps were collected by trawling. The gonadosomatic index (GSI) and nutritional condition (hepatosomatic index [HSI]) of shrimps were highest at the summit and deepest depths (>1500 m) sampled, whereas at intermediate depths between ca. 900-1500 m, these values were low. The intermediate depths around ca. 1000 m are influenced by the core of the Mediterranean Outflow Water (MOW), which is characterized by high salinity and low O-2 concentrations. The highest GSI were recorded in species (Aristeus antennatus, Plesionika martia) distributed at summit, associated with higher Chl a 1-2 months before sampling at surface. The species with the highest HSI were also linked to Chl a 1-2 months and with higher %OM (generalized additive models, GAM, results). Overall, the studied shrimp species showed viable populations on GB, with reproductors/spawners more markedly distributed over the summit (ca. <900 m). Notably, reproductors of several important commercial species (A. antennatus, P. martia) reached larger sizes and had greater potential fecundity (GSI) than in their optimal distribution areas, out of GB. P. martia recruitment only occurred in 2010, a year characterized by highly negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) indices (-5.96/-5.2), suggesting that benthopelagic shrimps may colonize the GB at a variable periodicity as a probable consequence of the variable availability of zooplankton prey over seamounts. At the same time, species such as Aristaeopsis edwardsiana and P. martia may have some advantages when colonizing habitats in the GB because of the absence of competition from similar, even congeneric species. This was reflected in the patterns of size-depth distribution in the GB compared to mainland areas. In conclusion, the habitats of the GB and, by extension, of seamounts/banks contain rather isolated and small sub-populations, yet these populations can have a reservoir effect that can contribute to eventually restoring the main population core in other areas.

AB  - The relevance of the research lies in the need to assess such components of watercourse ecosystem as bottom sediments and aquatic plants that are able to accumulate various pollutants from the catchment area and can serve as indicators of the ecological state of pollution of the surface watercourse.
   The aim of the work is an environmental assessment of small rivers of the Middle Amur Lowland under the influence of drainage reclamation according to the content of heavy metals.
   Objects: surface water, bottom sediments and aquatic plants susceptible to drainage reclamation.
   Methods: filtering water samples through membrane filters with a pore diameter of 0,45 mu m for the separate determination of dissolved and suspended forms of heavy metals; sampling of bottom sediments with a Gr-91 rod-type dredger at a depth of 25 cm from the bedding surface; acid decomposition of samples of bottom sediments and vegetation in the "Mars-6" microwave system, grinding in a "Pulverisette 6" planetary mill, determination of heavy metals by atomic absorption spectrometry on a "Solaar 6M" spectrometer.
   Results. In surface waters, there is an increase in gross concentrations of heavy metals, especially iron and lead, exceeding the maximum permissible concentrations by three times. The accumulation of various pollutants takes place in bottom sediments, however, when the chemical and hydrological parameters of the environment change, they again pass into the watercourse, thereby being a source of secondary pollution. The most intense deposition processes were calculated for Fe (lgK=5,06), Pb (lgK=4,76), as well as for Zn (lgK=4,60). The average character of sedimentation can be traced for Mn and Cu (lgK=3,36). For Ni, the coefficient has a minimum value (lgK=2,82), which indicates metal reverse migration from bottom sediments to water. Under the influence of drainage, an increase in concentration of heavy metals in macrophytes occurs.

AB  - 1. Maintaining and protecting biodiversity for the future under changing environmental and sociopolitical conditions is a major challenge. Scenarios are used as decision-making aids for natural resource management at local to global scales. Scenarios are underutilised by conservationists at a local level, where they can be highly effective for anticipating change.
   2. People's values and attitudes are crucial in determining the future, yet they are rarely placed at the centre of scenario exercises. Novel methods have been developed to fully integrate people's worldviews into scenario planning. The ethnographic futures framework focuses on how changes occur through human agency and how they will be felt by society in the future. The three horizons approach considers how different ideas and paradigms become more, or less, dominant in society over time.
   3. Natural England (NE), the statutory adviser to the UK Government on the natural environment in England, carried out a scenario planning process using these novel approaches. The scenarios consider a wide range of global and local factors and investigate their impact upon the natural environment in England, to 2060.
   4. A set of four contrasting scenarios was produced. Despite their differences, nature was always highly valued in some form; ultimately, the state of the natural environment was determined not by natural forces but by societal choice.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Scenario planning allows the development of key visions for the future. These can be used to establish, and influence, the direction of future trends and their impacts on the natural environment, particularly in the context of a shifting basis for conservation policy that seeks to enhance ecological resilience. The scenarios are being used within NE to help local communities shape the future of their natural environment; this process can be utilised by governments or environmental agencies elsewhere. This study demonstrates that across a range of scenarios the future state of the natural environment is very much a matter of societal choice. Decision-making frameworks for environmental conservation must take proper account of ecological knowledge, societal values, foresight and complexity.

AB  - This article aims to assess the potential of using the components of the five-helix model in countries with different levels of business development in Industry 4.0 for the US, Azerbaijan, Ukraine, and Poland. We determined the stimulators and not stimulators of the company development interacting with the participants of the innovation system: "business," "society," "state," " science," and "environment." We empirically evaluated the company's ability to use the potential of the five-helix model during the transition to Industry 4. These estimates, along with the development indicators of the five-fold spiral elements, were used to build a decision tree for choosing a practical scenario for business development and information transformation. It helped determine options for ensuring business efficiency, depending on the development of the five helix components and the company's ability to use their development potential.

AB  - This study is the first attempt to survey the diversity of fish digeneans in the Gulf of Gabes (southern coast of Tunisia). A total of 779 fishes belonging to 32 species were sampled. 53 species of Digenea belonging to 15 families were recorded. Among these species, 24 are reported for the first time from the coast of Tunisia. We report one new host record, Lecithochirium sp. from Sardinella aurita. The Hemiuridae is the dominant family. A host-parasite list is presented with the information on the prevalence, abundance and mean intensity of each species collected. The diversity of Digenea is compared with other localities in the Mediterranean Sea and the northern east of Tunisia. The Gulf of Gabes shows the lowest diversity linked to the anthropogenic activities and impact of exotic species. The use of Digenea as indicators of the state of the ecosystem is discussed.

AB  - The new European assessment system for freshwater ecosystems is based on reference conditions. As the ecological status of rivers must be determined with respect to the near-natural reference conditions focus is given to establish a typological framework. A basic part of this typology is the ecoregion approach. Multivariate analysis of the benthic invertebrate assemblages confirmed the grouping of Austrian fluvial landscapes into four of the European aquatic ecoregions: Alps, Central Highlands, Hungarian Lowlands and the Dinaric Western Balkan. The benthic assemblages are more homogeneous within an ecoregion than among different ecoregions. Analyzing sites from adjacent areas in Italy, Germany and the Czech Republic clearly indicated that the ecoregion concept fulfils the goal of independence from political borders and that this concept can be used in Europe for implementing the Water Framework Directive. Nevertheless, considering the detailed structure of central European landscapes, the ecoregions are too large and variable to provide a framework for regional management based on ecological data. With respect to the variety of the central European river faunas a further division into bioregions was seen as necessary. Combining a priori derived types of Austrian riverine-landscape-types and major surface-water-types with the results of the multivariate analysis (groups of similar benthic assemblages) led to a description of 15 'Austrian Fluvial Bioregions'. Fluvial Bioregions are very strong descriptors of the faunal assemblages; their determinative character is stronger than the ecological quality of a site. Within the bioregions, the natural variability of several biological measures metrics, indexes) is low. Consequently, the discriminatory power of the measures for evaluating ecological status is increased by using the bioregional classification.

AB  - Many advances in the field of bioassessment have focused on approaches for objectively selecting the pool of reference sites used to establish expectations for healthy waterbodies, but little emphasis has been placed on ways to evaluate the suitability of the reference-site pool for its intended applications (e.g., compliance assessment vs ambient monitoring). These evaluations are critical because an inadequately evaluated reference pool may bias assessments in some settings. We present an approach for evaluating the adequacy of a reference-site pool for supporting biotic-index development in environmentally heterogeneous and pervasively altered regions. We followed common approaches for selecting sites with low levels of anthropogenic stress to screen 1985 candidate stream reaches to create a pool of 590 reference sites for assessing the biological integrity of streams in California, USA. We assessed the resulting pool of reference sites against 2 performance criteria. First, we evaluated how well the reference-site pool represented the range of natural gradients present in the entire population of streams as estimated by sites sampled through probabilistic surveys. Second, we evaluated the degree to which we were successful in rejecting sites influenced by anthropogenic stress by comparing biological metric scores at reference sites with the most vs fewest potential sources of stress. Using this approach, we established a reference-site pool with low levels of human-associated stress and broad coverage of environmental heterogeneity. This approach should be widely applicable and customizable to particular regional or programmatic needs.

AB  - Reliable ecosystem status assessment of coastal and marine environments is key due to mounting pressures from human activities. Aiming at a successful management, a plethora of evaluation tools currently exist, but there is no consensus on what index or indices should be used by environmental managers in establishing benthic quality.
   The main goal of this investigation was to evaluate the suitability of thermodynamic-oriented indicators (Eco-Exergy and Specific Eco-Exergy) and trait-based indices (Rao's Quadratic Entropy, Functional Redundancy and Community-Weighted Mean trait value) as tools to capture potential ecological changes, comprehending their utility for addressing specific management objectives. In order to do so, a long-term data set (1993-2012) from a southern European estuary (Mondego estuary, Portugal) was used to assess the responsiveness of macroinvertebrates assemblages to a large-scale management intervention, and the performance of thermodynamic-oriented indicators and trait-based indices was compared.
   The results indicated that the undertaken management efforts were successful at improving the ecosystem state and confirmed that hydrodynamic conditions in the estuary have been the major drivers of the changes observed over the last three decades. Both Exergy-based and trait-based indices coherently reflected the ecological changes observed along the temporal disturbance-recovery gradient analysed. Indices response was congruent but of different nature and detail level. Trait-based indices provided a more detailed assessment of the benthic communities and informative picture than Exergy-based indices but the overall outcome of both types of indices was broadly convergent. Combining multiple indicators should thus be more likely to improve transparency and to provide a more robust assessment method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Ecological scales include plant species, which are responsive to changes in habitat conditions. Such plants act as phytoindicators that integrate many environmental factors.
   Objective: To identify suitable habitats for searched-for plant species based on phytoindication data.
   Materials and methods: Altogether, 47 square plots (100 m(2)) were established within a selected forest area of the Mordovia State Nature Reserve. In each plot, species composition was recorded for further analysis, and the mean values of four environmental factors (shading, soil moisture, soil nitrogen, and soil pH) were calculated using the Tsyganov ecological scale. To visualize changes in factor values, contour maps were created for each factor. To reveal differences between species composition in study plots, Jaccard's similarity index was calculated.
   Results and discussion: All study plots have been arranged mainly along gradients of three soil parameters, namely pH, nitrogen availability and moisture, while habitat shading has not acted as strongly. Gradient maps obtained of four selected environmental factors demonstrated remarkable similarity. This suggestion is confirmed by the distinguishing of three areas because of overlapping of these maps. Similarity between values of environmental factors and plant distribution was determined. The use of phytoindication methods allows showing changes in the values of environmental factors in a forest area, and being combined with a species similarity index, it is possible to predict habitat suitability for threatened plants.
   Conclusions: The possibility of indicating and finding an area suitable for inhabitation of plants based on the phytoindication ecological scale approach was determined. As threatened plants have a narrower range of environmental conditions, this method is especially suitable for these investigations.

AB  - This paper presents a description of three of the proposed phytoplankton indices under investigation as part of a classification framework for UK and ROI marine waters. The three indices proposed for the classification process are (i) phytoplankton biomass measured as chlorophyll, (ii) the frequency of elevated phytoplankton counts measuring individual species and total cell counts and (iii) Seasonal progression of phytoplankton functional groups through the year. Phytoplankton biomass is calculated by a 90th percentile measurement of chlorophyll over the growing season (April to September) compared to a predetermined reference value. Calculation of functional groups and cell counts are taken as proportional counts derived from the presence of the indicator species or group as compared to the total phytoplankton count.
   Initial boundary conditions for the assessment of high/good status were tested for each index. Chlorophyll reference conditions were taken from thresholds developed for previous EU directives with the setting of offshore concentrations as a reference condition. Thresholds for elevated counts of phytoplankton taxa were taken from previous EU assessments describing counts that could be impact negatively on the environment. Reference seasonal growth curves are established using phytoplankton counts from "high status" waterbodies.
   To test the preliminary boundaries for each index, a risk assessment integrating nutrient enrichment and susceptibility for coastal and transitional waters was carried out to identify WFD waterbodies in England and Wales at different levels of risk. Waterbodies assessed as having low or medium risk from nutrient enrichment were identified as type 1 and type 2 waterbodies, and waterbodies assessed as high risk were identified as type 3 waterbodies. Phytoplankton data was extracted from the risk assigned waterbodies and applied to each phytoplankton index to test the robustness of the preliminary classification ranges for each phytoplankton index.

AB  - Although the terms 'health' and 'healthy' are often applied to marine ecosystems and communicate information about holistic condition (e. g. as required by the Ecosystem Approach), their meaning is unclear. Ecosystems have been understood in various ways, from non-interacting populations of species to complex integrated systems. Health has been seen as a metaphor, an indicator that aggregates over system components, or a non-localized emergent system property. After a review, we define good ecosystem health as: 'the condition of a system that is self-maintaining, vigorous, resilient to externally imposed pressures, and able to sustain services to humans. It contains healthy organisms and populations, and adequate functional diversity and functional response diversity. All expected trophic levels are present and well interconnected, and there is good spatial connectivity amongst subsystems.' We equate this condition with good ecological or environmental status, e. g. as referred to by recent EU Directives. Resilience is central to health, but difficult to measure directly. Ecosystems under anthropogenic pressure are at risk of losing resilience, and thus of suffering regime shifts and loss of services. For monitoring whole ecosystems, we propose an approach based on 'trajectories in ecosystem state space', illustrated with time-series from the northwestern North Sea. Change is visualized as Euclidian distance from an arbitrary reference state. Variability about a trend in distance is used as a proxy for inverse resilience. We identify the need for institutional support for long time-series to underpin this approach, and for research to establish state space co-ordinates for systems in good health.

AB  - The River Values Assessment System (RiVAS) is a standardised multi-criteria analysis approach for developing river rankings for diverse values (e.g. irrigation, whitewater kayaking, native birds) to aid decision-making regarding various aspects of river management. The method identifies primary attributes that characterise the value and an indicator for each. Eleven values have been, or are being, implemented. In this paper, the distribution of primary attributes and indicators by value are mapped. Almost all values require some sort of count data (especially recreational and ecological values) and most require water quantity or water quality data. Conversely, some values require data solely pertinent to that value. The tangata whenua (indigenous peoples of New Zealand) value is the most holistic. Findings suggest that comprehensive state of the environment reporting for rivers requires data additional to that currently collected, especially recreation-related data. RiVAS provides a useful framework for thinking strategically about monitoring and reporting.

AB  - Samples of Atlantic sardine Sardina pilchardus (also known as European pilchard) were collected bimonthly from 2004 to 2008 off the central west coast of Portugal to describe the reproductive activity of this indeterminate batch-spawning species; compare the seasonality of somatic growth, condition, and feeding; and evaluate differences between sexes. Monthly assessments of individual biological information for both males and females were complemented by histological analysis of ovaries during 1 year and liver tissues (both sexes) at different times of the reproductive cycle. The temporal patterns of the gonadosomatic index and various histological indices (most advanced oocyte stage, atresia incidence and prevalence, and spawning activity) indicated that Atlantic sardine were reproductively active mainly from October to March and that residual activity occurred in the remaining months. For both sexes, condition indices (hepatosomatic index, relative weight, and amount of fat stored) increased mainly during spring, reached a maximum at the end of summer just before the subsequent spawning season began, and then decreased during autumn and winter, declining to minimum levels at the beginning of spring coincident with a significant reduction in reproductive activity. Somatic growth took place mainly during spring and early summer for both sexes. The observed seasonal patterns in these biological properties suggest a seasonal transition from a period in which energy resources are allocated to reproduction (autumn and winter) to a period in which resources are allocated to growth and fat deposition (spring and summer). The only exception was the distinct hepatosomatic index pattern and the histological differences in hepatocytes between males and females during the spawning season, which may be related to the dual function of the liver in females (lipid metabolism and yolk precursor synthesis).

AB  - Accurately monitoring the quantity and quality of urban vegetation contributes to regional greening efforts and improves the understanding of vegetation's impact on the environment. However, factors such as building shadows and synthetic materials can greatly obstruct vegetation estimates. Additionally, vegetation indices (VIs) saturate quickly in high biomass conditions, complicating vegetation quality assessments. To address these issues, we propose a new vegetation index, namely the hyperspectral image-based vegetation index (HSVI). HSVI is built in three steps: band selection, saturable band reconstruction, and index structure redefinition. Firstly, we select four representative bands and construct an enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to eliminate the interference of complex urban surface factors. Secondly, we reconstruct the easily saturable band (760 nm) through an exponential function to form an optimized enhanced vegetation index (OEVI). Finally, the index structure is redefined by adding the denominator of the sum of the red edge (689 nm) and green (520 nm) bands to OEVI to further enhance the spectral information of vegetation and eliminate the saturation problem typical of VIs. Three datasets with different geomorphological features (Shanghai Theatre Academy, Dazhu Mountain, and the University of Houston) are used to compare the performance of HSVI with six VIs widely adopted in urban ecological research, i.e., the difference vegetation index (DVI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the simple ratio (SR), the optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSVAI), the modified transformed vegetation index (MTVI2) and the wide-dynamic-range vegetation index (WDRVI). The results show that the vegetation extraction accuracy of HSVI is more than 90%, which is significantly higher than those of the other VIs. Additionally, HSVI also solves the VIs saturation issue. Therefore, HSVI shows high potential usefulness for urban ecological research applications.

AB  - This study presents the use of geographical information system (GIS) datasets and methods to investigate landslide susceptibility in the rugged mountainous terrain of Shigar and Shyok Basins in northern areas of Pakistan. Study area is situated in Karakorum mountainous region where catastrophic landslides occur frequently and pose a serious threat to local living conditions. Landslide susceptibility index maps were prepared by combining four main indicators groups: (1) human induced parameters, which contain Landsat 8 imagery and distance from roads; (2) topographical parameters, which include slope, aspect and plan curvature; (3) hydrological parameters, which contain stream power index, topographic wetness index and distance from drainage and (4) geological parameters, which consist of lithology and distance from major thrusts and faults. These layers were prepared in GIS environment, and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) based heuristic approach was adopted to generate final landslide susceptibility map for this preliminary regional level landslide hazard study. Three different susceptibility zones have been identified in the region. AHP weights with 0.04 consistency ratio were used in the preparation of final map. The final landslide susceptibility map of the study area indicates that the low, moderate, and high landslide susceptibility classes are respectively covering 23.2% (4745 km(2)), 45% (6737 km(2)), 23.2% (3444 km(2)) when distance from roads, distance from drainage and distance from major thrusts and faults parameters were not incorporated in the analysis. Including distance from roads, distance from drainage and distance from major thrusts and faults parameters layers to the final landslide susceptibility analysis shows that moderate susceptibility class is the predominant landslide susceptibility category covering 88% (13,412 km(2)) of the study area characterized by steep slopes (30 degrees-45 degrees), low positive plan curvature (0-1) and weak lithology.

AB  - Ecological indicators for long-term monitoring programs are needed to detect and assess changing environmental conditions. We developed and tested community-level environmental indicators for monitoring forest bird populations and associated habitat. We surveyed 197 sampling plots in loblolly-shortleaf pine forests, spanning an area from Georgia to Virginia (U.S.A.) and representing a gradient in levels of anthropogenic disturbance. Ninety of these plots were randomly selected from a sampling grid, permitting quantitative assessment of cumulative distribution functions for bird community and habitat parameters. Species were independently classified into habitat assemblages indicating birds typical of disturbed habitat (e.g., shrubland, forest edge) and undisturbed habitat (mature forest). Relative abundances of these assemblages were used to form a bird community index-similar to the index of biotic integrity applied to aquatic systems-showing the effects of habitat disturbance on forest bird communities. Bird communities on the majority of the sample area (52-75%, 90% confidence interval) were dominated by disturbance-tolerant species. Sites dominated by mature-forest species were comparatively uncommon. Habitat assemblages appeared to be particularly useful tools for environmental monitoring; individual species abundance was positively correlated with assemblage species richness, and assemblage members showed consistent responses to variations in disturbance level. To a lesser extent, component species of nesting guilds showed this pattern of cohesive responses, but those of foraging guilds did not. We also developed a habitat index based on habitat variables that predicted bird community index values. Habitat and bird community indices were strongly correlated in an independent validation dataset, suggesting that the habitat index can provide a reliable predictor of bird community status. The two indices may be used in combination, with the bird community index providing a direct measure of the status of the bird community and the habitat index providing a basis on which to separate changes in the bird community into local habitat effects versus other factors (e.g., landscape level effects, changes on wintering grounds).

AB  - Background: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has been an enormous threat for bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients. For active and/or latent HCMV infection, diagnosis of the risk factors which increase the risk of post-transplant morbidity and mortality seems necessary. In this research, some of the HCMV risk factors were monitored and compared with HCMV molecular diagnostic methods for better detection of HCMV infection in BMT patients
   Methods: HCMV risk factors including clinical, biological, biochemical, haematological indexes, and also anti-HCMV and transplant prophylactic and therapeutic conditioning regimens were monitored from March 2002 to March 2006, in 104 BMT patients referred to BMT Unit of Nemazee Hospital in Shiraz University of Medical Sciences and was compared with HCMV molecular methods for BMT donors and recipients' pre- and post-transplantation.
   Results: Anti-HCMV-IgM was detected in 9.6% and 6.7% of BMT recipients and donors, respectively. Anti-HCMV-IgG was also detected in 8.7% and 9.1% of recipients and donors, pre-transplant, respectively. HCMV-PCR results were positive in 20% of recipients and 33.3% of donors. Significant correlations were observed between HCMV positive results and the use of a therapeutic dose, but not the prophylactic dose of glucocorticoids and cyclosporine, pre and post-transplantation. Fasting blood sugar, creatinine, globulin, and liver enzymes A levels such as alkaline phosphates and asparagine transpherase significantly correlated with detection of HCMV-DNA in transplant patients. Also, negative results of HCMV-PCR significantly correlated with the use of prophylactic dose of acyclovir in BMT patients.
   Conclusion: Significant correlations of positive and negative HCMV-PCR results with HCMV disease risk factors suggest the possible role of these factors on prognosis and monitoring of HCMV disease in BMT recipients pre- and post-transplantation.

AB  - One of the objectives of monitoring benthic algal cover is to observe short- and long-term changes in species distribution and structure of coastal benthic habitats as indicators of ecological state. Mapping benthic algal cover with conventional methods (diving) provides great accuracy and high resolution, yet is very expensive and is limited by the time and manpower necessary. We measured reflectance spectra of three indicator species for the Baltic Sea: Cladophora glomerata (green macroalgae), Furcellaria lumbricalis (red macroalgae), and Fucus vesiculosus (brown macroalgae) and used a bio-optical model in an attempt to estimate whether these algae are separable from each other and sandy bottom or deep water by means of satellite remote sensing. Our modelling results indicate that to some extent it is possible to map the studied species with multispectral satellite sensors in turbid waters. However, the depths where the macroalgae call be detected are often shallower than the maximum depths where the studied species usually grow. In waters deeper than just a few meters, the differences between the studied bottom types are seen only in band 2 (green) of the multispectral sensors under investigation. It means that multispectral sensors are capable of detecting difference in brightness only in one band which is insufficient for recognition of different bottom types in waters where no or few in situ data are available. Configuration of MERIS spectral hands allows the recognition of red, green and brown macroalgae based on their spectral signatures provided the algal belts are wider than MERIS spatial resolution. Commercial stock of F. lumbricalis in West-Estonian Archipelago covers area where MERIS 300 m spatial resolution is adequate. However, strong attenuation of light in the water column and signal to noise ratio of the sensor do not allow mapping of Furcellaria down to maximum depths where it occurs. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We show that the EcoTroph model based on trophic spectra is an efficient tool to build ecosystem diagnoses of the impact of fishing. Using the Southern Benguela case study as a pretext, we present the first thorough application of the model to a real ecosystem. We thus review the structure and functioning of EcoTroph and we introduce the user to the steps that should be followed, showing the various possibilities of the model while underlining the most critical points of the modelling process. We show that EcoTroph provides an overview of the current exploitation level and target factors at the ecosystem scale, using two distinct trophic spectra to quantify the fishing targets and the fishing impact per trophic level. Then, we simulate changes in the fishing mortality, facilitating differential responses of two groups of species within the Southern Benguela ecosystem to be distinguished. More generally, we highlight various trends in a number of indicators of the ecosystem's state when increasing fishing mortality and we show that this ecosystem is moderately exploited, although predatory species are at their MSY. Finally, trophic spectra of the fishing effort multipliers EMSY and E(0.1) are proposed as tools for monitoring the ecosystem effects of fishing. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Burning of fossil fuels and biomass, transport and industry are the main sources of PAH (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons) in the atmosphere. Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is also a compound identified in cigarette smoke. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has qualified benzo[a]pyrene for compounds with proven carcinogenic effects on humans. The target value for benzo[a]pyrene, taking into account health protection purposes, is defined in the Regulation of the Minister of the Environment on the levels of certain substances in the air and it is annual average concentration 1 ng/m3. The aim of the study was to carry out a cancer risk assessment for residents of Wroclaw, Krakow and Warszawa related to inhalation exposure to benzo[a]pyrene in ambient air. The methodology employed by the American Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) was used in the study. The lifetime exposure of adults and children was assumed. The results of measurements carried out at the air monitoring stations under the State Environmental Monitoring by the Regional Inspectorates for Environmental Protection (RIEP) in Wroclaw, Krakow and Warszawa in the years 2014-2016 were used. The average concentration of BaP in the years 2014-2016 was 3.84, 6.31 and 2.19 ng/m(3) for Wroclaw, Krakow and Warszawa respectively. The calculations show that the highest risk of cancer was obtained for the inhabitants of Krakow: 1.54 . 10(-5) children, 7.52 . 10(-6) women, 6.30 . 10(-6) men. The estimated cancer risk was higher for Krakow residents than for Wroclaw (1.01 . 10-5 children, 4.94 . 10(-6) women, 3.82 . 10(-6) men) and Warszawa, where these indicators were the lowest (children: 5.34 . 10(-6), women: 2.61 . 10(-6), men: 2.19 . 10(-6)). Children are the group most exposed to the risk of cancer associated with BaP in the air among the examined subpopulations..

AB  - Many ecosystems have abruptly changed in the past and may again in the future, yet prediction and inference of mechanisms causing abrupt changes remains challenging. Critical transitions are one such mechanism, occurring when systems with alternative states cross a threshold. Such transitions are associated with a loss of resilience, often signaled by increasing variability or autocorrelation over time. However, critical transitions are difficult to distinguish from other causal mechanisms, and detection of resilience loss in sedimentary archives can be confounded by time-averaging and discontinuous sampling. Here, we simulate woodland-grassland regime shifts resulting from critical transitions and other mechanisms. We then test the diagnostic ability of two widely-used resilience indicators, standard deviation and autocorrelation time, after alterations common in sedimentary records: time averaging, discontinuous sampling, and varying sedimentation rates. Standard deviation but not autocorrelation time still distinguishes gradually forced critical transitions from other regime shifts when sedimentation rates are constant, and can be robust to abrupt changes in sedimentation rate. Unfortunately, shifts in standard deviation alone are rarely definitive evidence of critical transitions. Under exponential sedimentation regimes, which are common in younger upper-column sediments, neither resilience indicator is effective. Discontinuous sampling weakened the strength of resilience indicators. A demonstrative analysis of abrupt early Holocene deforestation recorded at Steel Lake, Minnesota showed signals consistent with resilience loss during early Holocene aridification. Hence, signals of resilience loss can be recovered from sedimentary archives, but efficacy varies among indicators and sedimentation regime. High-resolution and multi-proxy records remain essential to inferring causes, while process-based time series modeling such as this can be calibrated to systems of interest to explicitly test hypotheses about abrupt change causes.

AB  - Anthropogenic activity leading to forest structural and functional changes needs specific ecological indicators and monitoring techniques. Since decades, forest structure, composition, biomass, and functioning have been studied with ground-based forest inventories. Nowadays, satellites survey the earth, producing imagery at different spatial and temporal resolutions. However, measuring the ecological state of large extensions of forest is still challenging. To reconstruct the three-dimensional forest structure, the structure from motion (SfM) algorithm was applied to imagery taken by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Structural indicators from UAV-SfM products are then compared to forest inventory indicators of 64 circular plots of 1000 m(2) in a subtropical dry forest. Our data indicate that the UAV-SfM indicators provide a valuable alternative for ground-based forest inventory' indicators of the upper canopy structure. Based on the correlation between ground-based measures and UAV-SfM derived indicators, we can state that the UAV-SfM technique provides reliable estimates of the mean and maximum height of the upper canopy. The performance of UAV-SfM techniques to characterize the undergrowth forest structure is low, as UAV-SfM indicators derived from the point cloud in the lower forest strata are not suited to provide correct estimates of the vegetation density in the lower strata. Besides structural information, UAV-SfM derived indicators, such as canopy cover, can provide relevant ecological information as the indicators are related to structural, functional, and/or compositional aspects, such as biomass or compositional dominance. Although UAV-SfM techniques cannot replace the wealth of data collected during ground-based forest inventories, its strength lies in the three-dimensional (3D) monitoring of the tree canopy at cm-scale resolution, and the versatility of the technique to provide multi-temporal datasets of the horizontal and vertical forest structure.

AB  - Wetland protection, floral and faunal resource management, and habitat migration are all concerns for the ecological risk of wetland landscapes. Indices of landscape-scale ecological risks have the potential to influence changes in landscape patterns, the conditions of endangered plants and animals, and influences from nature and humans. Semi-variation function and gravity center models were used to quantify risk area changes. The changes of landscape ecological risk were analyzed for Bayanbulak Wetland from 2000 to 2010. In addition to landscape and species distribution data, GIS technology and remote sensing were used in this study. Results show that landscape structure changed over the 10-year period, with high-cover grassland area decreasing the most. Landscape pattern index types also changed for the study area. The number of landscape-type patches to low-cover grassland decreased, the landscape fragmentation index of dry land and high-cover grassland was reduced, and the interference degree of middle-cover grassland increased over the study period. The index of landscape ecological risk decreased from 2000 to 2010, with the spatial structure changing from a single center concentration to a multi-center distribution. All varying ecological risk regions of gravity centers moved from the northeast to the southwest. The gravity migration of the Level 2 region moved the furthest. Additionally, evidence suggests that various threatening factors reduce the ecological function and systems of wetlands. These include climate change, biological invasion, human activities, and water pollution. This paper assesses the heritage site landscape ecological risk and calculates the gravity center change of the region, which can be formulated to enrich and develop the research of small- and medium-sized wetlands in cold, semi-arid climates.

AB  - The implementation of management measures for improving the ecological status within an Ecosystem Based Management approach represents one the of the main challenges in coastal and transitional water environments. In general terms, ecological status and ecosystem functioning are expected to be positively associated, being good ecological processes a sort of prerequisite for the ecosystem health, but often relationships between ecosystem functioning indicators and the metrics used to define ecological status resulted to be rather puzzling. Moreover, the Biological Quality Elements (BQEs) do not show a consistent response to the changes in the ecosystem. This situation does not allow to recognize where interventions are really needed, hindering the definition of effective management strategies. In the present paper, a spatially explicit food web model of the Venice lagoon (with the resolution of 300 m) is used to simulate changes in the ecological status and related them to different management scenarios. Functional changes in the food web were investigated by comparing values of a set of 12 indicators derived by the ecological network analysis. In general, results highlighted on one hand the need for more discussion about the implementation of the WFD, at least in complex and spatially heterogeneous transitional waters environments, as the Venice lagoon; on the other, results remark the opportunity to support the BQEs monitoring with an ecological modelling approach. These models are certainly not the panacea for addressing questions about the environmental management, as they have inherent uncertainties (on parameters, structure, processes etc.); however, they can prove useful for selecting among different policy choices, since they offer the opportunity to simulate the mean effects, preliminarily verifying the efficacy of the proposed interventions.

AB  - Drought is the primary constraint in pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) production in the drier semi-arid and arid regions of south Asia and Africa. The traditional landraces from drier regions are good sources of drought adaptation but often lack high yield under near-optimum growing environments. The objective of this paper was to assess whether crosses between landrace populations and elite germplasm can produce hybrids with better grain yield under favourable conditions than landraces, without compromising grain yield under drought. The research evaluated 20 crosses and their nine parents (consisting of landrace-based populations and elite composites) under drought and non-drought conditions. Drought response index (DRI), based on flowering and grain yield measured in drought and non-drought environments, was used to assess drought tolerance. Landrace populations yielded significantly more grain under drought stress than elite composites and crosses and had the highest mean DRI (3.99). In contrast, composites showed maximum sensitivity to drought with significantly negative DRI (-3.64). Adaptation to either drought or high productivity conditions appeared to be associated with different plant types: higher panicle number, lower grain number per panicle, and smaller seed size were associated with drought adaptation; low tillering and greater number of large-sized seeds per panicle were favoured for optimum growing conditions. Crosses yielded significantly better than composites under drought, better than landrace populations under non-drought and had a wide range in drought sensitivity. Around 40% of crosses produced on average 23% higher grain yield than the best landrace under favourable conditions, without compromising grain yield under drought. The results illustrate that hybridization of landrace populations with elite composites can produce germplasm that combines drought tolerance of traditional material with high production potential of elite genetic material.

AB  - 1. Stewardship of biological and ecological resources requires the ability to make integrative assessments of ecological integrity. One of the emerging methods for making such integrative assessments is multimetric indices (MMIs). These indices synthesize data, often from multiple levels of biological organization, with the goal of deriving a single index that reflects the overall effects of human disturbance. Despite the widespread use of MMIs, there is uncertainty about why this approach can be effective. An understanding of MMIs requires a quantitative theory that illustrates how the properties of candidate metrics relates to MMIs generated from those metrics. 2. We present the initial basis for such a theory by deriving the general mathematical characteristics of MMIs assembled from metrics. We then use the theory to derive quantitative answers to the following questions: Is there an optimal number of metrics to comprise an index? How does covariance among metrics affect the performance of the index derived from those metrics? And what are the criteria to decide whether a given metric will improve the performance of an index? 3. We find that the optimal number of metrics to be included in an index depends on the theoretical distribution of signal of the disturbance gradient contained in each metric. For example, if the rank-ordered parameters of a metric-disturbance regression can be described by a monotonically decreasing function, then an optimum number of metrics exists and can often be derived analytically. We derive the conditions by which adding a given metric can be expected to improve an index. 4. We find that the criterion defining such conditions depends nonlinearly of the signal of the disturbance gradient, the noise (error) of the metric and the correlation of the metric errors. Importantly, we find that correlation among metric errors increases the signal required for the metric to improve the index. 5. The theoretical framework presented in this study provides the basis for understanding the properties of MMIs. It can also be useful throughout the index construction process. Specifically, it can be used to aid understanding of the benefits and limitations of combining metrics into indices; it can inform selection/collection of candidate metrics; and it can be used directly as a decision aid in effective index construction.

AB  - Winter wheat lines were evaluated for their reaction to Fusarium head blight (FHB) after inoculation with Fusarium culmorum in two field experiments. A mixture of two F. culmorum chemotypes was applied (3ADONdeoxynivalenol producing, NIVnivalenol producing). Different types of resistance were evaluated, including head infection, kernel damage, Fusarium biomass content and trichothecenes B (deoxynivalenol (DON), and nivalenol (NIV)) accumulation in grain. The aim of the study was to find relationships between different types of resistance. Head infection (FHB index) and Fusarium damaged kernels (FDK) were visually scored. Fusarium biomass was analysed using real-time PCR. Trichothecenes B accumulation was analysed using gas chromatography. Wheat lines differ in their reaction to inoculation for all parameters describing FHB resistance. We found a wide variability of FHB indexes, FDK, and Fusarium biomass content. Both toxins were present. DON content was about 60% higher than NIV and variability of this proportion between lines was observed. Significant correlation was found between head infection symptoms and FDK. Head infection was correlated with F. culmorum biomass and NIV concentration in grain. No correlation was found between the FHB index and DON concentration. Similarly, FDK was not correlated with DON content, but it was with NIV content; however, the coefficients were higher than for the FHB index. Fusarium biomass amount was positively correlated with both toxins as well as with the FHB index and FDK. Environmental conditions significantly influenced the DON/NIV ratio in grain. In locations where less F. culmorum biomass was detected, the DON amount was higher than NIV, while in locations where more F. culmorum biomass was observed, NIV prevailed over DON.

AB  - Alpine pastures are typical examples of "high nature value farmlands", representing important habitats harbouring unique biological communities. Disturbance induced by overgrazing influences significantly ecosystem processes, in which invertebrates play a major role. To develop new models of sustainable management of pastures, more knowledge is needed of the animal communities, essential to the ecological functioning of pasture ecosystems. The apparent poor ecological state of several pastures in the Natural Regional Park of Alpi Marittime (NW-Italy) lead us to evaluate the influence of grazing history on biodiversity, using spider and harvestmen assemblages as key groups. Four different pastoral types characterized by four different grazing histories were identified using the Daget-Poissonet method. Spiders and harvestmen were collected by means of pitfall traps. Arachnid assemblages were characterized in terms of composition, abundance, species richness, richness of endemic species and taxonomic relatedness. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) were used to test differences among assemblages occurring in each pastoral type. Furthermore, we tested differences in terms of plant communities (species richness and percentage of zoogenic species). Specificity and fidelity of every spider and harvestmen species within pastoral types were explored by the IndVal (Indicator Value) procedure. Fifty-eight species of spiders and seven species of harvestmen were collected (2,304 individuals). Pastoral types related to intensive grazing were characterized by the dominance of diurnal wanderer spiders (namely Lycosidae) while, conversely, nocturnal wanderers (mainly Gnaphosidae) were more abundant in extensive pastoral types. Results show that both species richness and spider abundance were higher in abandoned areas of extensive grazing, while endemic assemblages were richer in extensive grazed areas, which also hosted the most diverse plant community. Furthermore, most of the indicator species of spiders of this type were endemic, characterized by more demanding ecological requirements.

AB  - To investigate the sedimentological characteristics of the Margalla Hill Limestone (MHL), a multi-proxy approach including geochemical, mineralogical, and micropalaeontological investigations were carried out. Using detailed field observations and petrographic investigation of the studied section, five microfacies were dentified. Total organic carbon (TOC) values of the limestone are generally low (0.10-0.96%) and highly degraded, as observed from the low hydrogen index (i.e., 17-349 mg HC/g TOC). TOC is mainly Type-III and Type-IV organic matter that reflects a continental source or highly weathered marine organic matter (OM) with minor Type-II which corresponds to algal or bacterial OM. The values of T-max range from 419 to 512 degrees C for most of the samples, which lies within the mature stage. Major element abundances do not vary significantly in the studied unit and are mainly linked to variations in clay contents. Trace elements (V, Cr, Mn, Zn, Ni, Cu, Th, Rb, U, and Zr) of the MHL depict a mainly detrital origin for shales, and overall decrease in trace element's concentration suggests a change from physical to chemical weathering. The rate of sedimentation as determined by the Th/U ratio indicates a regular to irregular low rate of sedimentation, from base to top of the studied section. The redox conditions, as reflected in the variation of Cr (V/Cr), using the V/Cr ratio with Ni + V indicate that the MHL was deposited under oxic-dysoxic conditions. Chemical Index of Alteration, Chemical Index of Weathering, Plagioclase Index of Alteration, and Weathering Index of Parker showed that the source region was subjected to intense chemical weathering likely under tropical palaeoclimatic conditions with abundant rainfall. The limestone consists mainly of calcite followed by minor quartz and dolomite. Clay mineralogy revealed that the clay fraction is dominated by kaolinite, smectite, mica, and chlorite. The microfossils of various genera of benthic foraminifera have been identified. Based on benthic foraminifera, an Early Eocene (SBZ-8; Middle Ilrdian 2) age has been assigned to the MHL.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   Colon cancer is associated with a higher incidence among residents in high-altitude areas. Hypoxic environment at high altitudes inhibits the phagocytic and oxygen-dependent killing function of phagocytes, thereby increasing the inflammatory factors, inhibiting the body's innate immunity and increasing the risk of colon cancer.
   AIM
   To examine the effect of minimally invasive surgery vs laparotomy in patients with colon cancer residing in high-altitude areas.
   METHODS
   Ninety-two patients with colon cancer in our hospital from January 2019 to February 2021 were selected and divided into the minimally invasive surgery and laparotomy groups using the random number table method, with 46 patients in each group. Minimally invasive surgery was performed in the minimally invasive group and laparotomy in the laparotomy group. Operative conditions, inflammatory index pre- and post-surgery, immune function index and complication probability were measured.
   RESULTS
   Operative duration was significantly longer and intraoperative blood loss and recovery time of gastrointestinal function were significantly less (all P < 0.05) in the minimally invasive group than in the laparotomy group. The number of lymph nodes dissected was not significantly different. Before surgery, there were no significant differences in serum C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-a levels between the groups, whereas after surgery, the levels were significantly higher in the minimally invasive group (26.98 +/- 6.91 mg/L, 146.38 +/- 11.23 ng/mL and 83.51 +/- 8.69 pg/mL vs 41.15 +/- 8.39 mg/L, 186.79 +/- 15.36 ng/mL and 110.65 +/- 12.84 pg/mL, respectively, P < 0.05). Furthermore, before surgery, there were no significant differences in CD3+, CD4+ and CD4+/CD8+ levels between the groups, whereas after surgery, the levels decreased in both groups, being significantly higher in the minimally invasive group (55.61% +/- 4.39%, 35.45% +/- 3.67% and 1.30 +/- 0.35 vs 49.68% +/- 5.33%, 31.21% +/- 3.25% and 1.13 +/- 0.30, respectively, P < 0.05). Complication probability was significantly lower in the minimally invasive group (4.35% vs 17.39%, P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSION
   Laparoscopic minimally invasive procedures reduce surgical trauma and alleviate the inflammatory response and immune dysfunction caused by invasive operation. It also shortens recovery time and reduces complication probability.

AB  - Photosynthetic rates vary depending on growth conditions, even within species. Remote sensing techniques have a great potential to predict the photosynthetic rates of leaves with different characteristics. Here, we demonstrate that the photosynthetic rates of leaves acclimated to different light and nutrient conditions can be estimated based on the chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF), the photochemical reflectance index (PRI), and a chlorophyll index. Chenopodium album plants were grown under different light and nutrient conditions. PRI, ChlF parameters, and CO2/H2O gas exchange rates of leaves were simultaneously determined under the various light and CO2 conditions. PRI was used to assess non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), but the relationship between NPQ and PRI was weakened when the data on leaves grown under different conditions were pooled, because PRI in darkness (PRI0) changed with the leaf pigment composition. Among 15 pigment indices, we found that NDVIgreen, a reflectance index related to the leaf chlorophyll content, had the best correlation with PRI0 (r(2)=0.89) across the studied leaves, and the correction of PRI by NDVIgreen improved the predictability of NPQ (r(2)=0.82). Using the steady-state ChlF, the NPQ estimated from PRI and NDVIgreen, and the stomatal conductance coefficient, we calculated the CO2 assimilation rates, which were strongly correlated with the actual rates (RMSE = 4. 85 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), irrespective of growth conditions. Our approach has the potential to contribute to a more accurate estimation of photosynthetic rates in remote sensing. However, further studies on species variations and connecting with radiative transfer models are needed to demonstrate this at the canopy scale.

Interval-Newton techniques are explored for identifying, with certainty, all equilibrium states and all codimension-one and codimension-two bifurcations of interest within specified model parameter intervals. The methodology is applied to a tritrophic food chain in a chemostat (Canale's model), and a modification of thereof. This modification aids in elucidating the nonlinear effects of introducing a hypothetical contaminant into a food chain. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding effects of flow alteration on stream biota is essential to developing ecologically sustainable water supply strategies. We evaluated effects of altering flows via surface water withdrawals and instream reservoirs on stream fish assemblages, and compared effects with other hypothesized drivers of species richness and assemblage composition. We sampled fishes during three years in 28 streams used for municipal water supply in the Piedmont region of Georgia, U.S.A. Study sites had permitted average withdrawal rates that ranged from < 0.05 to > 13 times the stream's seven-day, ten-year recurrence low flow (7Q10), and were located directly downstream either from a water supply reservoir or from a withdrawal taken from an unimpounded stream. Ordination analysis of catch data showed a shift in assemblage composition at reservoir sites corresponding to dominance by habitat generalist species. Richness of fluvial specialists averaged about 3 fewer species downstream from reservoirs, and also declined as permitted withdrawal rate increased above about 0.5 to one 7Q10-equivalent of water. Reservoir presence and withdrawal rate, along with drainage area, accounted for 70% of the among-site variance in fluvial specialist richness and were better predictor variables than percent of the catchment in urban land use or average streambed sediment size. Increasing withdrawal rate also increased the odds that a site's Index of Biotic Integrity score fell below a regulatory threshold indicating biological impairment. Estimates of reservoir and withdrawal effects on stream biota could be used in predictive landscape models to support adaptive water supply planning intended to meet societal needs while conserving biological resources.

AB  - Catchment-modelling techniques, although not yet widely used in biological contexts, may be a valuable tool in the management and conservation of stream fishes. This study was undertaken to evaluate the potential of a catchment-scale hydrologic model, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), to explain characteristics of stream fish assemblages and to enhance current field-based stream assessments. Stream fish assemblages, instream habitat, geomorphology, and water quality were surveyed in 16 study catchments in Ohio, USA. Subsequently, SWAT was used to model stream discharge, sediment flux and concentration, and nitrogen and phosphorus yields for each catchment. Principal component analysis (PCA) and multiple linear regression were used to explore potential relationships between environmental factors (both reach-level measurements and SWAT-modelled catchment-scale processes) and fish assemblage descriptors assessed within the framework of an Ohio fish-based Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI). Reach-level factors contributed to three of the four significant regression models, explaining 12% to 14% of the variation in fish species richness, the number of darter (Etheostoma) species, and the number of sensitive/intolerant species. SWAT-modelled parameters including minimum and mean annual flow and sediment yields explained significant variation in total IBI scores (57%), species richness (63%), the number of darter species (60%), and the number of sensitive/intolerant species (61%). The results support the utility of SWAT as a complement to field-based surveys. It is proposed that process-based catchment-modelling techniques such as SWAT could improve stream fish management and conservation efforts when used as a screening tool to target streams and catchments for subsequent field surveys and as a method to model potential impacts to stream ecosystems and fish assemblages in highly sensitive areas and/or inaccessible catchments.

AB  - Limited information was focused on perimenopausal syndrome and mood disorders (depression and anxiety) in a specific population: perimenopausal women. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and severity of perimenopausal syndrome and mood disorders, and to analyze their relationships and risk factors in perimenopausal women in Shanghai, China.
   A cross-sectional study was performed on 1062 women aged 40 to 60 years from 3 communities. The general conditions questionnaire, Kupperman index, self-rating depression scale, and self-rating anxiety scale were used. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for perimenopausal syndrome and mood disorders.
   The prevalence of perimenopausal syndrome, depression and anxiety, which were primarily associated with mild symptoms, was 10.92%, 25.99%, and 12.62%, respectively. The differences in the prevalence and severity of perimenopausal syndrome, in the prevalence of depression, and in the severity of anxiety in different age groups were statistically significant (P<0.001, P=0.028, P=0.003, P=0.002, respectively). The relationships between perimenopausal syndrome and mood disorders were strong and positive (P<0.001). It was found that age, employment status, personality characteristics, menstruation, and constipation were risk factors for perimenopausal syndrome, but monthly household income was a protective factor. Also, higher income and better medical insurance were beneficial to depression. However, disharmonious family relationships, irregular menstruation, constipation, and severity of perimenopausal syndrome were harmful to depression. For anxiety, attitudes to children status, cesarean section times, and constipation were risk factors.
   We concluded that perimenopausal syndrome and mood disorders are common in perimenopausal women in Shanghai, whose associations are strong and positive. Many risk factors are associated with and shared between perimenopausal syndrome and mood disorders. Therefore, appropriate management of perimenopause is needed to alleviate the conditions.

AB  - The three main estuaries in the French Atlantic coast - the Seine, Loire and Gironde, all with high tidal regimes - are interfaces between the continental and the coastal ecosystems. The Seine and Gironde are highly contaminated, whereas the Loire remains in a more natural state. Both the Seine and Gironde have suffered from harbour construction, and as a result, their biological units are extremely compartmentalized. Benthic species and communities have adapted to tolerate temporal physical and chemical changes (e.g. salinity, substrata, depth, and levels of fine particles and oxygen) and human activities (e.g. dredging, shipping traffic, and habitat reduction). Although numerous bio-indicators and indices are used to define the ecological quality status (EcoQS) of coastal waters, very few of them were developed specifically for environments with a mosaic of conditions and salinity levels, including freshwater. The main problem appears to be that all the indices for determining anthropogenic stress examine the abundances of stress-tolerant species, which may also be able to tolerate natural stressors such as those occurring in estuaries. This paper takes a look at the development status of the benthic indicators and index approaches used in the three main estuaries along the French Atlantic coast. In addition, it examines the adaptation of the different benthic indicators to the taxonomic sufficiency principle, and the adaptation of the Benthic Opportunistic Polychaetes Amphipods index (BOPA) and the Benthic Opportunistic Annelida Amphipod index (BO2A) for use in the freshwater zones of transitional waters (i.e. up to the upper limit of the tidal range). Several perspectives are discussed in light of the diverse disturbances and the heterogeneity of such stressed zones, such as the use of multimetric and scoring approaches.

AB  - There is widespread application of indicators to the assessment of environmental condition of streams. These indicators are intended for use by managers in making various comparative and absolute assessments and often have a role in resource allocation and performance assessment. Therefore, the problem of formally defining confidence in the results is important but difficult because the sampling strategies used are commonly based on a compromise between the requirements of statistical rigour and the pragmatic issues of access and resources. It is rare to see this compromise explicitly considered and consequently there is seldom quantification of the uncertainty that could affect the confidence a manager has in an indicator.
   In this paper, we present a method for quantitatively assessing the tradeoffs between sampling density and uncertainty in meeting various monitoring objectives. Assessments using judgement-based representative reaches are shown to be unreliable; instead a sampling approach is recommended based on the random selection of measuring sites. A detailed dataset was collected along two streams in Victoria, Australia, and the effect of sampling density was assessed by subsampling from this dataset with precision related to the number of sites assessed per reach length and the intensity of the sampling at each site.
   The sampling scheme to achieve a given precision is shown to depend on the monitoring objective. In particular, three objectives were considered: (1) making a baseline assessment of current condition; (2) change detection; and (3) detection of a critical threshold in condition. Change detection is shown to be more demanding than assessing baseline condition with additional sampling effort required to achieve the same precision. Sampling to detect a critical threshold depends on nominating acceptable values of Type I and 11 error and the size of the effect to be detected. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Sewage effluents are one of the main anthropogenic stressors in Mediterranean rivers. The establishment of a cause-effect relationship is hindered in natural systems by the existence of confounding factors (i.e. biotic interactions). Here we analysed the effects that anthropogenic stressors have on a mono-specific fish community (Iberian redfin barbel population, Barbus haasi) inhabiting the northern edge of its distribution range. In Spring 2004, a total of 40 consecutive sampling sites were surveyed in Vallvidrera creek, and 1,331 specimens were measured and weighed. A principal component analysis was performed to synthesize the information provided by 22 environmental variables. Analysis of variance, bivariate correlation analyses and multiple linear regressions were then used to determine the influence of the environmental gradients built (water quality, hydromorphology, woods and macrophytes, and degree of silting) on fish population features (fish size, body condition status, density and biomass). The findings revealed that water quality was the most significant environmental gradient for this fish population. In particular, fish density decreases and fish length increases in those sites exposed to sewage. Additionally, our results showed the best body condition of those specimens inhabiting fast flow reaches which confirms the rheophilous condition of B. haasi. However, these findings were unnoticed for the current version of the index of biotic integrity using fish as bioindicators in Catalonia. Resource managers need to refine diagnostic tools in order to detect subtle deleterious changes on fish communities before they become evident at population scale. Conservation measures should be focused in these small streams in where the best preserved native fish populations usually inhabit. This study suggests the need to change water management policies in Mediterranean rivers to improve the water quality of sewage effluents and increase the dilution power of these rivers.

AB  - A 3D digitising device was used to acquire architectural information on branches from open-grown and understory saplings of Fagus sylvatica (L.). Branch and shoot images were reconstructed from the data set using an image synthesis software (freeware POV-Ray(R)). Image analysis enabled us to: (i) quantitatively investigate light interception at the shoot and the branch scales; (ii) to derive relevant structural parameters at both scales; (iii) to relate the observed shift with light environment on the independent effects of leaf inclination, within-shoot shading, shoot density and dispersion within the branch. Leaf display pattern, both at the branch and the shoot scale, was strongly affected by light availability. At the shoot level, reduced self-shading in shaded conditions resulted in an increased light capture as high as 32%, expressed on a leaf area basis in the vertical direction. At the branch level, shaded environment caused a substantial increase of 60%. Considering that incident irradiance varies by a factor of 20 between understory and open conditions, plasticity in branch architecture allows to reduce the discrepancy in the amount of intercepted light to a factor 12. This difference in light capture ability at the branch level was shown to result from: (i) more horizontally inclined leaves in shade; (ii) a greater branch leaf area index in sunny conditions (on average 1.60 vs. 0.95 in shaded conditions); (iii) a more regular shoot dispersion in shade (shoot dispersion index averaged 1.30 vs. 1.10 in the open). Finally, results are discussed in terms of optimal architecture for carbon gains, and the interest of the method for parameterisation of radiative transfer models is emphasised.

AB  - This paper presents a survey of French Eastern English Channel fishers' observations of the past and current state of the marine ecosystem and their wishes for the future, as a first step towards formulating management objectives. Twenty-nine semi-directive interviews were carried out in June 2006 among fishers and shellfish farmers. Cognitive maps proved useful to formalise their experience and knowledge. Most interviewees mentioned a decrease of the resource in recent years and pointed out the presence of several problems, such as pollution, degradation of the ocean floor and harmful impacts of human activities, including fishing. The indicators used by the fishers as the basis to form their opinion were similar to those generally used by scientists for assessing the state of exploited marine populations and communities (average fish length, CPUE, fished biomass...); additional indicators were the timing and duration of fishing seasons.

The evaluation of the sustainability of the family production units of pigs in deep beds in the community of Pena Larga presents an average qualitative assessment, with a level of sustainability that is moderately sustainable with a sustainability index of 2.56. The limiting critical indicators of sustainability correspond to the economic and social dimension, with the influence of the attributes of productivity and self-management such as: crop yield, diversification of vegetable production, variation of prices of inputs, present organizations, dependence on external inputs and availability of local market for the sale of piglets, because they were classified as, potentially not sustainable and not sustainable, respectively. A collective proposal of strategic guidelines for community development aimed at improving the level of sustainability of the common critical indicators in the family production units was generated.

AB  - Vineyards are a dominant feature of many landscapes in Mediterranean-climate regions. We examined the effects of streamflow declines, associated with vineyard water-withdrawals for frost protection, on benthic-macroinvertebrate communities at three sites along three small streams in the Mediterranean-climate region of Northern California. One site was heavily affected by water withdrawals for frost protection, the other two were not. In addition, we examined relationships between vineyard coverage and benthic-macroinvertebrate community response using data from 59 sampling events at 39 sites along 35 small streams in Napa County, California. We tested three a priori hypotheses in terms of the response of biological traits of benthic macroinvertebrates to high vineyard coverage: (1) proportion of individuals with semi-voltine (i.e., one generation every 2 years) life cycles would be lower compared to those with uni- and multi-voltine cycles, (2) proportion of individuals able to undergo diapause would be higher, and (3) proportion of individuals with the ability to burrow into the substrate would be higher. In the three-site study, we found that vineyard water-withdrawals for frost protection coincided with consistently lower values in both the benthic-macroinvertebrate index of biotic integrity (B-IBI) developed for Northern California streams and the ratio of Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera to Odonata-Coleoptera-Hemiptera individuals (EPT/OCH), a metric developed for European Mediterranean streams. In the broader-scale study, we observed that vineyard-coverage levels above about 20% coincided with lower values of the B-IBI. The semi-voltine life-cycle trait was lower above this level, whereas the diapause and burrowing traits were not affected.

AB  - To study the effects of foliar application of auxin (indole acetic acid) on the morphophysiological and biochemical characteristics of safflower cultivars under water-deficit stress (WDS) condition at the end of the growing season, an experiment was performed using split-plot factorial in the form of randomized complete block design with three replicates during the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 crop seasons. The main factor of this experiment was water-deficit stress in two levels, i.e., normal irrigation (control) and irrigation cut-off at flowering stage, and two sub-factors include safflower cultivars (Golmehr and Goldasht) and foliar application of auxin in two levels, i.e., no application and applying 4 g.L-1 auxin. Water stress decreased bush heights, grain weight, grain yield, biological yield, harvest index, SPAD index, contents of oil, palmitic acid, linoleic acid, and oleic acid and increased proline content and activities of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase and peroxidase. In comparison with the Golmehr cultivar, the Goldasht cultivar had a higher number of grains (13.27%), grain yield (32.42%), and biological yield (34.29%). Higher bush height (15%), oil percent (9.58%), linoleic acid (30.76%), and oleic acid content (19.59%) were observed in Golmehr cultivar. Under WDS, the activities of antioxidant enzymes and proline in the two cultivars did not change significantly; however, under WDS, meanwhile, Goldasht cultivar showed higher catalase (12%) and peroxidase (13.5%) activities and proline (11.04%). Since using auxin alleviated the side effects of WDS through increasing SPAD index (2.51%), proline content (17.93%), and activities of catalase (30.53%) and peroxidase (14.72%) enzymes, auxin application can be recommended for alleviating the effects of WDS.

AB  - The present study aimed to reveal the impact of the stay-green trait in bread wheat under terminal heat stress. Field experiments (early and late sowing; for two consecutive years) were conducted to investigate the influence of terminal heat stress on the morpho-physiological traits in different stay-green types i.e., non-stay-green, moderately non-stay-green, moderately stay-green, and stay-green. In addition, the greenhouse experiment was performed to dissect the stay-green trait in functional stay-green, non-functional stay-green, and non-stay-green genotypes. The results of the field experiments confirmed that genotypes exhibiting the stay-green trait have a significantly high chlorophyll content, normalized difference vegetative index, grain yield, biological yield, kernel weight, and low canopy temperature under control and heat stress conditions. In the greenhouse experiment, functional stay-green and non-functional stay-green genotypes showed a high chlorophyll content and photochemical efficiency, whereas biological yield and grain yield showed a significant relation with the functional stay-green genotype under control and terminal heat stress treatments. The sequencing and expression analysis of chlorophyllide a oxygenase (CaO), light-harvesting complex (Cab), stay-green (SGR), and red chlorophyll catabolite reductase (RCCR) in functional stay-green, non-functional stay-green, and non-stay-green genotypes revealed variations in the exons of CaO and RCCR; and significant difference in the regulation of CaO and Cab at 7 days after anthesis under terminal heat stress. This study confirms that genotypes displaying the stay-green trait can aid wheat breeders to cope with increasing temperature in the impending decades.

AB  - The Volta Lake was assessed to characterize the general water quality for sustainable and efficient management. Results show that DO levels in the lake may result in hypoxic conditions if, not monitored. Based on the BOD levels, the Volta Lake could be considered as having received no significant to significant pollution discharges. Nutrient results show that the limiting nutrient in the Volta Lake is P-limiting. The weighted solway index (WQI) assessment shows the fairly good quality characteristics of the lake and its ability to support human and animal use although requiring monitoring. The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment Water Quality Index (CCMEWQI) assessment also shows that the overall water quality of the lake was fair and therefore, water quality characteristics may be fluctuating between pristine and impaired levels. Additionally, water quality may usually be suitable for the protection of aquatic life but occasionally threatened with conditions departing from natural or desirable levels and therefore, requiring conventional treatment. Based on the classification of the Water Pollution Index (WPIKR), the chemical health status of the lake was fair and therefore, requiring monitoring for ecosystem sustainability. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) resulted in the extraction of five principal components which accounted for approximately 75.45% of the total variance with eigenvalues > 1. PCA also shows expected process-based and hidden relationships amongst factors that generally govern the water chemistry and the major dissolved ions in the lake. This study highlights a possible early warning of ecological/pollution problems in the lake. It is thus, recommended that the Water Resources Commission (WRC) which is the agency responsible for the management of the Volta Lake in Ghana adopts monitoring measures to prevent imminent pollution of the Volta Lake.

AB  - The use of remote sensing methods for environmental monitoring of the surface water quality is proved. Regression relationships are consistent with ground-based measurements at sampling sites in water bodies and are an effective tool for assessing the ecological status of water bodies. The state of the water bodies of the Mokra Sura river basin varies considerably. The best is the water quality in the upper part of the Mokra Sura river, the worst - in the middle and lower parts. The factors of water pollution are discharges of not enough treated wastewater of industrial enterprises of the Kamyans'koy and Dniprovs'koy industrial agglomeration. The purpose of our search included the following tasks: (a) calculation of integrated environmental water quality indices; b) obtaining satellite information, processing of multispectral satellite images of water bodies using appropriate applied software techniques; c) establishment of statistical dependencies between water quality indexes obtained for biotopically space images and data of actual in situ measurements. The results of systematic hydrochemical control of the Mokra Sura river basin from 2007 to 2011 years were initial data in 4 control areas located in the Dnipropetrovsk region: 1 - the Sursko-Litovske village; 2 - the Bratske village; 3 - the Novomykolayvka village; 4 - the Novooleksandryvka village. Environmental assessment of the water quality of the Mokra Sura river within the Dnipropetrovsk region was based on the calculation the integrated environmental index (IEI). Priority pollutants in this case are oil products and ions SO42- , Mg (2+) , Zn (2+) , Cr (6+) .
   Two images with a difference in three years in April 2015 and May 2017 were used to determine the current changes in the land cover of the study area. Geomorphological assessment of the water network of the Morka Sura river was performed using satellite radar interferometry. Multispectral images of Landsat 5/TM (2007-2011) and Sentinel 2B/MSI (2017) satellite systems were used for remote assessment of water bodies in the study area of the Mokra Sura river basin. The multispectral index TCW (Tasseled Cap Wetness) was used to measure the spectral reflection of the aquatic environment along of the Mokra Sura river flow. The main advantage of the studies is a demonstration of remote sensing capabilities to estimate Mokra Sura river ecological status not only in individual sites, but also throughout the flow - from source to mouth. Follow the necessity to use water from the Mokra Sura river for irrigation, the level of soil water erosion can only increase and enhance the negative processes of eutrophication of reservoirs. Long term technogenic pollution requires information about the state of surface water of fishery, drinking and municipal water use facilities as an integral part of the aquatic ecosystem, the habitat of aquatic organisms and as a resource of drinking water supply. Over 80% of the Mokra Sura river basin surface (IEI 4-12) belong to the classes with the assessment of dirty, very and extremely dirty. The results of studies using remote sensing indicate the need to reduce the streams of not enough treated wastewater to the the Mokra Sura river. The obtained data can be used for ecological assessment of the current and retrospective state of water bodies, development of forecasts of rivers pollution.

AB  - The use of a bird community index that characterizes ecosystem integrity is very attractive to conservation planners and habitat managers, particularly in the absence of any single focal species. In riparian areas of the western USA, several attempts at arriving at a community index signifying a functioning riparian bird community have been made previously, mostly resorting to expert opinions or national conservation rankings for species weights. Because extensive local and regional bird monitoring data were available for Nevada, we were able to develop three different indices that were derived empirically, rather than from expert opinion. We formally examined the use of three species weighting schemes in comparison with simple species richness, using different definitions of riparian species assemblage size, for the purpose of predicting community response to changes in vegetation structure from riparian restoration. For the three indices, species were weighted according to the following criteria: (1) the degree of riparian habitat specialization based on regional data, (2) the relative conservation ranking of landbird species, and (3) the degree to which a species is under-represented compared to the regional species pool for riparian areas. To evaluate the usefulness of these indices for habitat restoration planning and monitoring, we modeled them using habitat variables that are expected to respond to riparian restoration efforts, using data from 64 sampling sites in the Walker River Basin in Nevada and California. We found that none of the species-weighting schemes performed any better as an index for evaluating overall habitat condition than using species richness alone as a community index. Based on our findings, the use of a fairly complete list of 30-35 riparian specialists appears to be the best indicator group for predicting the response of bird communities to the restoration of riparian vegetation.

AB  - Increasing agricultural activities result in increasing use of different pesticides in order to protect the products, but this is happening without paying attention to the consequences of the daily increase of using pesticides. Pesticides could affect human health and the environment at the same time. In this study three pesticides (diazinon, carbaryl and butachlor), which are used in rice production, were measured in the Babol Roud River located in Mazandaran province in Northern Iran. A large portion of the agricultural land use in this region is for rice production. Water samples were collected from 8 sampling points along the river during 4 seasons throughout the year, since planting of rice is conducted twice a year in this region. Mean concentrations for diazinon are 367.7 and 354.5 Agr i in October 2018 and June 2019, respectively. Also, concentrations of carbaryl are 197 and 211.1 mu g L-1 and butachlor arc 299.6 and 413.2 mu g L-1 in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Moreover, hazard quotient (HQ) for non-carcinogenic health risk of these pesticides were calculated based on the United States Environmental Protection Agency reference dose (RID) and the European Union's acceptable daily intake (EU ADI). HQs for adult based on RfD are 4.3, 0.3 and 0.1 and for children are 8.6, 0.08 and 0.03 for diazinon, butachlor and carbaryl, respectively. Also, HQs for adults based on the EU ADI are 15, 0.05 and 0.1 and for children are 30.0.1 and 0.4 for diazinon, butachlor and carbaryl, respectively. The probabilistic ecological risk assessment indicated that diazinon in the river represents a considerable risk to invertebrate and vertebrate communities, carbaryl to invertebrate communities, and butachlor to primary producer communities. The 5th centile of the species sensitivity distributions for each of these communities of biota are exceeded in more than 75% of samples. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Age, growth, sex and gonadal maturation of the shanny, Liphorys pholis, were determined in specimens caught in a rocky intertidal area in northern Portugal in order to provide essential ecological data on the species. This study represents the first available reference in the literature for L.pholis in a southern European location. Totals of 251 individuals (115 females, 99 males, 37 undetermined; total length: 30-172mm) were collected seasonally (November 2013, March, June, and September 2014) in a northern Portuguese rocky beach (Povoa do Varzim: 41 degrees 2347.79N; 08 degrees 4645.48W) using fine-mesh aquarium fishnets during low tides. Marginal increment analysis showed that one translucent and one opaque zone was formed each year in the sagittal otoliths. Ages of L.pholis ranged from 0 to 6years. Males were larger and older than females. The von Bertalanffy growth equation parameters considering all individuals were L=184mm, K=0.26mm/year, t(0)=-1.34. The annual variation of the fish condition and hepatosomatic indexes appeared to be related to the mobilization of the somatic reserves prior to reproduction. Maximum gonadosomatic index for males and females coincided with the breeding seasons (November and March). The sex ratio was close to 1:1, all maturity stages included. Furthermore, some stages of sexual development in males and females were observed during the same season, and several germinal cells were also observed at the same time within a single ovary or testis, indicating that L.pholis is an asynchronous and multiple spawner. Maturation for both sexes appears to be around 70mm TL and prior to reaching 1year of age.

AB  - Intensive land use in the Rolling Pampa of Argentina generates heterogeneous environmental and ecological conditions associated with agronomic practices. The yields of crops with different resource allocation to the production of primary or secondary metabolites could vary with the environment. Crops that mainly produce primary metabolites would have high yields under favorable environments, and crops that produce high quantities of secondary metabolites would have high essential oil yield under unfavorable environments. To test whether this hypothesis is applicable under the Rolling Pampa conditions, field experiments were conducted with the following objectives: (1) to compare biomass and grain yield in three winter crops: wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.) landrace with high essential oil content (HEO) and coriander landrace with low essential oil content (LEO), grown at different levels of N fertilization and weed control; and (2) to determine relative changes in grain yield, essential oil production and harvest index with environment in the coriander landraces. The crops were grown at two locations differing in physical and chemical soil degradation due to the intensity of land use. Wheat allocated resources mainly to the production of primary metabolites, producing higher biomass and grain yield in the favorable environments. The HEO coriander landrace, which allocates resources to the production of both primary and secondary metabolites, produced similar biomass and grain yield in both locations, but resource partitioning to the production of essential oils was high under unfavorable environmental conditions. The LEO coriander landrace which allocates resources mainly to the production of primary metabolites and, in a minor proportion, to secondary metabolites, produced high biomass and grain yield in intermediate environments and high essential oil yield under unfavorable environments. The environmental conditions of the Rolling Pampa that curtailed the allocation of resources to the production of grain yield promoted the production of essential oils. Based on these results, under poor soil environments, one option is to produce crops with essential oils as marketable yields, instead of adding inputs to improve soil condition and produce traditional crops, where yield is very sensitive to environmental variations.

AB  - Regarding various energy and materials flowing in the urban ecosystem and the merit of emergy as an embodied energetic equivalent for integrated ecological economic evaluation, an evaluation framework of emergy-based urban ecosystem health indicators (UEHIem) was established in view of five aspects including vigor, structure, resilience, ecosystem service function maintenance and environmental impact to depict the urban ecosystem health states. Further, set pair analysis (SPA) was employed to assess the urban ecosystem health level based on the UEHIem, by which the approximate degree of real index set to the optimal one was defined and evaluated to describe the relative health state of the concerned urban ecosystems. Choosing twenty typical Chinese cities in 2005 as cases, we evaluated and compared their urban ecosystem health levels based on UEHIem and SPA. The results showed that health levels of Xiamen, Qingdao, Shenzhen and Shanghai are pretty well, while those of Wuhan, Harbin, Yinchuan, Beijing and Urumchi are relatively weak. Moreover, the relative health levels were analyzed by SPA to discern the influences of the mentioned five aspects on the UEHIem. It is concluded that emergy synthesis combined with SPA can serve as an effective relative-measure to compare different ecosystem health levels of urban ecosystems. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Many coastal areas host rich marine ecosystems and are also centers of economic activities, including fishing, shipping and recreation. Due to the socioeconomic and ecological importance of these areas, predicting relevant indicators of the ecosystem state on sub-seasonal to interannual timescales is gaining increasing attention. Depending on the application, forecasts may be sought for variables and indicators spanning physics (e.g., sea level, temperature, currents), chemistry (e.g., nutrients, oxygen, pH), and biology (from viruses to top predators). Many components of the marine ecosystem are known to be influenced by leading modes of climate variability, which provide a physical basis for predictability. However, prediction capabilities remain limited by the lack of a clear understanding of the physical and biological processes involved, as well as by insufficient observations for forecast initialization and verification. The situation is further complicated by the influence of climate change on ocean conditions along coastal areas, including sea level rise, increased stratification, and shoaling of oxygen minimum zones. Observations are thus vital to all aspects of marine forecasting: statistical and/or dynamical model development, forecast initialization, and forecast validation, each of which has different observational requirements, which may be also specific to the study region. Here, we use examples from United States (U.S.) coastal applications to identify and describe the key requirements for an observational network that is needed to facilitate improved process understanding, as well as for sustaining operational ecosystem forecasting. We also describe new holistic observational approaches, e.g., approaches based on acoustics, inspired by Tara Oceans or by landscape ecology, which have the potential to support and expand ecosystem modeling and forecasting activities by bridging global and local observations.

AB  - We describe changes in the habitat associations and geographic distribution of thorny skate during their feeding season in the southern Gulf of St Lawrence, based on 32 yr of monitoring by a bottom-trawl survey. In the 1990s, geographic range contracted sharply and distribution shifted into a narrow band of warm deep waters. These changes appeared to reflect altered habitat selection by individual skates, rather than local depletion of the skates that had habitually occupied the vacated areas or a change in the timing of seasonal migrations. Changes in skate distribution coincided with a decline in skate biomass and a cooling of bottom waters. The contraction in the geographic range of skates appeared to be a density-dependent response, more closely linked to the decline in skate abundance than to the change in environmental conditions. The cause of the shift in habitat associations is less certain. An index of the distribution shift was more strongly correlated with skate biomass than with an index of temperature conditions, and the change in temperature associations is in the direction predicted by density-dependent bioenergetic considerations. However, the shift into deeper waters is into a depth zone where skate condition is relatively low, contrary to the expectation that fish should be concentrated in optimal habitat at low population size. On the other hand, while the shift into warm deep waters coincided with a cooling of waters at intermediate depths, distribution failed to shift back to the earlier pattern as these waters warmed in the late 1990s.

AB  - This paper reviews progress in environmental impact assessment (EIA) over the last 40 years, with particular emphasis on the last 15-20 years, and poses the question: is EIA ready to meet future challenges? The first part of the paper briefly examines the spread of EIA around the world, recent trends in the uptake of EIA, and the continuing emergence of variants of impact assessment. The second part of the paper concentrates on current issues in EIA, under three broad headings: theory and EIA, practice issues and EIA effectiveness. An important thread running through the second part of the paper is how discussions about EIA theory, a feature of the last 15 years, are affecting the different areas of EIA practice and evaluation.

AB  - The successful bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics (Beijing 2022, officially known as the XXIV Olympic Winter Games) has greatly stimulated Chinese enthusiasm towards winter sports participation. Consequently, the Chinese ski industry is rapidly booming due to enormous market demand and government support. However, investing in ski areas in unreasonable locations will cause problems from an economic perspective (in terms of operation and management) as well as geographical concerns (such as environmental degradation). Therefore, evaluating the suitability of a ski area based on scientific metrics has become a prerequisite for the sustainable development of the ski industry. In this study, we evaluate the locational suitability of ski areas in China by integrating their natural and socioeconomic conditions using a linearly weighted method based on geographic information system (GIS) spatial analysis combined with remote sensing, online, and field survey data. The key indexes for evaluating natural suitability include snow cover, air temperature, topographic conditions, water resources, and vegetation, whereas socioeconomic suitability is evaluated based on economic conditions, accessibility of transportation, distance to a tourist attraction, and distance to a city. As such, metrics ranging from 0 to 1 considering both natural and socioeconomic conditions are used to define a suitability threshold for each candidate region for ski area development. A ski area is considered to be a dismal prospect when the locational integrated index is less than 0.5. The results show that 84% of existing ski areas are located in areas with an integrated index greater than 0.5. Finally, corresponding development strategies for decision-makers are proposed based on the multicriteria metrics, which will be extended to incorporate potential influences from future climate change and socioeconomic development. However, the snowmaking model with local data should to be used to further analyze the suitability for a specific ski area.

AB  - The response of dry lands to environmental gradients can be abrupt rather than gradual. These shifts largely occur unannounced and are difficult to reverse once they happen; their prompt detection is of crucial importance. The distribution of vegetation patch sizes may indicate the proximity to these shifts, but the use of this metric is hampered by a lack of large-scale studies relating these distributions to the provision of multiple ecosystem functions (multi-functionality) and comparing them to other ecosystem attributes, such as total plant cover. Here we sampled 115 dry land ecosystems across the globe and related their vegetation attributes (cover and patch size distributions) to multi-functionality. Multi-functionality followed a bimodal distribution across our sites, suggesting alternative states in the functioning of dry lands. Although plant cover was the strongest predictor of multi-functionality when linear analyses were used, only patch size distributions reflected the bimodal distribution of multi-functionality observed. Differences in the coupling between nutrient cycles and in the importance of self-organizing biotic processes characterized the two multi-functionality states observed. Our findings support the use of vegetation patterns as indicators of ecosystem functioning in dry lands and pave the way for developing effective strategies to monitor desertification processes.

AB  - To evaluate impacts of competitive conditions in tree neighborhoods on growth responses as influenced by moisture availability and local environmental conditions, we sampled 102 codominant 40- to 70-year-old coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) in regions with relatively high and low moisture availability. We quantified local environmental conditions (topographic position index, heat load, and soil depth), and the annual basal area increment and climate moisture deficits during two growth periods: a five-year period prior to commercial thinning and years six to 10 after thinning. In both regions and growth periods, tree growth was higher for trees growing in local neighborhoods with lower competition. The density/growth relationships differed by region and by growth period in the moist regions, but they were not influenced by climate moisture deficit. Furthermore, including topographic position index, heat load, or soil depth did not improve model support. Our results highlight the importance of managing local competition and indicate that environmental factors such as soil depth, heat load, and topography may be less likely to warrant consideration when developing thinning prescriptions. This could allow foresters to accommodate other ecosystem services when designing density management treatments, at least within typical growing conditions.
   Study Implications: Concerns about climate change have led to questions whether existing management practices, such as current thinning prescriptions, need to be modified to ensure sustainable provision of ecosystem services. Our results highlight the prominent role of local competitive conditions and indicate that fine-scale differences in topography and soils within our study region are not useful criteria for modifying thinning prescriptions to alter how trees responds to climate conditions, at least under typical growing conditions. Thus, foresters can focus their prescriptions on other aspects when developing thinning or other partial harvesting operations, such as timber production or wildlife habitat.

AB  - The summer school on 'The contribution of environmental indices in meeting the objectives and principles of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive' was organised in Constanta, Romania, during 3th and the 7th of June 2013, within the framework of Work Package 8 (WP8) of the PERSEUS Project (Policy-oriented marine Environmental Research for the Southern European Seas). The main focus was to create training opportunities which would strengthen the existing research and technological development network in the Mediterranean and Black seas in principles such as ecosystem modelling, monitoring and environmental assessment. The school targeted the need that both the EU and non-EU states should adopt a common framework and regional approach with regards to environmental policy development; common monitoring practices and the use of common assessment tools. The main objectives of the PERSEUS Summer School on the contribution of environmental indices in meeting the objectives and principles of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) were the: (i) to expose participants to aspects of the theoretical and practical background on the assessment of the benthic ecological status using the index M-AMBI (multivariate AMBI - AZTI Marine Biotic Index) and Marine Strategy Framework Directive assessment issues; (ii) to provide participants with the most important concepts related to the fishery related indices; (iii) to get participants acquainted with the main applications of ocean color based index/eutrophication-related core set indicators CSI023 (chlorophyll-a); (iv) to present theoretical and practical aspects of characterisation of the ecological state of marine and coastal waters using Trophic index (TRIX); (v) to establish links between different researchers involved in the field of environmental indicators related with the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. 20 students from various Black sea and Mediterranean countries and with different backgrounds completed the school successfully, blending a thorough lecture programme with social interaction and exchange of ideas.

AB  - In the setting of profound ocular blindness, numerous lines of evidence demonstrate the existence of dramatic anatomical and functional changes within the brain. However, previous studies based on a variety of distinct measures have often provided inconsistent findings. To help reconcile this issue, we used a multimodal magnetic resonance (MR)-based imaging approach to provide complementary structural and functional information regarding this neuroplastic reorganization. This included gray matter structural morphometry, high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) of white matter connectivity and integrity, and resting state functional connectivity MRI (rsfcMRI) analysis. When comparing the brains of early blind individuals to sighted controls, we found evidence of co-occurring decreases in cortical volume and cortical thickness within visual processing areas of the occipital and temporal cortices respectively. Increases in cortical volume in the early blind were evident within regions of parietal cortex. Investigating white matter connections using HARDI revealed patterns of increased and decreased connectivity when comparing both groups. In the blind, increased white matter connectivity (indexed by increased fiber number) was predominantly left-lateralized, including between frontal and temporal areas implicated with language processing. Decreases in structural connectivity were evident involving frontal and somatosensory regions as well as between occipital and cingulate cortices. Differences in white matter integrity (as indexed by quantitative anisotropy, or QA) were also in general agreement with observed pattern changes in the number of white matter fibers. Analysis of resting state sequences showed evidence of both increased and decreased functional connectivity in the blind compared to sighted controls. Specifically, increased connectivity was evident between temporal and inferior frontal areas. Decreases in functional connectivity were observed between occipital and frontal and somatosensory-motor areas and between temporal (mainly fusiform and parahippocampus) and parietal, frontal, and other temporal areas. Correlations in white matter connectivity and functional connectivity observed between early blind and sighted controls showed an overall high degree of association. However, comparing the relative changes in white matter and functional connectivity between early blind and sighted controls did not show a significant correlation. In summary, these findings provide complimentary evidence, as well as highlight potential contradictions, regarding the nature of regional and large scale neuroplastic reorganization resulting from early onset blindness.

AB  - Under the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Ministry of the Environment of Japan (MOE) added Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) to the test guideline fish short-term reproduction assay (FSTRA) developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) using fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). The FSTRA was designed to detect endocrine disrupting effects of chemicals interacting with the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG axis) such as agonists or antagonists on the estrogen receptor (Esr) and/or the androgen receptor (AR) and steroidogenesis inhibitors. We conducted the FSTRA with Japanese medaka, in accordance with OECD test guideline number 229 (TG229), for 16 chemicals including four Esr agonists, two Esr antagonists, three AR agonists, two AR antagonists, two steroidogenesis inhibitors, two progesterone receptor agonists, and a negative substance, and evaluated the usability and the validity of the FSTRA (TG229) protocol. In addition, in vitro reporter gene assays (RGAs) using Esr1 and AR beta of Japanese medaka were performed for the 16 chemicals, to support the interpretation of the in vivo effects observed in the FSTRA. In the present study, all the test chemicals, except an antiandrogenic chemical and a weak Esr agonist, significantly reduced the reproductive status of the test fish, that is, fecundity or fertility, at concentrations where no overt toxicity was observed. Moreover, vitellogenin (VTG) induction in males and formation of secondary sex characteristics (SSC), papillary processes on the anal fin, in females was sensitive endpoints to Esr and AR agonistic effects, respectively, and might be indicators of the effect concentrations in long-term exposure. Overall, it is suggested that the in vivo FSTRA supported by in vitro RGA data can adequately detect effects on the test fish, O. latipes, and probably identify the mode of action (MOA) of the chemicals tested.

AB  - Shutting down dumpsites, implanting and operating landfills are important steps to consolidate an efficient and sustainable urban solid waste management system. In the state of Rio de Janeiro, since 2007, there have been significant advances in this process. However, it is fundamental to transcend the terminology that distinguishes the final disposal sites and to evaluate the real quality of the provision of this public service. There is no doubt that shutting down dumpsites should be a priority for states and municipalities, however, this thought should not distance oneself from the constant evaluation of the environmental performance of these activities and, consequently, the operational quality of the landfills. Based on this principle, the state of Rio de Janeiro, through the State Environmental Institute (INEA), developed in 2013 a methodology for obtaining the Final Destination of Waste Quality Index. The main objective of this article is to evaluate the results of the application of Rio de Janeiro's Final Destination of Waste Quality Index, in the years of 2013, 2014, and 2015. This analysis made it possible to criticize the strategies proposed by the public policies for waste management in the state, as well as their effectiveness. It was verified that the landfills of Seropedica, Campos, and sao Goncalo presented the best performances and were considered adequate. Together, these landfills received more than ten million tons in the period, about 58% of the urban solid waste collected in the state. The Miguel Pereira, Barra do Pirai, and Pirai landfills presented the worst performance, considered inadequate, receiving about 47,000 tons in the period, less than 1% of the MSW collected in the state.

AB  - A reanalysis is reported of the wave time series recorded during Hurricane Camille having as objective the identification of individual waves that satisfy current criteria defining abnormal or freak waves. It is shown that during the hurricane development, a very nonstationary situation has occurred during which the second-order sea state parameters changed significantly with time. The parameters of the largest individual waves in sea states which identify abnormal waves did not show any clear trend, and such waves occurred during the development stage and not when the significant wave height was the largest. It is argued that the present criteria of identification of abnormal waves are not satisfactory, as they do not take into account the nature of the sea states in which the waves occur.

AB  - The results of multi-element analysis of plants of the forest ecosystem in Eastern Europe (Central Forest State Biospheric Reserve) are presented and the composition of similar species from Western and Northern Europe is compared. The scales of species and anthropogenic variability of the absolute content for more than 50 chemical elements in the plant samples are considered. It was shown for the forest ecosystems of Europe that Polytrichum commune, Sphagnum sp. and Hypogymnia physodes are good biological indicators for active migration of Mn, Ni, Sn, Th, Cr, Mo, and S in the ecosystems. Their accumulation and removal are determined by the habitat conditions. The chemical composition of higher plants, except bryophytes, reflects to a certain extent the general requirements of the plants in elements of mineral feeding but weakly defines the state of the environment. However, S, Cu, Sm, Sr, Tm, and V can be used for monitoring in the boreal forests of the European part of Russia. The results of multi-element analysis of the forest plants suggest that the studied ecosystem of the Central Forest Reserve can be considered as medium-contaminated.

AB  - External nutrient loading was reduced over the past decades as a measure for improving the water quality of eutrophic lakes in western Europe, and has since been accelerated by the adoption of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) in 2000 (EC, 2000). A variety of eutrophication-related metrics have indicated that the response of biological communities to this decreased nutrient loading has been diverse. Phytoplankton, a major component of the pelagic community, often responded rapidly, whereas a significant delay was observed for submerged macrophytes colonizing littoral areas. In this study we tested whether assessment methods developed for phytoplankton and macrophytes in lakes during Germany's implementation of the WFD reflect this differential response. An assessment of 263 German lakes confirmed that a lower ecological state was recorded when based on the biological quality element (BQE) for macrophytes than the BQE for phytoplankton during the investigated period (2003-2012). On average, lakes had a moderate ecological status for both phytoplankton and macrophyte BQEs, but differences of up to three classes were observed in single cases. Long-term data were available for five lowland lakes subject to strong reductions in phosphorus loading. Their phytoplankton-based assessments indicated a constant improvement of the ecological status in parallel to decreasing water phosphorus concentrations. In contrast, macrophyte-based assessments indicated a 10-20 year delay in their ecological recovery following nutrient load reduction. This delay was confirmed by detailed data on the temporal development of macrophyte species diversity and maximum colonization depths of two lakes after nutrient load reduction. We conclude that the available WFD assessment methods for phytoplankton and macrophyte BQEs are suitable to track the differential response of pelagic and littoral areas to nutrient load reductions in German lakes.

AB  - One important component of ecological integrity in plant communities is the degree of invasion. Assessment of invasion commonly involves counting non-native species. Alternatively, invasion can be defined as a process where one, or a few species (native or non-native), displaces many resident species. Invasion, defined in terms of displacement, has been documented in the field, but indices indicating this process are not well developed. In this paper, I present an Index of Invasion (II) that includes three metrics: current invasion, potential invasion, and sources of invaders. Two of these metrics were derived from measured importance of plants in the field. The third metric was derived from the number of landscape elements facilitating entry of new invaders. Values of the II were compared to other indices of integrity [the Floristic Quality Assessment Index (FQAI) and the Minnesota Index of Vegetative Integrity (IVI)] using data collected from riparian forests located inside and outside Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area (LBLNRA) in western Kentucky. A previous paper using standard methods of community analysis concluded that sites outside LBLNRA were of lower conservation value (i.e., less diverse and more invaded) than sites inside LBLNRA. These results were supported by the FQAI and IVI. The II also suggested lower integrity of sites outside LBLNRA (i.e., higher invasion scores), but the effect of site location was not significant, indicating that invasion of these sites was not the sole explanation for differences in community composition. The II did, however, successfully identify three sites, two outside LBLNRA and one inside, where species previously ranked as severe threats were important components of the vegetation. The II presented here, or modified versions of this index, may be useful for allocating management efforts or for understanding the variation of invasion across sites with similar vegetation.

AB  - Classical life-history theory predicts 'trade-offs' between reproductive and somatic investments. However, empirical studies have shown that intraspecific phenotypic correlations between these two resource investments are often positive or nonsignificant, rather than negative as predicted. The model of Van Noordwijk and De Jong (1986) was proposed to explain these unexpected results. According to their model, positive correlations between reproductive and somatic investments will result if individual variation in resource acquisition exceeds that of resource allocation, whereas negative correlations will result if individual variation in resource allocation exceeds that of resource acquisition. To test this model, I used body storage/condition as an index of somatic investment because it is usually strongly related to level of resource acquisition. I predicted that laboratory studies should more often show negative correlations between reproductive and somatic investments than field studies, because individual variation in resource acquisition is expected to be lower in controlled laboratory environments than in variable natural environments. A literature review revealed that correlations between somatic (storage) investment and reproductive investment (estimated as clutch/litter mass, number of offspring per clutch/litter, or number of clutches/litters) among conspecific breeding female animals are more often positive (15 species) or nonsignificant (17 species) than negative (6 species). Moreover, as expected, five of six negative correlations were observed in laboratory studies, whereas 13 of 15 positive correlations were observed in field studies. It is concluded that future empirical and theoretical work on life histories should consider individual variation in both resource acquisition and allocation and the interaction between the two.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the level of contamination and genotoxic impact through micronucleus assay and histopathology in Wallago attu and Cirrhinus mrigala procured from the polluted site of the River Chenab at industrial and sewage waste disposal. The water sample was found viciously contaminated with heavy metals i.e. Ni, Cr, Mn, Co, Pb, Hg, Zn, Sn, Cu while all other physio-chemical variables crossed the suggested limits of WHO. The heavy metals load induced histopathological alterations were correlated to environmental degradation and the productivity of this biological system. W. attu and C. mrigala harvested from contaminated sites of the river indicated higher intensity of DNA damage through micronucleus induction and nuclear abnormalities with 5.46 +/- 0.17, 1.23 +/- 0.08 and 4.2 +/- 0.11, 0.4 +/- 0.04%, respectively. Muscle sections of W. attu and C. mrigala harvested from the polluted section of river demonstrated the necrosis, degeneration of muscle fibers, intra-fibular edema and release of the blood into the tissues due to the bursting of blocked of the blood vessels. Dermal layers showed degeneration of the collagen bundles those were found loose or collapsed in some regions. Photomicrography also revealed vacuolar degeneration in muscle tissues and atrophy of muscle bundles. Intra fibular edema and splitting of muscle fibers were also seen along with bioaccumulation of toxicants. W. attu showed maximum incidence of alterations with highest histopathological alteration index related to environmental degradation. Control fish samples showed normal muscle tissues with normal equally spaced muscle bundles and myotomes. (C) 2019 Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.
